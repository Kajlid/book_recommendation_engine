Can you keep a secret with death lurking ever closer? Not only does Marilana make her choices with confidence, but she is still in her youth, not yet considered an adult. A young lioness, fiercely devoted to her path as a bandit hunter, a student, a servant, and a healer, Marilana lives a lonely life. With few friends and a desolate future, she is suspicious of the new lion in her class. When Marquiese forces his way into Marilana's path, lives change. Marquiese is living a lie. His life depends on his secret remaining hidden. When he lets his curiosity drive him close to Marilana, he risks everything. Is trusting her the biggest mistake of his life . . . or the only way he can survive? Come, enter Mystillion and the Kingdom of Redsands and let the journey of Marilana and Marquiese lead you to fantastic places. You may even learn a little about yourself along the way.",
