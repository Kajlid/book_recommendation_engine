  "description": "At the start of the new millennium, Aftab's life came undone. He turned forty, and his wife of fourteen years left him for another man, taking their only child with her. As he looks back on his imperfect past, crowded with personal and professional compromises, only a slim hope saves him for perhaps this flight will give him a second chance to reclaim a long-lost love that could have been his, had he the courage of his convictions. And then he can start afresh. With uncommon sensitivity and a rare understanding of human emotions, Navtej Sarna has produced a poignant account of a life that missed opportunities and approximate loves.",
