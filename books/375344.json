  "description": "In his outstanding autobiography, Konstantin Stanislavsky reveals his own ideas and experience. \"The theatre is the finest medium of intercourse between nations. It reveals their most cherished aspirations. If only these aspirations were revealed more often ... the nations would shake hands, and lift their caps, instead of training guns on each other.\" -- Konstantin Stanislavsky \"This wise and delightful book...is packed with sage practical counsel to actors and actresses.\" -- The Times Literary Supplement \"A great figure upon the world scene, one of the greatest men of the theatre that ever lived.\" -- New York Herald-Tribune \"It was a source of great enlightenment to me.\" --Sir Laurence Olivier",
