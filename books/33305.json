  "description": "WHEN EVERY FRIENDLY FACE COULD MASK A KILLER...\"Sweet Baby Jane\" Perkins has carved out a mega-selling reputation as rock's favorite bad girl. But her hard-living, tough-talking image can't prevent the sharp dose of reality that hit home when her estranged mother is killed in a car accident. As bizarre coincidences escalate in her own life, Janey grows certain that someone is watching her every move, and it's not one of her adoring fans...THE ONLY PERSON SHE CAN TRUST...Since leaving the Army Rangers six months ago, Jason Wilson has been adrift, a warrior without a war. Now he's taken his first civilian assignment for his army buddy's security firm: protecting a rock diva on her sold-out tour. Far from being a spoiled star, Janey is a revelation-sweet, modest, and incredibly sexy. Their friendship is turning to mutual, heated desire, but it's a distraction that could cost them more than their hearts...MAY BE A PERFECT STRANGER...Drawn into the depths of a deadly secret, they'll face off against a killer growing more ruthless every day, and Jason will discover just how far he'll go to protect an explosive passion he never expected...",
