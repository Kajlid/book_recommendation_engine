Opportunity strikes at a house party when the most unlikely person offers the perfect solution.Camden Vale is no gentleman, and heâ€™s not prone to saving anyone, but something about Prue changes all that. When his offer to befriend her extends beyond the house party, and his feelings extend beyond expectation, no one is more surprised than he. Except, perhaps, for the other Spinsters, and they have much to say on the subject.",
