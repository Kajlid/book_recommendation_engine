  "description": "Book 7: An empty bed, a threatening note, and a solemn delegation from Faerie can only mean one thing: Garrett's been kidnapped and Charlie's in danger. In order to keep her son safe and rescue her mate, Jackie is forced to make some unpopular decisions, pitting her against long time allies whose cooperation she desperately needs.  Meanwhile, the people she cares about are fighting their own battles. Garrett is getting a close-up view of just how Queen Fionna is running things at the Faerie Court, and it's not a pretty sight. Sixteen year old Charlie is steamed about being sent away and not included in the rescue efforts, but Isaiah's determined to keep him in line and working hard. Of course, Charlie has some plans of his own.  And with the help of his sister, Queen Fionna, Lord Kennet is working on a scheme that just might bring his family back together, whether they want it or not.",
