When she wakes in an office after the company Christmas party, Shelby Corbin accidentally trips over the Christmas corpse… who also turns out to be the co-owner of Westbrook Department Store and Shelby’s boss.

What he does know is that he saw a dark-haired woman in a crimson dress running from the scene. With his own sister one of the prime suspects, Rand begins his own investigation. And he’s starting with a suspect of his own…Shelby is pretty sure Rand knows something. On the other hand, it’s really hard to say no to a sexy, successful, and gorgeous man… even he if he does suspect she’s a murderer. One thing is certain –she’d better watch her step, or this Christmas could be the death of her!",
