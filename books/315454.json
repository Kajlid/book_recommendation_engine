  "description": "A rookie cop. A team of supernatural detectives. A shifter with some impulse control issues.My name is Cat McKenzie, and I thought wood sprites weren’t a thing.Apparently, they are. Fun fact: they enjoy eating carrion which was how I discovered the body of a hunter in the woods. The local werewolf pack confirms it’s a bad wolf doing the biting. Add two more to the body count and we have a furry serial killer on our hands.Life can’t be as easy as that though. From new recruits at PIG to questions about mine and my sexy-as-sin partner’s connection, I’m left trying with more questions than answers.Murderous will-o’-the-wisps, dryads and a thieving harpy… could life get any crazier?",
