  "description": "After Darren begs Jeannie to try to fit in more with the locals, she's thrilled when a flyer comes though the door. She can make new friends, keep fit, and learn all about healthy meals at the same time! But when Dua Twist is found dead in the aerobics room, Jeannie realizes that not everyone is as friendly as they should be. The question is, can Jeannie figure out what Dua Twist did to make someone hate her so much? If she can figure it out, she might fit in better herself and catch a murderer. She's sure she can do it, after all, she's solved one case already! Besides, Amelia does it all the time in Ragamuffin and Mrs. Queen and Jeannie has never missed an episode.",
