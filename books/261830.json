This is a land filled with strange people, magic and more danger than Fable has ever dreamed of.She must battle for not only a way home, but for the lives of those she loves dearest. With the help of her peculiar new friends, Fable must learn to trust in herself or risk losing her cousin forever. Can she save him before it’s too late?",
