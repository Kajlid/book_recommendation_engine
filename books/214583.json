She doesn't just make other people uncomfortable—she terrifies them, and she has no idea why. All she knows is she has to keep to herself, even when impossible things start to happen. Then she meets Mikhél, a rebel from the planet Spyridon, and she learns that there’s nothing wrong with her at all. She’s just not human.

Spyridon is controlled by a vicious warlord, and Mikhél wants Jane to join the fight for freedom. As she secretly trains for battle on a ship filled with enemy spies and slaves who would turn her in to save themselves, she can’t help but wonder—can she really fight for a world that wants her dead? She’d better decide quickly, because the enemy won’t wait until she reaches Spyridon to strike. Mystery, romance, and suspense mingle in the debut novel from Lillian James.
