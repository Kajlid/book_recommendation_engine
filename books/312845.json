  "description": "This is the story of Nobel-winning genomicist Dr. Frieda Sengmeuller, who invents \"age-decoding\" – a genetic engineering method that stops human aging. When age-decoding is rolled out in the year 2053, corrupt Authority leaders secretly use CRISPR technology to remove peoples' \"propensity to dissent\". They fake Frieda's suicide, containing and tormenting her for two centuries as she is forced to research \"reverse-aging\". Frieda's daughter Ximena teams up with Authority insider Tavon Brooks to try to rescue her and preserve humanity. This book depicts the scientific and moral challenges our world may face with the expanded use of genetic engineering.",
