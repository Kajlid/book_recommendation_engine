  "title": "Perfect Proposal",
  "description": "Even before I started working as an entertainment lawyer for Wildcard Records, I knew my life was about to change. That is, until I met David Lennan. I began suppressing the overwhelming feelings developing inside me every time I saw him. Feelings I couldn’t explore so long as I walked the fine line remaining his boss. My life was perfect – a perfect nightmare. I took a leap of faith in myself and left — striking out on my own. It could be the best or worst idea of my life. But I was finally in control. And when David followed me, I put my proposal on the table. I was still in charge of the show. At least until the first time he kissed me good night.",
