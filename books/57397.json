  "description": "\"Their true colors are hidden until one woman turns everything upside down. \"\"Speed, Book 2\"Seth Pace, guitarist of the rock band \"Speed,\" is a born dreamer, and nothing stands in his way of making those dreams a reality. Except when it comes to band manager Luke Struthers. He s everything Seth wants in a partner, but even after five years of perfectly explosive sex, Luke refuses to commit.After a childhood ravaged by abuse, Luke knows he s a potential danger to anyone foolish enough to love him. Seth is safer without him, but Luke has no idea how to cut him loose painlessly. Until he spots Seth s kind of woman pretty, smart, friendly. The plan: seduce her into a sexy threesome, then leave the two alone to fall in love. Problem solved.A night of excitement with the two hottest men on the planet? Yeah, baby! Yet Kaz s inborn ability to read auras tells her something isn t right. It s obvious Seth and Luke are madly in love, but subtle clues in Luke s aura signal he s up to something. She s not sure what, but if she doesn t do something quick, the two men she s quickly come to adore will wind up without the happily ever after they both deserve.Warning: One man + one man + one woman = a whole lot of steamy two-way and three-way M/M & M/M/F sex, a hero or two to drool over, and a heroine who recognizes true love when she sees it. \"",
