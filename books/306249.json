  "description": "She’s got an independent streak a mile wide. But Chance has a long, long rope. After a nasty divorce, Lacey Winslow has worked hard to rebuild her life, and guards it with fierce determination. She’s had it up to here with her lurking ex and with macho men in general, including one Chance Bodine. He seems hell-bent on breaching her defenses and claiming her for his own. Just when she thinks she’s got her life back on track, an attempted robbery brings the police—and Chance—running. Even more annoying, Chance decides she needs protection. His protection. Chance is in love with Lacey, and he doesn’t care who knows it. Problem is, the last thing Lacy wants is for another man to stake a claim on her hard-won independence. Nevertheless, Chance vows to protect Lacey at all costs—even if he has to protect her from herself to do it. This title has been previously published. Warning, this title contains the explicit sex, graphic language, spanking.",
