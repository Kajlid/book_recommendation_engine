  "description": "Originally written for the BBC's Listen With Mother radio programme, these stories were based on Dorothy's recollections of her own childhood with her naughty little sister. For fifty years, stories about the funny, loveable, mischievous little girl have enchanted children all over the world, perfectly complemented by Shirley Hughes' warm and nostalgic illustrations. These stories are perfect for bedtime reading, or as read-alone books for slightly older children. First experiences, significant events and childhood emotions are dealt with brilliantly and with a tremendous sense of fun.",
