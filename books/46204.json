  "description": "This is a study of the American book series, The Modern Library of the World's Best Books. In October 1930, Macy's department store in New York City used the inexpensive book series as a loss-leader to draw customers into the store. Selling for only nine cents a copy, the small-format, modern classics attracted crowds of buyers. Businessmen, housewives, students, bohemian intellectuals and others waited in long lines to purchase affordable hardback copies of works by the likes of Tolstoy, Wilde, Joyce and Woolf. As the author of this book points out, it was a significant moment in American cultural history, demonstrating that a series of books respected and praised by the nation's self-appointed arbiters of taste could attract a throng of middle-class consumers without damaging its reputation as a vehicle of serious culture.",
