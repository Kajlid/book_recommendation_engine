Renia, a scribe with a tragic past, spends her days expertly copying books that do little to satiate her desire for knowledge.When a fateful commission lands on her desk, she finds herself tasked with transcribing a book coveted by assassins from the southern continent. Its theft throws the scribing halls into chaos and threatens to destroy the fragile peace that exists between their nations.Haunted by dreams of her past, Renia must learn to master her impulses and awaken her long dormant magical abilities if she is to prevent war.Fate, it would seem, is eager to grant her wishes.
