  "title": "Comes a Painted Horse: An American Story of Faith",
  "description": "\"Comes a Painted Horse\" tells the tale of Christian faith in 19th century America. It opens with the story of John Long Waters, son of a Cherokee chief, who is forced along the Trail of Tears with his people. After nearly losing his own life, John discovers his Christian faith through his rescuer. John's faith and devotion to God are passed down to his son, Micah Red Horse, who faces trials of his own. A grown man, Micah and his family find food, shelter, and friendship with the Heideggers, a family of German immigrants. Though from different backgrounds, a bond of Christian faith forms between the families. However, when tragedy strikes the Heidegger family, Micah finds himself torn between his desire to seek vengeance and a faith that prohibits revenge. In G.M. Eichin's debut novel, Christians will be reminded to keep their faith, even when things seem most unclear, because God always has a plan.",
