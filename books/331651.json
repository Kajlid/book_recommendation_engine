  "description": "Megan wants to be Alpha. She's strong, she knows she can lead her pack and her wolf is ready. First, she has to overcome a series of challenges to show the rest of the pack that she's worthy. But the biggest challenge might be her feelings for the current Alpha - and his second.Orion and Elvin split up years ago because they wanted to father children and thought it would be too complicated trying to find a woman who would suit them both. Instead they became an Alpha and his second first, and the closest of friends second. But when Megan disrupts their carefully constructed order, it might be a chance to forge something new.This is a standalone novella-length (around 20 000 words) story suitable for ages 18 and up told entirely from Megan's point of view and ends on a HEA. Content warning: this is a Spicy book with a capital S and includes graphic sex (MF, MFM, hints towards MM), anal, some violence, no bullying.",
