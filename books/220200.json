  "description": "When single mother of twins Diedra meets and falls in love with James, she assumes that “as long as you both shall live” will be the start of peace, contentment, and blissful motherhood.Diedra has a full life that often intersects with the lives of three other Breanna, the free and flirtatious spirit; Cassandra, Diedra’s childhood friend; and Sharnell, the overachiever. And when Diedra’s brood grows to seven after the birth of triplets, she thinks that surely her saga is fully written.But when unexpected obstacles suddenly pile on with no end in sight, Diedra must struggle to save her marriage, brave a frightening diagnosis, and untangle mysteriously lucid dreams whose meaning remains just out of reach—but which are increasingly worrisome in their urgency.On top of it all—she’s pregnant again.More than a Christian romance, Dreams of Tamar weaves together relevant scripture and riveting storytelling and will resonate with believers of today who have real problems that require real solutions. Dive in to a story of a love that binds people together with unbreakable chains as they work out their salvation and journey toward restoration.",
