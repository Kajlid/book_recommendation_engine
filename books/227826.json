  "description": "A princess on-the-run finds sanctuary where she least expects it... After nearly dying in an assassination attempt, Princess Alessandra of Glorvaird escapes to a place no one would ever think to look for her: small town Oklahoma and a ranch staffed by a herd of wooly, uncouth cowboys. One cowboy in particular gets under her skin, until she sees his softer side. She knows this interlude can't last forever, but that doesn't stop her from wishing it might... Former Navy SEAL Gideon Hale might've rescued the princess from freezing to death, but the soldier doesn't trust easily-or at all-especially when his gut tells him Alessandra is keeping secrets. But as Alessandra begins to fit into his life, he discovers another side to the princess-one that he can't help but like. When Alessandra's enemies close in, Gideon must fight to save the woman who has become so much more than a princess... \"Once Upon a Cowboy\" is a contemporary western retelling of the Snow White fairytale and Book 1 in the Cowboy Fairytales series. Other books include: Cowboy Charming The Toad Prince",
