  "title": "Assailant’s Greed: The Triad’s Tale",
  "description": "A game mechanic corrupted. A plan infinitely complex. A triad of assailant's split apart. Industry giant Tornado Tech has done it again with their hit game Assailant's Greed and a triad of hopeful assailants is eager to earn virtual riches with their overly complex scheme that is sure to please the game's complexity system. But even the best laid plans can fall apart and Assailant's Greed reveals that it might just have a plan of its own to be the best laid. When the triad gets split wide open they must weave through even more complex plot just to survive. As the plan to remove the mark becomes more and more convoluted an important question remains unanswered. How could a game even have a plan that involves sexing up players? More importantly to the triad is their own personal question, “What do you mean we have to share the spotlight?” Warning: Contains m/m situations, futanari situations, and shifter monster banging. While part of a series, this novelette can be read as a stand alone story!",
