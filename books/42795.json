  "description": "Ceridwyn Brent had a fairly easy life, kept safe from the supernatural dangers of the world around her by the enchantments her parents placed on her when she was a baby. Then her parents died in a car accident leaving their daughter a well-protected nervous wreck, afraid of travel and especially cars, and unwilling to leave the house. Then she met Lily Carpenter, a half-succubus trying to get her life back on track and they helped each other back to something like a normal life. As normal as it gets when your house looks like the Munsters were the chief designers and your housekeeper is an enigmatic fairy.It was Lily who persuaded Ceri to apply for the job as research assistant to Doctor Cheryl Tennant, lead researcher in quantum thaumatology at the London Metropolitan University. Doctor Tennant is locked in a battle with a better funded team at Cambridge to discover the fundamental particle of magic, the Null Thaumiton. Everyone knows the race has been heating up with both sides close to a result, but there was no way Ceri could have expected sabotage and murder to be involved in an academic contest.Soon Ceri and Lily are in the middle of an academic war, surrounded by wizards, werewolves, and demons, and in the meantime thereâ€™s still that elusive particle to uncover.",
