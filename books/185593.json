  "description": "First in a new Sword and Sorcery trilogy, 'Trail of the Necromancer' provides the back-story for the characters of Hemlock and Melganaderna, first introduced in 'Nysta #4: Blade of the Vampire King'.  Bound by their love, they would fight for each other. Die for each other. Murder. And a whole lot worse...  --- The scouts were quick, and there were four of them. Dressed in greys and greens which blended into the forest, they dashed from the trees. Bright blades in their hands. The rain had begun falling hard again after a few days of soft drizzle. Desperate sheets beating at the ground. The horses snorted, breath steaming. The four men made no sound, their light boots rushing through the mud as though skipping across it. Hemlock looked up, eyes widening. Saw the first shape dive from a tree branch. It landed with a grunt and rolled forward, slashing at Melganaderna's horse. Which she jerked around even as she threw herself free of her saddle. Torment howled in her hands. Their captain shouted into the wind. “Protect the princess! If you can't take the Kingkiller alive, kill him!” Hemlock's mouth opened. “Kingkiller?”  --- When the Dark Lord falls and Rule holds the world in his fist, the shadows will rise…  The King is dead. Murdered in cold blood. The Lord of Light himself rages at the crime.  Believing Hemlock has enchanted the King’s daughter, armies have gathered. Roused to violence, they follow the fledgling necromancer and the woman who loves him. A woman who carries the fabled axe, Torment. They came at first for justice. Then for revenge. Finally, for dominion.  For the Wall of the North is too big a prize to ignore.  But they should have let him go. Should have never followed him toward the Deadlands. Because his coming was foretold since the Night Age. And, with the grimoire of Lornx in his hands, he will bring necromancy back to the world. The dead will heed his call. The Shadowed Gates will open and spill their secrets to him alone, promising magic to rival even the last of the gods.  All he has to do, is take it.",
