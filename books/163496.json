  "description": "On August 19, 1843, horror master Edgar Allan Poe released one of his darkest short stories, The Black Cat, his exploration of the psychology of guilt. Now, over a hundred and fifty years later, the tale of an unreliable narrator is continued by horror author Keith Gouveia. After killing his wife, John Mohr is sentenced to die at the gallows. But when an unlikely visitor turns into a reluctant partner, John embraces the monster within and becomes the god of the underworld's instrument of death. Doomed to walk the earth as an undead aberration with an insatiable hunger, John must send souls to Hell in his place or face its wrath. Also included are two bonus poems, and two short stories: The Tell-Tale Heart by Edgar Allan Poe, and Broken by Keith Gouveia.",
