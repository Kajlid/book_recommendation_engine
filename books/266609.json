  "description": "\"'A misunderstood T-Rex. He only wants a hug, but his short arms, along with society’s preconceived notion about T-Rexes, prevents this from ever happening.'A puff of meticulously groomed pubic hair, belonging to a divorced, middle-aged woman, who thought she deserved better, but now realizes it is a lonely, lonely world out there.'It’s a very well dressed, but fat, egg. His name is Sir Francisco and he aspires to, one day, be scrambled.'​Paul nodded once, pressed his thin lips together, put the blotted pages down, and made a scribble of thoughts in the notebook on his lap. Then, he took a long, deliberated sip of his steaming chai tea. ​Paul is a lanky, flamboyant, barely five-foot tall psychotherapist whose office is located in a cheeky district within the city. Calming incense dwindled here, motivational quotes written in DIY calligraphy displayed there. He said he could help me find myself– a crock of shit if you ask me. But he didn't-they never do.\"",
