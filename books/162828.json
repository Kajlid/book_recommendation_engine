  "description": "One modern-day Rapunzel. One naked man. Two very different wicked witches.At 22, Sage Rampion has led a strange and cloistered life. She's been homeschooled, and she's never owned a cell phone, watched TV or spoken to a man on her own. Everything she's seen, read and watched has been vetted by her grandmother Andrea, Professor of Women's Studies and hardline old school feminist. When Sage and Andrea see Ryan modelling naked below their office window, Andrea marches out to charge him with indecent exposure. But he waves up at Sage, and his grin is the warmest thing she's seen in her lonely existence. She rushes down to warn him, and as they grow close her sheltered world begins to unravel. Sage starts asking questions about the way she was brought up, and the beautiful teenage mother who abandoned her. But answering those questions means confronting Andrea, and she's not a good enemy to make. Taking her on brings Ryan and Sage more trouble than either of them could have imagined.A timely re-telling of the Rapunzel fairytale in the era of selfies and smartphones.",
