She's the multi-pierced, multi-tattooed girl hanging around the cybercaf√©s, always out at odd hours in marginal places. The jocks call her \"slut puppy,\" the bland blondes in the plaid miniskirts wrinkle their noses at her, the teachers think she's brilliant, and the counselors call her unstable.She's all of those things. So why has she singled out Matt Lathrop, an almost invisible nobody, for special attention? Clearly her agenda is dangerous, and clearly Matt should walk away. But how? Skye means mystery; she trails drama in her goth wake. Skye signals an end to his dreary existence -- but at what price?",
