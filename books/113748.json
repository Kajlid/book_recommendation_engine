Surfacing by Shana Norris Mara Westray has just lost her mother, and being shipped off to live with the father she doesn't know is not how she imagined grieving. But from the moment she steps off the ferry, nothing is as ordinary as it looks. As she tries to unravel the events that led to her mom fleeing the island sixteen years ago, Mara finds that the biggest secret of all is only the beginning.  Like Mysteries? Dancer by Amanda Brice Bombs, poisoning, arson… Will aspiring ballerina Dani Spevak’s 15 minutes of fame on the hit TV show Teen Celebrity Dance-Off be over before she reaches age 15? Dani and her friends are suddenly at the center of some serious sabotage. And if she doesn’t find out who is behind it, her next pirouette could be her last.  Like Angels? Winging It! by Shel Delisle Angel in Training Grace Lightbourne wants to earn her wings fast, so she skips school in Heaven, heading straight to Earth on a Mission as an apprentice Guardian Angel. But, she'd better watch out -- she's flying by the seat of her pants.  Like Time Travel? Like Clockwork by Elle Strauss When Adeline travels back in time to 1955's Hollywood, she meets a James Dean-esque type hottie. But can bad boys from the past be trusted?  Like Witches? Stirring Up Trouble by Juli Alexander Zoe Miller is a 15-year-old witch with a talent for potions. Then there's all the so-called normal stuff. Like high school, her annoyingly selfish \"friend\" Anya, and her crush on Anya's ex-boyfriend Jake. Now, Zoe's dad is dating Jake's mom, and things are getting more and more complicated. Zoe's tired of fate interfering so cruelly in her life. Can you really blame her for putting her potions to not-so-good use and stirring up trouble?  Like Sweet Entertainment? Confessions of a 16-Year-Old Virgin Lips by Cindy M. Hogan VL. Virgin Lips. You may not have heard of it, but where I live, it's a thing with a card, even if it is a figurative card. Maybe that's a bit strange. I mean, what teenage girl isn't interested in kissing? Locking lips definitely interested me, but the drama that came with it didn't. No kissing, no drama. Simple.  Like Fairy Tales? The Curse Girl by Kate Avery Ellison When Bee is imprisoned in a magical, cursed house because of her father's selfish choices, she has just one plan ... escape! But she must solve a riddle and help her fellow prisoners break the curse that binds them all before she can leave, and that is proving more difficult than she originally thought thanks to the bitter young master of the house, Will. Will wants nothing to do with Bee or her help (and he certainly isn't planning on falling in love with her), but he might have underestimated just how determined and clever – and irresistible – she can be.   Like Cute Crushes? Chasing Puberty by Kat Brookes Puberty has left high school freshman Logan Stanley behind. Join her on her journey as she discovers that being a true 'It' girl is only a state of mind -- you just have to believe!",
