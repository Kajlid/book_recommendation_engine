  "description": "PATH TO BEING YOUR TRUE SELF by Marilyn Holzmann is a uniquely loving, gentle piece of art that goes way beyond the usual frame of a self-help workbook. In it, you don't get only tools and techniques that are clear and precise and can therefore be easily followed and implemented in daily life, but it encompasses explanations and definitions that are simple to understand, a message that is powerful and brings peace and love to your heart. This book has it all and yet is so concise that it can be quickly read and grasped and implemented almost immediately. The words contained therein will change your life for ever and they are so imbued with unconditional love that your heart will open to receive on a higher, more powerful level than you have ever experienced before. Leaving In Peace is a must-read for anyone wishing to improve their quality of life, regardless of cultural background or religious or spiritual affiliation.",
