  "description": "My name is Mac Brennan, and before I woke up with a black as pitch arm covered in demonic tattoos I didn’t remember getting, I fell in love with a girl who was brutally gunned down by a warlord and left to die a desert.  Or so I thought.  Turns out, she made a deal with a demon to save her life. Guess we weren’t so different after all.  Her deal is simple. If she wants to live, she must destroy everything I hold dear.  Well, if it’s destruction she wants, it’s destruction she’ll get.",
