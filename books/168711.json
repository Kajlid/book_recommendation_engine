  "description": "\"I can find you your soul mate in five dates.\" Dr. Jake Lennox took that bet from his best friend, nurse Anna Adams. And then he insisted on returning the favor. After all, he's a commitment-phobic bachelor, while Anna wants the wedding ring and the white picket fence. So why can't he find her Mr. Right while she finds him Ms. Right Now? Now, admittedly, in small-town Celebration, Texas, the dating pool is shallow. And Anna and Jake's picks for each other are either too small or too tall, too old or too bold. Still, they're determined that by dates number five, both of them will be diving headfirst into marriage. So why do they suddenly seem to think it could be with each other?",
