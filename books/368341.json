  "title": "Farewell, My Queen",
  "description": "Detailed and dramatic novel narrated by Agathe-Sidonie Laborde, companion and lectrice of Marie-Antoinette. It is the day of Agathe's sixty-fifth birthday, Vienna 1810, as she looks back on the most tumultous days of her life. The action begins on 14 juillet 1789 and details the last hours during which Louis XVI, the intimates of the royal family and most of the Court flee from Versailles. Told in a simple but pacy and engaging manner, the narrator recounts intimate last days of the queen and the various intrigues which are thrown up as the Court disintegrates. This is a fantastically commercial book which transports the reader back to 1789 and is written with great drive and narrative tension. Chantal Thomas is a specialist of the period so the novel is also based on years of historical research.",
