  "description": "Fired from yet another job, Cassidy St. John never expected the answer to her prayers would come looming out of the fog on Fisherman's Wharf. When celebrated artist Colin Sullivan offers her a job modeling for one of his paintings, it seems as though her troubles are over. But they're only just beginning . . .Sullivan is mesmerising, and when he focuses his painter's gaze on Cass she finds him almost irresistible. But he also has an infamous reputation that makes her wary. Cass has no intention of becoming one of his conquests, thrown aside once the painting is done. But as she struggles to contain her feelings, she has no idea of the spell she's cast on Sullivan himself. Unaccustomed to refusal, Sullivan is fascinated by Cass - her spirit and her beauty. But it's her independence and surprising innocence that intrigues him the most. There's something different about Cassidy St. John. And as her feelings reveal themselves in her portrait, Sullivan dares to hope he can change her mind - and change his life - for ever.",
