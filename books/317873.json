  "title": "Blood Feast: The Complete Short Stories of Malika Moustadraf",
  "description": "Malika Moustadraf (1969-2006) is a cult feminist icon in contemporary Moroccan literature, celebrated for her uncompromising, troubling depiction of life on the margins, as well as her stark interrogation of gender and sexuality in North Africa.Blood Feast is the complete collection of Moustadraf's short fiction: haunting, visceral stories by a master of the genre. A woman is groped during her suffocating commute; a teenage girl suffers through a dystopian rite of passage; two mothers scheme about how to ensure their daughters pass a virginity test. And the collection's titular story paints a grim picture of dialysis patients in Casablanca--Moustadraf ultimately died of kidney disease at age thirty-seven, denied access to basic healthcare that could have saved her life.Through brilliantly executed twists and rich slang, she takes an unflinching look at the female body, abuse and harassment, and double standards around desire. Blood Feast is a sharp provocation to patriarchal power, and a celebration of the life and genius of one of Morocco's preeminent writers.",
