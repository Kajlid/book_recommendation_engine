A land where he was king of all he surveyed. A land where he could be God himself, if he chose to be. Until those kids moved into the cabin below the ridge.It had been perfect at first for the four young people. Friends since their broken childhoods, now they stood together at the threshold of adulthood. They were a family by choice, not by nature. When supplies dwindled and society failed, so did the rules of civilization and the mountain closed in. Not all predators walk on four legs.THE GREY MATTER is a novel of white-hot suspense where life is unpredictable and survival is paramount. Who is a friend and who's the enemy?",
