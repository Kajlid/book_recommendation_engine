  "description": "Nine new stories from a long-time star of the science fiction field including the Hugo Award winner \"The Erdmann Nexus\" and Nebula Award winner \"The Fountain of Age.\" These stories have been reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction, Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of the Year, and Best of the Web.Kress unpacks the future the way DNA investigators unravelled the double helix: one gene at a time. In many of these stories gene sculpting is illegal yet commonplace and the effects range between slow catastrophe (“End Game”), cosmic (“First Rites”), and tragic (“Safeguard”). Then there’s the morning when Rochester disappears and Jenny has to rely on “The Kindness of Strangers.” There’s Jill, who is kidnapped by aliens and trying to learn the “Laws of Survival.” And there’s Hope, whose Grandma is regretting the world built “By Fools Like Me.”Table of Contents: The Erdmann Nexus - (2008) - novella The Kindness of Strangers - (2008) - shortstory By Fools Like Me - (2007) - shortstory First Rites - (2008) - novelette End Game - (2007) - shortstory Images of Anna - (2009) - shortstory Laws of Survival - (2007) - novelette Safeguard - (2007) - novelette Fountain of Age - (2007) - novella",
