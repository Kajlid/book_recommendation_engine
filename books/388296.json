  "description": "A grim futuristic account of Egyptian society in the year 2023, \"Utopia\" takes readers on a chilling journey beyond the gated communities of the North Coast where the wealthy are insulated from the bleakness of life outside the walls. When a young man and a girl break out from this bubble of affluence in order to see for themselves the lives of their impoverished fellow Egyptians they are confronted by a world that they had not imagined possible. Breathtaking and suspenseful, \"Utopia's\" twists and turns will keep readers guessing until the very last page, and may leave some wondering whether this is a vision of the future that is not too far away.",
