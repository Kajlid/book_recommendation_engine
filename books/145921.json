The young lovers defy the gods to be together, but when they're caught, the punishment is dire. Asterius is sent to be killed by Athena herself, while Kallia is sold into slavery.Years later, circumstances conspire to send Kallia to be sacrificed, along with thirteen other Athenians, in the labyrinth of the minotaur. But there is more waiting for Kallia in the shadows than a bloodthirsty monster with a staggering size difference. There is terrifying passion, illuminating pain, and a shocking discovery that will change her life forever.In the Minotaur’s Lair is a dark fantasy erotica about a minotaur’s hunger for one human woman. This dominant creature demands Kallia’s submission. But is her sacrifice just a power play to gain the upper hand? And what will she do when she has it?",
