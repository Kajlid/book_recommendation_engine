In this first collection of Sláine’s adventures we meet one such tribe, the Sessair, brave warriors of enormous skill, and the best of them is a young barbarian named Sláine Mac Roth. Sláine is, among other things, a master of the ‘warp spasm’ – channelling the mystical power of the Earth through his body to become a mighty, monstrous beserker!
