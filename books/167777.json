  "description": "HISTORICAL FANTASYCompleted the 3rd edition to the 1st novel toward the trilogy. As promised, I am giving the first book away to friends and fans. Amazon does not let me give the book away and is 99 cents. However, you can go to Smashwords and get the format to fit your kindle. The book is on Nook, Sony and Kobo for free download.For almost a decade, I have worked on and off towards the trilogy. I have failed and succeeded at the same time in accomplishing my goals as a writer. It is my family, friends, and associates who make writing worthwhile to keep going forward with my endeavor.Living in Waco Texas, I feel I am truly at home. I have moved around my home state for a career most of my life. I was just trying to find myself in the business world. I moved back to Waco and found myself in writing. I thought I had a purpose in life until I started putting thoughts down on paper. Everything changed when I was trying to impress one girl. It is funny how life changes you to become a better person.",
