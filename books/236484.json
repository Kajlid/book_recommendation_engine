Not only does she have to win over frightened, injured wolves daily, but she’s tired of those threatening to close her sanctuary down.  It’s not until Eric Jackson walked into her life that she sees a light at the end of the lonely tunnel she’s been traveling. To the surprise of both, they have more in common than either could have ever imagined.",
