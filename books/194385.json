  "description": "A New York Times Notable Book of the YearTwenty-five years ago, after Richard Nixon resigned the presidency, Gerald Ford promised a return to normalcy. \"My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over,\" President Ford declared.But it was not. The Watergate scandal, and the remedies against future abuses of power, would have an enduring impact on presidents and the country. In Shadow, Bob Woodward takes us deep into the administrations of Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton to describe how each discovered that the presidency was forever altered. With special emphasis on the human toll, Woodward shows the consequences of the new ethics laws, and the emboldened Congress and media. Powerful investigations increasingly stripped away the privacy and protections once expected by the nation's chief executive.Shadow is an authoritative, unsettling narrative of the modern, beleaguered presidency.",
