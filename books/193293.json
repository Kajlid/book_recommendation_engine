  "description": "Life is full of expectations. For Brady Coldwell it's always been about the game. Hockey is and always will be, his life. His family sacrificed everything to get him here and he won't let them down. He knows what's expected of him. Natalie Banks is no different. She too knows what it means to have everyone sacrifice for you. She knows about the debt that's left owing in the end and the price you pay for making up your own mind. But when an innocent mistake lands them as roommates, neither of them is prepared for the feelings they have or the consequences of their actions. How do you negotiate matters of the heart? How do you say no when it simply feels so right?",
