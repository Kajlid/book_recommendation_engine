  "description": "People will set themselves goals or write lists of things they need to do before they kick the bucket or hit a certain age â€“ Reading one of Mark's books should be up there with losing your virginity, bull running in Pamplona, or getting your hair groomed by a monkey in India. Wet Pet, named after the shortest ever poem, is a compilation of Mark's short stories. There is a mixture of humour and serious subjects. Mark strives to deliver a short with a beginning, middle and end, with some kind of message or twist. These stories are based on true stories.",
