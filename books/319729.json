Then, one fateful day, he found himself on the bitter end of a curse, and he offered me in exchange for his freedom.I thought my life was over, but I was wrong. While trapped within the curse creator's ancient castle, phantoms begin speaking to me, caressing me with invisible hands, and proclaiming I’m theirs. One is cold and possessive, another curious and calculating, and the third… well, he might be damaged beyond repair—just like me.At night, however, when the phantoms leave, terrifying beasts emerge. Their snarls and roars awaken something dark within me, and their pull is impossible to resist.I’m changing, becoming something greater than I ever thought I could be.When the past comes back to haunt me, and my future is compromised, I find myself facing an old enemy.
