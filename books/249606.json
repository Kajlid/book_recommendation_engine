  "description": "Wandering alone on Tormance, the one inhabited planet of the star Arcturus, the hero of this remarkable story cries, \"I must make up my mind that this is a strange journey, and that the strangest things will happen in it.\" And the strangest things do indeed happen in a book that is at once an engrossing fantasy and a profound metaphysical fable. Maskull is transported to the Arcturan planet where a series of mysterious adventures causes him to undergo countless physical transformations. The people he meets—some frightening, some spiritually beautiful—are like none on Earth, and their behavior is like that of no mortal Maskull has ever known. Gradually Maskull becomes aware that his journey is the journey of a human soul caught in a death struggle between good and evil.First published in 1920, A Voyage to Arcturus combines fantasy, philosophy, and science fiction in an exploration of the nature of good and evil and their relationship with existence. Described by critic and philosopher Colin Wilson as the \"greatest novel of the twentieth century,\" it was a central influence on C. S. Lewis's Space Trilogy. J. R. R. Tolkien said he read the book \"with avidity.\" Clive Barker has stated \"A Voyage to Arcturus is a masterpiece\" and called it \"an extraordinary work...quite magnificent.\"",
