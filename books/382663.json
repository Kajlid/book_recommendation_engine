  "description": "Sariah has done the impossible many times over. In a world devastated by the rot's widespread destruction, she has unmasked the lies concealed in the sacred stones, discovered the shocking source of the ravaging rot, and found the only tale capable of uniting a warring people. Along the way she has wised the seven twin stones, experienced the Prism's destructive powers, and tangled with the mysterious Stone of Creation. Now, Sariah, the rogue stonewiser who stunned the world by escaping her master and defying the Guild, and Kael, the rebel leader who against all odds loves her, must confront their most difficult challenge yet: They must find a stolen child deemed by prophecy as an abomination but also the only one capable of setting rule upon chaos, preserving the future of stonewising and defeating the rot. The stakes couldn't be higher. The coveted child they seek is also their son.",
