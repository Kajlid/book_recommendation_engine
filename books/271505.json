  "description": "Saffron Skye has inherited a little piece of Hawaiian paradise. Only it’s filled with the leftovers of her late uncle’s life and overrun with his enormous flock of chickens. When her new friend, the oldest man in town, dies, no one else finds it suspicious. But as the town’s newest poultry keeper Saffron recognizes fowl play when she sees it.  Saffron is a tetrachromat and can see colors nobody else can see. If only she could do the same with killers.  To find the culprit--and the victim’s hidden fortune--Saffron will have to look in some surprising places. Even her new flock will lend a wing.  With scrumptious island food galore and two handsome men vying for her attention, Saffron has to focus, crack a few eggs . . . and crack the case.",
