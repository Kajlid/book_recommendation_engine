  "title": "Always Believe in Love",
  "description": "From the author of the Kellington series of Regency romances, comes the fourth book in the Emerson saga.  Nicholas Chilcott is the Earl of Layton, though his biological father was actually the late Earl of Ridgeway. When Nick's cousin Simon challenges him for the title, Nick must travel to the coastal village of Weymouth to uncover secrets from the past. But, instead, he finds the woman he wants to build his future with.  Kate Winston serves as the church archivist, while trying to evade the unwanted advances of the new vicar. When a handsome earl comes to town on a mission, she cannot resist helping him, though she has no desire to join his world in the ton.  As Nick and Kate work to find answers to the past, they discover a passion that neither can deny.  ADVISORY: ALWAYS BELIEVE IN LOVE is, technically, historical romance. But it is very light on the history and rather heavy on the passion. It has adult situations and graphic sexual content. You will not like this book if you don't like those things. It does contain some information about fish. You might like that part of the story if you like fish.",
