  "description": "One tempting heiress. Two sexy cowboys. Three means fun beyond her wildest dreams-until her Cord starts to unravel. A Midsummer Night's Steam story Thoroughbred rancher's daughter Caitlyn Culver has always wanted playboy Cord Daily, even after her daddy threatened to bankrupt him. But winning a racehorse in a poker game means Cord is no longer just a cattle rancher. He's come back wealthier and more wicked than ever. Snaring this cowboy won't be easy for Cait, and keeping him will be even harder. Still, his sexual antics and taste for menages won't scare her off. She knows the best way to snag a man like Cord is to pretend indifference. So when he comes onto her in the barn, she plays along-only to leave him tied to a ladder, aroused and unfulfilled. It's payback time. Cord seeks out Cait and brings along his playboy cousin, Dolan Crane. The two cowboys are enough to set her body afire. She's bound and determined to resist their sexual allure, but ends up experiencing a night beyond her wildest fantasies. Now Dolan wants Cait for himself. Cait's father wants Cord's racehorse. And Cord wants Caitlyn to choose-her father's money or her cowboy's love. Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language, menage a trois, and BDSM.",
