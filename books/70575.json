  "description": "When oversexed rageaholic Tori Gale is inexplicably transported to the uniquely twisted land of Oz, she quickly learns that her best chance for survival is giving the treacherous, despicable perverts who dwell there a taste of their own medicine. After all, if the various Munchkins, tin men, and witches who cross her path can't satisfy her carnal desires, what good are they? Murder, betrayal, seduction... Tori has no pity for Oz or any of its degenerate inhabitants, and if she has her way, none of them are getting out alive.",
