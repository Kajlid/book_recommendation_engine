  "description": "It’s the trip of a lifetime–ruined castles and ancient battlefields.\n\nBut I can’t stop longing for my burly professor.\n\nA year ago, I used to see more of him. Back before the professor’s book deal and rise to TV fame, I used to visit his office hours. We’d sit and talk together; going over lecture notes and assignments.A year ago, it felt like he was mine.He wasn’t, obviously. Professor Munro is twice my age–and so off limits it’s not even funny. So why do I miss him so badly? Why does my chest ache when we pass in the halls? Why did I sign up for this trip, looking for any excuse to spend a few weeks near him?And when we finally set foot in Scotland… why does it seem like the professor can’t keep away either?\nBig Brain is a short and steamy age gap instalove story, starring a history professor and the quiet student he can’t help wanting.",
