  "description": "No one guessed the zombies would reach our rural town so fast. We thought we had time. We believed we were safe.It was pure chance that I found Russ by the side of the road the day our world fell apart. The first boy I ever loved was hardly my first choice for riding out the apocalypse with. But he wasn’t my last choice either. Thing is, the business of surviving the end times gets lonely.None of us can go back to before the zombies shattered our illusions of safety. And that goes double for Russ and me. Our relationship ended long before the virus changed everything. The bonds of the family we’ve built from the ashes of society mean more than taking a second chance at romance. True love doesn’t mean much when heartbreak could be the distraction that gets us all killed out in the wilds.Still, with the gnawing fear of a fate worse than death as a constant companion, it’s easy to seek comfort in old habits. Russ doesn’t make it easy to keep my emotional distance, but we get by on furtive moments stolen together. Until our niece gets sick and we’re her best shot at a cure. Only, it turns out our situation is even more dire than we knew, and in exchange for saving Lily, we’re sent on a hopeless mission. I’m not sure which is worse, facing certain death, or watching the man I can’t have risk everything by my side.CW: This book contains mention of pregnancy/infant loss, allusions to trafficking, violence, gore, body horror/zombies.The Willows is a part of the Final Days MM romance multiauthor series. Each apocalyptic book can be read as a standalone, but there are more thrilling zombie tales to enjoy, so why not grab them all?!",
