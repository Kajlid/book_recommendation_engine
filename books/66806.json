  "description": "The greatness of a spiritual teacher is only partially revealed by the work of his own hands. The rest of the story is one he cannot tell for himself. It is the influence of his consciousness on those who come in contact with him. Here, in some two hundred stories spanning more than forty years, personal reminiscences and private moments with this master teacher become universal life lessons for us all.",
