  "description": "The more beautiful the lie, the more painful the truth . . . \tI’ve finally got feisty Georgina right where I want her. In my bed. In my swimming pool. Strapped into the kinky swing hanging in my home gym. And through it all, Georgina’s clearly becoming more and more physically addicted to me. A junkie in constant need of her next fix. Exactly according to plan. \tBut, to my shock, I’m beginning to think she’s not the only addict here. Any more than she’s the only liar. In fact, as crazy as it sounds, this fiery, relentless woman has been breaking down my walls. Burrowing underneath my skin and slithering her way into my bloodstream. \tIndeed, when it comes to the indomitable force of nature that is Georgina Ricci, the gorgeous woman can have anything her heart desires . . . Well, anything, that is, besides the truth.  BEAUTIFUL LIAR is the second book of the standalone REED RIVERS TRILOGY. The full trilogy is BAD LIAR, BEAUTIFUL LIAR, and BELOVED LIAR, to be read in order.",
