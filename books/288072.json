  "title": "Sustain: 50 easy tips for a cleaner, greener, plastic-free home",
  "description": "How to live a more sustainable life and create a calmer, healthier, eco-friendly home without using plastics.Making small lifestyle changes can make a big difference to our planet. Sustain is full of advice and information to help you take a more eco-friendly path. Recycling, reusing, and shopping at farmers’ markets are a good start, but cutting down on the use of poisonous chemicals is just as important—it’s perfectly possible to clean a house using nothing more than lemons, baking soda, vinegar, and plain water. Old-fashioned tips passed down through generations are complemented by newer ideas and innovations. As you move toward greener alternatives, why not try growing some of your own vegetables, fruit and herbs, and use them to make jams, oils and chutneys using the handy tips. Make beauty preparations and bath oils, too, for soothing, effective treatments to enhance everyday health and wellbeing. There are lots of ways to make do and mend, and by taking care of your clothes and not participating in fast fashion you will contribute less to the environmental impact of the fashion industry. Becoming eco-friendly just takes some readjustment; and by following the advice in this invaluable guide you will find yourself living a calmer, greener life.",
