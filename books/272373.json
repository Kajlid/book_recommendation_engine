  "title": "Encounters",
  "description": "Encounters is a collection of poetry and prose that dives deep into the emotional senses we all connect with. Though Encounters can be read as a bundle of individual poems, together it makes up a story of a personâ€™s highest flights and darkest lows. It recounts the encounters we as humans experience through love and heartbreak, the loss of those closest to us, and our connections with humanity and nature.",
