  "description": "When Jet visits her grandmother in Crete, she expects sun, sea, and sand, not a sexy police chief, a strange disappearance, and murder. Jeanette (call me Jet, everyone does) Wilson is done with men, done with her boring job, and done with London’s grey skies. Sun, sea and sand is what she needs now. She decides to visit her grandmother on the sunny Greek island of Crete. Grandma lives in the southern village of Sivas and is practically one of the locals. Having sworn off men, Jet meets temptation on legs within minutes of stepping off the bus, and all her good intentions are tested to the limit. Then Jet arrives in the village to find it in uproar. A housing inspector from Athens is upsetting all the locals. When the housing inspector is murdered, and Grandma is caught up in the fallout, Jet turns sleuth to solve the mystery and win Grandma’s freedom. Help comes from an unexpected direction, but is it too good to be true? With everyone around her acting suspiciously, Jet must choose who to trust. Get it wrong and she could find herself the next victim…",
