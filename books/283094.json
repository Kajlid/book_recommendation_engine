  "description": "The battle lines have been drawn. My fellow scions and I stand on one side, and the power-hungry barons on the other.The scheme they've put in motion could shatter both our community and the nonmagical world. Neither I nor the guys I love are willing to let that happen, but with the barons throwing both laws and parental bonds aside, we're short on options. The fate of our world could come down to a literal battle for our lives, one I'm not sure we have any hope of winning.Will the strength we've found together and the allies we've managed to gather be enough to carry us through? How close to the barons' level will I have to sink to have a chance at victory? As our time runs out, the only thing we can count on is that blood will be spilled—and lots of it.*Vicious Arts is the eighth and final book in a university-age paranormal academy series. Expect magical villainy, a tough heroine who bends to no one’s will, a dollop of steam, and a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers romance where there'll be no choosing required.*",
