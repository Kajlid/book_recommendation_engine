  "description": "My purpose for sharing my personal story is to inspire those who are hurt to know Jesus and receive all that he died for us to have. The freedom that the Lord offers is for those who are lost, mad, bitter, angry, and hurt. I pray that those who read this book will know that the Word of God contains the answer to every situation that can be encountered. The Word of God is powerful and has the capability of restoring and mending relationships. For anyone who has been molested, raped, hurt, persecuted, and void of hope, I encourage you to read this book. Hear and allow God to minister to you. He wants to help you to become the person that he died for you to be. Don't live in bondage. Now is the time for you to break free and take your life back! You are more than a conqueror through Christ Jesus, and no problem is bigger than God.",
