  "description": "The second largest migration after India’s partition. A story that shows a glimpse of the-inhuman- 2013-riots of Muzaffarnagar. When everyone was moving out from the city, a retired teacher takes a hard decision to stay. As Masterji gets lonelier with age, his interaction with the outer world also starts shrinking. During one such time, he is visited by Dev who is like a family member to him, but to Dev, he is his idol as Masterji had given a lot of good teachings to him in the past. Masterji once used to have answers to everything in life, from small outwardly doubts related to ordinary life to unfathomable inward contemplation that tortured a human soul. These were the answers that have given a new direction to Dev’s everyday life, but as the inhumanly evil in the form of riots continues in the city, he finds himself again surrounded by so many disturbing questions that nobody else can answer but his life’s idol. Masterji and Dev witness the 2013 riots of Muzaffarnagar. And that’s when Dev suggests Masterji to leave the city, the city where he spent his childhood, and everything around him made him nostalgic for his childhood. A painful story of learning, friendship, life childhood, riots, rapes and politics.",
