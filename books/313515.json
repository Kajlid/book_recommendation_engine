  "description": "Can the online world bring people closer together? Charlie Doyle is a regular sort of guy who, too long in a corporate office, decides to create an online dating account. His profile declares that he is seeking a ‘friend with benefits’ whose sexual needs and desires perfectly mirror his own; an occasional partner, who can share his pursuit of erotic intensity! Deborah becomes his first contact. Her profile states a direct kinky interest in bondage, blindfolding and sex toys. Needless to say, their online talk becomes increasingly explicit! The initial ‘meet-for-coffee' confirms Deborah’s trust in Charlie. They converse comfortably about their lives and families. She finds Charlie to be a gentle, decent man. She feels safe in his presence and looks forward to being his carnal muse. Though they both live ordinary lives, in the hotel things become extraordinary! Deborah transforms herself into a glamorous revealing split skirts, red high-heels and stockings. In no time at all, she is bent over Charlie’s desk, gladly surrendering to his bare-bottom discipline! Relishing the role-play, Charlie allows his true alpha male to emerge; which enables them both to gratify their deepest sexual wishes. These contemporary, unputdownable stories are pulsating, taunting and romantic; where, as luck would have it, accidental love spills over from intense sexual desire!",
