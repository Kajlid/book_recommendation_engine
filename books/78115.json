  "description": "Han Empire - 196 CE Warlords rise and fall within the broken Han empire. Old names vanish from the land, while brazen leaders make their fame—none more so than Cao Cao, the once powerless lord who now controls the puppet court of the emperor. As the final clash between Cao Cao and his old friend Yuan Shao draws near, the Hero of Chaos leads a brutal war to secure his borders and dominate his neighbors. His troops know no rest, his enemies no mercy, and while they learn to fear the glint of Cao Cao’s spears, it’s in the shadows that Liao Chun and his elite warriors sway the fate of the empire. But as losses amass, even among his closest friends, Chun realizes that maybe his cause is not as just as he thought. Victims are no longer faceless, their screams haunt his nights, and when another path opens up for the young officer, Liao Chun faces the ultimate Blind obedience or honest betrayal.",
