  "title": "Love & Dr. Devon",
  "description": "It's not easy being a doctor, especially when your wife has run off in search of excitement and you're fired from your practice for sticking up for your principles. Christopher Devon tries to make a new life and, after a bit of persuasion from his daughter, to meet a new woman. But how to find one? And how to placate a son who thinks you should never have split up in the first place? Dr. Devon is not the only man with woman trouble. Tiger Wilson has been married just a little too comfortably for 30 years, and Gary Flynn is a serial womanizer who refuses to settle down. But soon all three of their lives are turned upside down, and not just by women. This entertaining novel shows how reality can prove a fly in the ointment of living happily ever after.",
