  "title": "The Education of a Poker Player",
  "description": "This classic book is out on its own, not only as a poker playing manual but also as an exposure of the cynical reality behind the American dream. A marvellous autobiography about countless poker games and countless characters, about the railroad men, travelling salesmen, speculators, drunks, no hopers - even secret agents - whom Yardley saw through a tobacco haze across the green baize tables of the world. First published in 1957 the poker tutelage is of the cautious/tight play variety that still works well in the Friday night games. The book is also a fascinating insight into Yardley's work as a code-breaker in WW1 and WW2.",
