  "description": "James Herriot meets Bridget Jones in this honest, no-holds-barred account of the ups and downs of a vet's lifeMisty was ecstatic to see her owner but to the nurse's surprise her owner just stood there and said, \"What have you done with my dog’s head?\" \"I’m sorry,\" replied the nurse, \"what do you mean? She’s just been in for spaying.\" \"That isn’t my dog’s head. The rest of it is my dog but you’ve put a different head on it.\"On a crisp October morning in 1996, Emma Milne started her first job as a newly qualified vet, and now she tells the full story. We discover the numerous things that can get stuck in an animal's stomach, how to stop a cow exploding, and—the biggest truth of all—that animals are easy to deal with in comparison to their owners. They say that truth is stranger than fiction, and these tales turn out to be stranger—and funnier—than you could ever have imagined.",
