  "description": "It’s been two years since private eye Will “Lucky” Marks’ first case. That was the one that ended a promising police career. It was the one that started it all. The veneer has worn from the once dreamy image of an L.A. Shamus. Now, Lucky takes the cases that come, and finds a life somewhere between the glitz of Hollywood and the dregs of humanity.Like most good detective stories, it all starts with a woman, but unlike the adventures he once imagined, now-a-days, it’s usually somebody else’s wife. But every once in a while, the jaded Will is bound to get “Lucky.”",
