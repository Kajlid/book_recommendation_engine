  "description": "\"The Poet’s Garage\" by Terry Tierney is a provocative poetry collection enriched by deep images that refuse to remain static. Poems begin with epiphany-esque imagery only to morph into something radically new. Readers may begin a poem at Dairy Queen only to find themselves witnessing the implications of homelessness. Tierney weaves through poems with lucid metaphor, tinted lenses (which are not rose-colored), and painful memories made beautiful through language. \"The Poet’s Garage\" is an invaluable addition to the canon of California poetry.",
