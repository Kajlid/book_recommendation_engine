  "description": "Engineer Kristen McKenna loves to make things go fast. So when NASCAR team owner Matthew Knight offers her a job, Kristen's competitive spirit shifts into overdrive. But she has to struggle to keep her mind on her blueprints and off her dangerously appealing boss. Kristen's always been more comfortable in a lab than on a date--but suddenly both Matthew and Todd Peters, the supersexy team driver, are vying for her attention! Things heat up both on and off the track as Kristen finds herself torn between the two men. And as sparks begin to fly around the garage, she discovers that there's more to life than spoilers and engine specs. But can Kristen design a finish that gets both her team--and her heart--to Victory Lane?",
