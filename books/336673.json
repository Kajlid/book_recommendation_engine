No pain no gain. Carpe diem. What a punish! Nat has zero qualifications as a philosopher or life coach, and he doesn't feel like becoming either one anytime soon. But as someone who has struggled to find the ray of positivity in most days of his life, he knows what it's like to feel the relief from a moment of joy. So buckle up for Nat's unrequested take on pushing back against expectations and rolling through life with some laughs and kindness like a real, righteous ratbag!",
