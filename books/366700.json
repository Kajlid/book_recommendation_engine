  "description": "Vassily, the voice of Noah Cicero's new novel, is a different sort of insurgent. An insurgent battling abjection, poverty, and depression in a 21st century Middle America rapidly devolving into Third World inscrutability. In his fifth work of fiction, the Rustbelt's voice of defiance puts forth his most anti-heroic message to date, bringing us back to the homeland to see that the real insurgency lies within ourselves.",
