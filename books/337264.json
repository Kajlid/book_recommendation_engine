  "description": "If I’m smart, I’ll avoid her like the plague. Except…when have I ever been smart? Sure…I’ll admit it, women have come and gone from my life since I was in high school. They’re nothing more than a warm body to sink into at the end of a long day. Even though I’m upfront about not being interested in a relationship, there are always a few persistent females who think they’ll be the one to change my mind. Don’t worry, it doesn’t take long to disabuse them of that notion. Once they realize a couple hours of fun between the sheets is all I’m looking for, they get the hint and move on to greener pastures. And you know what? That’s exactly the way I like it. I’ve got enough on my plate with my new job as assistant coach for the Claremont Cougars and returning to college after a seven-year hiatus to finish up my degree. A woman is the last thing I want. Or need. I’m happy on my own. For the most part. All that changes when I run into a blonde bombshell in the guy’s locker room. Once I lay my hands on her, it takes every ounce of self-restraint to set her free instead of dragging her closer the way I want. But releasing her is exactly what I do a few seconds before my new boss walks through the door. And introduces me to his daughter. Did I mention she’s twenty? Which makes her completely off-limits. * Shameless first appeared in the Kiss & Tell anthology *",
