  "description": "PlayLand Inc. careens toward bankruptcy, and its CEO is comatose. Maura Ramirez, head of Human Resources, battles the egos, incompetence, and backstabbing of her fellow executives as she scrambles to save the toy company. Meanwhile, a murderer lurks among them. This thriller portrays real-world corporate chaos, reminiscent of Michael Crichton’s Disclosure and Scott Adams’s Dilbert. Sara Rickover navigated bureaucratic realms for more than two decades as an attorney, executive, and human resources consultant before turning from facts to fiction. “Playing the Game is a gripping, insightful commentary on the unique challenges inherent in a family-owned business.” Peg Nichols, author, Mediation Survivor’s Handbook",
