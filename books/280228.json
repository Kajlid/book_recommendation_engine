  "description": "Stray bullets from the hunting club have hit her house before, but when one pierces her wall, Alaina decamps to the wash shed for safety. She nearly has heart failure when she discovers she's sharing her 'safe harbor' with a wounded panther. Ralphie is no 'ordinary' two hundred plus pound great cat, though. He's amazingly intelligent and, when she takes him into her home, she finds he's also disturbingly affectionate. To keep the hunters off her property, she hires a man to build a fence. But, Raphael Doucette, the dangerously attractive stranger she hires seems to have an unhealthy interest in what's going on at the hunting club--and his own agenda. Rating: Contains explicit sexual content, violence, graphic adult language, and some situations which could be offensive to sensitive readers.",
