  "description": "Brodie Duncan expected to be taking a week-long Alaskan cruise with his girlfriend. But when she ended their relationship just moments before boarding, he ended up on the ship alone. Determined to make the best of a bad situation, Brodie considers a no-strings-attached fling. What he didn't bargain for was a man as appealing as Julian Richards. Trapped in his own bad relationship with a selfish woman he was starting to resent, the charismatic Julian is shocked by his reaction to tall, dark, and handsome Brodie. Instantly attracted to each other, the men create enough heat on their trip to the Inside Passage to melt the Glaciers in the bay. In the end, on a vacation full of surprises, Julian and Brodie discover that not only do they have strong feelings for one another, by Cruising they just might have found their soul mates.",
