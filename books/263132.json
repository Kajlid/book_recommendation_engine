  "description": "Meet Shaun Parrish. A good man. A good soldier. Good at his job, good with his friends and comfortable within himself. But what happens when all this is taken away? How can a man survive in a place where he knows nothing? With no friends, no communication, no local knowledge. Stranded alone in a land he does not understand, unable to speak the language or understand the people in it. Stranded in a land where it can be fatal to say or do the wrong thing. Shaun Parrish must keep his wits about him and adapt, quickly, or die trying. Surviving in the Stone Age can be as hard as its name implies!",
