  "description": "Aria Lightâ€™s planet is overpopulated. They have used up every natural resource, cured every disease, and are now on the verge of planet-wide self-destruction. In a desperate race to save their world, scientists send probes through space searching similar planets in other galaxies with the aspiration of starting new somewhere else. Light and three other crew members embark on a treacherous journey for the Milky Way. Landing on a thriving blue planet, they hope for fresh air, clean water, and fertile land, a new world with the potential for colonization. What they discover instead are massive, carnivorous lizards with insatiable appetites. . .",
