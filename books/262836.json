  "title": "The Boys of Seelow: The Hitler Youth",
  "description": "In the hinterlands of the Third Reich, the boys of Seelow watch their nation's conquests with delight. Upon each new victory in the field of battle, the young Germans become more devoted than ever to Adolf Hitler, the man who erased the humiliation of the First World War. Blaz, Koby, Ivo, Jarman, and their friends are enlisted into the Hitler Youth to be readied for the day the Fatherland calls on them. War with the Soviet Union demands the full efforts of the German people, and the boys begin to play a more active role in the war, helping out behind the lines in the east. Disaster strikes at the Battle of Stalingrad, and the Reich is sent into retreat. The FÃ¼hrer demands more troops to stem the tide of Russians, and the boys are thrust onto the frontlines of the brutal war in the east. In the forests and plains of Belarus, Poland, and finally Germany they fight for their country, their friends, and their lives.",
