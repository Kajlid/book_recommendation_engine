  "description": "A late night shot fired through her office window sends New Mexico news bureau reporter Jessica Flynn on a frantic search for a sadistic killer who thinks she knows much more than she really does.  To save her life, she must first learn how the gruesome murder of a souvenir shop owner is linked to the victim's bizarre discovery of a spy device at a nuclear plant.  Jessica reluctantly teams up with federal agent Luke Marsh to find out who has been eavesdropping on the top secret facility. But should she trust him? Marsh's murky connection to the disappearance of her parents seven years earlier has never been fully explained.  Meanwhile, Jessica comically struggles to hide her own secret â€“ an annoying and colorful trio of imaginary childhood friends whose existence she continues to deny. When a vindictive editor questions Jessica's sanity, her career is in jeopardy.  Jessica is determined to stay grounded in reality. But a desperate escape through the harsh desert wilderness may force her to accept some extraordinary help.  Note to readers:  The exotic setting created for the fictional town of Salt Flat is based in part on the author's real-life experiences as a southeastern New Mexico bureau reporter for a major regional newspaper.  The extensive salt flat wilderness described in Death by Snake does not exist. The nuclear reprocessing plant mentioned in this story is also fictional.  However, the premise for Death by Snake is based on a true incident involving the accidental discovery of a spy device at a radioactive waste disposal site.",
