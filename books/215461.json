  "title": "A Few Hidden Truths: Islam and Indonesian Democracy in The Age of Terror",
  "description": "A Few Hidden Truths documents Indonesia’s modern transition from dictatorship to democracy. It is a unique personal insight which begins by outlining the archipelago’s recent autocratic past. The unique thrust of this book is that it records personal experience. It also documents the effects of excessive corruption and theocracy.This book explores the ways in which religion and corruption perpetuate injustice and, by contrast, ensure cohesion. These issues are complex and relevant in today’s world.This book gives both a scrutiny and a personal journey. It details forces which pressure for increased religious conservatism and a return to autocracy. My words also express hope for fledgling democracy and for pragmatic reason. These experiences and evolving considerations are of a different value to a soldier’s tales of woe in Iraq. They’re made in peace and hope. As the people of Java and Indonesia strive for democracy and freedom from corruption.",
