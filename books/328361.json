  "description": "A Google strategist shows how companies can move beyond performative allyship into the authentic enactment of diversity, equity, and inclusion.After being in corporate America for nearly a decade as a triple minority who passes for a straight white woman, Dannie Lynn Fountain knows that corporations’ modern plague is the story of its DEI duality. Time and time again, she has witnessed companies pretend to care about DEI for public relations fodder and then discriminate against employees or ignore their identities. Dannie’s solution to this problem? Rage against the system by refusing to accept mediocre-at-best action. This story isn’t just about how messed up corporate DEI currently is; it also takes a hard look at what is necessary to get diversity right in three parts: ● The context of corporate DEI● Why the change in perspective● What’s not working and how to change Ending Checkbox Diversity gives readers an understanding of exactly how corporate America is failing underrepresented identities and offers a plan for what to do next, with clear examples and metrics for evaluating DEI in their own careers and aligning themselves with companies that are actually doing the work.",
