  "description": "With the long awaited arrival of the Round Table, Britt introduces questing and a code of honor to her young knights. While Britt tries to sneak off on the first Order of the Round Table quest with Sir Gawain, King Pellinore, and the newly knighted Sir Tor, Merlin receives word of a threat against Britt’s life coming from the north.  Tensions are high with Sir Lancelot acting as a general pest, Sir Kay’s determination to swaddle Britt in safety, and Merlin’s complete failure to see Britt as anything more than a trusted friend.  Can Britt survive the upheaval and establish the Round Table as a place of honor and chivalry?",
