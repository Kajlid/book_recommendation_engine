Now she's back to her painfully normal life and her relationship with Colin has fizzled to the occasional e-mail - …until he writes saying he's coming to Connecticut, just in time for the prom. But when he arrives, he's exhausted. It seems that when Morgan crossed the portal as Morganne, a spell was cast on Colin.
