  "title": "Lahkia: Heir of Darkness",
  "description": "Mateless. Dead. It's been two hundred years since Zorgroth's bloody ways threatened peace on Lahkia, and his influence was thought to be long forgotten. Now, children are disappearing and village archers are being found in pieces. One of Lahkia's leaders has called for an emergency meeting, but he fears it may be too late. Hiding beneath the floorboards of this meeting, Azura hoped to overhear something adults wouldn't share with children. Her heart races as she hears the leaders discuss someone who calls himself the Heir of Darkness. She listens as they speak of terrible creatures, of the mysterious deaths in the mountains, and as they debate the Heir's unthinkable demand: Surrender five hundred children per territory--or face destruction.  Azura knows they only have one moon cycle before his deadline. If she hopes to unravel his identity in time, she must learn to use her instincts, trust in unexpected friendships, and believe in herself. But when even Lahkia's leaders don't have answers, how can a child hope to stop a war?",
