  "title": "A Bit of Myself",
  "description": "A Bit of Myself is a memoir that was written, first and foremost, for my children so that they may better understand their ancestors and the passion for life that helped us become an American family. Through this journal, I share not only my most cherished and intimate memories but also memories of great struggle and heartbreak, hoping to reveal to the reader \"a bit of myself\" This memoir will take the reader on a journey from Bagnoli, Naples, Italy, where I was born, to immigrating to the United States in search of the American Dream. You will travel the streets of the burning South Bronx, where I started my Americanization at the age of six, to my final destination of Westchester, New York. Each chapter is filled with personal thoughts, poems, and family recipes so that the reader may better understand the author.",
