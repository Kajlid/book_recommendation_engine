She attacks by declaring Colin an upstart who is unfit for local society. He shockingly counters by offering for her hand in marriageâ€”and she surprisingly accepts.Or, when all else fails, conquer her.Although this genteel lady has vowed never to succumb to unbridled passion, she quickly learns that theirs will be no marriage in-name-only, but rather a slow, sensuous and alarmingly effective seduction . . . that turns her world upside down.",
