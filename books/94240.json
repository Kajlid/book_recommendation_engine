  "description": "Jodi Bristol knows three things for certain: bad things happen to good people; college girls order the most complicated coffee drinks; and Price Joseph will never see her as anything other than the barista who makes his vanilla oat-milk lattes. Price has spent his entire life being known for his looks instead of his brains, and has conveniently managed to avoid any real responsibilities outside of his job as a Talladega firefighter. He even stumbled into modeling for romance covers—a fact he’s kept to himself. Now that he wants to move higher up the ranks at the fire station, he realizes his carefree living might have cost him.When an electrical fire forces Jodi into the bed-and-breakfast Price hasn’t even opened yet, their newfound chemistry is enough to scorch everything it touches. She’s crushed on him for years. He wants to be more than a pretty face. Can they break free from their self-imposed restraints and find happiness together?",
