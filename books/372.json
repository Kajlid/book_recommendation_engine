  "description": "Who's really running the world? Why does the last Norse king of Caithness suddenly wake up after twelve hundred years in a ship? When will Danny Bennet get his BAFTA award? What's so special about Angantyr's recipe for escalopes of seagull? Will Hildy collect enough petrol vouchers for a cut-glass decanter?Who is afraid of Beowulf?When Hildy Frederiksen, an idealistic young archaeologist from Long Island NY, discovers a Viking longship sunken in a Scottish marsh, a magnificent burial chamber for an ancient Norse king and his twelve champions, she knows she has stumbled on the most exciting find since Tutankhamen.Hrolf Earthstar, on the other hand, is seriously irritated to have been awoken, but unsurprised to learn, on his return from the grave to save the world from his old friend the sorcerer-king, that not everything has changed in the last twelve hundred years.As he and Hildy set out to do battle with the powers of darkness they encounter such incomprehensible phenomena as electricity, computers, television and the Bakerloo line. None of which turn out to be as modern as Hildy had thought.For anyone wondering what caused the twentieth century, Who's Afraid of Beowulf provides the only logical explanation.",
