  "title": "Ellie McDoodle: Have Pen, Will Travel",
  "description": "When Ellie's family moves to a new town, she's sure she won't fit in. Nobody else likes to read as much as she does, the other kids tease her, and even the teachers can't seem to get her name right. But when the students need someone to help them rally against unfair lunch lines, it's Ellie to the rescue! And if shorter lines and better food prevail, can friendship be far behind?Just in time for the back to school season, Ellie McDoodle takes pen in hand again as she chronicles the woes—and the happy surprises—of being a new kid. Chock-full of cartoons, diagrams, lists, games, and plenty of witty asides, this charming follow up to Ellie Have Pen,Will Travel will ease the new kid blues–and perhaps inspire some creative doodling, too.",
