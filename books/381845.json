  "description": "WARNING – This books contains homoeroticaFor Panther shifter Vapor, nothing is more important to him than his feline coalition. A true soldier, he has never let them or his leader, Mitchell, down. So when he's given his latest assignment, he doesn't think twice before accepting it, even if it is to track down Mitchell's youngest brother, Andrew, and bring him in. This isn't going to be a regular rescue mission, however, since Andrew is a wanted fugitive and Vapor will be taking him back to face charges for crimes against the coalition. Still, Andrew is young and inexperienced so Vapor knows the mission will be a snap--or at least he does until Andrew shows him otherwise.Before he knows it, Vapor has been shot with his own gun, arrested by the human police and his favorite car is stolen. Andrew is behind every humiliating incident, too. Things climb to a whole new level of embarrassing when Andrew seduces Vapor, then leaves him naked and handcuffed to a fence. Vapor vows that he will track down the brat and make him pay, not just for his prior criminal activity, but for each degrading encounter they've experienced. As Vapor gets closer and closer to capturing his prey, he finds himself falling for Andrew. Then when Andrew runs to him, instead of away, Vapor finds he has to make the hardest choice of his life—his coalition or the man he loves.",
