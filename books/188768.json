It is a gift for all the peoples, nations and religions of the world.An unprecedented crisis is spreading worldwide. A crisis of political, economic and environmental change and upheaval is now gathering force, threatening the stability and future of humanity. This is not the end of times, but instead a great transition to a new world reality. We now stand at a turning point that will determine the life and future of every man, woman and child on Earth. It is at this time that God has spoken again. A Messenger has been sent and a mission is now underway to prepare the human family for the great change that is coming. God is now calling across the world, calling into every nation, culture and faith community; calling into the halls of government and religion; calling into the darkest place where inner suffering and physical deprivation are deepest; calling for the spiritual power of humanity to awaken and emerge at this turning point in the history of our world.   Introduction Chapter 1 The Proclamation   Chapter 2 The Recitation Chapter 3 The Engagement Chapter 4 God Has Spoken Again Chapter 5 The Seal of the Prophets Chapter 6 The Mission of the Messenger Chapter 7 The Initiation Chapter 8 The Blessing Chapter 9 Living at a Time of Revelation Chapter 10 The Assembly Chapter 11 God’s New Message for the World Chapter 12 God Is Moving Humanity in a New Direction Chapter 13 The World Must Receive God’s New Message Chapter 14 The Calling  Important Terms The MessengerThe Voice of Revelation About The Worldwide Community of the New Message The Society for the New Message",
