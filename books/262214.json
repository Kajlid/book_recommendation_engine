  "description": "What starts as a straightforward magical mission turns deadly.  Spring Thorne’s life is a mess. The man Spring loves seems to loathe her, family enemies are coming out of the woodwork, and her mother remains in a twenty-year stasis, waiting on ancient artifacts to revive her. When Spring’s uncle asks her to retrieve one of the final two objects, she jumps at the chance—until she finds out dear old Uncle Alastair has also recruited Knox Carlyle; the recent bane of her not-so-idyllic existence.  Knox Carlyle avoids Spring at all costs. Since the day she became an adult, she’s made it her mission to attract his notice. He refuses to allow himself to love her, believing his dark past eliminates any chance they have to be together. But with every look, every touch, his hard-won determination weakens.  With an army of Désorcelers determined to capture or kill witches at every turn, Knox is compelled to protect Spring from her own stubborn tendency to charge into trouble even if it means following her to South America to retrieve a powerful amulet. But when Knox fails to protect Spring, he is forced to go to extremes in order to save the only woman he’s ever loved.  Spring Magic is the fourth installment in the epic Thorne Witches series. Experience the magic today!",
