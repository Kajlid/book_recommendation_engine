  "description": "Lauren's senior year is going exactly as planned. Her craft blog is getting more visitors every day, and she knows what she's going to do with her life after graduation: get her associate's degree, marry someone fabulous, and live happily ever after.Sure, she doesn't know what she's going to get that degree in...and there's no Prince Charming on the horizon yet. But, still, that's the plan. At least it is until her older brother’s cocky best friend shows up out of nowhere and announces he’s moving in.Now Lauren’s crafting area has been relegated to the garage, and Harrison’s stuff has taken over the guest house—her guest house. He’s the only boy she’s ever despised, and he’s always there, getting under her skin, looking and smelling just a little too incredible for Lauren’s good. She wants to hate him...but she's going to have to stop daydreaming about him first.Lauren's counting down the days until Harrison leaves. But when time runs out, will she be able to let him go?",
