  "description": "Oscar Bowen wondered if his mate would ever come to him. He saw wolves as young as eighteen finding their forever loves and he began to wonder when he too would find that love and satisfaction. While moving boxes for Vincent Dane, he stopped at a family diner in Odin and his life was changed. He never thought he’d find his love in such a mundane place. Oscar was so stunned that he couldn’t speak as he beheld the beautiful brunette man that would change his entire life. Oscar is a take charge, black and white, sort of man. Jeremiah has emotional baggage and a desire to be cared for. Will Oscar allow his job as Rue Pack enforcer and his black and white attitude get in the way of providing his mate the affection he needs?  Jeremiah Adler has lived a life of abuse at the hands of his uncle. He has lived in fear of the man, ever since he was sent to live at his Uncle’s farm when he was four years old. He works as a waiter, trying to save up enough money to escape the nightmare. He is shocked when he meets Oscar, shocked that a man as handsome and mature as Oscar would pay him any attention. Something inside him tells him that Oscar will change his life, but will Uncle John and the swirling uncertainty in Jeremiah’s heart allow them a happily ever after?",
