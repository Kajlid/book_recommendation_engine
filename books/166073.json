It was well-written with excellent dialogue. The point of views between the characters shift effortlessly, and I found myself eager to read Eve's point of view just as much as Joshua's, even though the story centered more on him. This was an excellent book.\"★★★★★ - \"Joshua’s Island really spoke to me and I recommend it to everyone. Bullying is an ongoing problem and the only way it can be addressed is head on, which I think this book expresses. Bullying is never something that should be ignored by the victim, or by others who know it’s going on. This book should be a must read in every classroom.\"",
