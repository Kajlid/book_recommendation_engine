  "description": "After theater professor Adair Wilson unwittingly assists in the abduction of two Pittock students, she sets out on a death-defying quest to rescue the twin girls whose rare anatomical quirk makes them a target for paparazzi and fetishists.When Adair’s wealthy family refuses to help and the girls’ family denies their existence, Adair must battle an underground prostitution ring protected by corrupt police.With only her lover, Helen Ivers, at her side, Adair turns a handful of clues into a plan of action that pits her against the world’s most ruthless human trafficker, a woman known only as the Purveyor. Set in the hidden world of modern slavery where over twenty-five million people are sacrificed to fuel the world’s lust for rare minerals and human flesh, The Purveyor offers a gripping insider portrait of human trafficking from suburban Boston to the legal brothels of Nevada. Both a blood-pounding thriller and a romance of love, loss, and self-sacrifice, The Purveyor is as insightful as it is terrifying, a tour de force of avant-garde crime writing.",
