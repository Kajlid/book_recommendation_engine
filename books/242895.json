  "description": "Um. Um. Um. Are you reading this? If you are, I need your help.  I was at a party; I was running; I fell. And get this—this is the part you'll never believe—I fell down a rabbit hole. Like Alice in those old books.  Except in those books, there wasn't blood everywhere. In those books, the characters weren't all male, attractive, and interested in me. Forget everything you know about the Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the March Hare …  This isn't Wonderland; this is Underland. Violence, sex, drugs, and magic … that's all there is in this place. There's me, Allison, and there are the men that want me, the enemies that hunt me, and the darkness that's quickly rolling in.  And only I can stop it. So if you're reading this, will you help me? Please. I just want to escape this place and go … home.  ALLISON'S ADVENTURES IN UNDERLAND (Book 1 of 3 in the \"Harem of Hearts\" series) -- is a full-length reverse harem/new adult/dark romance novel, a gritty retelling of \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\". Don't expect a children's tale; these characters are nothing like their more innocent counterparts. This book contains: drugs, cursing, violence, sex ... and love found in the darkest shadows.",
