  "description": "The first book in Louise Erdrich's highly acclaimed \"Native American\" trilogy that includes \"The Beet Queen,\" \"Tracks,\" and \"The Bingo Palace,\" re-sequenced and expanded to include never-before-published chapters.Set on and around a North Dakota Ojibwe reservation, Love Medicine is the epic story about the intertwined fates of two families: the Kashpaws and the Lamartines.With astonishing virtuosity, each chapter draws on a range of voices to limn its tales. Black humor mingles with magic, injustice bleeds into betrayal, and through it all, bonds of love and family marry the elements into a tightly woven whole that pulses with the drama of life.Filled with humor, magic, injustice and betrayal, Erdrich blends family love and loyalty in a stunning work of dramatic fiction.",
