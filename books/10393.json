She can disappear into the woodwork, share tea with a queen, or flatten a thug with one swift kick, but what she really wants is to provide her dysfunctional younger siblings with the security of the home she’s been denied.Instead, she learns her grandfather has died and the family mansion has been usurped by a stranger who never leaves the third floor. Worse yet, her grandfather’s executor has absconded to the Caribbean with the proceeds of their inheritance.
