  "description": "I am officially a divorcee who is muddling through a midlife crisis. As if being single in my forties isn’t traumatizing enough, my ex tried to kill me, my best friend thinks orcs are coming after us, the town is convinced I’m a witch, and my daughter moved back in with me.These last few months have been a hectic ride, and the fun isn’t over yet. I’m in dire need of a job, so the smart thing would be to apply for some mind-numbing work. Something easy where all you have to do is show up. The bills must be paid.Instead, I’ve decided to go out on a scary limb and open my own shop.What was I thinking?As if I am not stressing enough, I am having a string of horrid luck. Attempted murder. Assault. Vandalism. Someone is trying to mess up my life.And I’m so done with it.I’ve been given a second chance. I am on my way to becoming a happier, healthier me, and I am not letting anyone screw that up.But what am I supposed to do when the line between reality and the impossible starts to blur? Do I see a doctor for medication or begin to accept that, just maybe, magic does exist? And would somebody please find my ex-husband? He’s escaped jail and is apparently threatening to kill me again.#PWF",
