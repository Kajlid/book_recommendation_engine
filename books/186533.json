Now their first three adventures are together in one volume.

In A Wind in the Door, Meg, Calvin and Mr. Jenkins (their grade school principal) must travel inside C.W. and battle to save Charles’s life—as well as the balance of the universe. And in A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Meg’s brother Charles Wallace has twenty-four hours to stop the tragedy of nuclear war from occurring. Read the iconic novels that continue to inspire millions of fans around the world.This edition of the first three novels in the Wrinkle in Time series is a distinguished new addition to Barnes & Noble's Collectible Editions classics.
