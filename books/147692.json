  "description": "London, 1820 After the deaths of his parents and a dark, troubled childhood, Captain Nate Bowen vowed he would have his revenge. But he never expected to have the tool of his revenge dropped so neatly into his lap. Juliana Hargate is not only the daughter of his enemy, but is destitute, very much alone - and exquisitely desirable. And now that Nate has saved her life, she's at his complete mercy... Captive. All Juliana wanted was to clear her father's name. Instead, she's been struck with amnesia - unable to recall even her name - and imprisoned by a tall, imposing, and entirely unscrupulous pirate. A pirate whose eyes seem to look past her skirts and many petticoats, and whose touch sends delicious ripples of desire through her. With every passing day, she finds herself tempted to give him the very thing he's determined to take...",
