Struggling to make a living as an artist, she and Hexe can barely make ends meet, but they are happy.

Now, with her pregnancy seeming to progress at an astonishing rate, Tate realizes that carrying a possible heir to the Kymeran throne will attract danger from all corners, even beyond the grave...",
