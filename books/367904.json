She was destined to be a dragon slayer, but cute and charming Curtis stole her spot. Then she sees a giant killer fairy√ëand it's invisible to everyone but her! If Emma has any chance of stopping this evil fairy, she's going to need help. Unfortunately, the only person who can help is Curtis. And now, not only has he stolen her dragon-slayer spot, but maybe her heart as well! Why does she think it's going to be a fairy bad day?",
