  "description": "NOTE FROM THE DOM, LOGAN THORNDIKE: Though we've had some practice and play, my Princess and I have our first official scene, which we expect to be amazing, and we do have a hot, sexy time, both in and out of our roles. But as first timers, we are unprepared for and shaken by the rapid descent out of subspace called sub-drop, and it throws our budding relationship into chaos. We should've read the fine print in the manual before trying at home! This novella contains spanking, impact play, temp play, bondage (I mentioned the chains in the blurb for Book 4--insert that here) and other BDSM-y and steamy situations to get you hot and bothered. But you'll also witness me being a complete jackass. That is all. Keep a flared hand fan at the ready for the heat, but you might also want to grab some tomatoes for hurling too while you're at it. Or flames. Just sayin'.* * * This 24,000-word novella is Book 5 in the 10-part Sorority Pledge Saga, a serialization that follows a rocky romance centered around the edgy bliss of Domination and submission. 18+ please. * * * (Based on industry standards, this book is about 104 pages.)",
