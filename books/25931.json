  "description": "Versistasis explores family bound by genetic heritage but also with a common spiritual nature. Natasha is the crux of a thousands of years long family line, and the Christ nature of humanity itself. Expressed in a single quality, through an integral metaphysical order of life, and the theory of everything, she along with Clantis and Teagan encapsulate the abundance of force in the cosmos connecting the sub-atomic realms with the galaxies through versistasis. By a temporal reality, one empowered in circular time by linear routines and bequeathed by the electro-magnetic thresholds of nature in the world by real time, her universe exists with humanity in perfection. Yet the reality of the time-space continuum is far beyond the simple experiences of the human being in daily life and as a consequence, beyond the multi-verses, the angels and arch-angels inform a certain characteristic mind-body where Natasha is only one exemplification of the qualities of a humanity in free-will. The nature of time within the three dimensions of space takes a interesting rearrangement in this first book a series, exemplifying popular culture and emphasizing astrology as the critical factor in the new post-modernist mentality where genetic engineering proves capable of steering the destiny of humanity once and for all.As the end of technological society is reached, the realistic enterprises of the time traveling humanity juxtapose perfected technologies with the omnipotence of God and the complete surrender of human love. Before an alternative humanity discovers the ultimate potential of life itself, they first must come to grips with the nature of life in the cosmos and that not so different life known within a gravity bound space station, creating a new Eden after an apocalypse.",
