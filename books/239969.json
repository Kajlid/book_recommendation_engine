  "description": "ACE for ASIN: B06XW3WYD6Tamás Buda is a pest…the bane of my existence…my billionaire boss…and also my dad’s best friend.  He’s been teasing me since I was a child, but now all I want is for him to tease me with those strong hands, luscious lips, and primal pectorials.  When he invites me to Budapest for a summer internship at his international advertising firm, I discover he's into a whole different kind of playing. One night after work we walk along the Chain Bridge and he reveals the bridge isn’t the only place in Budapest with chains, and Ghoulash isn’t the only lashing in town.  He’s as dark as his is rich, and more difficult to solve than Ernő Rubik’s Cube.  When my spring fling turns into a summer of sin, I’m left wondering if I've fallen for him for good.  *Budapest is an insta-everything standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
