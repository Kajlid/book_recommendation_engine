  "title": "Poems: Charlotte Brontë",
  "description": "Before Jane Eyre captivated readers, Charlotte Brontë was a poet whose lyrical voice explored themes of love, loss, and longing.This volume brings together Brontë's complete poetic works, from her earliest verses in Poems by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell—the collaborative debut of the Brontë sisters—to the haunting lines woven into Jane Eyre itself, including Mr Rochester’s Song to Jane. The collection also features On the Death of Anne Brontë, a heartrending elegy for her beloved sister. These poems open a window into the mind of a literary great, and offer a fresh perspective on the roots of her writing.",
