Something’s wrong. Or maybe it’s all in her head. Regardless, she vows to uncover the truth.Except someone wants to keep her quiet, and it’s the last person she ever suspected.Blue Haven is a science-fiction thriller that explores what innovation can achieve—and destroy—despite the best intentions. King’s imaginative world building and use of moral ambiguity make this page-turning novel a thought-provoking thrill that’s impossible to put down",
