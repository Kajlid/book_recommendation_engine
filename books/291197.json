  "title": "Ivan the Bold",
  "description": "She’d walk through fire to save their world. To claim her, he’d let it all burn.Her widowed heart freshly healed, Lavinia wants nothing more than to bind herself to Ivan, the man who adores her fatherless sons almost as much as he loves her. Then duty calls her to risk their future and return to a life she’d fled — to a man who wants her as much as she fears him. Tasked with escorting Lavinia back to the land of her birth, Ivan pledges his heart along with his protection. He’ll have his mark upon her within days. But no sooner do they arrive than her previous life threatens to tear her away forever. Haunted by the mistakes of her past, Lavinia would do anything to redeem herself and save her people. Consumed by desire, Ivan must decide if passion is worth more than the survival of his race.Duty or love? They can’t have both.Author’s Note: This is not a shifter romance. The Dokiri men are savage enough in their manly forms. That being said, this book features subdued sexual content. Enjoy the heat but don’t expect to get singed. Linear reading order highly recommended.Trigger warning: This novel plays on the trope of abduction. While Dokiri men won’t let anything keep them from the woman they love, even that woman herself, all sexual acts between the hero and heroine are consensual.",
