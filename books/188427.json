  "description": "Rather than spend his first post-college summer on the beach with a hot boy and a margarita, Zane Woodward goes home. While the lectures aimed at getting him to be more respectable like his lawyer father aren’t appreciated, Zane wants to be near his sister and his best friend—both of whom he’s convinced need him.Enter Geordie the Buddhist, blue-haired, stacked house sitter-next-door. Geordie has a penchant for parties, older women who can pay the bills, younger men who can wear him out--and he may or may not be able to control the weather.While Geordie and his philosophies begin untangling Zane from his own expectations and hang-ups, they bring the two closer and closer. Soon their chemistry flares into a hot and heavy summer romance. But Geordie has hang-ups of his own, including an aversion to getting too attached to anyone or anything. When things get a little too heavy between him and Zane, his instinct to cut loose and run free is tested, and Zane’s plans for a perfect escape of his own might never get off the ground.",
