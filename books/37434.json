  "title": "Agatha Christie: The Woman and Her Mysteries",
  "description": "For 50 years, Agatha Christie ruled the roost in British mysteries. Her books have been translated into every major language, and her two most favorite creations, Detective Poirot and Miss Marple, independently solved dozens of murders since Poirot first appeared in 1920. Unlike today's more promotional authors, Christie was very private. Thus this book's gift is to take us behind the scenes. We get to know Christie's intimate world. We share her hopes and fears over a long life, and emerge with a better understanding of what made her so remarkable. \"Agatha Christie did more than just write detective fiction. She was a novelist, and that is what will keep her books alive.\" --A.L. Rowse",
