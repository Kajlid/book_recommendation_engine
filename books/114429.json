  "description": "She was the one who needed help. — \"Why me\"? Katie Russel lamented when her car issued one last dismal clank, leaving her stranded in the Great Smoky Mountains. But she managed to fumble her way to the nearest home to ask for help. — \"Come in. Come in.\" A strange man obviously frazzled, flung open the door and pulled her inside. \"I've been waiting for you since last night.\"He'd been expecting a domestic to take his sister's fussy baby off his hands and dance to his fiancee's whims. And he had no intention of apologizing once he realized his mistake.",
