When her marriage ended amicably, she knew she had to get back into the game to find her soulmate and have the family she wanted.

Or is she?Miranda Hart doesn’t believe in love. When she’s saddled with her flakey sister’s kid, she has a choice to make—step up to break the cycle and keep her niece from being another victim or continue to live through her work. When she meets the cute, down to earth Tori, she can’t help but wonder if maybe she does want more than her career.When opposites attract, steam rises, especially with an ice queen in the mix. Will these two single parents break down their preconceived notions enough to find a family they can rely on?If you love sensual, steamy age gap, ice queen, sapphic/lesbian romances, then this is the book for you.",
