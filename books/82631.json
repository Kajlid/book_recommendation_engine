  "description": "Although she is a bestselling author of erotic romance, Natasha Raven has never penned a sex scene. Her sister, Liza, was responsible for the sizzle in Natasha's books â€“ until she passed away only months ago. Now Natasha must write the scenes herself. Trouble is, she hasn't a clue what to write and being a virgin doesn't help. When she is invited to speak at a conference workshop titled 'From Your Sheets to the Page,' Natasha panics. But a suggestive wink from a young hotel staffer named Jace gives her an idea. But will she go through with it? And is Jace all that he seems?",
