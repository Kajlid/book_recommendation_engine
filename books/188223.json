  "title": "Crushing the Alinsky Radicals: Second Edition",
  "description": "This is the second edition of this groundbreaking book. The enemy of individual rights today is a group I call the Alinsky Radicals. They are associated, philosophically and politically, with the communists and fascists of the past. They are not your father’s liberals. In this book, I provide the intellectual ammunition you need to eradicate these radicals from society. First, we’ll identify the context that enabled these parasites to emerge. Then we’ll analyze the fundamental principle in Hegel’s philosophy and show that it is untrue and unworkable. We’ll also examine their other nefarious deceptions. Finally, we’ll analyze their arguments and identify their pattern so you can effectively dismantle and expose them. The result will be the political crushing of the Alinsky Radicals and their philosophical burial on the dust heap of history.",
