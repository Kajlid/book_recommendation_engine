  "title": "Pulling Taffy",
  "description": "Fiction. Gay / Lesbian Studies. Moving from mid-nineties Boston, to post-grunge Seattle, to Giuliani's New York, Sycamore's debut novel is about searching for home and not necessarily finding it. D. Travers Scott calls PULLING TAFFY \"a sharp and sparkling picaresque of queens and k-holes, grandmothers and tricks, friends and freaks. If David Lynch and David Wojnarowicz created a rebuttal to Will and Grace, it could very well be this book. Sycamore's keen eye reveals the everygay as not merely absurd but grotesque. Like good drugs, Sycamore's writing leaves me craving more.\" Likewise Edmund White writes, \"I admire the candor and the reticence in this beautiful, anguished, funny novel. I have seen the future, and it is PUILLING TAFFY.\"",
