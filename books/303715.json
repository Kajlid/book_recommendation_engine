  "title": "Waiting on the Monsoons for His Desert Soul",
  "description": "This is a poetry book, often with a storytelling format, about my life, its many odysseys, and some of the lessons taught to me. It also has poetic portraits of others (real, composite, and imaginary), as well as prayers, ditties, and dedications. It carries a few of my photos, including the front cover. Hopefully, it offers wisdom and humor resulting from stints as a circus clown, a steward of a radical faerie sanctuary, a Unitarian Universalist Lay-Minister, a Winkte' (Two Spirit) Lakota Sundancer, and every restaurant position imaginable, including chef and baker, among many other experiences. I have been a journeyer, a seeker, at times just a nomad, always looking for my passion, my freedom, and my mission. I was a closeted gay man which colored my early life dramatically and then I came out 40 years ago and that figures in much of my poetry as well. For the last 15 years I have been mostly a healer, a baker/cook/restaurant manager, a photographer, a poet, and a community event organizer and entertainer. It is dedicated to the two-spirited and the two-spirit in all of us.",
