Behind closed doors, he wants me to use another woman's soaps, be tied in her straps, answer to her name. It's a twisted game, and I'm scared of how much I want to play.Get in, get out, save my brother, protect myself. And I've got to be fast, because Mark’s arrogant, infuriating, totally hot brother, Davis, suspects I'm up to no good… and he’ll go to any lengths to uncover my secrets.",
