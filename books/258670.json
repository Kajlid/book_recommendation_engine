  "title": "The Gospel Under Siege : Faith & Works in Tension",
  "description": "What is the relationship between faith and works? Some have erroneously concluded that faith includes works or that \"true\" faith guarantees a life-long pattern of good works. The result of this teaching has caused many to seek assurance of their salvation by examining their good works. Many have become trapped by dwelling on the question, \"Have I shown enough good fruit in my life to prove that I am really saved?\" The Gospel Under Siege looks at many passages which are mistakenly thought to teach these ideas. Few, if any, books deal with a larger selection of debated texts than does this book. The already ample number of these (e.g., James 2, 1 John 3:6 and 9, Acts 2:38, Hebrews 6 and 10) has been increased in this new edition with such passages as Romans 2:7, 10, 13 and 2 Corinthians 13:5. Based on clear analysis of these passages, Zane Hodges demonstrates that these passages are meant for Christian readership. The Gospel Under Siege shows that the rock solid promises of God's Word is where one needs to look to find true biblical assurance. In many of these misunderstood passages, Christians are warned about the possibility of failure in the Christian life and not about the possibility of finding out that they were not really saved in the first place. If you have ever run across passages that made you wonder whether works are necessary for salvation or made you wonder whether you were \"really\" saved, then this book is for you!",
