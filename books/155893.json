  "description": "D.I. Jake Talbot is a burnt-out British detective given a second chance to believe in love, friendship, and the transcendent essence of the human experience. When he investigates a seemingly innocent visitor to a residential care home for the elderly he uncovers a dangerous family hiding a forbidden romance that mysteriously crosses the boundaries of time. The deceitful family does all they can to prevent Talbot from discovering their secrets surrounding an unsolved murder, family betrayal; at the core of which is a keenly intelligent, though somewhat mentally challenged young man who is fixated on an elderly woman being held captive by her own son. Talbot sets out to right the many wrongs done to the blameless, and in turn, rediscovers his own humanity.",
