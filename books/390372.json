  "description": "The Concrete BlondeThis high-voltage thriller opens with Homicide Detective Bosch battling charges as the chief defendant in a civil suit against the LAPD. The family of a notorious serial killer whom Bosch shot during an arrest four years ago has accused Bosch of killing the wrong man. This allegation becomes horrifyingly plausible when a new murder occurs with all the hallmarks of the dead slayer’s style. The Last CoyoteHarry attacked his commanding officer and is suspended indefinitely, pending a psychiatric evaluation. At first he resists the LAPD shrink, but finally recognizes that something is troubling him and has for a long time. In 1961, when Harry was twelve, his mother, a prostitute, was brutally murdered with no one ever accused of the crime. Trunk MusicBack on the job after an involuntary leave of absence, LAPD homicide detective Harry Bosch is ready for a challenge. But his first case is a little more than he bargained for. It starts with the body of a Hollywood producer in the trunk of a Rolls-Royce, shot twice in the head at close range—what looks like “trunk music,” a Mafia hit.",
