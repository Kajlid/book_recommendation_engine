  "description": "Evangeline Chase is in the darkest corner of life and struggling to find any light at all. A business woman, a daughter, and a friend, Eva is also a control freak who can’t be sexually satisfied and wants nothing to do with love…or used to. That was before she was swept away in lust and love’s embrace while experiencing a total loss of control. Alexander Mason is the knight Eva’s always wanted, yet the man she sacrificed because she couldn’t handle losing control over the chaos of emotions he caused in her. Eva fears living a life scorned by her self-instigated loss. Left with a cavernous void that can only be fulfilled by the man who gave her the most erotic moments, euphoric orgasms, and touching love she has ever known, Eva is willing to do anything to give Alexander control of her, her love, and definitely her body.  But if Alexander returns hurt and shunned by Eva, will she willingly accept all of his conditions and rules, or will they battle in and out of the bedroom for control and ultimate fulfillment? Three Stages of Love: Attraction is the exciting next entry into the erotic romance series; featuring a strong heroine, Three Stages of Love: Attraction explores the hesitation felt with losing control and the wonderful reward obtained by embracing the uncontrollable. Bringing back the same palpitation-inducing romance that made Three Stages of Love: Lust an instant classic, this remarkable follow up novel uses its desires, insecurities, and explosively sexy scenes to draw readers into its erotic love story.",
