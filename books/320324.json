  "description": "Pierre and Bill have been together for over twenty years, ever since Bill was five. Thrown together by tragedy, they stayed together despite the many attempts to tear them apart. Some thought it wrong that a stranger should raise a child, especially when that stranger was gay. Especially, too, when the child also grows up to be gay. But Pierre and Bill would win that fight and go on to develop a unique and special bond.Now many years later, they’re facing a different kind of crisis. The specter of workplace abuse and financial insecurity threaten their future. When Danny shows up their lives get even more complicated, but it’s Liam’s arrival that turns their world upside down. Liam comes with Ruthie, and he has a problem of his own. Love takes center stage. Whether as parents, children, lovers, rivals or friends, everyone wants love, fears losing it, and struggles to make room for more. A sequel, (Pierre & Bill Now ) and a prequel, (Pierre Before Bill), are now available.",
