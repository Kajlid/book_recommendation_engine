  "description": "Penelope Leach's Your Baby & Child is the most loved, trusted and comprehensive book in its field--with almost two million copies sold in America alone. Newsweek says that it is not only one of the best parenting books, but also \"by far the most pleasurable to read.\"  This new version, completely rewritten for a new generation, encompasses the latest research and thinking on child development and learning, and reflects the realities of today's changing lifestyles and new approaches to parenting.    Penelope Leach's authoritative and practical style will reassure, encourage, inform and inspire every parent-to-be and new parent. Your Baby & Child is the baby book that responds fully to every parent's deepest concerns about the psychological and emotional as well as physical well-being of his or her children.  Dr. Leach describes--in easy-to-follow stages, from birth through starting school--what is happening to your child, what he or she is doing, experiencing and feeling. She tackles the questions parents often ask and the ones they dare not. Whether your concern is a new baby's wakefulness, a toddler's tantrums, a preschool child's shyness, aggression or nightmares, or how to time your return to work, choose day care or tell a child about a new baby or an impending divorce, the information you need to make your own decisions is right here.",
