  "description": "KEYRA   It’s my job to imagine everything that could happen and go wrong.  Except, apparently…when it comes to my personal life and Dane Thoreau.  I was shot for god-sakes, and still…he’s the only thing that sends me running.  Dane  I’m used to thinking one thing about women: Don’t trust them.  Until I met Keyra Banks.  The fierce, amazing woman has been getting under my skin for months, and I’m only a man. Now, with more women in my life than I’m ready for…the question is: Can I be the man that she deserves?  And the really important thing for me to consider…  Do I even want to be?  Join the oldest Banks sister on this journey to see if love really looks good on everyone.  Yearn For Me is a 40,000 word romance with a HFN, explicit sexual situations, and no cliffhangers. It is the second book in The Banks Sisters series, but can be read alone.",
