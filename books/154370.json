This year, Angela surprises herself--she tells the truth....The Gillespies are far from the perfect family that Angela has made them out to be. Her husband is coping badly with retirement. Her thirty-two-year-old twins are having career meltdowns. Her third daughter, badly in debt, can't stop crying. And her ten-year-old son spends more time talking to his imaginary friend than to real ones.Without Angela, the family would fall apart. But when Angela is taken away from them in a most unexpected manner, the Gillespies pull together--and pull themselves together--in wonderfully surprising ways...From the bestselling author of The House of Memories comes a funny and heartfelt novel about miscommunication and mayhem in a family like no other.READERS GUIDE INCLUDED",
