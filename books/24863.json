  "description": "In 1970, the BBC's popular science-fiction series Doctor Who began its second decade with a radical new direction and a fresh, dynamic incarnation of the Doctor. For five years, Jon Pertwee was the Doctor in the ongoing fight against evil and injustice.Doctor Who gave Jon Pertwee, already a successful radio, stage and film actor, the opportunity to expand his extensive repertoire to include television and he delighted audiences world-wide with his portrayal of the Doctor as a dashing, debonnaire man of action.In the year before his death in 1996, Jon Pertwee had been working with Doctor Who historian David J. Howe to present for the first time anywhere in print an appreciation of Doctor Who from the viewpoint of its leading actor. The stories, the monsters, the companions, the locations and the guest stars are all recalled in this entertaining and informative trip back through time, told in Jon Pertwee's inimitable style.I Am The Doctor is fully illustrated with over one hundred colour and black-and-white photographs, many of them never before published, and features reminiscences about The Navy Lark and Worzel Gummidge as well as an overview of Jon's entire career. Including anecdotes and memories from others who appeared in and worked on Doctor Who in the early seventies, I Am The Doctor is guaranteed to entertain and delight fans of Jon Pertwee whatever their age.",
