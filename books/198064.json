  "description": "Scott Harold thought that his life had officially hit the skids. He couldn’t afford his little brother’s medical treatments and had ended up borrowing money from the wrong man. He was now forced to degrade himself in basically indentured servitude, with no hope of ever coming up with enough money to pay back what he borrowed. When it all became too much, he drowned his sorrows and his life at Jesse’s bar, the booze coma is the only real sleep he’s had since his hell began. He thought there was nothing left for him but misery, until Vampire Coven Master Hugo Durant found him passed out cold and swept him up into his arms and his life. He doesn’t yet understand that he is the fate destined beloved of the most feared vampire in the region. Can he come to trust Hugo enough and fix what has broken in his life? Master Vampire Hugo Durant has been in charge of his coven for over 300 years and is used to getting what he wants and what he wants is his forever love. Nothing will stand in his way. You can count on that.",
