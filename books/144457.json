  "description": "A Seacat’s Love is a science-fiction action-romance about a grieving government spy and a humanoid feline scientist who meet in the corridors of a secret laboratory during an attempted escape. The first book in the Oceanan Trilogy, it’s an exciting action-adventure with themes of friendship, honor, and trust as well as doing what’s right, not being too quick to judge—and intergalactic love.Rick McCall is a spy who can’t forgive himself for making the bad choice that led to the death of his wife and unborn daughter. Leonora is a brilliant scientist and high-ranking Seacat Warrior from the planet Oceana who is captured by the human army, imprisoned, and secretly subjected to experiments by government agents. All it takes is one look into her pale blue eyes, when Leonora collides with him during her attempt at freedom, for Rick’s heart to stir and his life to change its course.When he discovers that Leonora’s claims about the government experimentation are true, Rick sees that he must help her and her colleague, Tigif, escape the planet, at great risk to his life and career. As they try to retrieve the aliens’ ship while avoiding a massive government dragnet, Tigif’s treachery turns out to be more than an obstacle to the growing relationship between these two people of different worlds, and his advances on Leonora become more and more forceful.Combining the imagination of science fiction, the steamy passion of a romance, the thrills of an action-adventure, and the all-too-human conflict of a drama, A Seacat’s Love will appeal to a wide audience of readers. And fans of the Sea-anan Saga will be thrilled to find out how the parents of the multiracial protagonists they’ve met in books one and two come together.",
