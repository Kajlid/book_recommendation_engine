  "description": "Amara is wary of mages, they chased her out of her homeland. Yet there is something about the mage Trevan of Nightfall that Amara can't resist. But can he be trusted with her most fiercely guarded secret? Courting such a pretty yet prickly outlander won't be easy, but Trevan is determined to try. She may be fierce, proud, and from a different culture, but after all, he is the Cat, and none but the most fascinating and challenging of women could satisfy him?",
