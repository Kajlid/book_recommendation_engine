  "description": "Do you have or know someone who has a vision problem? Nearly all of us can answer yes. The eye care business is a billion-dollar industry. Americans pay high prices for eyeglasses, contact lenses, and surgery each year. With all the advances in eye medicine, this title is the first step in shifting some of the responsibility of eye care from health professional to individual. What most people don't know is integrated medicine can be an effective tool in the treatment of eye disorders such as glaucoma, macular degeneration, cataracts, and more. The authors use therapies such as vitamin and mineral supplementation, herbal remedies, homeopathy, and much more with great success. Through both alternative and conventional therapies, you, too, can promote long term eye health and reduce the damage to your wallet.",
