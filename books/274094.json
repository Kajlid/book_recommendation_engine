  "description": "Margaret’s mother split six months ago, leaving her in the clutches of her strip club owner stepfather. Now it’s her eighteenth birthday and he’s informed Margaret that she needs to start earning her keep. And that means giving her first lap dance to a Russian stranger named Lenin. When her mysterious first customer pays thousands above the asking price for her company, then shreds the leather couch with shaking hands to keep from touching her, Margaret begins to wonder if there’s more to the Russian than meets the eye.  And there is. So much more than she could ever imagine. Including the fact that he refuses to let his angel go, now that he's found her.",
