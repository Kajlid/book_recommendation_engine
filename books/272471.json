  "description": "A Reverse Harem Paranormal Romance\n  Hindsight is an obnoxious word. No matter how vital the perspective hindsight brings you, you can’t see it while you star in your own show. There is no glowing neon sign that flashes a warning. But looking back, I see it now. I see how messed up my life was, how horrible a person I had been. Looking back on who I was and the things I did makes me cringe.  Now.  But not then. No, then I walked through life enjoying every little nonsense my twenties threw at me. I embodied chaos. But the thing about chaos is that there should be order in it. Even then my chaos had no order and I did what I wanted, when I wanted. Damn the world.  You wouldn’t have liked me very much.  Consequences? I didn’t even know what those were. Morals? Those were for my parents’ generation. Ethics meant nothing.  If you asked anyone, they would have told you I was living my life to the fullest. I wasn’t. That’s hindsight. I spent my days hazed out and destroying everyone around me by collecting their secrets. Burning bridges I didn’t even know existed. I hurt others with my words and my actions.  I’m trying to tell you I, Bette Morgan, failed as a human being.  So yeah, hindsight and all that. It took dying to realize how messed up I was as a person. Yet that was the easiest part of my story.  Living destroyed me, broke me into a thousand little pieces no one could put back together. Not when I became something sinister, dark, and not human. My broken shell was given purpose that shattered me even more.  Until them, even though they became the reason for my destruction.  I only wish I’d known then what I know now...  Nameless Darkness is the first book in The Raven series, a slow burn paranormal reverse harem story intended for ages 18+. This book contains strong language, violence, s****l situations, and a heroine who doesn't have to choose between her four men.",
