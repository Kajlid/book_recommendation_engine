  "description": "Contemporary MulticulturalRaelynn’s new neighbor doesn't understand Southern snow. When he tries backing out of his driveway and ends up with his rear bumper in Rae's gardenia bushes, what else can she do but invite him to dinner? And when his nearness makes her head buzz, and his unexpected kisses make fireworks go off behind her eyes, what else can she do but kiss him back? The attraction is mutual and hot, but there's nothing simple about the situation. Rae’s been avoiding relationships since her husband of ten years left her for another man, and Alec is still getting past losing his wife in a car accident.Even if Alec is ready to move on and Rae can get over the self-doubts that plague her, they're neighbors. An affair could make neighborhood block parties incredibly awkward. Still, they can't resist and the result is the most incredible sex of Rae's life. She’s never had anyone read her an erotic short story and she’s sure never tried some of the positions in Alec’s little book. But will the fire behind this red-hot, snow-blind, cabin fever fling burn out when the snow melts or will they make it all the way through Alec's little book?Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find anal play/intercourse.",
