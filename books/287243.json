  "description": "I never wanted the limelight. The only thing I wanted was Conley Logan. When words failed to express my feelings for Conley, I relied on music instead. But our love song ended before it even began, before I'd even told her how I truly felt. As a result, I watched Conley leave hand-in-hand with my bandmate instead of me. Not wanting the fight that would break up the band, I made a choice. I lived with it every day, knowing it was nobody's fault but my own. I've moved on. I'm content with my small-town life, running a bar. But now Conley is back, forcing me to face the music. From the way I'm still tempted to make her mine, it's as if nothing has changed-but until she tells me why she's back, I'm not sure I can trust what's growing between us.  The only thing that has changed: I'm not letting her get away this time without a fight.",
