  "title": "Almost Straight",
  "description": "I started my junior year of high school knowing three definite I believed in God. Good grades were the key to my future. And I wanted a boy to take me to prom. Then Liv happened. The way her eyes smiled when she watched me made my stomach do somersaults. Mysterious and flirty, she inspired me to question things about myself I took for granted. People seem to think certain traits are engrained in you from the moment you’re born. Personality, special talents, sexual identity, things like that. But what if some things aren’t so black and white? What would people say if they knew Audrey, the good church girl, was actually...almost straight?",
