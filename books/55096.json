  "description": "Where Niki goes, death is never far behind. Everyone Niki knows hates Congressman Frank Bradley. He is the father of New Government, after all. He started the Registry, and the world adopted it. Bradley is the man who separated Abnormals and Normals, and made it a crime for Abbies to exist.So when Bradley shows up at Niki's door bearing a terrible secret, then promptly disappears, she feels compelled to dig deeper. But the more Niki uncovers, the more danger she is in. A mysterious organization is out for her blood – literally – and her father's criminal past may not be as self-serving as she thought. There is also the matter of Niki's inscrutable employer Sam and the secret of his identity. With help from her partner Bobby Gage, Niki finds out just how little she knew about her family, and the truth of who she really is.Praise for Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, book one of the Niki Slobodian series:\"Exemplary noir.\"\"A new kind of heroine.\"\"J.L. Murray...keeps you captive until the very last page. I didn'twant it to end.\"\"A legitimate page-turner.\"\"I can't wait for the next one.\"",
