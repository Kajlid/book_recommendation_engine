  "description": "\"Portrait of a party girl named love was nothing but sex misspelled in her pretty little green eyes. She was the embodiment of erotic crime nor. Love was business, lust was profit for this crazy sexy bitch. She lived for sex, violence, and stealing expensive things, from gold bars to men's hearts. And she always found suckers to do her crimes for her-like me, your humble narrator. How did this come about, how did I wind up facing the barrel of a gun, one bullet left, my best friend-Laura's lover-holding that gun and ready to blow my brains out? Let me tell you about it, if you got a few minutes to listen to one damn sordid tale of debauched depravity, acted out by the sin seekers you usually only read about in dog-eared old pulp novels.\" A lost classic by the pulp fiction master Don Elliott, the manuscript to this novel was found buried in the basement of an old house, never before published until now!",
