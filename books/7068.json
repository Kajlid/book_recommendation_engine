When Joss McMillan witnesses his sister's murder--at the hands of a vampire--his whole life changes. He learns that not only is his family part of the Slayer Society, a group whose mission is to rid the world of vampires, but he is their new recruit. As Joss trains he discovers powers that could make him the youngest, strongest Slayer in history. But there is a traitor in the Society, one whose identity would shake Joss to the core . . . if the traitor doesn't kill him first.Written from the perspective of Vlad's former friend turned mortal enemy--vampire slayer Joss McMillan--this is the first in a series of five books that can be read alongside Vlad Tod or entirely on their own.",
