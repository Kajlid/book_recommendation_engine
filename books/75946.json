  "description": "Kids from preschool through second grade will LOVE this silly story about a young boy whose vivid imagination goes into overdrive as he wonders why his classmates arenâ€™t showing up to school each day. He eventually discovers they are not being taken or in harms way but rather they just caught a COLD. Uncertain what a COLD actually is, our hero sets out on an adventure to literally catch a COLD. Will he succeed? Will he actually catch a COLD? Anyone who has ever been in a classroom where students start getting sick should know the answer to that question.",
