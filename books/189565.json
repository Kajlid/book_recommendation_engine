  "title": "The Trouble with Dragons",
  "description": "The world is populated by some beastly dragons who care nothing for how much they mess up the oceans, chop down the trees, gobble up all the food and use everything up without stopping to think. Those dragons need to wake up to what they are doing to their world before it is too late. This is a delightful and energy-filled picture book that addresses concerns about the environment in the most child-centric and delightful way possible.",
