  "description": "The Plum-Rain Scroll has long been missing, but in old Japan, men have forgotten its existence. When the evil Marishoten, the Black Iris Lord, seeks to overthrow the Mikado, and usurp the Chrysanthemum Throne, he first seeks the precious Scroll, to learn the Unanswerable Word - the Word of Power. It is left to two unlikely companions to foil Marishoten's evil design: Taro, the Odd Job Boy, armed only with a kitchen knife, and Prince Hachi, Lord Eight-Thousand Spears, mounted upon his mare Oikaze, swift as the wind.",
