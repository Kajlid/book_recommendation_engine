  "description": "The Rapture has come and gone. The dead have risen. The Four Horsemen are drawing nearer, and those left behind are entering a new era. Relying on dreams, intuition and in some cases, even the dead, survivors find themselves being drawn to Blue Church, Ohio, where something monumental is about to happen: the ultimate showdown between Good and Evil. At the end of all things, will God forsake humanity, can good triumph, and will anyone even be left alive to tell the tale?",
