  "description": "THE MOST NOBLE OF SPIRITS RISE FROM THE MOST HUMBLE OF HEARTS He was unaware they searched for him. After all, he was an ordinary man, a simple pianist who herded goats and played Chopin high in the Pyrenees Mountains. He was also unaware that deep within his brilliant hands, dormant and undisturbed, was an ability to kill. In the darkest days of World War II, a man who plays Chopin so magnificently the angels weep, begins a reluctant journey into spyhood. Garcia Quinones, virtuoso pianist famous throughout Europe, is forced into the dark world of espionage by Britain's MI6 where he must learn to lie, deceive and murder. “I am a pianist, not a spy,” he cries. Under duress, Garcia is groomed for the lead role in a daring plot to dupe the Germans. His teacher, one of Britain's most revered spymasters, must ensure Garcia fools the Germans as brilliantly as he plays the piano. Can the pianist's delicate fingers learn to curl around a 9mm pistol and squeeze the trigger before he faces the Gestapo and the Reichsfuhrer of Nazi Germany. “The Unwilling Spy” is the timeless story of exceptional men who strive to battle tyranny and evil in times of war. When the soul of an artist is forced to confront the demons of political oppression, the results are unforgettable.",
