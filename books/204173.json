  "description": "There had always been otters in the stream running through Farthing Woodâ€”and that had never been a problem for the other animals before but when there is a shortage of fish in the stream, the otters are forced to hunt on land. The otters are taking valuable prey, and the foxes and other Farthing Wood animals have to compete for food. Lean Vixen is determined to protect her family from starvation, and that means deciding on a plan to drive the otters out once and for all. An extra section in the back of the book offers more than 20 pages of interesting facts, activities, a quiz, author info, and more.",
