  "description": "A chance meeting has New Zealand writer Laszlo Winter thinking back to his time in London in the late 1950s. There was Australian Samantha Conlan, fleeing an affair with Freddy Goldstein, who carried with him a dark history. Rajiv was an earnest young Indian at work on a study of Yeats, and Heather was the girl with whom Laszlo exchanged lessons on Shakespeare for lessons in love. There was all of that and more, and then there was Laszlo, knocking blindly among them, despairing at his academic prospects, and gradually realising that he was, would only ever be, a storyteller. Now, years later, from the other side of the world, the people seem to spring to life again, in this beguiling work by one of New Zealand's foremost writers.",
