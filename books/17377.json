  "description": "In the years following World War II, something vital and original was born in the restive cauldron of American culture. At that moment the voice of this vital and original something came fully into its own. It was insistent, loud and bawdy, and it finally had a name. It was Rock and Roll, and it was about to challenge society's values about race, sex, love, work, patriotism, fashion, commercials and religion that lay at the core of the traditional vision of America. Rock music strongly exemplifies a contrary set of values and issues its own clarion call for freedom and individuality.From its roots in the black and white \"under classes\" through its clash with the broader culture to its multifaceted incarnation today, rock and roll has fostered and reflected a genuine cultural revolution which has gone on to influence the world. This narrative investigates rock music from a rarely seen philosophical perspective. Topics covered include a definition of rock music and a suggested typology; an examination of rock on radio, television, film and the Web; and a depiction of what is to come. Of particular interest is how rock's shifting mores have mirrored and influenced the complex changes experienced by American society as it has undergone almost continuous turbulence.",
