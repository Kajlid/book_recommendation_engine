  "description": "No Longer Available. Not in Stock. Canceled with Publisher 3-05-2013He sits here, night after night Listening to the stillness in his mind Swallowing on thoughts,choaking on visions Drowning in his silence; the house is cold without her warmth It's raining again, thunder clapping with sparks of lightning Sending energy to places unknown and walking in circles Another glass of wine, a romatic tale in his hand He reads a passage aloud, he hears no response and yet... The edge of silence burns as nothing is given and nothing is taken But as for his beliefs,that gap is always growing, as he sees from afar The distant horizon of a nightmare yet to come His mind stays cluttered and betrayed, yet naked and pure He's fond of the nights, the nights of solace The only thing he hears is his breath escaping from his chest Moving through his lips and into a shadowy space.",
