  "description": "What is it about a computer geek trapped inside the body of a tall, dark, and handsome man that makes a woman's knees go weak? Theo Maragos is actually an incredibly successful businessman who is to be featured in a major magazine. And it's Zoë's job as the Muse of Beauty to transform him from nerd to hunk. First to go are those wire-framed glasses . . . revealing a devilish twinkle in his blue eyes. Next is a close shave . . . showing off that sexy grin, not to mention dimples that can charm the clothes off this muse. It would be so easy to fall for Theo, but the number-one rule during Zoë's exile from Mount Olympus is don't fall in love, especially with a mortal. Will Zoë succeed in keeping her heart safe, or will she risk all for a lifetime with her very own Mr. Right?",
