  "title": "American Traditional",
  "description": "Traumatized by a complicated childhood and losing the love of his life, Sage Osbourne pours everything he’s got into keeping his routine, and trying to avoid the not-dates he keeps getting set up on, content to be single and determined to keep it that way. He attempts to maintain that decision when a gorgeous newcomer opens up a new café just doors down from the tattoo shop. It doesn’t help that Will is not only perfect for him, but seems to be interested in taking their relationship further than just friends.  Prior to opening up Masala, Will Rahman’s life had been carefully plotted out by his overbearing parents. He was to graduate medical school, become a doctor, and make everyone proud. Will threw a wrench in those plans when he dropped out and took what little he had across the country to start a café. Disinherited and attempting to escape a toxic relationship, Will’s determined to live life his own way: without the influence of anyone else. However, things don’t ever happen the way Will plans them. A phone call one night, just hours before Masala opens its doors, changes Will’s life forever. Now the guardian of his seven-year-old sister, Molly, Will tries to keep his head above water, all the while navigating his blossoming feelings for the tattooed man next door.  Will anything go to plan, and will both men find a way to be happy together, or will the trauma of their recent past keep them apart?  American Traditional is third in the series of Irons and Works. Each book is a stand-alone novel with guaranteed HEA.",
