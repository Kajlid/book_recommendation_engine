  "description": "Kelcie Roberts has finally found the spot in Scotland where she’s certain Mary Queen of Scots’ chalice is located. If she and her archeological team can dig it up, she’ll change history and become famous, finally earning her a doctorate from back home in Minnesota. There’s only one problem—the owner, famous soccer player and businessman Graham McGregor, is putting restrictions on the dig, making her play as if she’s his girlfriend just to make his ex-girlfriend jealous. Graham’s mother doesn’t like Kelcie because of a centuries old feud between their families, and Kelcie also can’t tell anyone she’s the daughter of a U.S. Senator who hates Europe. She just wants to get the chalice, but it seems as if the world has other plans for her, played out in the media while Graham worms his way into her heart.",
