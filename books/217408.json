  "description": "She hates him.He loves getting under her skin.Travis King is the worst kind of a**hole.He taunts me for being a good girl and mocks my high standards.He’s cruel, crass, and has enough confidence to last two lifetimes.And I hate him.It wouldn’t matter so much if he were avoidable.But considering he’s my older brother’s best friend and roommate, I see him more than I’d ever want to.His sculpted abs and gorgeous eyes are wasted on such an arrogant man, which makes me hate him even more.Even though I’ve had a crush on him since I was ten, the feelings weren’t mutual and he’s made that very clear.He’s always loved getting under my skin and one night against my better judgment, I let him in my bed.I’ve succumbed to his manw**re ways, but that doesn’t change a thing.Because the King is about to get played at his own game—and lose.Checkmate, King.This is book 1 in the Travis & Viola duet and must be read first. Suggested for mature readers only.",
