  "description": "Finally, Fancy Marie felt that she had slipped the noose of circumstances that was strangling her in Texas. After nearly six months here, high in the Colorado Rockies working and maintaining the vast, remote and beautifully secluded Cimarron Ranch with just her two young sons, at last she felt she had a sense of purpose, a contentment filled from long days of diverse and hard work. Little did she realize how ominous circumstances would yet change for her, as a combination of a visit from her \"patron\" from Texas is complemented with a horrifying encounter with a dangerous escapee from a mental institution; the conclusion is an unexpected shift to a clearly bright future someplace close to Paradise.",
