  "title": "Blackbird: A Mother’s Reflections on Grief, Loss, and Life After Suicide",
  "description": "Is grief on a dial or a switch? Both.Over six short weeks in 2022, Betsy Thibaut Stephenson lost her son to suicide, mother-in-law to dementia, and family dog to cancer. Rather than succumb to grief’s darkness, Betsy chose to face her losses head-on, accepting grief as an uninvited yet permanent companion in her revised life.Blackbird is a memoir composed in real time, a concise and brutally honest look at the emotional, physical, and spiritual impact of deep despair. By unflinchingly pulling back the curtain on fear and shame, Betsy’s story inspires important conversations about mental health, grief resilience, and creating a path toward healing.",
