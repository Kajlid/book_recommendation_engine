  "description": "Rosemary has been cursed—and, despite being heir to a family of powerful wizards, his ambivalence towards magic renders him incapable of breaking the complex spell on his own.One effect of his curse is particularly devastating; everyone he knows has forgotten him, including his partner, Rowan. Because Rosemary was Rowan’s introduction to the world of magic, they have also forgotten a core part of who they are—a wizard of prodigious skill.The two of them must make a deal with a stranger named Siobhan, who shares their desire to hunt down the wizard who cast the curse. But her tactics are reckless, her motives questionable… and Rosemary has to find a way to get Rowan on his side before either Siobhan endangers them both, or the curse spirals out of his control.“Five stars! Clearly written and carefully plotted, with some excellent gay characters.” - F. Marsh, author of Both Sides of the Moon",
