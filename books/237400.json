  "description": "Most people don’t like to talk about their vulnerable moments. It’s hard enough to be honest with ourselves, let alone share these feelings with others. Even harder is to laugh when we do recognize those certain moments that, even in retrospect, are just completely cringe-worthy. For Gia, laughing and writing about these experiences is cathartic—even more so when depression and anxiety are fighting to take center stage. Join her on a journey from devastatingly-shy teenager to almost-completely-functioning adult that is hardly linear and always a work in progress. After all: How can a flaw be fatal if we’re all chuckling about it?",
