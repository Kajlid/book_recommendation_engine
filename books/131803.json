  "description": "Richard M. Watt's study of the French Army mutinies of 1917 is historical writing in the grand manner, the fruit of scrupulous research and profound insight into events and personalities. Here is the story of how and why, at a critical point in World War I, regiment after regiment defied their officers and laid down their arms; of the thirty years of corruption and treason in high places which led to the mutinies; of the ruthless actions which ended them, and of the way in which France regained its will to victory.",
