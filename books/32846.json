  "title": "Sam, the Strawb Part",
  "description": "What happens when a thin boy dresses as a pirate, attaches a jolly roger to his bicycle and starts to hijack strawberries? When the pirate starts handing his booty over to poor children, the people take his side. But the evil fruit monopoly doesn't take kindly to pirates. They hire the notorious pirate-killer, Commodore Tiberius J. Swinkill, to hunt Sam down. Thus begins the epic chase across Canada. It's broken bicycle against a sailboat on wheels in a chase for the hearts and strawberries of the nation! This swashbuckling tale of fury and fruit is for children, parents and everyone who loves strawberries, children or pirates. Author Scott Bury will donate all proceeds from the sales of this story to Children at Risk, a registered charity that supports families and children with autism spectrum disorders.",
