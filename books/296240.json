  "description": "Amanda Brooks is a born-and-bred New Yorker with an envious life that isn’t as picture perfect as it seems.For over a decade she’s been hiding a dark secret—a secret that goes back to that summer at Camp Catalpa when a man died in the woods. Fellow campers Catherine and Meg were there, too, and in the years since, not one of them has ever spoken about what happened that day. Until Amanda slips up—and the truth threatens to explode the tightly controlled façade of her life.When her past begins to poison her present, Amanda has no one to turn to except the two women who know her most monstrous self. Reuniting with Catherine and Meg one last time, Amanda is desperate to put the demons of that twisted summer to rest. But when trusting anyone, even one another, starts to feel like a wildly risky proposition, just how far will these three go to keep the truth from emerging—and their lives from unraveling?",
