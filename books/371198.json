  "description": "Charles Highway is every mother’s worst nightmare. Precociously intelligent, mercilessly manipulative and highly sexed, Charles devotes the last of his teenage years to bedding girls and evading the half-arsed overtures of his distant parents. That is, until, he meets the aloof, wildly unattainable, Rachel. As Charles’s twentieth birthday – and the Oxford entrance exams – loom, his plans for seducing Rachel will draw him into a private collection of obsessional notes and the eponymous ‘Rachel Papers’. WINNER OF THE SOMERSET MAUGHAM AWARD 'Scurrilous, shameless and very funny' The Times Literary Supplement ‘Amis has brought off the feat of satirizing his contemporaries while making them both funny and, in a bizarre way, moving’ Peter Ackroyd",
