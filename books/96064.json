  "description": "Librarian's Note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B00D002DE8The stress of opening her own specialty bakery has kept Brooke tied up in knots, just not the kind she would prefer. When she spies the hunk of a Dom across the crowded bar, she’s intrigued, but his wristband indicates he’s off limits. That doesn’t stop her from doing the most daring thing she’s ever done to snag a man’s attention, but when things escalate beyond even her wildest imaginings, she can’t get out of there fast enough.His contract with the Mustangs is set to expire at the end of the season, and third baseman, Todd Stevens is holding out for a longer, more lucrative deal as a free agent. Convinced more money and a new city will cure what ails him, he isn’t looking for a long-term relationship, much less a one-time hookup with a sub who doesn’t know her place. Unfortunately, the little minx eyeing him from across the room might just be the one to make him change his mind.",
