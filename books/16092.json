  "description": "Years before he was a legend, years before he was loved, years before his name was associated with Camelot, Merlin was alone. An orphan since infancy, Merlin is taunted by those who see his gifts as evidence that he is the devil's own son. But when a young knight comes to the orphanage recruiting young soldiers, Merlin is pulled into a war he doesn't want to fight. Though gifted with exceptional powers to see into the future, Merlin's own tumultuous life threatens the stability of the entire future.",
