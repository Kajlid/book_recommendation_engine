  "description": "I am great at my job.And I'm not just saying that—I have the statistics to back it up. Being a cupid is my passion. Being the best is just the dollop of pink icing on the heart cake.But none of that matters when I find myself caught up in a battle in the fae realm. I'm about to get hit with a power blast strong enough to end my immortal life when something happens. A fae male steps in front of me and takes the hit.Belren dies, right there in front of my eyes.Aimless in my guilty grief, I lose my footing as the perfect cupid. And footing is very important when you're trying to have a superior bow and arrow stance.Finally fed up with the constant cloud of regret, I go back to where it started—the fae island where Belren died. Yet I don't find closure. Instead, I find him.But the horned, handsome, and entirely see-through male doesn't remember me at all. And that's when I know that the fates are out to mess up my orderly life.Because the truth is, Belren haunted me long before he ever became a ghost.Now, it seems we both have unfinished business.",
