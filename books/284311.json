Join the unlikely heroine on an adventure of a lifetime! Lush watercolor illustrations of cool characters, weird monsters, and spooky villains.  Fourteen-year-old Anna has just moved to New York with her mother and stepfather, and she hates everything about her new life. After another argument with her mother, she defiantly sneaks out to ski in Riverside Park.  Much to her surprise she meets another cross-country skier, a boy about her own age, and follows him into a snow-covered magical Otherworld inhabited by the monstrous Wyssun and the Skiers who hunt them. Mistaken for a boy, Anna is accepted by the peculiar Skiers as one of their own, and becomes trapped in the Wyssun' World.

Before she discovers the truth about love, she has to learn the value of loss, only then can she find the way home.",
