  "description": "I'm not supposed to want him, but I do. I'm not supposed to need him, but I can't stop. I'm not supposed to love him, but my heart won't listen. Most of all? I'm definitely, under no circumstances, supposed to sleep with him. Grant \"Wrecker\" Harrison spent three years of his life locked away. He's out and he's tired of hiding. He wants everyone, even his father Judge President of the Death Lords MC, to know she's his. Chelsea Weaver loves Grant even though she knows it's wrong. She knew it was wrong when she gave him her virginity and she knows it's still wrong three years later... because Grant's her stepbrother and Judge is the only father she's ever known.",
