(These are standalone books tied together by a common theme--belief in the beauty of that second chance.)How does one see truly--with the heart or with the eyes?Matt Brandon has it all--wealth, power, looks, and talent. Women want him, men want to be like him. When a freak ski accident strips him of one of life's most basic needs--his sight--he struggles to accept the possibility that his blindness may be permanent.Enter, psychologist, Sara Hamilton, a woman who has known her own share of grief and loss and may just be the one person who can help Matt redefine his new world. Sara is every woman's woman--she's not a toothpick or a Cosmo girl, has never been prom queen, or dated the blond-haired god with the big white teeth. She's honest and decent and real...and lives on the perimeter, applauding her patients' successes, nursing them through their failures, but never acknowledging or accepting her own lackings. She's loved and lost once and has been so emotionally scarred, she's not willing to risk those feelings again.Of course, she's never met a man like Matt Brandon. As Matt and Sara explore the delicate balance between 'blind' trust and hope, they will discover that sometimes you have to lose everything to find what you are truly looking for...That Second Chance Series:Book One: Pulling HomeBook Two: The Way They WereBook Three: Simple RichesBook Four: Paradise FoundBook Five: Not Your Everyday HousewifeBook Six: The Butterfly Garden",
