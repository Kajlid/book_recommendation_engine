  "description": "Have you ever been afraid to live and afraid to die? Felt anxious, alone or desperately sad? Have you ever been overwhelmed with joy? Loved so much it felt amazing and it hurt? Faced adversity and wanted to give up but somehow found the will to continue? Have you ever felt someone else's sorrow or love? Or just simply been curious about everything in the universe and life? Well prepare yourself to go on a vulnerable, emotional journey of personal experiences articulated through poem. If you relate to any of the emotions, or feelings in these poems, my wish is that you may find, inspiration, encouragement, and hope.",
