Even believers can let the normal concerns of life get blown out of proportion, becoming ensnared in worry and What if something happens to my spouse? What if something were to happen to one of my children? What if this plane crashes? Uncovering the surprising scope of fear in the body of Christ and how many Christians who believe in the Lord’ s care and love are being kept from God’ s best by their fears, Freedom from Fear shows readers how to take back their lives. This eye-opening book examines the roots of worry and anxiety, such as fear of rejection, disapproval, failure, and the unknown. Readers will learn how fear-filled strongholds develop and discover the tools they need to tear down the prison walls. Reaching out to anyone crippled by worries, Anderson and Miller share how the fear of God dispels all unhealthy fears and leads believers to joyous freedom. Includes a 21-day devotional guide to help readers on their journey from fear to peace.",
