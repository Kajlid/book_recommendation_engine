The rest of the vampires like her, but they don’t know that she has been secretly rescuing the human slaves out of the vampire castle. If they ever found out, she will be torn into pieces. And Arden's trouble doesn't end there. On the land of Winoley, the demon god Hesper awakes in every three hundred years. Each time, two young children, chosen by the gods, must to be brought to the capital Trinity. And Hesper shall choose one from the two to be sacrificed. If all went well, the demon will return to sleep. But if the people made a mistake, Winoley will be drowned in fires. With Hesper’s next awakening three years away, Winoley thought it had everything prepared — that is, until one of the two chosen girls ran away and committed suicide. The world falls into a frenetical search for a successor. Arden knows that she is the successor they are searching for. But she is neither planning to let her identity be discovered, nor to succumb to her fate. Instead, the young girl secretly heads to the capital, plotting to make a dangerous bargain with the almighty gods...",
