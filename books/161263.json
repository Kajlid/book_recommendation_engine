  "title": "Clifton Manor - Episode One",
  "description": "The year is 1912, and Clifton Manor is one of the most prestigious homes in the Yorkshire countryside. But as Anna Holden is about to discover, it is a house not only steeped in history, but in secrets as well…Upon her arrival as the new assistant cook, Anna discovers that a thousand mysteries await her. What lies beyond the heavily padlocked door the other servants do their best to avoid? Who has Lady Clifton been speaking to in such hushed, surreptitious tones? What is the cause of the misfortune running rampant amongst the staff? And why does George Winston, the eligible bachelor of the family, seem more taken with Anna than he does the proper ladies his mother parades before him?Despite her station in life, Anna can’t seem to put these questions out of her mind. As the pieces fall into place around her, she how long will it be until her own secrets are revealed?Author's As you will have noticed, this book is referred to as “Episode One” which may sound like a slightly unusual subtitle for a book. The idea is that there will be six episodes per “season” of this story and I will keep writing it for as long as I have stories to tell in the Clifton Manor universe. I love reading books in the same way I watch TV shows—regular bursts of short, digestible content. This style is not for everyone, but I hope some of you like it and keep reading. I will be releasing episodes of Clifton Manor on a regular basis so you should never have to wait too long for you next fix.",
