  "title": "Only Children",
  "description": "Only Children is a provocative and candid memoir of a life filled with unexpected twists resulting from chance encounters. Opening in February 1955, the four-year old author recounts how he and his mother travelled by train from Calgary to Saskatcehwan to attend a family funeral. When they return home, a new boy comes to stay, but soon leaves, and the two don’t see one another for nearly forty years. Pat Buckna’s remarkable portrayal of his childhood in Calgary in the 1950’s and 1960's takes a surprising turn when, on holiday with his parents and a teenager, he watches his father confront a clerk in a grocery store who turns out to be his brother. That afternoon a young woman knocks on the door of their hotel room and introduces herself as his sister. As a teen, the author becomes entangled in a series of reckless encounters. He meets a girl on a bus and follows her to the boreal forest of Northern Quebec. He befriends an older married woman with children and becomes an ‘instant’ parent at twenty. One morning, he leaves his marriage and becomes Chris Miller, a country-music singer living in his van. On the road he meets a crazy woman from Oklahoma, gets arrested, then heads north to rebuild his life. The day after his mother dies, an uncle tells him a secret she has taken to her grave. After forty years the author reconnects with his older brother Gerry, the boy who had come to stay as a child. At Gerry’s funeral, an even more startling secret is revealed.Only Children will be of interested to anyone who grew up in western Canada in the 1950's and 1960's, people whose parent's withheld information about siblings or family. Pat's insights into relationships, coming-of-age, family and his own actions make for a fascinating exploration of an unique and event-filled life.",
