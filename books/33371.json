  "description": "Young Moon's father was Chinese on his mother’s side, and he could go on and on talking about the miraculous accomplishments of the great Chinese people. He said more than once that they were among the most blessed and privileged of nations. After all, they had dozens of astronauts -- yuhangyuans -- in orbit and on the Moon, and there was a small base on Mars, too, being built by robots. Even bigger stations -- the ring cities -- were planned.Young Moon used to get uncomfortable and wished he would lower his voice. Their walls were thin in Wonsan and school taught her that this kind of talk was treason. Teacher said the Dear Leader would know if you didn’t pay proper respect to the glories of the Homeland, and he could get very cross with you if he found out. Every screen was two-way and you never knew if someone was watching.All she wanted was to be left alone to talk to the visions in her drawings -- visions that came to warn her of impending danger. But a chance word spoken by an angry classmate would force Young Moon’s family to flee North Korea for China, where she would witness her father set in motion a world-shaking disaster of epic proportions.Be sure to read Book 2 in the Water Worlds young adult science fictions adventure \"Sami.\"And visit the Water Worlds Web",
