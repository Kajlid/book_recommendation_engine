Until his anonymous \"owner\" turns out to be far more—and far more male—than he counted on.Fellow FBI agent Scott Jamison has one chance to give his heart to the friend and teammate he's loved for years. He's even willing to bankrupt himself for just two days with Asher, and he'll pay any price for a piece of the man's heart.But Asher knows the price might be too high. A gay man in the FBI? Teammates who are also lovers? That sort of love could ruin careers and destroy friendships.Can Asher bear to out himself, or will Scott lose his one bid for love?",
