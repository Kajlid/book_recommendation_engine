  "title": "The Hooded Falcon",
  "description": "As the great black pirate ship bore down on them, Desmond O'Donald knew himself for an Englishman, a lover, and a pirate. All his doubts about excorting Lady Mary from their native West Indies to England were instantly stilled. Her beauty and his breeding told him he must see her to safety, by fair means or foul. And if he had to masquerade as a notorious pirate captain - risking the sword, the plank, and the felon's fate on the scaffold, he would risk all, like a gentleman. His wild past fitted him for his new role. Like the noble falcon hsi ship was named for, he swooped fiercely at his prey. But his desperate gamble led them ever deeper into danger before they could escape the power struggle raging in the bloody Caribean waters.",
