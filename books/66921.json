They are invisible spirits with the power to move stone, and no one knows why they are here. They can be the stone angel in your yard or the supporting pillar of your home. Shattered pieces of their statues have revealed nothing, for their souls simply move to another hiding place. Hers whispers a terrible warning. Time is running out.",
