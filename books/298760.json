  "description": "For Her Pleasure Evangeline Anderson Leita McLain runs a small solo asteroid mining outfit at the ass end of the Centauri solar system. She's had no luck in getting a man to stay with her so she decides to buy a Companion 2000, the very latest in cybernetic sex slaves. Pierce Branson is a man addicted to adventure. But when he finds himself with a bounty on his head for a crime he didn't commit, he knows he's got problems. During a shoot out in the Companion factory, Pierce hides in one of the packing crates. Next thing he knows he's waking up in Leita's bedroom and starting his new life-as a sex slave. But he doesn't count on falling in love with his new Mistress. Or on playing the part of her \"Master\" when Leita decides she wants to explore her kinky side. Now both Leita and Pierce have some choices to make. Leita knows she shouldn't let herself fall for a cybernetic sex slave and Pierce knows he ought to tell her the truth. But it may be too late for him to come clean even though everything he does is For Her Pleasure.",
