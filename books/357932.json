  "title": "Three Plays: The Fire Raisers / Andorra / Triptych",
  "description": "Three contentious and enduring plays about the clash of the individual and societyFire Raisers (1958) tells the tale of a respectable bourgeois whose house is one day visited by three strangers. It \"is successful on every level; the story is as gripping as an adventure story; each line is fraught with several meanings: as an allegory it is unique\" (Edna O'Brien); Andorra is based on the author's own experience of anti-semitism in Switzerland and is about Andri, a young man who is believed to be a Jew and who is persecuted by his community as a result; Triptych is a portrait of a writer grappling with his own mortality.The flexible and contemporary translations by Michael Bullock (The Fire Raisers, Andorra) and Geoffrey Skelton (Triptych) are here complemented by an introduction by Peter Loeffler.",
