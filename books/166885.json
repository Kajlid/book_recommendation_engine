  "description": "In the first in the series, Meg Darcy, a single, lonely, working-class dyke PI currently between cases, wonders how to seduce the attractive but aloof police detective Linquist (nicknamed The Ice Queen). The opportunity comes soon as their paths cross while each is investigating the grisly murders of homeless women whose bodies are being dumped in city cemeteries. Of course, the ultimate goal is being first to catch the killer, but is there also room for romance between two such fiercely competitive antagonists?",
