  "description": "Winter weather is keeping children from visiting the zoo. So the animals are out of sorts—listless, grumpy, and no longer fun. All except two little friends, a very small hippo and a baby kangaroo. Their hip-hopping, toe-tapping,  and rap-rocking soon has the other animals joining in the hip-aroo beat. \"Racoons danced in pairs, baboons danced in troops, and snakes joined the dancers as live hula-hoops.\" Children's favorite songs get a funny new spin—seals bark out \"The seals on the bus go round and round\"—as the animals create their very own musical.Young readers and listeners will be amazed and delighted at how the animals chase the winter doldrums by getting along as friends, pooling their talents, and pushing themselves to new heights. After all, these are the same clever animals who learned to read in Judy Sierra's and Marc Brown's Wild About Books , an award-winning New York Times #1 bestselling picture book. ZooZical is sure to inspire some \"can do\" fun in kindergarten and primary grades.From the Hardcover edition.",
