A chance to be something she never had the opportunity to be before: a lady--a woman with a good reputation. John Evans has never belonged in his small town. So when Eliza shows up and treats him better than anyone ever has, he's ready to marry her before she finds someone she'd rather be with. But she harbors a secret that makes someone like her unsuitable for marriage, and she is determined that no one will ever find out. Ever. Until someone from her past shows up... Then who is going to dare love a woman like her?",
