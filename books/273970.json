  "description": "It’s Roan O’Shea’s world and we’re just here for the ride. And what a ride it is…  After a lifetime of living in fear (and by other people’s rules), Roan’s determined to use his ill-gotten talents and money to turn the quaint, quiet town of Sanctuary Mills into his own little slice of heaven. Living under the alias Flynn Gallagher, Roan is on a mission to undo the evil of his past, and win the hearts of his new neighbors, by spreading his own brand of joy and light. But, just when Roan thinks he’s pulled off the ultimate con, an FBI agent, a murder, and a mystery threaten to expose his past and his intricate web of identities and secrets.  It takes a special breed of criminal, and a massive set of steel-plated testicles, to pull off a Ponzi scheme targeting organized crime’s heaviest hitters. Agent Sherman Mathis has spent months hunting for Cillian McGregor, and every lead has been a dead end. Except Flynn Gallagher. The jet-setting wine enthusiast and blogger is the only victim of McGregor’s baffling scam who isn’t dead, in jail, or slammed a door in Sherman’s face, but he’s not the perfect source our agent was hoping for, once they finally meet. Sherman’s hopes for a lead vanish immediately and he begins to suspect Flynn is hiding something deeper and bigger than McGregor.   A small town like Sanctuary Mills should be child’s play for a master strategist and showman like Roan, but he learns the stakes are higher when his heart starts calling the shots. This time, he’s got his sights set on the ultimate prize and Roan won’t rest until he’s won Sherman’s trust, and his heart. He’s just got to solve a murder, come clean, and flip a Federal Agent.  Flipped is a sequel to Snatched and can be read alone but will contain many Snatched spoilers!",
