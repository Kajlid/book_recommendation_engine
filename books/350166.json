  "description": "H. P. Lovecraft is the most important and influential horror writer of the twentieth century. His stories of occult nightmare and cosmic terror have drawn praise from William S. Burroughs, Angela Carter and Jorge Luis Borges and continue to inspire new generations of writers and artists.John Coulthart is one of H. P. Lovecraft's major visual interpreters. As an artist for David Britron's Lord Horror series, his work has been described as \"shocking…harmful\", \"harrowing\" and \"brilliant\" and has been banned on the grounds of obscenity by British law courts.This collection presents all of Coulthart's Lovecraft-inspired work from the past decade including two complete comic strip adaptationsThe Haunter of the Dark and The Call of Cthulhuover thirty pages of previously unseen drawings and paintings plus selections from the controversial Lord Horror series Hard Core Horror and Reverbstorm, which have been evolving Lovecraftian imagery in bold new directions.Material specially created for this volume includes The Great Old Ones, a kabbalah of Lovecraft's gods with accompanying evocations by Alan Moore, author of Watchmen, V for Vendetta, From Hell and many other graphic novel classics.",
