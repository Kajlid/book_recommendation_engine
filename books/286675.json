When she is caught in an unsanctioned bank robbery in my territory, only my reputation protects her.She should have stayed away.Instead, she charges back into my life like a shining beacon in my otherwise bleak existence. She has no place in my world where hardened criminals toy with the lives of the innocent.A better man would let her go — again.There’s no white picket fence in life with a Bellandi, and she deserves so much more. I pushed her away once, but now that she’s back I won’t let anything else come between us.Not even Ivory herself.Bloodied Hands is a full-length standalone novel with an HEA, but the series presents a better reading experience when following the suggested order. This series contains dark elements, including an over-the-top antihero who does as he pleases. Please read at your own discretion.",
