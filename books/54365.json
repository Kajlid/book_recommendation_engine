  "description": "Amelia Bedelia has never been camping. She tries her best to do as the Rogers order, but pitching a tent is not the same as throwing it into the bushes, and catching a fish with bare hands does not mean keeping. Tent stakes are not the same as tent-shaped steaks. Starting a fire on the grill may take a match more than pine cones and coffee grounds. Shhh for sleeping bags.",
