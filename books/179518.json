They set out on a journey with some of their Angel Pack friends to find a way to break the bond, but the spell they need is known by only one living witch, the mysterious Zane. Along the way they meet some new allies and enemies. When Adam takes it upon himself to follow a lead and goes missing, Viktor turns to his friends to help him find his mate and bring him home safely. A new witch in town stirs up trouble as she tries to snag one of the mated wolves as her own and Alpha mate Jesse leaves the pack to find a way to deal with his newfound powers. Viktor tries to save Adam in time and bring him home where he belongs.
