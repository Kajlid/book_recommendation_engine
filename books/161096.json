  "description": "Annie: I've been the good girl too long. I don't drink, don't smoke, and live at home with my preacher father. The most daring thing I've ever done is work part-time at the library. Rule-breakers and lawless men aren't part of my world but not doing doesn’t mean I haven’t thought about it. And every fantasy I’ve ever had is promising to come true if I just take a chance. Easy:The moment I laid eyes on Annie, I knew she was the one for me and Michigan. We've been partners ever since we served and now we do everything together. And by everything I mean riding, drinking, and women. If we can get Annie on board, it'll be perfect. Not only do I have to convince Annie, though, I need to convince Michigan, too. Michigan: Easy seems to think sweet, delectable Annie's just going to fall into our laps. But my one experience with a preacher’s daughter left me scarred—emotionally and physically. A good girl like Annie wants to experience a little danger but she doesn’t want to live it and I’m not going all in unless this is for the long haul.Three hearts are on a collision course. They will either be ruined or remade.In the small town of Fortune, the Death Lords rule the roads. Come along for the ride.",
