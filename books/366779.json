  "description": "For twenty-three years Sam has lived an ordinary life in Seattle with his mother, sister, and friends. But after a romance with his girlfriend ends in tragedy, Sam escapes to New Mexico in hopes of finding adventure and leaving his past, family, and friends a distant memory. In Albuquerque, a place filled with sun and blue skies and where he is a stranger, Sam meets Lola, an angel-obsessed woman with secrets of her own, who invites him to be a part of her close-knit circle. Below Sunlight is a gripping, and sometimes funny, story of addiction, lust, sorrow, and the burden dark secrets carry.",
