  "description": "When you look at a man’s past, who he is makes sense. Things previously shrouded become clear, and the airs of mystery that once clung so tightly to him, begin to fade away until all that is left is the being he hid like a dark secret.Elish’s beginnings did not start out with a bang, but inside of a peaceful home far from the savage realities of the greywastes. But like all things in the Fallocaust, the peace didn’t last. One can be sheltered from the monsters of the dead world, but you can never escape the demon who hides under the mask of a smiling king.Because in the end, reality is a beast that cares not for the perfect images it shatters, or the world it devours piece by piece. But reality can also strengthen, it can light you on fire, burn you to cinders, and then watch proudly as the phoenix rises from the ashes, stronger than it ever was before.However, underneath each feather there is a scar, and though blood pumps hot through his veins, it is from a heart cold and closed off.But it didn’t start out that way, quite the opposite.And this is his story.",
