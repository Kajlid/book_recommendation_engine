He's back in his hometown to recover from injuries and is glad that sweet, easy-to-talk-to Tess will be his physiotherapist. But the last thing he expects is that she'll ask for a trade: she'll heal him if he'll bed her!Turns out inexperienced Tess wants to explore her sexual side. Travis is happy to comply--she's incredibly desirable and doesn't even know it. But when a fellow marine sets his sights on Travis's new recruit, he realizes that sexually liberating Tess may have been a tactical error. And he'll need all his seductive skills to make sure she's signing up for a permanent post in his bed--and no one else's!",
