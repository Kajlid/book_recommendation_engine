It’s open season on other players.The man who usurped the world chose Toby to be the champion of this cause, despite his lack of knowledge of game… or perhaps because of it.

Their game, their reputation, and their very company are on the line. With Toby’s help they take up the challenge and fight to reclaim their world.",
