  "description": "Kareena is understandably nervous on her wedding night, when she will make love to her husband for the first time - but at least she knows her parents have chosen well. Samir is goodlooking, gentle and considerate - and, although she's met him only a few times, Kareena is confident she will grow to love him. But Samir has a secret. A secret in the shapely form of Cloey whom he's been dating for the past six years. Cloey isn't prepared to give up her man - or, more importantly, his bank balance without a fight. And she's prepared to fight very dirty indeed. Kareena, however, is not the timid little Indian bride Cloey had expected her to be. In fact, Cloey might just have met her match.",
