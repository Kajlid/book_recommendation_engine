  "description": "Legends have long told of the powerful, mysterious creatures that are half human and half fish. This scrapbook is a collection of writings and \"evidence\" from Aunt Lydia. The four mermaid figures bundled with the book represent the four types of mermaids that can be found all over the world: the frequently spotted shipsavers; the wishgivers who help those in trouble; the shapeshifters who whimsically enter and exit the human world; and the weatherworks mermaids who bargain with humans for favors. Plenty of \"factual\" information is included.",
