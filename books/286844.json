Unfortunately, Chiaki's attraction to Yosuke is thwarted by her own insecurity and the scheming of other girls--especially her twin sister Saya!Although Yosuke seems out of Chiaki's league, she would do anything to give him a massage. The two eventually strike up a deal in which she will be allowed to touch his back if she can make him fall in love with her. What Chiaki doesn't know is the real reason Yosuke wants to hang around her: to avenge his younger brother, who was allegedly deceived and dumped by somebody named Chiaki Togu!",
