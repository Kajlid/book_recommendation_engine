  "description": "Mr. Putter can’t imagine why anyone would need to know one hundred ways to cook beans. His neighbor Mrs. Teaberry can, and she says a cooking class will be something new and fun for them to do. Mr. Putter isn’t so sure—he’d much rather think about an ice cream soda than all those beans. But Mrs. Teaberry has a way of talking him into things. It turns out that learning one hundred ways to cook beans might be more exciting than Mr. Putter ever expected. With his cat, Tabby, and Mrs. Teaberry’s dog, Zeke, at the class with them, everything takes a chaotic turn when Zeke bites into something surprising—and beans go flying!",
