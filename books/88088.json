  "description": "She survived Earth's worst global pandemic. In the city she learned how to cope with the roaming dead. Tucked away in the mountains she struck down the living who tried to kill her. Now Riley fights a new battle - the one within herself. Wracked with survivor's guilt and an almost crazed sense of duty that takes her out of the solitude of the Southern California mountains and into the heart of Orange County, she makes a series of choices that can lead to the destruction of everything she's managed to save. In the end, will it all be worth it? What will be lost? What will be found? And which questions will be left unanswered?",
