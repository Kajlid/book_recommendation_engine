  "description": "Diabolical, deliberate seduction takes some planning...and maybe a little dark magic. David Barrett, the Earl of Dunreith, has a reputation for being calm, cool and distant. He's the last man anyone would think would compromise a young woman, but he has his reasons--not to mention a very wicked secret he carefully hides from the world. Victoria Caldwell isn't exactly sure how it happened, but all of a sudden her world is upside down. Apparently the man she's always viewed as a mild-mannered friend is instead a passionate lover, capable of luring her into wild, wanton behavior. Even more bewildering, she finds out nothing about David is as it seems and the enigma both intrigues and frightens her. Is he the intelligent, even-tempered man she's known for years, or something else entirely? As the past starts to play havoc with the future, both David and Victoria find a single pivoting decision can summon up all forms of demons, if even if the choice is one made for love...",
