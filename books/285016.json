Most of their memories have been locked away since in Siele only good memories are allowed to provide the inhabitants with the most blissful existence. Sam’s bliss, however, doesn’t last long because some forbidden memories come back to him. Memories of Cara, his older sister.  He can’t remember much of her, only her face, her voice and how close they were as children. His parents, however, can’t remember her at all. So, Sam goes looking for his sister but, in his search, he comes across a cliff so high that he cannot see where it ends. Ceolim—the god of Siele—convinces him Cara is down there and that he must jump. Gullible and wanting to see his sister again, Sam jumps off the cliff—  And falls straight into a land festered with chaos and plagued with monsters, where humans are the bottom of the food chain. This place is Krenuo. In Earthen words:  Hell.  Down here, Sam loses contact with Ceolim and must ally with demons, learn to use magic and fight human-eating monsters, all to cross Krenuo and reach Cara.  All to find the truth.\"   Krenuo's Children is a fast-paced thrill-filled YA Dark Fantasy Adventure novel with a unique magic system based on death.",
