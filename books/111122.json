  "description": "Vincent is a werewolf desperately clinging to his humanity. Formerly a prowler who tracked and killed werewolves across the country, he lives alone in the woods, an outsider to his pack. But when a case of mistaken identity leaves him poisoned with silver, he’s forced to accept help from the prowler who wounded him. To make matters worse, only his pack holds the key to breaking his fever and ensuring his ultimate survival. Logan is a prowler drawn to the isolated town of Pinechester when a series of suspicious deaths are reported. Confident the threat has been neutralized, he’s taken by surprise when bloodied Vincent saves him from an attacking werewolf. As the full moon rises, he learns that Pinechester is harboring a dangerous secret. But he will need Vincent’s help – and the help of ex-girlfriend Anna - to uncover the truth and defeat the deadliest enemy they have ever known.",
