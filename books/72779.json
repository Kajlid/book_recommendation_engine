  "title": "Israel: An Echo of Eternity",
  "description": "Israel \"the promised land,\" the \"holy land,\" has long played a central role in Jewish and Christian thought. Now, in the closing few years of the twentieth century, politics and prophesy coincide. The Israeli-Arab peace process unfolds; messianic concepts of the role of Israel at the millennium and the end of days are receiving great attention. In An Echo of Eternity , one of the foremost religious figures of our century gives us a powerful and eloquent statement on the meaning of Israel in our time. Heschel looks at the past, present, and future home of the Jewish people. He tells us how and why the presence of Israel has tremendous historical and religious significance for the whole world. This classic, originally published in 1967 by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, is now updated with an important introduction by Susannah Heschel, his daughter, who holds the Abba Hillel Silver Chair in Jewish Studies at Case Western Reserve University. Illustrated with line drawings by Abraham Rattner.",
