Mathewson comes the first book in the EMS series…For readers who enjoy romantic comedies, men in uniform, and love to laugh, cry, and read a story about two people who belong together…Joe and Eric, the EMT crew of Echo 17, have been best friends since they were eight years old. They've been through a lot together over the years, but nothing like what they're about to experience.When a routine call goes wrong, everything changes and in one moment, Eric realizes just how close he came to losing the one thing that matters to him. He’s done playing games, done watching Joe risk her life, and he’s going to do whatever it takes to get the stubborn woman off the truck even if that means losing her forever.There was only one problem with that plan.Joe, or Josephine to those who wanted to annoy her, loved her job, loved what she did, and had absolutely no plans on leaving. She doesn’t care what Eric says, she’s not going anywhere and the sooner that he realized that, the sooner she could go back to pretending that everything was fine.",
