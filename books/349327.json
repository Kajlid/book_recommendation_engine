The moment he sees Jane on the arm of another man, he wants to possess her, body and soul. - Educating… Antonio is well aware that Jane is determined to keep their sexual relationship temporary, but he has other plans. Within hours of their first meeting, he introduces her to his best friend, and together they set out to unleash her inner submissive. - Reinventing… Jane’s weekend of heady sexual freedom is drawing to a close. She arrives at the final event, a masquerade ball, escorted by her masters, then discovers that the party isn’t the only item on their agenda.
