  "description": "Here is a story in which the magic catches you from the very first page. This, you feel, could happen. The wild, solitary country, the trout stream, the rowan berries, the mist in which a man can so naturally disappear, all are real and yet a part of the mystery. And the boy, Dougal, standing in the middle of it all, strong, sturdy and carefree; busy, while his parents were away, looking after the goat, making his porridge, fishing for his supper, and taking a great delight in being on his own, free to do what he liked.It was the trout stream that led him to the source of his adventure though there had been already perhaps a hint of something out of the ordinary in the coming of the stranger with the grey eyes and the love of sharing: who came and went so silently and always, if Dougal wanted company, came again.",
