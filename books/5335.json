  "description": "Perhaps one of the only books to have received a tip of the hat from publications as diverse as \"Ms.\" and \"Screw\", Dirty Plotte was for eight years a forum for Julie Doucet's irrepressible comics. These intensely-drawn strips explore some of Doucet's deepest and most bizarre fantasies: from masturbation with cookies (given to her by her mother, of course!), to various unlikely scenarios of her life as a man. In later issues, Doucet explored more complex themes: these stories of love, passion, and seemingly endless cycles of bad relationships are told with an unflinching candor and honesty and drawn with Doucet's characteristic eye for obsessive detail.",
