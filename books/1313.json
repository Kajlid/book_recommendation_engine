After her dad stops communicating with her, she’s convinced he thinks the marriage is a bad idea as well.What’s a girl to do? After the first day in her new home Rowan knows her step-dad is hiding something. If only she can dig up this yummy dirt, break up the marriage, and get herself back to her dad’s grave. Caught between a ghost of a father and a father haunted by ghosts, Rowan will either heal herself for good or tear apart her new family forever.",
