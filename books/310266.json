  "description": "Nadia is a successful business woman, who knows what she wants and knows how to get it. She works for Matt, and his magnetic personality is not easy to endure. The sexual chemistry is intense, and their relationship works as a gradual experimental journey, that goes deeper and deeper into their fantasies, and the exploration of their feelings and boundaries.This story works like a TV series, not a movie. It’s the story of Nadia, her friends, her views, and the way she learns, explores, experiments, fails, changes her mind. It’s Matt’s story too, because they do this together, learn together, find new ways together. There’s love, complicated relationships, vanilla, BDSM, ménages, voyeurism, role-play. It’s slow burn, but it gets hotter and hotter, there’s plot and smut. No cliffhanger.",
