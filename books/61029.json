  "description": "Gabriel James never imagined he would fall in love, didn’t believe it possible, until he met Melissa. Melissa Martin changed him, transformed his life completely and caused him to feel as he never had before. He never dreamed his origins would put her at risk and ultimately threaten her life. He never thought he would have to leave and endure the pain of losing her. To ensure her safety, he made a deal with his creator, Dr. Franklin Terzini, to disappear and take with him incriminating evidence that implicated the geneticist in the embezzlement of genetic material and human cloning. In exchange for her safety, he was forced to disappear to a remote location and never return to Harbingers Falls again.When Gabriel left Harbingers Falls five months earlier, he thought he’d lost everything. He believed he had no choice but to exist in a world without the only person he had ever loved, the only person that had ever loved him. He soon discovers, however, that his suffering has been in vain, that leaving Harbingers Falls was a horrible mistake. He unearths vital evidence that suggests Melissa is in danger and that Dr. Terzini has not upheld his end of their agreement. He suspects that old enemies have come back to pursue her, that their missions have been resurrected.Gabriel must race against time and travel to Harbingers Falls to save Melissa from the evil that is closing in all around her. He returns to find that things are far different than what he originally thought.
