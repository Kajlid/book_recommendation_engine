  "title": "The Hammer Commission",
  "description": "Mark Levin is an investigator for one of the oldest organizations in Europe, the Catholic Church's secret 'Hammer Commission'. Founded by Pope Pius the Third in the fifteen century the members of the Commission work to hunt down devils, demons, and other evil creatures as well as the people who summon them to Earth. After centuries of hard and often deadly work the Commission members have begun to believe that this particular battle in the never ending war between Heaven and Hell might finally be won, until Mark and his partner are ambushed at a warehouse in Paris by a devil thought too big and too powerful to be summoned in these modern times.Suddenly things are no longer as they were, other teams are being attacked and even killed, devils are appearing in places thought impossible, and they all seem to have a goal in common: killing Mark. And to make matters worse Mark is starting to lose faith in his own organization, whom he thinks may also want him dead, and from which he has been keeping his own secrets.",
