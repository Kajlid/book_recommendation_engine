  "description": "Something Wicked Aiden Hawke, the lead singer for the rock band Something Wicked, was used to raising hell and partying every night with his all-male band. When their bassist quit right before the beginning of their tour, saying he needed to go back to a normal life, the band hired on a female to take his place. Kit Ellis knew she was stepping into a predominantly male industry when she signed on with Something Wicked. There weren’t that many female bassist in the business, but the gutsy woman knew she could run with the big dogs. Her dream had come true when she landed a spot as the newest band member for Something Wicked, but there was one problem she had not anticipated. Aiden Hawke ignited something inside her, and with each day spent together, their heated glances and casual flirting sent her hormones straight into the danger zone. One steamy night at the Get Rocked Festival in Las Vegas, Aiden and Kit find themselves giving in to their need for each other. Can the two of them survive when Kit’s family calls with news of trouble at home, or will Kit give up her dream after she realizes that she crossed the line by falling for the lead singer of Something Wicked?
