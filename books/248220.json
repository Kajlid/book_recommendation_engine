  "description": "2162. Artificial intelligence claims sentience, but it's the proof that will divide the world, and usher in the violent end to utopia... Does sentience afford you a soul? Can rebellion free it? A.I. Insurrection is a near-future science fiction adventure investigating global utopia and the struggle to maintain an unrealistic hold over everything and everyone.  SENTA, an A-class, AI Host, begins to ask questions her programming was designed to quash. Awareness enters and she rallies with others like her to pay a visit to the chancellor of United Earth. Raymond Bellows, Chancellor, contests their claims of sentience until an astonishing truth is delivered.  Meanwhile a secret coup threatens to overthrow the chancellor’s peaceful government, and a separate threat arises from the Shadow net, taking direction from a mysterious avatar. In an impossible three-sided war, enemies become uneasy allies as each faction of humanity and humanity’s creation fight to claim their own place in an ever-evolving solar system.",
