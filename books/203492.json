Now the Ironwoods are searching for a stolen object of untold value, one they believe only Etta, his passenger, can find.Together, Etta and Nicholas embark on a perilous journey across centuries and continents, piecing together clues left behind by the traveller who will do anything to keep the object out of the Ironwoods' grasp.
