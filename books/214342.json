  "description": "Everson Croft here, professor of mythology and behind-the-scenes wizard.Show me an amateur conjurer, and I’ll stop him before he gets himself killed.That’s the idea, anyway. But New York City isn’t what it used to be, and I don’t mean the recent crash.Amateur casters are calling up creatures they shouldn’t be able to. And there’s been a murder at the city’s most hallowed cathedral, a message in blood on the victim’s back the NYPD wants me to interpret, like yesterday.Something tells me I’m in over my head. And that’s not just Chinatown’s newest mob boss, a scary-powerful vampire, or my possessed cat talking.No matter how much magic I hurl, worse keeps chasing bad, and I’m amassing enemies like they’re aluminum cans.Did I mention the end of the world might be nigh?Damn. Maybe I’m the amateur here.",
