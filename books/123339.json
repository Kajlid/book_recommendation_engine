  "description": "She needs me, because she needs money. I don’t need her. Just her complete submission…Maybell Jacobs is the Wallflower: quiet, shy, socially awkward and hell-bent on hiding even from herself, that is until a chance encounter takes place between us.Instantly she hates me and for good reason. I'm a walking-red-flag. Filthy rich jock, short tempered, and violent. I can have anyone and anything I want.. except her.Little does she know her disgust, anger, and hate for me fuels my obsession to own her, completely in every single way. Maybell resists, predictably... but her fight only makes her more desirable and I have plans that will lead her right into my lap and never want to leave. When she joins the sinful tradition put on by the elite of the town, the Hunt, I’m shocked. The pretty little thing has no idea how much danger she’s in if she decides to become my prey.Sweet, innocent, and fragile like a flower. I'll have to be careful or risk breaking her. Because I’m the ultimate predator and when I play there are no rules. I don’t chase. I capture.And I like to own my bait.★ Tropes include: secret society, college, touch her and die, CNC & chasing bait fantasy ★",
