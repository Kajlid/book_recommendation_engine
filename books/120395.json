  "description": "Mary Magdalene over the ages has been maligned and misunderstood. Thankfully history has once again been proven wrong. My Greatest Love, My Greatest Sorrow is a channeled book through one of the top intuitives in the United States Johanna Carroll. This book is a close intimate account of Mary's personal relationship with Jesus and the commitment she made to him and their spiritual work together. Controversial in nature, yet written with tremendous love and warmth you will feel Mary standing by your side just as she did with the author while she scribed this story. This divine couple is the ultimate partnership we all seek and this book shows you how.",
