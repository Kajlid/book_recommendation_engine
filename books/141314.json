  "description": "The Short: Dirty Little Freaks is the story of Jade Daniels, a tough girl full of secret dreams and desires who learns that sometimes the biggest walls need to be torn down in order to build something beautiful from the ruins. A punk rock story about lust, love, and all the naughty bits in between. The Long: Meet Jade Daniels, she hates her name, hates her life and hates people in general. She loves sex, loves her roommate, and loves her secret obsession, learning. Now she loves a guy with a stunning green mohawk, lickable abs and a mind as filthy as hers. Hush crashes into her carefully constructed world of sex, drugs and music with his gorgeous tattooed body and sexual demands. Jade is happy... But Jade learned long ago that nothing but misery lasts forever, and happiness is fleeting at best. Or is it? The Warning: ***Rated 18+ Please understand that this book is full of swearing and sex and drugs. I don’t control what my characters do or think, so don’t shoot me off a bunch of angry emails because you got fired for reading it at work, or God is going to smite you for laughing, or you caught your husband jerking it to the sex scenes. This is also a work of fiction. Seriously, dude. If you feel compelled to have casual, unprotected sex or shove coke up your ass because you read about it somewhere, frealz, you need help. Unprotected sex often leads to gross diseases and even worse, babies. And yeah, drugs are bad…mmkay? So, I guess that about covers it",
