But when a strong current sweeps Bonnie and her friends past their appointed campsite, depositing them instead on what the boatman calls a \"forbidden island,\" they're just happy to have reached dry land.Overnight, things take a turn for the worse. Three torturous days pass, but the boatman doesn't return, and what once seemed like a vacation in paradise becomes a battle against the elements.Peppered with short, frantic entries from Bonnie's journal as she struggles to survive, Lost Girls tells the page-turning, heart-pounding story of a group of teen girls fighting for their lives.",
