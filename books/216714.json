  "description": "Daniel Beauchamp realised his error before the day was out but his real mistake was to ignore his father’s caution. May 1862, hopes of a quick victory in America’s civil war have perished with the losses at Shiloh. Across the Atlantic, it has been six months since the Trent crisis that almost dragged Britain into the same abyss. The architect of the peace is dead and the nation is in mourning. Before he died, the so-called peacemaker devised a stratagem to punish the Federal government for its blatant aggression and it has fallen to an organisation that calls itself ‘The Club' to continue his work. If all goes to plan, the political map of the world will be changed irrevocably. Except that secrets are hard to keep and rumours of Britain’s duplicity have already reached Washington. An expatriate Virginian living in London has been ordered by the head of the US Secret Service to find out what the British are plotting. And stop them. By any means. Daniel Beauchamp is on a mission to warn his father’s associates that their lives are in danger. He also carries a letter which could destroy the British way of life. A further complication is that Daniel stands accused of murder by an old foe from Scotland Yard who burns with hatred. Wanted by the police, hunted by Federal agents and scandalised by his association with the beautiful and wilful Matilda Adams, Daniel is in a race to find the real killers and clear his name. But the men he seeks are not the sort of people to be taken alive.",
