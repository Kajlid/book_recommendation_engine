  "description": "A world where humans wander, drugged and lulled by electronic bliss. Where quick sex is best, where people would rather burn themselves alive than endure. A dying world of no children, no art, no reading. Where some still refuse to surrender. And love is the only hope.A strange love triangle. Spofforth, the most perfect machine ever created, whose only wish is to die. Paul and Mary Lou, whose passion for each other is the only future.A haunting novel, reverberating with anguish. That beats with the force of life. And celebrates joy and love, the strength of hope, the force of the word, and the magic of a dream.",
