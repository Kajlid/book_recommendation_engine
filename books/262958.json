  "description": "The twenty stories collected here transmit the same intense charges of intellect and emotion that characterize Carroll's longer works. Among the many pleasures \"Friend's Best Man\" - An award-winning story about a dog that teaches its owner the real and very frightening meaning of \"The Animal Kingdom.\" \"Black Cocktail\" - A short novel about a high-school kid who never grew up - literally. \"The Sadness of Detail\" - What are we to do when contacted by angels? What are we to do when one makes an offer we can't refuse? \"A Flash in the Pants\" - Original to this volume - a story about a beautiful stranger and a house that remembers all too well its previous owners.",
