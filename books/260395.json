  "description": "Though the modern world has given us many benefits and privileges, it has also burdened us with constant stimulation and endless expectations. Feeling overwhelmed, we become distracted from our life's purpose. Because we have lost our path, we feel emotionally, physically, and spiritually imbalanced - and this has left many of us stressed and anxious. In The Stressless Brain, I detail the importance of building a relationship with yourself through the use of Kundalini Meditation. By incorporating yogic technology into your life, you can learn to govern your thoughts and emotions in a mindful manner. Meditation offers you the tools to view your life with clarity so that you can respond, rather than react, to stressful situations. Bridging the worlds of yogic meditation, psychology, and science, The Stressless Brain will help you thoroughly understand stress and anxiety and how it affects your entire body, mind, and soul. Whether you are experiencing mental hardships from your professional, personal, or romantic life, my objective is for you to find answers within yourself and make any necessary changes - all through the regular practice of meditation. If you feel powerless, then I hope the yogic insight and meditational instructions provided in this book can give you the strength to harness your mind and teach it to best serve you. Using Kundalini Meditation, you can find the courage to self-reflect so that you can self-correct.",
