  "description": "In the wake of a zombie apocalypse, Charlotte finds the family cabin to be the perfect place to make life work. With the use of aging equipment she used to think of simply as antiques, as well as the lessons on gardening, fishing, harvesting, cooking, and canning that she'd simply thought to be amusing stories imparted to her by her grandparents when she was a child, she falls into a steady daily routine of working toward not only surviving her current existence, but being fully prepared for making it through the coming winter as well.Yet despite knowing they were out there somewhere, from the news brought by the occasional traveller, she finds herself unprepared for the unannounced arrival of one undead creature at her cabin - and entirely unready for the truth it brings along with it.",
