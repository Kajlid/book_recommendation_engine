Please see 'The Disenchanted Soldier' for the latest version on this story.Libby was fascinated by the stories surrounding Daniel, by this man who looked down at her from the aged black and white photos on the walls some seventy years after his death. His story seemed inextricably linked to pioneering New Zealand and she wanted to know more.To know what he was really like: his hopes, his dreams, his desires and his secrets. She was certain there were secrets.It’s 1863 when 21 year old Daniel, a trained soldier embarks on an adventure of a lifetime, in pursuit of a new life, of land, and to shrug off his past. Crossing the oceans to New Zealand to fight an unknown enemy, Daniel wins a medal for his efforts. Yet, he is soon disillusioned by war, by its violence and cruelty, its emptiness changes his life forever. Eventually, he finds happiness and heartache in equal measure with his great love, Emma, a young Prussian girl, building their life together in Foxton.Libby was not disappointed. Daniel’s story was more than she had hoped for – a life of adversity and sadness, of success and happiness. His legacy is unforgettable.",
