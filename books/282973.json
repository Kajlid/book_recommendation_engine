  "description": "My people collected--(Captured.)--all the bi-pedal inhabitants of a small blue planet in a galaxy that was quite a journey from our own star system.Tender-skinned and intelligent, these new aliens make interesting pets. Fascinating, actually. And when the rest of the universe realizes this, everybody wants to own one.Therefore, we need these new aliens to breed.It’s my job to assist the aliens in reproducing… by whatever means I deem necessary.**Note: this is a 20K Short Story Gothic Horror-ish/Science Fiction Romance. This is a deviation from my other stories, pretty absent of humor. Honestly, it’s a little messed up. This is not where you’ll find your Christmas cheer this year… unless you’re a little twisted too. Trigger warnings for those who could be triggered by triggerish material. 18+. Important word of advice: Do NOT read this story while swimming. Not because it has anything at all to do with water--it doesn’t--but because your e-reading device could be damaged. (You’re welcome.)",
