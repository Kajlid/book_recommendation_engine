  "description": "A woman with the desire to heal. A lord with a shameful secret. And a contract that binds them together.  Wishing to follow in her father's footsteps, EVELYN PROCTEN has always tended to those in need. Despite social convention, the only future Evelyn can see for herself is that of a doctor…until she is called to Farnworth Manor to tend to the young viscount's sister, who finds herself unmarried and with child. Unfortunately, her stay at Farnworth Manor once again throws Evelyn into the path of Lord Ashwood, a man she has loved from a distance for many years. A man who has never looked at her twice. A man who disapproves of her professional ambition.  As far as society is concerned, RICHARD DAVENPORT, VISCOUNT ASHWOOD, is a cold-hearted and uncaring man. Although he does not overly care for society's opinion of him, he cannot deny that there is truth in their assessment. Nevertheless, Richard knows his duty and would never act against propriety. However, the whispers retreat into the background when his unmarried sister reveals to him that she is with child. Determined to maintain her secret, Richard keeps her locked away at Farnworth Manor. Still, in order to ensure his sister's well-being, he is forced to call upon the one woman who has always been able to melt the ice from his heart.  Will he be able to resist her? Or will he succumb to her tender heart and share with her the one secret that has always determined his life?    \"To say I loved Oppressed & Empowered is an understatement. It had all the right facets of a perfect historical romance – angst, mystery, danger, awakening love and happiness found. I was just sad to see it come to an end.\"- Rural Reader, Amazon Review  \"This book is based on a brilliant idea that forces one (very gently) to look at things through someone else's eyes, to feel what they feel emotionally and to understand, in a small way, what it is like to have Asperber's Syndrome and what it is like to live with someone with this syndrome. I truly loved everything about this story. \"- Zena, Amazon Review  \"Bree doesn’t disappoint! She addresses issues without hesitation! Lady physicals, unmarried pregnancy, and more. I loved this tale of Evelyn and Richard. 2 souls that cry out to us! Bree does a stellar job again. I read it in one day, thank you for your wonderful way with words.\"- FELICITY, Amazon Review    Also check out Bree's A Forbidden Love Novella Series which is FREE with Kindle Unlimited!",
