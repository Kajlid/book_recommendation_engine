  "description": "Not so long ago, two carefree 18-year-olds hitchhiked across a country of wide-open highways and wide-open people. Ride with them on this nostalgic look back at \"America of the Big Heart.\" It was 1961, before the deaths of JFK and MLK, before Vietnam. IndieReader calls their adventure out of adolescence into the beginning of responsibility: \"A must read not only for the baby boomer generation, but great commentary on friendship, mental illness and, ultimately, the road towards redemption.\"",
