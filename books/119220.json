  "description": "For dog trainer and search-and-rescue volunteer Raine Stockton the last few months have been marked by murder, danger, and betrayal. A luxury vacation to the Caribbean resort island of St. Bart’s sounds like the perfect antidote for stress, particularly since it includes three of her favorite traveling companions: boyfriend Miles, his daughter Melanie, and Raine’s happy-go-lucky golden retriever Cisco. But even in paradise, trouble finds them.  An American actress has suffered a fatal diving accident, and someone close to Miles appears to have been involved. As more and more people from Miles’s past surface, he and Raine are drawn reluctantly into a murder investigation. Raine, far more comfortable in her native North Carolina mountains than in this foreign culture surrounded by the baffling behavior of the rich and famous, is at a distinct disadvantage. But Raine faces her worst fears when someone she loves goes missing, and she is forced to navigate unfamiliar terrain in an alien land to track down a killer. And this time, even Cisco can’t help her.",
