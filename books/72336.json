  "description": "So you wanna run?OK, then let’s run. But it’s not going to be easy and this no nonsense program is not for the faint of heart. If you want to run with us, you can’t be a punk! Running a marathon is not for the weak bodied or for the fragile spirited. The physical part of running is only a small portion of how far you can go. It’s your mind that will carry you past the physical obstacles. You will feel pain during your training, but it’s just weakness leaving the body. Don’t cry. Just push through it and stop whining! If you want to earn that 26.2 bumper sticker, this book will help you get it, but don’t think you won’t be pushed out of your comfort zone. Comfort is the thief of progress. We don’t want to rob you of your progress, so we’ll make sure you are anything but comfortable. You may be in pain and you may be tired, but if you stick with it, you’ll be glad you did. There’s nothing quite like knowing you’ve accomplished a feat that makes you part of an elite group. It’s not every day someone runs 26.2 miles. Written by a 12 year Army veteran who trained soldiers to get fit, you won't find any sissy stuff here. We concentrate on diet, choosing the proper clothing, training, and most important: mental discipline.So, if you’re truly ready, grab your sneakers, your water bottle and this book to get started. Stay motivated, and stay disciplined. It’s all worth it when you cross that finish line. Besides, no one likes a quitter.",
