  "description": "A heart-stopping, provocative story about lust and love. Who needs a white picket fence anyway?  Happily ever after—what a joke! I tried that once and ended up divorced. Now, I only want one thing from men. Charlie Nelson is good at giving me that one thing. Really, really good. So good, in fact, I discovered a new side of myself. I never knew I liked to watch until I saw his talented hands touching someone else. I never knew I liked to be watched until I felt his searing gaze on me. Maybe happily ever after isn’t always a white picket fence, wedding bells, and 2.5 kids. Maybe it’s something a bit more…unconventional.",
