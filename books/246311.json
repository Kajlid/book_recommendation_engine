  "title": "Absurdimals: Lola Goes to School",
  "description": "The Absurdimals are a group of hybrid animals here to shake up our perception of normal! They represent the changing faces of our society and encourage children to embrace individuality. In this book, Lola the Belephant goes to school for the first time and finds out she's not quite the same as the other animals. After feeling like an outsider, Lola learns that there is no such thing as being too different, there is only new-different. In accepting and loving herself for who she is, Lola inspires other \"normal\" animals to come forward, and embrace their own perceived absurdities, too!",
