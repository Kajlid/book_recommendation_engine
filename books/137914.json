I moved far from home, away from everyone I know and love to avoid having to reveal my Gift…a Gift so strong it scares me.

But worst of all, I have to face Caine, a man I have loved for as long as I can remember, who just doesn’t feel the same way about me.Somehow, Caine and I find ourselves in the middle of investigating the mysterious disappearances of other Gifted people. When the two of us are abducted, I have to decide if I am willing to use my Gift to save us, even though doing so will reveal my abilities to Caine. Little did I know that using my Gift is exactly what the villain is waiting for…putting both our lives are in jeopardy.",
