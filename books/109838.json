  "title": "Liverpool: Wondrous Place : Music from Cavern to Cream",
  "description": "Liverpool is the cradle of British pop, a city responsible for more number 1 hits than any other. This is the definitive story of its journey from the Cavern to Cream.Even before it gave us the Beatles, Liverpool produced the first true rock 'n' roll star to be born outside America, Billy Fury. There has been a stream of star names ever since - from the Merseybeat time of the Beatles, Cilla Black and the Searchers to Echo And The Bunnymen, Elvis Costello, Frankie Goes To Hollywood, The La's, Lightning Seeds and Atomic Kitten. Liverpool even rules the dance floor, through its very own super-club, Cream. Wondrous Place is a unique look at how one city became central in the history of music. The book looks at its full range of cultural influences, from Bill Shankly and the Liverpool/Everton divide to poets such as Allen Ginsberg and Roger McGough, comedians including Jimmy Tarbuck and Alexei Sayle, Shirley Valentine and The Boys From The Black Stuff, the Toxteth riots and the Hillsborough disaster. Despite the backdrop of economic decline, Liverpool has never lost its uniquely creative energy.",
