  "description": "Ever had one of those days? Riya Tong, Fate Weaver and half-dragon, is having a doozy. First she wakes to find herself mysteriously seven months pregnant. Then she encounters Marcus, Maat Warrior. The man might be gorgeous but the judgmental know-it-all jerk seems to believe he has the right to stick his nose where it doesn’t belong. Compounding the insult by making it all too clear he thinks Riya’s magic borders on the lame. Thank heavens they never have to see one another again.Problem is, Fate has other plans. Para-Exterminators, the reality TV show Maat’s Warriors use as cover to hide their supernatural mission is under threat. There is a monster loose and a bevy of assassins targeting Marcus, desperate to get their hands on the cursed chaos rubies. Forced to work together, Riya and Marcus quickly discover that beneath all the dislike and antagonism, an irresistible mutual attraction burns, threatening to consume them both. Only question is, will they live long enough to discover that you can’t fight Fate?",
