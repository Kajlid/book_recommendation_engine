  "description": "When their life raft at last comes to ground, Jim, Peggy, and bossy Ralph rejoice. But this island is not like the world they left behind. The entire island is filled with miniature villages, roads, even cities with skyscrapers. The kids would love to play with the doll-sized vehicles and houses . . . until they discover that the tiny buildings have all-too-alive tiny people who live in them. It's tough to be a little kid, especially when you're not little --the children only want some help (and maybe some hot chocolate), but everyone views them as terrifying giants.",
