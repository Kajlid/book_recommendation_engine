  "title": "Dude, You're a Fag: Masculinity and Sexuality in High School",
  "description": "High school and the difficult terrain of sexuality and gender identity are brilliantly explored in this smart, incisive ethnography. Based on eighteen months of fieldwork in a racially diverse working-class high school, Dude, You're a Fag sheds new light on masculinity both as a field of meaning and as a set of social practices. C. J. Pascoe's unorthodox approach analyzes masculinity as not only a gendered process but also a sexual one. She demonstrates how the \"specter of the fag\" becomes a disciplinary mechanism for regulating heterosexual as well as homosexual boys and how the \"fag discourse\" is as much tied to gender as it is to sexuality.",
