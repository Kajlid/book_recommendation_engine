Luckily, she has someone to turn to: her best friend Rahul.For seven years, Rahul Khan has followed three simple rules.* Don’t touch Jasmine if you can help it.* Don’t look at her arse in that skirt.* And don’t ever—ever—tell her you love her.He should’ve added another rule: \nDo not, under any circumstances, let Jas move into your house.\nNow Rahul is living with the friend he can’t have, and it’s decimating his control. He knows their shared dinners aren’t dates, their late-night kisses are a mistake, and the tenderness in Jasmine’s gaze is only temporary.
