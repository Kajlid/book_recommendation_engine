  "description": "Three nifty youngsters, Brammy, Bala and Shiv head a start-up that creates bots for a space exploration mission. The board that governs their funding loses trust in them midway. A new CEO, Miss Shakti Tandon, is roped in. But, when Shakti tries to take on the Trinity by its Horns, does she emerge successful? This book steers clear of the crowded racks of mythology titles and gives you a fresh and (sometimes) funny insight into the world that we live in.",
