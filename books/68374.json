  "description": "In a minute-by-minute account, this popular book gives a vivid picture of what actually happened on April 19, 1775. \"Tourtellot's book is the best account we have of the day of Lexington and Concord. The actions of each individual who played a conspicuous part in the day's work are minutely traced but Mr. Tourtellot never loses the main thread of his narrative and the wealth of detail he has included gives substance and color to an exciting story.\"― J. C. Miller, New York Herald Tribune Book Review \"Tourtellot does not let his 19th of April float up in the spring air unconnected with a past or a future. He has built in very skillfully the story of the months before that day and then sends its echoes rolling on through time―and into distant states and nations....No other book generally available performs an even remotely comparable job....Makes full use of old material, adds a good deal that has come to light in the intervening years and, standing firmly on its own base, presents magnificently for the general reader and the specialist this immortal opening chapter of our beginnings as a nation.\"―Bruce Lancaster, The Saturday Review \"The result of thoughtful examination of the evidence and clear writing.\"―Walter Muir Whitehill, New England Quarterly \"An absorbing and vital history, containing much newly published information about a crucial week in the history of the United States. \"―J.M. Goodsell, Christian Science Monitor",
