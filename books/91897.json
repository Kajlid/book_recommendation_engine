  "description": "When Reverend Oxford Christie is called to the Church of the One Soul in Philadelphia his first thought is, “What happened to the congregation?” No one has joined the church for many years and the previous minister’s portrait is now hanging in the basement far from all eyes. Though there is a cemetery, there are no graves for the spouses of the remaining members, who refuse to talk about it. Something sinister has taken over the church. Angel, the church secretary, is clearly hiding something, Nehmi, the caretaker, lurks about watching Reverend Ox’s every move, Ammahn seems to be a prospective parishioner, yet he sneaks in and sits in the back pew, never talking to anyone and Cynthia Neal says she’s drawn to the church through sounds emanating from its core, of which only she is aware. What’s more, Ox learns that Emmett and Mary Jane, two new visitors, are actually undercover detectives investigating an old, still-open case involving the church. It is said “The truth shall set you free,” but what is found in the deep recesses of this sanctuary will haunt you for eternity. . .",
