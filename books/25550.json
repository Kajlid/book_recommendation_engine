  "description": "Ziggy: I'm the youngest player on the National Soccer team, the baby of my family, and sick of being underestimated, so I've decided to take matters into my own hands. Which is where my brother's best friend and teammate, Sebastian, comes in.Seb needs to rehab his reputation. I want to give mine an edge. So I propose a fake friendship with real benefits: spending time in the public eye, my good-girl image and his bad-boy notoriety rubbing off on each other. He's my devious, dark-haired fantasy come to life, but his destructive ways make it easy to keep him in the (fake) friend zone. Or so I thought.Sebastian: I've been spiraling downward, and finally I've hit rock bottom. My hockey career and sponsorships are in jeopardy, and while I'm not ready to reform my ways, I'm happy to pretend that I have, to secure the life I'm on the brink of losing.So when Ziggy proposes a public \"friendship\" to revamp our reputations, it's an offer I can't refuse. Up till now, I've stayed away from Ren's little sister to avoid any risk of ruining my one good friendship. But I reassure myself there's no risk in our scheme. I'll fake a friendship with Ziggy, fix my reputation, and get back to hockey.",
