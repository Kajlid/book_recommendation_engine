  "description": "Helm in Alaska - with girls and trouble and dogs double...This time Uncle Mac has gone a little too far.For one thing impersonating a Communist courier to whom Helm bore not a shade of resemblance was one quick suicide, but a cover in the form of a black Labrador named Prince Hannibal of Holgate...well!And that wasn't all. Acting seemed to be in season because Helm found he wasn't the only one after an oscar for the part. Somebody else wanted to get the layout of the North-west Coastal Defense System. They weren't the goodies, or the baddies. So who the hell were they?And while confusion reigned supreme, Helm had to accomplish his main mission. Mac had been explicit on this count. 'Kill Holz before he kills the President.' Which left Helm wondering just how many Holzs there were, and just how many lives he had.",
