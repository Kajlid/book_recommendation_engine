  "description": "Honored in 2006 as a \"Year's Best Book for Preachers\" by Preaching magazine.Creation in six daysWoman from the side of man\"Sons of god\" taking \"daughters of men\"A massive disaster and an animal rescue boat of biblical proportionsAbraham, Sarah, Hagar and the ongoing saga of a dysfunctional familyThese are just a few of the episodes that Genesis conjures up. But we miss the point if we focus on what seems strange to us. And we distort the message if we demand that this book answer questions that are strange to it. To read Genesis intelligently, we must consider the questions, the literature and the times in which Genesis was written. In How to Read Genesis Tremper Longman III provides a welcome guide to reading and studying, understanding and savoring this panorama of beginnings--of both the world and of Israel. And importantly for Christian readers, we gain insight into how Genesis points to Christ and can be read in light of the gospel.",
