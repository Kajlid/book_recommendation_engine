  "description": "When siblings Zanth and Russell Finch inherit a box of old inventions from their late grandfather, they assume the items are useless and shove them into a closet. Homework, athletics, and work at the vineyard consume every minute of high school and the inventions are soon forgotten.  Until a family secret reveals a truth they never expected.  Their grandfather led a double life. Not simply a retired scientist tinkering in his workshop, Sterling Finch belonged to an underground society of scientists who will now stop at nothing to get the inventions back â€“ because they actually work.  The teens soon discover that not everything is as it seems in picturesque Niagara-On-The-Lake. The inventions have them seeing spirits, challenging their fate, and traveling through time.  High school has never been so adventurous as Zanth and Russell, along with their tight circle of trusted friends, continue the legacy of secrets.",
