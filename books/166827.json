  "description": "Imagine an America not too many years distant. An America that seems perfect on the surface, but whose ethical underpinnings have totally collapsed. An America where abortion is the rule for imperfect fetuses and euthanasia is mandatory at age 75. Jon and Grace Stanton's allegiance to God is about to be put to the ultimate test in this future society. As they struggle to protect two members of their family from the laws of the land, they must rely on each other and their faith as they never have before. This novel, first published in 1981, seems increasingly predictive in its description of a world where morality is dictated by technology rather than the Word of God.",
