  "title": "Beyond Apollo",
  "description": "A 2-man Venus mission fails. It's aborted. When it returns, the Captain is missing. The other astronaut, Harry M. Evans, is unable to explain what's happened. Conversely, he has too many explications. His journal of the expedition--compiled in the mental institution to which NASA has embarrassedly committed him--offers contradictory stories: he murdered the Captain, mad Venusian invaders murdered the Captain, the Captain vanished, no one was murdered & the Captain has returned in Evans' guise. As the explanations pyramid & as the supervising psychiatrist's increasingly desperate efforts to get a straight story fail, it becomes apparent that Evans' madness & inability to explain what happened are expressions of humanity's incompetence at the enormity of space exploration. The novel, published by Random House as its inaugural work in a proposed new sf program, was controversial & became even more so when it won the 1st John W. Campbell Memorial Award for best novel. Many felt that the award, regardless of the novel's accomplishment, was an insult to Campbell (1910-71), the editor of Astounding magazine whose name had always been synonymous with space exploration. Campbell, some argued, would never have published the novel given an award in his name. Others responded that Campbell had always honored controversy & the expansion of familiar means of thought, a category into which Beyond Apollo certainly fell. Beyond Apollo has been in & out of print, but an edition has always been available in the USA or in one or more of the 12 European & Scandinavian countries in which it's sold.",
