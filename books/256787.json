  "title": "The Downside of Love",
  "description": "This isn’t a story about a love triangle. There is no triangle involved. This isn’t a story about an accidental pregnancy. Although having a baby with her . . . I would. This isn’t a story about lies and deception, even though at times I’ve lied to myself.  No, this is my story.  A story about sacrifice. A story about a man who fell in love with the wrong girl. A story I wish I never had to tell.  This is a story about the true meaning of the downside of love.",
