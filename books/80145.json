  "description": "“You know Lana, this attitude of yours is hot. Even sassy, I’ll give you that. But--,” And I had no time to react before he approached me close and was in my face again. Oh boy…I hoped my heart could stay quiet! “I have to wonder…,” he said, his eyes probing mine very deeply, as if he were searching for something, “is this who you really are?” “And what would you know about that?” I challenged him, folding my arms across my chest. I squinted my eyes at him slightly, probably appearing a little smug. Jake leaned in nearer to me, placing his hand up on the tree beside my face. I ignored the tiny burst of excitement inside me because he partially had me trapped. “I know a lot more than you think,” he said pretty confidently. “I believe you hide a lot inside yourself.” No way…can he see through my façade?? “Well look who’s talking! You’re the elusive man of mystery!” Jake smirked a little. “It’s not exactly a secret that I’m a juvenile delinquent, Lana,” he said to me… High school senior Lana Parker finds herself drawn to Jake Montgomery, a boy in her class with a mysterious past. Lana surprisingly begins to dream about him and discovers that she may be deeply bonded to him through his musical talent.",
