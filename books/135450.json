It was easy for those opposed ‘The grand design’ and Sheik Mujibur Rahman from the very beginning to believe the worst, but it was difficult for those who had faith in him to face.Sheik Mujib was not a simple man, nor was the office he held. Equally our liberation war was also a complex phenomena. Therefore, each issue which has cropped up in this book merits separate analysis.During the independence movement Sheik Mujibur Rahman once was the undisputed leader but in independent Bangladesh he became the most hated dictator. Between these two facts, lies a lost connections.Attempt has been made to relate them to one driving passion of Sheik Mujib that binds them to gather. Politics? Ideology? Fear? Complex? Ego? Ambition?
