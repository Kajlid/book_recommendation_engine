  "description": "A Dark Why Choose Romance. My name is Stella, and I am empty. I am broken. I am nothing. The only thing I enjoy about my life is my job at the Tribune. My focus in both my editorial and my personal writing involves serial killers. Even my best friend doesn’t understand my obsession with them. No one does. Until I meet them. Until Lincoln and Edward come crashing into my life, setting a fire inside me and awakening parts of me I never knew existed. Lust, desire, total submission. Together, they make me feel alive. Almost whole. Instantly I realize they’re both hiding something from me. Edward and Lincoln are not who they pretend to be—there’s a darkness inside of them, and it’s just like mine. Beasts waiting to emerge. But their darkness is not the only thing stalking my thoughts. There’s a killer on the prowl, making his victims pray to their gods after he kills them. I call him the Angel Maker—and I, I just might be his next angel. This is a why choose dark romance intended for 18+ readers. ***TW: This is a dark, psychologically twisted tale involving violence, stalking, and other topics some readers might find triggering. 18+ Be warned.***",
