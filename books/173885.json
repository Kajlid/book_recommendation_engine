  "description": "Envy is a silent, cold-blooded killer, extinguishing a little more life from me every day. Hitting sharp, fast, and seemingly out of nowhere; struck by lightning without a storm cloud in sight...in she rolls. Reece Kelly, a force to be reckoned with, head of the class-- which means one thing-- she's out of mine. \"You're wasting your time, Rhett Foster. Locks have keys and walls can be climbed. I'm not buying your broody, skeptical act for one minute.\" And then there's that...As much as she compels me to open up, to show her what no one else gets to see...there are guilty shadows lurking in the depths of her eyes that she cannot hide from me.",
