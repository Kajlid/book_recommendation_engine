  "description": "There is no escape from fate… Dark clouds gather as the legend continues. In the town where secrets lie and natural justice rules, the sirens have fallen – captured and defeated. The fate of the hunters is in the hands of the wolves. In the grip of the largest full moon in centuries the stakes climb higher. Aided by a thwarted enemy, Apollo unleashes a long-awaited plan to defeat Artemis once and for all. Wolf venom spreads across the Valley like a catastrophic virus. Those that Lila loves most must choose to take cover or go on the defence as the battle for supremacy reaches new heights. Bonds are tested as devastation and mistrust escalates to breaking point. The tumultuous relationship between wolves and hunters reaches a bloody climax. What will the huntress uncover and who will be lost in the cross fire? Lila combats a new breed of predator in a war that will ultimately decide the fate of Shade.",
