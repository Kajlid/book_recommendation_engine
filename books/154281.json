  "description": "Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), the central figure in New England's first Great Awakening, offers here his most detailed description of the signs--true and false--of revival, while highlighting the role truly balanced emotions play within the Christian life. He takes a long, hard look at the evidence of true conversion--the fruit that comes from living like Christ. It is not enough to do \"Christian\" things--for without an authentic, selfless service motivated by the Holy Spirit, our works are empty.",
