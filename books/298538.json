  "description": "ColeI don't suck at dating.I suck at getting over the girl who friend-zoned me back in college.But I have a plan: Let her set me up. Bomb the dates. Then she can be my dating coach and I can finally prove I'm the one for her and not that jerk boyfriend she's always crying on my shoulder about.AriannaI've had the same boyfriend for three years, which practically makes me a relationship expert.So when my famous best friend asks for my help, I know turning him into boyfriend material will be a piece of cake.I'll tell him to get a haircut, maybe open a few doors here and there and the guy will be golden. I mean, with all those muscles and jaw-dropping good looks, it really should be no problem.There's just one thing I didn't expect: To want him for myself.",
