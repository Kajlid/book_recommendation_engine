  "description": "A quest, a war, a ring that would be grounds for calling any wedding off, a king without a kingdom, and a little, furry \"hero\" named Frito, ready—or maybe just forced by the wizard of Goodgulf—to undertake the one mission which can save Lower Middle Earth from enslavement by the evil Sorhed ... Luscious Elfmaidens, a roller-skating dragon, ugly plants that can soul-kiss the unwary to death—these are just some of the ingredients in the wildest, wackiest, most irreverent excursion into fantasy realms that anyone has ever dared to undertake.",
