  "title": "Drawn & Quartered: The History of American Political Cartoons",
  "description": "Chronicles the nation's highs and lows in an extensive collection of cartoons that span the entire history of American political cartooning. The authors note that not all cartoonists have worn white hats many have perpetuated demeaning ethnic stereotypes, slandered honest politicians, and oversimplified complex issues. Nonetheless, most cartoonists pride themselves on attacking honestly, if ruthlessly. This collection humorously recounts some direct hits, recalling the discomfort of the cartoon's targets and the delight of their readers. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.",
