  "title": "Nazi Wives: The Women at the Top of Hitler's Germany",
  "description": "'NAZI WIVES' IS A FASCINATING LOOK AT THE PERSONAL LIVES, PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILES, AND MARRIAGES OF THE WIVES OF OFFICERS IN HITLER'S INNER CIRCLEGoering, Goebbels, Himmler, Heydrich, Hess, Bormann – names synonymous with power and influence in the Third Reich. Perhaps less familiar are Carin, Emmy, Magda, Margaret, Lina, Ilse and Gerda. . .These are the women behind these infamous men – complex individuals with distinctive personalities who were captivated by Hitler and whose everyday lives were governed by Nazi ideology. Throughout the rise and fall of Nazism these women loved and lost, raised families and quarreled with their husbands and each other, all while jostling for position with the Fuhrer himself. Until now, they have been treated as characters, their significance ignored, as if they were unaware of their husbands' murderous acts, despite the evidence that was all around them: the stolen art on their walls, the slave labor in their homes, and the produce grown in concentration camps on their tables.James Wyllie's 'NAZI WIVES' explores these women in detail for the first time, skillfully interweaving their stories through years of struggle, power, decline, and destruction into the post-war twilight of denial and delusion.
