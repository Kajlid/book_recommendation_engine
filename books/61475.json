The first story, 'Word Queen', tells the tale of a Panda who discovers the secret of words on a journey through a magical land. 'Black Eye' meanwhile, is a simple rites-of-passage story about a boy's quest to find the truth behind the bruise around his eye.If you or your children want to be entertained and educated by stories filled with magic and strangeness, and introduced to worlds of Pandas,Words, Black Eyes, Adventures, Quests and Travelling Fools, then 'Two New Fairytales' could be the book for you.",
