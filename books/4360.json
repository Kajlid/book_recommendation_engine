  "description": "Beautiful, beloved college sophomore Brianna Denison was home for the holidays in Reno, Nevada. After a long night out, she crashed on a friend's couch. It would be the last time the child psychology major was seen alive. Her strangled body was found in a field nearly a month later. But Brianna was not the first victim of a murderer with a disturbing fetish, and the patience to search for his favourite prey - petite, vulnerable brunettes. In unflinching detail Gary King recounts the hunt for James Biela, an ex-marine turned rapist and killer. The investigation would lead authorities to a maze of troubled relationships, crucial DNA evidence, and ultimately a death sentence -- bringing this shocking true-life thriller to a chilling end.",
