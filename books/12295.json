  "title": "Murphy's Madness",
  "description": "Murphy Clover is in for the ride of his life. Maribel professes to be his number one fan when she finds out he secretly writes e-books. Murphy politely declines her attention, letting her know he's gay. This only makes her more determined to have Murphy, and now she has escalated to violence. Ludo Chernov was wrongly accused of giving a mate unwanted attention, and now he tries his best to stay away from them. The only problem with that plan is that he needs the help of one of them to find his mate. Murphy knows Maribel is real. She's hurt him twice already. When Ludo thinks she is a figment of his imagination, Murphy starts to question his own sanity. But there are a few mates who know he isn't crazy, and they escape the estate to prove his innocence. Will the mates help Murphy in time, or will Ludo have him locked away? Note: Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
