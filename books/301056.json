  "title": "A Baby for the Lumberjacks",
  "description": "Sold to the lumberjacks… When her father makes one bad deal to get out of another, the end result is giving his daughter to a lumberjack to have his baby. But twenty-one-year-old Saffron Sinclair feels she has no choice but to take the place of her beautiful and timid sister and present herself to the lumberjack instead. Her hope is that he’ll find her undesirable on sight – with her tattoos and the red streaks in her black hair – and send her back home. She’d cite the no refund clause and everything would be fine. But, when Saffron arrives at the mansion in the forest, she discovers there’s not only one but three dangerously gorgeous lumberjacks. Worse, they have no plans to return her, and walking away would mean giving them their money back.  Prepared to see this through for her family’s sake, Saffron stays and is determined to remain unscathed. Except their shameless examinations and their bold and intimate methods of discipline shatter her boundaries, leaving her curiously aroused and desperately craving more… Publisher’s Note: This is an unconventional steamy love story.",
