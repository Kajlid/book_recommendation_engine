Instead, she's dragged into helping her family of eight move across the country to her grandma's ancestral home in Florida.The old house is a mess that goes beyond the aesthetic. Some of Susan's ancestors aren't really \"gone,\" and they're determined to act out their anger.Along with her occult-obssessed sister, and a too-cute-to-be-true neighbor sending mixed signals, Susan takes up her grandmother's search for a way to save the house.If she can't save the family home, Susan can at least hope her family makes it out alive.**This book was originally published as a short story. Due to feedback, it was edited and rewritten, and is now a full-length novel at 250 pages.Susan is appalled when she moves back home after college to find her parents are packing the family off to Florida--to her Gran’s empty ancestral home.The place is a mess, but it goes beyond the aesthetic--there is something even more frightening in the house than they ever imagined, and it’s deeply intertwined in their family’s past. Some of her ancestors aren’t quite gone, and they’re determined to play out their anger to the bitter end, despite the home’s new inhabitants. She can only hope her family will make it out alive.",
