  "description": "If you're looking for a quest, help me find the changeling, destroy it, and save the Make-Believe and this halfling's sanity. As a baby, Kenneth Mess was stolen from his cradle and replaced with a clay replica. Now he is being raised underground by Clemency Pogue's hobgoblin friend Chaphesmeeso, so that he will eventually become a hobgoblin himself. But that can't happen until the clay baby dissolves. And that won't happen, since Inky, the changeling, rarely washes. Which means that the world of Make-Believe is in serious danger. Once again, an adventure is underfoot for Clemency Pogue as she tries to make the world safe for Make-Believe.",
