And yet, he's not. She knows him even though he doesnâ€™t know her.He's the powerful attorney, now world-renowned after coming off the trial of a century which was publicized across the country. And I'm one of the reporters that sat in his courtroom.I watched him, studied him, got to know him from afar which isn't hard since I know his exact brand of confidence, arrogance, and wealth.I know his type. I've dated his type. Which is why when I happen to come face to face with him, when sparks fly and heat simmers between us, I know what happens if I say \"yes\" to Reese Summer. I know he'll taste like sin and sex, even before he kisses me.I know he'll feel like pleasure and passion, even before he touches me.I know he'll demand more than I want to give, and yet, because I dare to give myself to him, the result will be deliciously hot.I know that I will not leave his bed without being utterly, completely sated. And I know that I will leave the next morning anyway.And so, I do. And so, he follows.And as chase begins my question becomes: Is Reese Summer THE one or is he really just a dirty, arrogant lie that should have stayed a one night stand?",
