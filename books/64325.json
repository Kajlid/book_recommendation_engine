The mysterious death of her husband is casting a shadow of doubt on her innocence and even with her ability to make herself disappear - literally - Alice is finding it hard to avoid detection. It comes as a relief when a stranger shows up at her door, offering money and protection - for a price. Drake Sebastian is on the hunt for two dangerous paranormal crystals, located on the mysterious and magical Rainshadow Island. Alice seems to hold the key to his success and a marriage will protect her from a murder accusation. A fair deal, right? It's merely convenience, after all . . . But as passions start to flare, so do old demons. Alice's honeymoon on Rainshadow is guaranteed to be memorable, as the island-and the chemistry between her and Drake-is about to explode... From New York Times bestselling author Jayne Ann Krentz comes the third Jayne Castle book set on the mysterious Rainshadow Island",
