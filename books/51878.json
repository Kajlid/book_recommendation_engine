  "description": "Winter came early to the Redoubt that year. And as the darkness of the sub-artic nights began to close in, an old evil stirred and re-awoke. Indigo and her companion, the she-wolf Grimya, have been guided to this great northern island, the birthplace of Indigo's lost love, Fenran. Here, amid the Redoubt's snow and ice, they must face another of the demons released by Indigo's folly. And there are memories too: memories of her own past, lying like traps and snares in the frozen ground. To destroy the evil, it must first be found. And Indigo's only guide is the very creature whose name symbolises fear and danger, the rare and elusive Snow Tiger. Or is that dark shape among the forest shadows an evil in itself?",
