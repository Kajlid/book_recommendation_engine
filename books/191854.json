  "title": "Moebius 2: Arzach and Other Fantasy Stories",
  "description": "This collection of nine short stories, six of which are told without the use of dialogue or sound effects, features the mysterious character Arzach, first created in 1976 by the French writer and illustrator Moebius.It is not apparent whether the eponymous character is a hero, an antihero or simply a definitive example of the surreal Fantasy and Science Fiction storytelling made popular by French comics magazine MÃ©tal Hurlant and its English language counterpart Heavy Metal. What it is apparent is that Moebius has created a truly unique world populated by strange and fascinating characters.Arzach is recognizable by his cone-shaped hat, his flowing cloak, and the stern yet gentle expression on his wind-burned face. He rides a creature that resembles an albino pterodactyl across bleak desert landscapes, where he encounters remnants of lost civilizations. His experiences are both dramatic and absurd, and his meandering journeys are as mystifying as they are humorous.",
