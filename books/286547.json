But she can put pen to paper to make a list of all the ways she can live out loud, just like her dad would have wanted.See the city from the top of the Empire State Building: Check.Eat hot dogs on the steps of The Met: Check.Get a job at Wasted Words: Check.What wasn’t on her list: Greg Brandon. And just when she thinks she’s figured out where to put him, everything changes. In the span of a few staggering heartbeats, she finds herself her caught in the middle of something she can’t find her way out of, with no clear answers and no rules.List or no list, she realizes she can’t control anything at all, not even her heart. Not the decisions it makes, and not the moment it stops.",
