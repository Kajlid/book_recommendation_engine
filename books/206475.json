Former bad girl Katie Stone can feel the weight of her reputation settle over her as she drives home for the first time in years.

Asher Powell never minded being the son of a small-town pastor until a recent breakup leaves him wounded by lifelong members of his church.

Through an unexpected friendship, two people from different worlds find peace, hope, and a second chance they never dreamed was possible.",
