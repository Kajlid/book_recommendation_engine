  "title": "A Song in the Night",
  "description": "She is the key to their escape, and they are the key to her survival…  When vagabond and criminal-on-the run Saylor Greyson boards a bus to Los Angeles, she doesn’t expect to crash land in a coffin in a world she thought only existed in the pages of fairytales. A world of astonishing magic, deadly curses, and a vast kingdom… that’s all hers. She just can't remember it.  It turns out that everything Saylor has ever known was an elaborate dream– except for her knack for seduction, the illicit power that sent her running in the first place.  With time running out, Saylor will need the help of her not one, but five super hot watchmen…. watchmen with questionable loyalties who are conveniently immune to her siren superpowers. Each of these men may have had a part to play in the dream of the life she knew, and Saylor suspects that tangling with them might be the only way to untangle her fabricated identity from the one she must remember if she hopes to break her curse, escape the tower, and...you know... live happily ever after.  A fresh mashup of fairytales and Greek mythology, this slow burn gothic romance will thrill readers with its twists and turns, and one headstrong heroine at the helm!  NOTE: A SONG IN THE NIGHT contains the first three episodes of the TEMPTED KINGDOM serial, and reads as a continuous full-length novel.",
