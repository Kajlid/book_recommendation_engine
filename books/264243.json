  "description": "\"This novel may appear to cater to specialised tastes. But it is highly recommended to nonfetishists, who will find it inventively hilarious.\" — The Guardian\"The sunlight glints on the translucent triumph of science. The faint rasp as I unspool it sends delirious brightly colored butterflies flocking through my stomach. I am like a tailor of the elves bedecking him in a shimmering suit of some magical material. Soon, Roy Orbison stands before all of Düsseldorf wrapped up in clingfilm. Silent white light floods my whole being and I become one with the universe.\"Just as the avant-garde artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude employed cloth to drape prominent buildings, Ulrich Haarbürste has adopted plastic wrap — or clingfilm — as his medium. His focus, however, is no inanimate landmark; it's the popular music icon Roy Orbison. In this singular novel, Haarbürste relates a series of encounters with the legendary musician that culminate with the former wrapping the latter from head to toe in clingfilm, to the author's immense satisfaction.This edition includes several related short stories, and as the author modestly observes, \"Not to speak boastfully, but it is perhaps the only book you will ever need to own on the subject of wrapping Roy Orbison in clingfilm.\"",
