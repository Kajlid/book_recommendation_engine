  "description": "STANDALONE CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE  No matter how unbreakable he may seem, every man has a weakness.  A year ago, my home became a bloodstained crime scene. That night marked the beginning of my hell—the same night I was tortured by my enemies and tossed into an underground prison to die.  They failed. I survived.  Now that I’m free, only one motive burns in my soul: revenge.  Lucky for me, they think Jase Hawkins is dead. Maybe I am. I’ve got nothing but a cold, merciless rage, and Black Betty, the sharp steel blade that never leaves my side.  Then she drifts into my life.  Lucia wants answers—so much so, she’s willing to fall into the darkness where my enemies lie in wait, to kill her for what she knows.  Or to take her for the depraved fantasies her body alone can rouse in a man’s mind.  Me? I want her for the fire in her touch that feeds my addiction, forces me to feel what has become numb, but my appetite for bloodshed runs deeper than flesh.  For my own sanity, I’ve vowed to stay away from her. Because she’s my only weakness, an obsession that leaves me craving more—one that could make even the most steadfast plan backfire.  **Not recommended for readers under the age of 18. Trigger warning for violence, drug abuse and scenes of rape and torture.  BACKFIRE is a spin-off of RICOCHET and can be read as a standalone.",
