  "description": "I’m Kayla Martin... I was once sweet and innocent, saw the world bright with colour, but now all I see is black and white. He not only ripped my innocence away from me, tortured me and made my life a living hell, but he stole the very soul that made me who I am. I’m a shell of the girl I once knew. But it’s all about to change. I’m ready to face my fear. And that’s going right back to the very place all this started. Grayson High. I’ve had to stay back a year to re-take my exams, back to the halls where students whispered, bullied, and taunted me. It’s been four years and I’m still trying to perfect the art of faking. It’s easy most of the time. My parents never really cared about me; they just saw the fake smile and assumed everything was fabulous, until he waltzes back into my life. Myles freaking Carter. My childhood crush. And he sees straight past my fake smiles to the broken girl inside. But what happens when he finds out about the real me...the broken, scared, weak girl? My biggest fear is on the verge of becoming discovered because he becomes my rock. I'm petrified that he'll find out what I've been hiding from everyone. Will he be able to look me in the eye once he finds out my secret?",
