By the time Carlos is 20, he's being sworn in as a deputy US marshall and now goes by the name of Carl. And Emmet Long has hooked up with the no-good son of an oil millionaire and the two of them rob banks. Carl Webster and Emmet Long may be on opposite sides of the law but their long time game of cat and mouse will turn them both into two of the most famous names in crime and punishment.",
