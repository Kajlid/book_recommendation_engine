  "title": "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove: A Play in Two Acts",
  "description": "Last Summer at Bluefish Cove is the story of a dissatisfied straight woman who leaves her husband to spend some quiet time by herself, and who unwittingly and naively wanders into the midst of a group of seven lesbians at the beginning of their annual beachside vacation ... The friendships, the laughter, the love, the fears of being outed, the difficulties of being gay and how it affects relationships with family, children, parents and careers, the demonstrations of what the painful price could be for a gay life 30 years ago in everyday America, had never before been told with such respect. Chambers' comedic dialogue, sensitivity to human nature and tender treatment of her characters help the play transcend preconceptions and show the universality of these women's journeys.",
