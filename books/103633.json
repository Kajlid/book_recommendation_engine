  "description": "Adelai has known only one home - that of the Temple of Inne-annah, Goddess of Lust and Love. As a shrinemaiden, she was raised to be a graceful, high-society courtesan catering only to the rich and powerful, for a price.On the eve of her auction, however, Adelai discovers treachery at play between two of the most powerful kingdoms in the land, and that she had become a pawn in a political game where the stakes are high, and one wrong move will mean war. The choices Adelai will make shall take her from gilded manors and fancy balls to a cruel king's royal court, where secrets lurk and loyalty is an illusion. In the end, Adelai must use all the skills she's learned both inside the bedroom and out of it to triumph against the men who want her, the men who would seek to possess her - and to win the man who loves her, against all odds.The Shrinemaiden is the first of the Maidens trilogy, which takes place in the dark kingdom of Sarcopia, but remains a standalone.Warning: explicit scenes, dubcon situations, sexy alpha males and some bdsm",
