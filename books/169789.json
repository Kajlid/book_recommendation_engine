They hear about a child born long ago, and a jolly man named Santa who brings gifts to celebrate Jesus’s birth on a day called Christmas. And so Mr. and Mrs. Mouse decide that their family should celebrate Christmas too.With delightful rhyming verse, detailed illustrations (with hidden pictures to search for!), and a childlike sense of wonder, the story of the Mouse family’s first Christmas is sure to become a holiday tradition.",
