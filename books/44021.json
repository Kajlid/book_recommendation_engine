  "description": "Reprisal is a dying town built on secrets and haunted by a mysterious shadow since its beginnings.Eddie Newport must survive one night in this town with his oldest friend as a bus full of escaped murderers breaks down on Main Street. To have the mind of a child in the body of a massive killing machine is an unfortunate combination. Dixon Lampier wanted to be gentle. He wanted his kitty. He wanted to play in the snow. Complicated words cannot make it through the haze that is his mind. To him a gentle touch is the same as a crushing blow. The time has come for the convicts to board the bus and Dixon is the last one in line. The transfer is about to begin.",
