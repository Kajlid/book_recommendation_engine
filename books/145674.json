However, that money was pocket change to my latest client, Adam Grubman, the richest man in online gaming. Adam needs sexual healing to turn him from mogul behind the keyboard to master in the bedroom. Fortunately, I'm just the woman for the job. But when our private sexts threaten to turn into an internet sensation, all hashtags break loose. And when Adam wants to turn our week-long tryst into a permanent gig, love might get in the way of my perfectly good business. \n\nThis is my story. Don't try this online.",
