  "description": "WHY ME?! Have you ever wondered that?What if I was to tell you that all of the crap stuff you go through, is actually doing you good?! Sometimes it is just a matter of opening your eyes and seeing the blessing hidden in disguise! As 50 Cent says 'Let's turn shit into sugar!' After tragically losing a friend to suicide I felt that I needed to do something to help young women get through growing up in this day and age - this is what lead me to write Well, This is Growing Up. A self-help book written by a young woman (24 exactly!) for young women. Well, This is Growing Up will help you view life differently, more positively and help you to have what everyone truly wants... HAPPINESS! By reading you will be more confident, happy in your own skin and comfortable being your true self... Even if it's a little bit (or a lot) W E I R D! I also don't shy away from 'real' topics even if they may not be 'G' rated ;). 10% of all profits go to Australian mental health organisation Beyondblue. Are you ready to be a bursting ball of happiness ?! Well, what are you waiting for? Let's begin! :)",
