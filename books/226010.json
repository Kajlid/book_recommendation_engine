  "description": "I lived in the dark for three years. My whole world revolved around the whims and happiness of three men. It was just a trip into the forbidden. A way out of a bad situation and forward into nothingness. Quin, with his easy smile and charming good looks. He was always there for me... Until he wasn’t.Smith, and his dispassionate attention. He was never there for me and he never regretted it.Bric, the one who listened, but only to himself. Self-absorbed, self-obsessed, and self-serving. He was never the one I wanted.And now he might be the only one I have left.It was good while it lasted, I guess. But it could’ve been so much more. It could’ve been so much better.And that’s why I’m turning back.",
