  "title": "Dorian: An Imitation",
  "description": "In the summer of 1981, aristocratic, drug-addicted Henry Wotton and Warhol-acolyte Baz Hallward meet Dorian Gray. Dorian is a golden Adonis - perfect, pure and (so far) deliciously uncorrupted. The subject of Baz's video installation, Cathode Narcissus, and the object of Henry's attentions, Dorian is launched on a hedonistic binge that spans the '80s and '90s. But as Baz and Henry succumb to the AIDS epidemic, how is it that Dorian, despite all his sexual and narcotic debauchery, remains so unsullied - so vibrantly alive?",
