  "description": "Since its formation in the twelfth century, The Order of The Knights Templar has kept its fair share of secrets. Eric Ray, a young man living in the present, didn’t intend to stick his nose in The Order’s business, but that’s somehow exactly what happened. Amidst a budding relationship and heartbreaking revelations, he finally learns the truths he’s been longing to hear. However, the more he learns, the more he realizes that some things are better left in the dark. The same issues plague Samantha O’Rourke, a time traveler living more than three hundred years before her time. Disturbed by revelations about Thomas Randall, a viscous pirate who will stop at nothing to get what he wants, she struggles to maintain the balance that once filled her home. Wanting nothing more than to move on with life and leave the past behind her, she faces each day with resolute strength, keeping her own secrets under lock and key. With a new leader at the head of The Order and his own standing as a Templar at risk, Tristan, Samantha’s husband, knows that now is not the time to rock the boat. No matter how hard he tries, though, he can’t seem to shake the demons of his past—or the ones threatening to tear him to shreds now. Desperation leads him to recklessness. He will fight to regain what was stolen away from him.",
