  "description": "\"For Christians who love a bit of sass, this delightful guide poignantly explains how to praise God while accepting the messiness that life brings.\"— Publisher's Weekly God is Crazy About You—Hot Mess and All! If you’re anything like Kerri Pomarolli, you’ve read Proverbs 31 and thought, “Who is this woman? And what kind of magic unicorn, Energizer Bunny juice does she have on IV?” And you thought social media standards were hard to live up to!   As a sought-after comedian living in LA, Kerri knows about impossible standards. “I don’t plow, and I don’t rise early. When it says she gathers her food from afar, does that mean takeout…?” In Confessions of a Proverbs 32 Woman, Kerri fearlessly shares the messiness of her own life with wit and honesty. Join her as she delves into the struggles of the modern woman tired of trying and failing to live up to Pinterest-looking, air-brushed, and insta-filtered “real life” role models telling her she’s not quite good enough. And learn the two things you can hold onto for longer than your genuine self-awareness and humble God-awareness. Kerri is a self-proclaimed hot mess for Jesus who has learned that God never said our lives would be mess-less, but He also never intended for us to wallow forever without a way through. When you’re at your most hopeless, God and His Word will meet you there, where you’ll find, as Kerri has, that this #hotmess4Jesus thing really can be the best possible life to live.",
