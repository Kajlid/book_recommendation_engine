  "title": "Thy Servant a Dog",
  "description": "'Thy Servant a Dog and other Dog stories' brings together a delightful selection of Kipling short stories and poems. The first three tales, Thy Servant a Dog, The Great Play Hunt and Toby Dog, are narrated by the Black Aberdeen Terrier Boots, and concern the adventures of himself and his canine friends Slippers, Ravager and Toby, their wars with Kitchen Cat and their incomprehension of the ways of the humans in their lives. A Sea Dog is a nautical tale about Malachi, who sees action in the North Sea, and Teem - a Treasure-Hunter tells of a little French dog with a nose for truffles. The collection also includes three poems, The Supplication of the Black Aberdeen, His Apologies and The Power of the Dog (included for the first time). This new edition includes many of the original charming black-and-white illustrations by G. L. Stampa and Cecil Aldin and is sure to entertain a whole new generation of children and dog-lovers.",
