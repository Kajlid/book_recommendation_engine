  "description": "I’ve been different all my life: always something to hide. But that was only magic. Now … I’ve never had a secret this big before.\nWerewolves know a thing or two about secrets. I thought I had it bad, visiting my sister in England and going to a spellcasters’ conference behind her back. Turns out werewolves have been hiding here the whole time. And now they’re being murdered.How was I supposed to say no when I was the one human—one outsider, one witch—they asked for help in finding the killer? A simple scry and I’d be back to my vacation. But the pack had other ideas.Between Zar’s talk of moonlit beach strolls, Isaac’s charm, Jason’s kindness, Andrew’s fast tongue, and even that bad boy thing Kage and Jed have going on, catching a killer could be the least of my problems.Did I mention they’re gorgeous? They’re gorgeous. Didn’t know that was a werewolf thing.The wolves say they’re here to protect me. Funny that I never needed it until they got me involved in hunting down a deranged serial killer.So now this is my vacation. A single witch, six sexy werewolves, and a murderer on the loose. What could possibly go wrong?\nThis is Book 1 in The Witch and the Wolf Pack series.",
