When a hunting trip ends in tragedy, he is forced to do the unthinkableâ€”seek refuge in Sanctuary Hope, where each family must nominate a member to the city council. It is seemingly a minor price to pay in exchange for medical aid and refuge. But it is also a dangerous trap, and unaware of the gut-wrenching reality, Vincent nominates himself to save his people. Now a life of war awaits him. . . and captivity to a vampire master known as Maddox Caine.",
