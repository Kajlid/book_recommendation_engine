  "description": "Regine’s blog about living with Leukemia gained a huge following, and eventually became the basis for book. She writes openly about emotional and physical aspects of her 15-month struggle to recover, and explains how her disease impacts her life. In the course of her illness, Regine has photography exhibits, goes to concerts, enjoys her friends and family, and advocates for registering as a blood and bone marrow donor. She was a typical teenager with an amazing will to live; and the lessons she learned have relevance for all of us. She died at home on December 3, 2009 with her family and cat by her side. Originally published in Norway, the book was selected by the Norwegian Ministry of Culture for a translation grant and became a bestseller there. PRAISE FOR REGINE'S BOOK✳ “Regine’s voice is matter-of-fact and honest…A heartfelt and visually appealing window into Regine’s last year.”—Kirkus Reviews✳ “Stokke’s openness and honesty that are the chief draw; readers will feel as though they have truly come to know her. (Regine’s Book is) a rare, valuable window into life with a terminal illness.” –Publishers Weekly✳ “(Regine’s) writing is honest and raw, insightful and inspiring. While her moods swing with the course of her treatment and relapses, her outlook remains steadfastly positive throughout all but the most difficult days…Her obsession with rock music and attending concerts saturates the text as it does her short life, and her original poems and artistic photographs add extra dimension to what is sure to be an inspiring read...” –Booklist",
