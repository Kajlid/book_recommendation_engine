  "title": "This Book is Broken: A Broken Social Scene Story",
  "description": "This Book Is Broken is a lively oral history of Broken Social Scene, the Toronto cult indie-rock band that doubles as a collective, cottage industry, and self-described beautiful mess. Writer Stuart Berman has pieced together the band’s story through interviews with all 18 members, as well as their Toronto peers, international allies, and childhood heroes. Exclusive photos, gig posters, and artwork — most of it provided by band members and associates — expand the text with a composite picture of this influential group of \"baroque popsters.\"",
