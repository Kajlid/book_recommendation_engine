With real-world examples from her radio show and strikingly honest letters from her male listeners, her book reveals that many men demonstrate a level of sensitivity and insight that will surprise most women.

Her growing audience will never look at their relationships, behaviors, and decisions the same way after listening to  Ten Stupid Things Men Do to Mess Up Their Lives .",
