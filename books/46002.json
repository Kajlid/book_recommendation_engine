  "description": "Too long have the elemental powers been sleeping. The end of all things lurks over the horizon. There may be no dawn chasing the darkness of this night. Death has shattered the tenuous alliances once so delicately tendered. Secrets and sanctuaries are no longer safe. Trust is no longer an option to those so brutally battered by King Rastaban's calculated rage. While the king's madness overtakes him and Sevilen struggles to come to term with his abilities, Aridani, the sole remaining heir to the decaying throne, breaks free and proves that there is still some light remaining in a shadowed world. His name harkens to the language of the lost Tenjeri â€“ hope, pure and innocent hope, so strong it remains evident even in days of deepest despair. Will his luminescence survive the influence of Rastaban's insanity, or will he be thrown into the void with the rest of Malora?Time will reveal the true powers of the Destroyers of prophesy. Who will rise and who will fall as the prophesies begin to come true? The conclusion of the Echoes of Oblivion trilogy brings forth the darkness and light in all brought to life within its pages, and the heroes and villains of Malora may not be who anyone thought they were once the cataclysm arrives.",
