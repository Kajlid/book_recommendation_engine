And Callie’s hearing whispers in the dark corners of her mind....One of the Vatican’s most infamous Shepherds has been murdered, and Callie’s friends are the prime suspects. To prove them innocent, Roland and Callie must risk their very souls....Because Callie can’t reveal that she’s hearing strange whispers when she uses her magic, or that she’s harboring an Angel’s Grace. And if the Shepherds discover the hellish bargain Roland made, the streets of Rome will flow with blood as brother turns against brother.And with the Antipope pressuring the Vatican for change, and Nate Temple arriving unannounced to demand an audience with the Shepherds, things couldn’t get any more chaotic.Until Callie learns of an ancient order of traitors hiding in the Vatican, and they’ll do anything to bring it down - brick by brick.The only way to find the traitor, keep her secrets, and save those she loves is to raise her blade against these holy warriors of God, shattering the Vatican itself.And the whispers in her head find all of this so terribly...amusing.If you like Patricia Briggs, Ilona Andrews, Linsey Hall, McKenzie Hunter, or Ella Summers, you will love the third installment of the Feathers and Fire series.Jump into the hellish nightmare today!",
