  "description": "A summer romance, built to last.Ritter University Novella - Book OneAndrzej Kaminski—Ski to his friends—has always wanted to be a doctor. At least that’s what his father tells him. Ski’s not so sure. With medical school no longer a foregone conclusion, Ski suddenly has no purpose, no direction. He has no idea what he wants to do—football and wrestling don’t count. Samantha Thunder's life is overflowing with two-by-fours and sacks of mortar. She doesn’t have time for romance, especially pretty frat-boys with dreamy pecs. She needs to run the family construction business, whether she likes it or not—which means staying far, far away from big, muscled distractions. Unfortunately, she can’t stay far, far away, no matter how hard she tries. This summer, Samantha is managing the renovation of the Phi Rho fraternity house on the Ritter University campus, and Ski is babysitting the house while he pretends to take some summer classes. The pressure is on for both of them to make some major decisions—about their future, and about each other. Walking away may be the best answer. If only they could…*Reader Note*This Ritter University book is part of series of interconnected but stand-alone books.",
