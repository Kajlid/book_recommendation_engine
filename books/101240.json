  "description": "For two hundred years Georges Belleveau has walked the night feeding from the living.In that time he has seen much. The 19th and 20th Centuries with all their wonders and horrors have marched past him. Monsieur Belleveau has watched all of it, and continued past them.As a result he’s discovered he does well writing and teaching history. It’s not something pulled from dull pages to be monotonously recounted to bored students.This career has brought him to a small midwestern university to teach a few night classes about his favorite subject. When it’s done, he’ll move on, as he always does.Georges couldn’t be more wrong.While hunting for a meal one evening he meets Diane Patterson, a woman of rare beauty and intelligence. In spite of himself he is drawn to her, and she to him.But Georges is a vampire and Diane is human, mortal. One thing that every night dweller learns is that humans can never discover the undead exist. It could mean the extinction of their kind.This secrecy is a barrier that cannot be crossed, and if it is, will Georges and Diane’s love survive On The Far Side of Darkness?",
