  "description": "I’m officially a member of Mateo’s pack now, which means the panthers can’t touch me. I thought joining his pack would mean that I would finally belong somewhere, but not everybody is welcoming. I’m still the odd one out—the runt who stole their future alpha. But those things don’t matter. I have my mates, and I’m content. For the first time in my life, I am happy. When the truth comes out about my past, about who I really am, even my friends start to doubt me. Maybe they’re right. Maybe I’m not a good person. Layla Rosewood—the unwanted panther. Still, I refuse to give up, no matter how bleak things may seem. If being the runt has taught me anything, it’s how to survive. I’ll show them all that I’m stronger than they think.  The New Girl is the second book in the Shifter Academy: United Trilogy. It is a slow burn, reverse harem (RH), why choose, fast paced, action packed, young adult (YA) paranormal romance.
