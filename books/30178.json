  "description": "At twenty-four, Amy was a typical type-A law student: smart, driven, and highly competitive until her heart began to fail. Amy chronicles her harrowing medical journey from the first misdiagnosis to her astonishing recovery after her heart transplant, which is made all the more dramatic by the romantic bedside courtship with her future husband, and her uncompromising desire to become a mother. She presents a patient's perspective of life after a heart transplant with honesty.",
