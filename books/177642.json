  "description": "You want it, you got it…  Whether it's tickets for special events or reservations for hotels and restaurants, Sophie Ashton is a networking ninja. As a personal concierge for the rich and elite, she has very little personal time and no desire for romance, but she always time for sex—except at work. A lesson she learned the hard way. But when she meets her new client, a sexy-as-hell CEO, she knows she’s in trouble. Worse, she knows she’ll like it.  Xavier Quinn needs Sophie. Her skills as a concierge make her the only person with enough finesse and connections to help him win a coveted contract. The problem is the attraction between them is too strong to fight. Mixing work and play never ends well, but what’s a little risk when the rewards are so delicious? Flipping caution the bird, Xavier convinces Sophie to surrender to their erotic desires, but the stakes have never been higher.  Pleasing a billionaire client like Xavier could change the game for Sophie, but if she loses the contract, her reputation might not be the only thing broken.
