  "title": "Sidecar",
  "description": "A fast, funny, and wholly satisfying compilation of short stories filled with the same rich detail, witty humor, jagged verbal jousting, and joyous intellectual tête-à-tête that are Ann McMan's calling cards. Reconnect with Syd, Maddie, and the Jericho gang in \"V1: A Valentine's Day Odyssey,\" as a sweet and simple gesture of love ignites a conflagration that could destroy friends, lovers, and a professional-grade mixer named Gloria. Meet Kate Winston, Shawn Harris, and the best, brightest, and most uniquely \"gifted\" personalities in contemporary lesfic, in the all-new novella, Bottle Rocket. Grace and Abbie screw up the courage to let themselves go for one magical night-only to find that the Fates are cheeky little bitches with a wicked sense of humor in \"Falling from Grace.\" Take flight with Poe's celebrated raven in \"Nevermore!\" as two improbable coworkers, Diz and Clarissa, find friendship and maybe a bit more in a comic holiday romp set to the dulcet tones of Enya. Features a foreword by The Rainbow Reader's Salem West. Sidecar carries a bounty of fun, a bit of pathos, and a few fine wine recommendations.",
