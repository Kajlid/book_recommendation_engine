  "description": "Dr. Neil Spector, one of the nation's top oncologists, led a charmed life. He was educated at prestigious universities, trained at top medical centers, and had married the woman of his dreams. It seemed too perfect. And it was.In 1994, it all came crashing down. He and his wife lost two unborn children. And a mysterious illness brought him to the brink of death. In his compelling memoir, Gone in a Heartbeat, Dr. Spector describes in great detail how he was misdiagnosed and, despite being a medical insider, was often discounted by his fellow physicians.As he recounts his own unorthodox approach to medicine and physician/patient relationships, Dr. Spector encourages readers to never surrender their power to a third party. He tells of courageous patients who served as role models, he conceded that doctors do a disservice to patients when \"we treat them like statistics,\" and he advocates for educated patients who can make informed decisions collaboratively and not simply follow instructions. In Dr. Spector's words: \"To recognize that we are in control of our own bodies and destinies can be a powerful step toward true healing.\"Readers of Gone in a Heartbeat will never view the medical profession the same again.",
