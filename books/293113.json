  "description": "A standalone enemies-to-lovers royal romance!  Ryker Hale is a freaking jerk. He became the prince of my country overnight and I have resented him for years ever since. Everyone admires him and treats him like a god, and yet all I can remember when I see him are all those times he made fun of and teased me in high school. It’s just my luck that the prince has a job opening for a dog-sitter position right around the time I lose my job. I need money soon and with nothing to lose, of course I apply, despite how slim my chances are. or how much I loathe the idea of working for him. The last thing I expected was to get hired, though. I also didn’t expect for Prince Ryker to remember me at all, yet he does. And now that he remembers, he wants me all to himself. A part of me wants to punch him right in his beautiful face for how he treated me, but I’m starting to realize he’s a changed man, and with each passing day I spend in his palace, I feel myself falling for him more and more.  I'm clearly out of my mind.",
