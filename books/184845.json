  "description": "Every February 14th, Harry comes back to town, his pickaxe stained with blood, waiting in the shadows of the Hanniger Mine, just for someone to kill, should they not heed his warning. IT COULD BE YOU!\nEvery slasher film fan has seen the 1981 My Bloody Valentine, the unforgettable story of a coal mining town drenched in shadows, of a love triangle threatening to destroy a friendship, of an insane miner desperate for revenge, and of one night where the local kids don't pay attention. Filmed in a real coal mining community in Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Island, this film has always been one of the most recognized slasher films out there, up with Friday the 13th, Halloween, Prom Night, Black Christmas and Sleepaway Camp. The screenplay is just as much fun to read as the film is to watch!",
