  "title": "Clay Parker: Growing Up Gay in 1953",
  "description": "Clay Growing Up Gay in 1953, is the story of a fourteen-year-old boy confused by his feelings, thoughts and dreams as he reaches adolescence and finds his sexual interests are in other teenaged boys. But it's 1953, a time of conservatism and rigid family and moral values. To top off Clay's problems, he's an orphan forced to live with an abusive aunt and uncle who openly show their distaste for the lad who was severely burned when a house fire killed his mother, father and younger brother. He realizes they would be the last persons he could turn to, to help him cope with his alien feelings. This is the story of Clay's troubles, trials and final triumph as he strives to find a family who will love him after he is forced to run away from home after a severe beating by his drunken uncle. The book contains some graphic sexual descriptions that may not be suitable for children under 12, although it would be highly recommended reading for gay teens to raise their awareness of the struggles of adolescent gay boys in earlier times.",
