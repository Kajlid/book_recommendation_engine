  "title": "Breathe Again",
  "description": "Teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown, 45-year-old Mara Donovan, a human pinball bounced between her desires, her family, and her deteriorating mental health, confronts a beastly diagnosis that threatens her already fragile sense of self; but when her usual tactics to cage the beast fail, Mara must accept the beast for what it really is before it destroys all that she holds dear. Married to the man of her dreams, with a child she adores, a younger sister who idolizes her, and the best friend anyone could ever wish for, Mara can see no reason why she's so angry. She reaches out to her doctor in hopes of getting a prescription for anxiety but ends up getting much more than she initially expected. The diagnosis turns her life upside down and leads Mara on a rollercoaster of a journey as she stumbles towards wellness.",
