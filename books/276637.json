  "description": "Rafferty Kaminski is a 13-year-old who believes in facts. Not like his Cryptozoologist father, who searches for creatures not proven to exist. When their father disappears in the Flinders Ranges, strange things start happening to Raff and his younger sister Zara. They learn their father belongs to a secret organisation and they are suddenly being pursued by Bunyip hunters. Raff is drawn into the weird world of cryptozoology as he and Zara follow ‘sightings’ of creatures around country Victoria. Will they find their father? And what is the ancient voice that only Raff can hear, as they approach the Wombat State Forest?",
