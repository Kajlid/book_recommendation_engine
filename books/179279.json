  "title": "Impetus: Ghazals",
  "description": "This chapbook of ghazals explores the struggle to reconcile life's duties and artistic pursuits; to essentially stop the proverbial wheel and carve out valued time for indulging in our soul's work, or simply being. Our bodies can become drones or cages, often feeling constricted or boxed in, searching for a small space to forge a different way, a porthole or exit point; to spread quiet, burning wings.",
