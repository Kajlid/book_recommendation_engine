  "description": "City girl finds love with a country boy?That only happens in the movies.Or at least that’s what single mom Ronnie tells herself when she sees the hunky cowboy on her aunt’s farm. It's fine to take the occasional peek at his broad shoulders and irresistible grin, but no way is she interested in getting to know him. Why bother? She’s only in town for a couple of months, and with one giant heartbreak already hanging over her head, she has no desire to open herself up for another one.Noah is in complete agreement. Love doesn’t have a place in his life, not after his disastrous relationship history. Even if it did, he wouldn’t choose Ronnie, who clearly thinks she’s too good for small-town life.But something about Harvest Ranch puts Ronnie off her game, and she can’t seem to stop making a fool of herself around Noah—who is turning out to be a nice guy, darn it!Will Harvest Ranch work its magic and help these two opposites find love? Or will Ronnie leave her heart behind in this small town?If you love the first flowers of spring, the sunlight dancing off rain drops, and a warm breeze brushing across your skin, then you'll love Harvest Ranch in the springtime.Come for a visit or stay for a while, you're always welcome in this small town.Each book in the series can be read as a standalone story.",
