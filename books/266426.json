  "description": "Twenty-six years ago, brilliant scholar, Rupert Westmacott-Jones disappeared. He was never found - at least not all of him. After a horrific tableau, featuring part of Rupert's body was found, similarities were drawn between a piece of art produced by his brother, Roland. The police focused on Roland as the prime suspect. Their conviction grew stronger as more body parts were displayed in bizarre settings. Unable to gather enough evidence to prove his guilt, the investigation was relegated to a cold case. Roland's now a famous artist. He's a loner, but he's never alone - the past is always with him.",
