  "title": "My Brother's Voice: How a Young Hungarian Boy Survived the Holocaust, a True Story",
  "description": "Stephen Nasser somehow dug deep within his soul to survive the brutal and inhumane treatement his captors inflicted on the Jews. He was the only one of his family to survive--but the memory of his brother's dying words compelled him to live. Stephen's account of the Holocaust, told in the refreshingly direct and optimistic language of a young boy, appeals to both younger audiences and his contemporaries. Written in a straightforward, narrative style, Nasser avoids the cloying or maudlin language that characterizes some stories of the Holocaust. Perhaps it's for that reason readers will find his book one they won't forget--and one they recommend to others as a \"must read.\"",
