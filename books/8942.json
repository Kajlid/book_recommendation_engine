  "title": "The Noble Ones",
  "description": "On the surface, Aidan's life seems no different from any other young man living during the waning years of the 18th century; he has a charming girlfriend, a thriving clock shop, and a sizable stretch of land. While repairing his late father's pocket watch, he deciphers a hidden message that unlocks the truth of his lineage and plunges him into a world filled with the fantastical. Aidan's journey takes him through enchanted forests, across sprawling country sides, and into the underbelly of corrupt cities where he battles political adversaries who will stop at nothing to maintain the status quo.",
