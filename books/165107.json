  "description": "Brownie, Apollo, and their ragtag group of strays have raided the grocery store and defeated some very mean mutts--but now they've run out of food. So when the crew discovers a nearby Twonkies factory, and all the Twonkies they could ever eat, they think they've got it made.The only catch is the cat guarding the factory--and this \"cat\" is MUCH bigger, and far more sophisticated, than any feline they've ever met. Can the dogs and their friends defeat their foe and claim the Twonkies for themselves?The Proimos father-son team returns with another irreverent, dog-filled take on the apocalypse, told in a graphic novel paper-over-board format. The instantly accessible artwork and laughs on each page will charm everyone from the most reluctant reader to the coolest of cats (humans and animals alike)!",
