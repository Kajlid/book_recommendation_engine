  "description": "I don’t have time for an unplanned visit home to help out in my father’s struggling letterpress shop. My stint in Vermont will have to be short, for a couple of reasons: One, I’m a busy executive trying to climb the corporate ladder. Two, my ex is still my dad’s right-hand man in the shop. And I am not over him. Nothing has changed at the Burlington shop. Auden still has his infuriatingly sexy Scottish accent. He’s still hot, and still stubborn. Between operating the antique press with his shirtsleeves rolled up, and moonlighting at Burlington’s hottest inclusive wine bar, he pushes every one of my attraction buttons. My falling-in-love-again buttons, too. Except I’m his polar opposite. I love change, and taking chances. Everything he avoids in life. So why am I trying to convince him to reach for more than we’ve ever dreamed of—the possibility of forever? Turnabout is a second-chance romance with interfering family, groveling, and a large helping of artisan stationery geekery.",
