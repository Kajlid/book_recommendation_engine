  "description": "I'm not ready to be a single dad . . .  I had my life all figured out. Hockey. A revolving door of women. No strings. No worries. Until my sister runs off with a man she's just met and leaves my nine-year-old niece in my living room with nothing but a backpack, a stuffed snake named Leo, and a broken heart. I need help. Elle Hurst was only supposed to be in my life for one night--a curvy distraction with a big heart and a wicked sense of humor. But she's volunteered to watch Chloe while she's in town, and I have no choice but to let her. It can't last. She has an expiration date, a life to get back to in Savannah, and I don't do relationships. I know people don't stick around no matter how much you want them to--it's a lesson I've been taught my whole life. I won't risk losing my heart . . . or will I?",
