  "description": "Chemist Dr. Joan \"Nosey\" Parkerâ€™s ability to identify scents rivals any other person on the planet. She can distinguish cane sugar from beet sugar, burning pine from spruce, and a man on the make from a man on the take. Combining scents and flavours for the food industry is her occupation and her passion.Joan is at first confused when she receives a reunion invitation to Madden High, the school from which she never graduated. After the death of her father, the family had moved away. Her estranged husband, Mort, convinces her to attend, and soon she becomes the prime suspect in the murder of Roger Rimmer, her high school classmate and a man with whom she has had more than a passing association.When the only person who can explain why she was invited to the reunion is found dead, Joan turns her olfactory skills to the investigation.",
