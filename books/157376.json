  "description": "Kos, a thirteen-year-old boy, talks about the most bizarre period in his life. His mother died a few years ago and his dad is having a heart attack right at the moment Kos makes the winning goal in the championship game. While Kos' father is in the hospital, it looks like the hotel he is running will be a big mess. But Kos and his three sisters do not intend to let that happen! Libby, the responsible oldest sister, Briek, the goth who feels best when she disappears in her music, and afterthought Pel, who is always cheerfully fluttering (preferably in a dress of her mother) put themselves together, and start to run the hotel, together with their brother Kos. This naturally leads to absurd scenes. Then it turns out that father is deep in financial problems. The hotel is threatened with closure But the children come up with a solution: someone has to win the local beauty pageant, with a hefty cash prize attached. Just guess who is the prettiest girl of the four of them? Exactly: Kos!\"",
