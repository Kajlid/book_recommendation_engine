  "description": "After the murder of Abigail’s immortal faery mother, the young woman is sold into slavery by her all-too-human father. Purchased by a wealthy landowner named William to care for his baby sister, Abigail is taken to a Grecian island - a mysterious place ruled by a Faery King, that holds a deadly secret linked to Abigail’s past. On the remote island, William’s family is endangered by the king’s thirst for vengeance, and Abigail and William's budding romance is threatened by her intimate, unwanted connection with the island’s Prince. To save the people she has come to love, Abigail must embrace the legacy she has long sought to deny. **The second edition of Abigail is twice the length and fully edited, uploaded January 2013.",
