  "description": "Jackson found his boys by accident, but taking the steps to understand what they need has been a deliberate decision. Only weeks into getting to know his pups, Jackson can already picture a future with Sawyer and Cooper. He just needs to show them that no matter what the obstacle, he’s their master by choice and nothing will change that.Cooper and Sawyer made a family together when everyone else turned their backs on them. Daydreaming about the day they’d find Master Right helped to fill the empty place in their family. As Jackson starts to merge into their life, none of the men know exactly how it will look. The only thing they’re sure of is that sometimes the best family isn’t the one you’re born with, but the one you choose.",
