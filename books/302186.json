Even worse, Jules finds out that Ty has never loved her. She storms away, only to have her ex’s sworn enemy offer her a ride into town... as well as a shocking proposal. A nice girl wouldn’t even consider making her ex jealous with a sham marriage, so why does she chance it with Roman? Acting the role of devoted husband, Roman soon becomes fascinated with more than Jules’s sweet smile and poetic soul. As her band’s fame grows in Vegas so do his feelings for her and what started out as revenge against his miserable cousin turns into something deeper. But bad boys don’t settle down. So why does Roman risk everything to win Jules’ heart? All bets are off in this modern and sleek tale of star-crossed love!",
