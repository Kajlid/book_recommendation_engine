She undertakes a holy quest for a lost elven prince that brings the gods' wrath down on her and tests her very limits.Oath of Gold is the climactic final volume of the epic that Judith Tarr calls \"the first work of high heroic fantasy I've seen that has taken the work of Tolkien, assimilated it totally and deeply and absolutely, and produced something altogether new and yet incontestably based on the master... [Moon's] military knowledge is impressive, her picture of life in a mercenary company most convincing. I'm deeply impressed.\"",
