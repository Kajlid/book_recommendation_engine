  "description": "Surf’s up! Mrs. Armitage and her dog, Breakspear, paddle out to surf the Big Wave. Soon the kindly Mrs. Armitage notices that Breakspear’s little legs are getting tired--so she swims off and returns with an inflatable desert island for him to rest on. Then she notices that Breakspear looks a little hot--so she swims off again and brings back an umbrella. Soon this silly pair is loaded down with flags, a horn, megaphones, and lots of other gear. What will they do when the Big Wave finally arrives?",
