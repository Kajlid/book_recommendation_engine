  "title": "The Tumbler: A 16-year-old Boy's Live Chronicle of Auschwitz, Belsen, Hanover, Hildesheim, Wolgsberg and Wustegiersdorf Nazi Death Camps",
  "description": "Azriel Feuerstein, a 16-year-old boy, was the sole survivor of his family after they were deported, along with the rest of the Jews during the Second World War German occupation of Hungary, to the human slaughterhouse of Auschwitz Nazi Death Camp. The author penned most of these compelling words as events happened and within months of being liberated from Belsen Concentration Camp by the British Army in 1945. This first time told story makes for a gripping read. This book radically differs from the usual \"Holocaust Memoir\" by the way the author merges the, sometimes humorous, concentration camp narrative with his conversations with an elderly Swedish lady, Froken (Miss) Ulle, who worked at the boarding school that took him in after the dangerously thin 25-kilogram teenager spent months of convalescence in Swedish hospitals. A father and grandfather, Azriel lives in Israel with his family.",
