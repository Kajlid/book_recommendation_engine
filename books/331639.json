  "description": "My match-making mother tortured my omega sisters in pursuit of her kind of happily-ever-afters and generous dowries. So when my heat starts abruptly, I know the posh hell that’s coming. My marriage is arranged. Without me.Too bad for mum, I take after my crime-savvy sister. I won’t ever be some pack’s omega, some alphas’ obedient little wife. I’d rather fake it as a beta--and take my chances outside the gilded cage.With fake beta identity documents, heat suppressants and my pet snake, I disappear into the night. An enterprising girl like me can make it on my own. But when Grey Akiva, the head of Akiva Security, catches me stealing, he can’t resist turning into my brutal white knight.Determined to save me from a life of crime, the sexy former SEAL gives me a choice: a year at Akiva Academy–aka his brutal military school for mercenary assholes–or jail. Worse yet, he recruits his two SEAL besties to help out. The twins Khyler and Benedict are gorgeous, maddening, and my new roommates.Will my omega nature make me cave to these three alluring, dangerous men trying to reform me, or will I beat them on their own playing field? The game is on.",
