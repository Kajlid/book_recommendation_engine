  "description": "To maintain the integrity of their reputation as the galaxy's mercenary elite, the soldiers of the barren world of Metzada adhere to a rigid code of loyalty and honor reminiscent of their Jewish-Israeli ancestors. When a veteran soldier apparently betrays the code, it becomes the ongoing task of his nephew to terminate himif he can. With the same gritty realism found in Emile and the Dutchman , this delivers fact-paced sf action-adventure with a refreshing twist.",
