Her Bramble B&B Christmas blog has just gone viral attracting the attention of a two-timing man who hurt her very badly. Getting out of town for Christmas is her only way to find peace. Instead she finds herself trapped on a vacation with a bickering couple and their two spoiled children, as well as a young married couple who barely speak to one another. The tension is almost unbearable--and then a blizzard hits, stranding them all in a remote ski lodge for the holidays.Christmas is looking like a write-off, until Marshall suggests they make the best of what they have, and work together. Eliza is surprised to find that the avid outdoorsman has a special touch with people...and with her in particular. Soon she realizes Marshall isn't just fixing Christmas--but her broken heart, too.",
