  "description": "For as long as I remember I've heard them. Voices. By the time I turned 12 my mom was positive I'd lost my mind so she went ahead and hospitalized me. The voices couldn't get to me there. It was the best two and half years of my life. Except I'm out now and even though I've moved and gone away to school, I still can't escape them.Before she died my grandma told me I was special and that what I have is a gift. All I know is that if this is a gift then it's probably the worst gift I've ever been given. I just want to be normal like every other girl on the planet. That is until him. Ryan could hear the voices too and even better, he knew where they came from and the real reason I had this so called gift to begin with. Suddenly I don't feel like such a freak anymore. If a guy that looks and acts like Ryan understands it then maybe it really is the gift my grandma believed it to be. Maybe I'm different but in a good way.At least that's how I felt until I learned the truth. Now all I know is, nothing will ever be the same again...",
