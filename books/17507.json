She propositions him, never realizing he’s had it bad for her since he first saw her luscious bod in a bikini a decade before. She plans a brief, hot, sexy encounter at the firehouse—in, out, done. But that quickly turns into a series of lusty hook-ups that neither can resist.Smokie is a wolf shapeshifter, so he knows the scorching sex with a human isn’t going to lead to anything more. Besides, Olivia insists it’s just a fling—no more relationships for her. Then a mystical seer declares they are true mates.Smokie thinks he’s too young to settle down and Olivia thinks hot sex does not equal love. These two are about to discover just how pleasurable being stuck with each other for life can be.",
