  "description": "***This is the fourth book in the series. First three books must be read first in order to understand this story line.***  I was a pawn. Weak and someone easily manipulated. To be played with as he saw fit. Until YOU.  YOU shone light in my now dark world. It was YOU who made me smile. For the first time in this game, I had hope. All because of YOU.  The more powerful pieces on the board, however, were a threat to YOU and me. They would win at any cost. Two kings ruling with an iron fist. Allies or opponents, it was hard to tell.  YOU promised to save me. Told me we would win.  But then I was on the wrong side of the board. This isn't YOU, baby. And I don't know what to do.  The game is almost over and I'm counting on YOU. Tick, tock...  Warning: This Isnâ€™t You, Baby is a dark romance. Strong sexual themes, excessive drug use, and violence, which could trigger emotional distress, are found in this story. If you are sensitive to dark themes, then this story is not for YOU.  This story will make YOU smile. This story will make YOU angry. This story will make YOU crazy.  I hope YOU love it, baby.",
