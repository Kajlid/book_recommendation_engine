  "description": "Promise, Texas, is a good place to live with the person you love. When rancher Cal Patterson and his wife, Jane-better known as Dr. Texas-face a threat to their marriage, she leaves Promise, the town that's become her home as much as his. Will Jane be back by Christmas? Because, for both of them, the greatest gift of all would be her Return to Promise. Gold River, Alaska, isn't your average town. After being jilted by her fianc√©e, Caroline Myers ends up there-thanks to her matchmaking aunts, who send her on what appears to be an autumn vacation. Not surprisingly, they have something different in mind. Something that involves spending a snowy Christmas in handsome Paul Trevor's home-as his Mail-Order Bride.",
