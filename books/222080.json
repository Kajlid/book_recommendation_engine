  "title": "Sparkle: The Queerest Book You'll Ever Love",
  "description": "Often hilarious, sometimes touching, frequently madcap, and irresistibly charming, the stories in each chapter follow two San Francisco gay men from one adventure to the next. Told to you, the reader, as if were actually there, learn how they came out, had their first sexual experiences, got pierced and then tattooed, became drag queens, adopted a nearly full grown son, placed a personal ad, and grew up to become the best of friends. Along the way, find out how many people wanted Sparkle dead and discover how much fun the bars and back streets of San Francisco really are. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, and, in the end, you may just learn a thing or two. Your mamma never told you that being queer could be this much fun.",
