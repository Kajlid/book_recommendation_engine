  "description": "Even as the sound of modern worship has grown louder, the heartbeat of true worship has grown faint. This is a call for those whose hearts burn to see it revived— who burn with reformation’s fire. Who long to see the purity of worship restored and the Lord’s house of prayer once again reflect the fullness of His glory and the wonders of His heart. The Reset is not simply a book on worship, it’s an appeal to the broader worshiping community to once again re-order their lives and practices in accordance with the sacred and priestly calling they were given and zealously return to the heart of worship. About the Jeremy Riddle is a pastor, worship leader and songwriter. He carries a deep passion for God’s glory and His church. His heart burns to see purity restored.
