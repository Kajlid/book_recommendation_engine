  "title": "Eating for England: The Delights and Eccentricities of the British at Table",
  "description": "The British have a relationship with their food that is unlike that of any other country. Once something that was never discussed in polite company, it is now something with which the nation is obsessed. But are we, at last, developing a food culture or are they just going through the motions? \"Eating for England\" is Nigel Slater's personal portrait of the British and their food. A celebration of the glories, humour, eccentricities and embarrassments that make up that extraordinary thing that is the British at table.",
