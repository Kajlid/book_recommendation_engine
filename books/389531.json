  "description": "A Love Story for the SoulThis is not a conventional book, nor story for that matter. It is more a suggestion of something, a whimsical glimpse inside the world of soul. It is a tale of a soul’s journey into life. Colourful landscapes, evocative passages and poetic rests makes each page a pleasure to read and reflect. Its mystery is part of the appeal.The Garden is an elegant spiritual classic that represents wholeness and reminds us of the cosmic model of our relationship to the infinite. Taking up this book is like entering a gateway into a safe refuge of inner reflection. But The Garden is more than a book...it is an invitation to ‘a place where we all may feed and drink; a feast in which everyone rejoices’.Through meditation and spiritual alchemy, a Dreamer awakens his soul and befriends a beautiful lotus flower and together they travel through a magical landscape to recapture the wonderment of being young and the transcendent beauty of childhood dreams. The Dreamer learns to follow his heart and discovers it takes greater courage to let go of life than to hold on to it.The Garden is a timeless fable about growing up, getting lost, and finding your way home again. This unique book is open for interpretation, allowing the reader to bring their own understanding and meaning to the story. Between the words and images lay a hidden place of magical meaning— ‘The innermost and most secret numinosum of the human soul.’Colour illustrations are best enjoyed by reading the paperback version or viewing on a colour-screen device.",
