Detective Chief Frank Ford and his assistant Cameron patiently begin to track down clues: Lowell's diary lists a number of men -- any one of whom could be suspected of foul play; a man had been seen lurking around the dormitory at night; and Lowell's hair clip had been found near a bridge over the campus lake. With this start, and a few other intangible clues, Ford finally discovers why some girls leave school suddenly ... and forever.(from the back cover)",
