  "description": "What do you do when you wake up to a whole new life…with dangerous urges you can’t control?Medic Drake McKennan has never been good at following protocol, so she doesn't think twice about rendering emergency care when a teenager’s life is at stake—even if the young girl is in the throes of Were fever and any sane human should know better. It isn't the bright shining pain of the bite or even the wrenching agonies of the fever that convinces Drake everything in her life has changed. It's the way she feels about the blonde with the wolf-gold eyes who awakens a dark hunger she can’t control…and doesn’t want to. Sylvan, the Alpha of the Adirondack Timberwolf Pack, is the one female Drake can't have. And the only one she craves. A Midnight Hunters novel",
