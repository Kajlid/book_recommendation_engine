  "description": "Tortured Sinner and Fallen Angel have been combined and republished under the title Broken Like You.My name is Johnny, and I dance with the devil.At least, that’s what I tell people, so they stay as far away as possible.I never meant to get mixed up with the wrong crowd, but if you want to win a war, you have to get your hands a little dirty.The plan was to keep myself isolated, until an angel walks into my life that makes my dead heart start to beat again.She’s sweet and innocent, and everything I shouldn’t want, but I can’t seem to stay away.It’ll take everything I have to resist the magnetic pull between us, but what if Claire is the salvation I need?Tortured Sinner is book one in the Sinners and Angels duet. Trigger warning: mild abuse (not from hero), language, sexual content. Meant for mature audiences.",
