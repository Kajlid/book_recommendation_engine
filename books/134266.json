  "description": "It started out as a simple drive down a country road.Oh sure, Hillman was thinking about suicide.Oh sure, the dead woman is in his back seat was goading him on.What was the point? Why bother living?Who am I?Turns out Coyote has something to say about that.Coyote...and a Troll.\"Trolling Lures is a campfire tale on speed, a heady cocktail of remorse, discovery and the quest for redemption, couched in equal parts bedtime story and fever dream. It is surrealism personified, and if you're into that sort of thing, Vernon has a treat for you.\" - Dark Scribe Magazine\"Steve Vernon manages to wrap up about six varieties of weird in this story. You've got a talking trickster god who likes to switch between being a coyote and a Mountie along with a couple of ghosts getting it on by a campfire. Yup, a little bit of everything happens in the Canadian wilderness.\" - Wag The Fox\"The story is wild; creatures and Gods make appearances along with reanimated corpses. Animals, real and imagined engage in violence that is horrific but serves the plot well. The story comes across as if told by a dying man hallucinating on morphine, think Alice In Wonderland as enhanced by Timothy Leary.\" - Horrorworld",
