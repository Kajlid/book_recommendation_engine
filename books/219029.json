  "description": "A Grain of Sand uses incredible micro-photographic techniques to present you with high-resolution glimpses of the strange and wonderful world that each grain of sand contains.\"To see a world in a grain of sand, And a heaven in a wild flower. To hold infinity in the palm of your hand, And eternity in an hour.\" William Blake, \"Auguries of Innocence\" 1805Here is the world viewed within a grain of sand, thanks to the stunning three-dimensional micro-photography of Dr. Gary Greenberg. To some, all sand looks alike--countless grains in a vast expanse of beach. Look closer--much closer--and your view of sand will never be the same.Employing the fantastic micro-photographic techniques that he personally developed, Greenberg invites you to discover the strange and wonderful world that each grain of sand contains. See, truly see, the sands of Hawaii and Tahiti, the Sahara and the Poles, a volcano, each exquisitely different, and each telling a fascinating geological story.Red sand and yellow, white sand and black, singing sand and quicksand: Greenberg's pictures reveal the subtle differences in their colors, textures, sizes, and shapes. And as this infinitesimal world unfolds so does an intriguing explanation of how each grain of sand begins and forms and finds itself in a particular place,  one of a billion and one of a kind.",
