The Indians call upon their best, and so Abhimanyu finds himself pulled from his honeymoon. His personal life has been put on hold, once again. From the high Himalayan mountain passes to the endless horizons of Thar, the leads take him to a point of no return. He wanted to retire soon, but the call of duty stretches him once again. While the enemy remains elusive, the possibility of a mole troubles him even more. Will he lose himself before he finds the truth, or will he let the truth find him and kill him?
