  "description": "When Taryn Radcliff’s boyfriend tells her that he has no plans to marry her, she makes the difficult choice to end their relationship. After meeting Dr. Lachele, Taryn decides to turn over her search for a husband to the capable matchmaker. The day of the wedding, Taryn sneaks a peek of her groom and sees something that brings her painful past to the front of her mind.  Army soldier Andrew Dawson is used to being the hero, but he never expected that his mom would end up with something he can’t save her from—breast cancer. He chooses to move back to Grace Lake, Idaho—the town he’s been running away from for the past eight years—to care for her. He soon realizes there will be no time to date—if there was anyone to date—and he isn’t confident in his ability to care for his mom alone. At the recommendation of his Aunt Eileen, he decides to give Dr. Lachele Simpson’s Matchrimony service a try. Can he trust that Dr. Lachele has picked the right woman for him? Or will he regret his choice to meet his wife at the altar?  www.keirakbarton.com",
