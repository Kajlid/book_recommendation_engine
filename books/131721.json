  "title": "The Death Game: Caroline and Charlie - A Bloodletting Book",
  "description": "When you can live forever and recover for just about any injury, it becomes increasingly difficult to entertain yourself. That's why two vampires living in Flagstaff, Arizona in the 1970s spend their free time figuring out increasingly more creative ways to kill themselves. What starts off as a game, eventually tests their relationship and reveals more about who these two vampires really are than they ever wanted to know. It's a story about love and co-dependency and depression and abuse and murder and all the things that make life interesting. Author's note: While this particular story takes place in the cannon of Bloodletting and features characters from the series, I think of it as an aside to the main story and so I'm releasing it as a stand alone story instead of a numbered volume in the series.",
