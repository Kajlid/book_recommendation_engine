  "description": "Thunder Bunny was a surprise. She was the last and littlest one. But there was something about her . . . just something. Thunder Bunny is a poetic and stunningly simple story of one most unusual bunny who comes out of the blue—and discovers who she is. In exquisite collage, Barbara Helen Berger brings life to this remarkable and original story that celebrates the spirit and courage of even the smallest. Like Berger’s classic Grandfather Twilight, a story to remember.",
