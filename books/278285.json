Then her dad hooks her up with a oncein- a-lifetime chance to intern for Sabrina Snow—sixteen-year-old Hollywood starlet and the girl of the moment. From the pages of Party Weekly magazine, Sabrina’s life looks like a nonstop merry-go-round of glamorous parties, red-carpet events, and designer clothes. But Lily soon learns that being Sabrina and being Sabrina’s intern are two very different things. This first novel from the daughter of noted young adult author and Pulitzer Prize–winning playwright Paul Zindel is funny, smart, and sassy.",
