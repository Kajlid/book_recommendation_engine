  "description": "One awkward billionaire. One failed psychic.  \nA tale as old as time...\n  \nLola Pink\n He schedules everything. And I mean everything. I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I took this job. I thought it would be simple—pretend to be Mr. Dane Clark’s personal assistant, find the missing blueprints, and get out of the Clark Castle for good. But, somehow this socially awkward, tech-genius billionaire has wormed his way into my heart. And even if we survive this mess, I’m not sure I want to leave.  \n Dane Clark \n How do I put this? She’s…pink. So very pink. Bright and sunny and peppy. I mean, she has at least one hundred and four pairs of sunglasses. Why? I’ve never seen a woman wear so many sunglasses before: red, pink, blue, green, glitter-encrusted. I don’t understand it. As for her organizational skills? Abysmal. Her attention to detail? Non-existent. Her ability to frustrate me to no end? Spot on. I never should have hired her. Lola Pink does not fit into my schedule. Nevertheless, she whirled into my life anyway; and she changed everything. Now I’m stuck trying to keep my company afloat and the two of us alive, while Lola turns my life all shades of pink.       ** ** ** ** This novel is a full-length, humorous romantic mystery featuring a splash of humor, a hint of mystery, and a dash of romance. It's rated PG-13 due to some strong language. Though it's the beginning of a series, this book can be read and enjoyed completely as a standalone.",
