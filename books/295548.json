  "description": "With the campaign over, a new devious challenge awaits. I thought the toughest part was behind us. Stupid me. Now I have to live with the consequences of winning, some that make me regret ever stepping foot in this city. Day one in office I learn of the president’s true plan, one so manipulative I can’t allow it to come to fruition. But with zero allies to call on, I’ll need to work with my enemies to stand a chance at stopping him. At least I have Trey, even if our scorching-hot affair can only happen in secret. Until the best part of my new life makes his own deal with a devil, I’m forced to make a choice. I can’t have it all in this power game they’ve woven, and watching me flounder is just part of their sick fun. Or can I play the game, change the rules, and have everything in the end? Too bad for me, luck has never been on my side. It’s sink or swim here in DC, and I’m the idiot wearing cement shoes to the party.Power Twist is the SECOND book in the five-book Power Play series offering more twists, turns and HEAT. Each book cannot be read as a standalone. All five books follow one main couple’s relationship as it grows through a five year time period. It’s suspenseful, steamy, and oh so unputdownable. If you’re a fan of Tiffany Snow, Meghan March, and Skye Warren then this series is for YOU!",
