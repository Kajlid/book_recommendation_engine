  "description": "One day you held my hand. One day you loved me. Then you were gone. I lost the only love I’d ever known. Thrown back into the foster system, pregnant and alone, I prayed that you’d come for me and save me from life’s cruelties. Only the next time I saw you, it was too late. Doing what I needed to do to provide for my son, we were finally brought face to face. It should have been the best day of my life, but it was far from it. It was the worst. That day a monster took me. I begged. I prayed. I dreamt of you, the memories keeping me alive. You finally came for me. You were my heart. My Salvation. But sometimes the heart is too damaged, too broken, to be saved. And sometimes monsters have a way of coming back to haunt me.*This is a dark story. It is intended for mature audiences. If you need a trigger warning then this book isn’t for you. I have other books of mine that I’d recommend like Current or Tainted by Crazy, but not this one.*This story does not have a cliffhanger. It is left open ended as this is a stand-alone series and the overall story line will continue between books, however, each book will be able to be read as a stand-alone.",
