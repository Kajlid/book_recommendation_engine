  "description": "This is an alternate cover ed. for ISBN 0451517849.\"The daydreams which edge toward nightmare; toward our desire to be pursued, cast out, demolished, damned\" is how R.P. Blackmur describes the \"mode\" of the eighteen stories in the Signet Classic collection. By means of weird yet inescapably convincing fables Hawthorne explores the corroding desires of superior men and women. Thwarted in their pursuit of perfection, endeavoring to escape the reality of their existence, they fall prey to a sudden lust for the ideal and are unwittingly compelled to commit evils in the name of pride. Of the author's insights into the Puritan's simultaneous need for fulfillment and self-destruction D. H. Lawrence wrote \"That blue-eyed darling Nathaniel knew disagreeable disguise.\" Hawthorn's contemporary, Edgar Allan Poe, said of his writing that \"Every word tells, and there is not a word which does not tell.\"",
