  "description": "Jamie Nolan is a young cop on his first undercover assignment, sent to investigate Dmitri Teplov, a suspected major player in the Russian mafia. Jamie knows better than to get involved with the gorgeous nightclub owner. But right from the start, the spark of attraction between the two of them is undeniable. Everything about Dmitri is just so unexpected. He’s sweet and shy, and has a nerdy side that Jamie finds irresistible. Can this man really be a criminal? No matter if Dmitri is guilty or innocent, Jamie’s big Irish Catholic family of cops and his police captain are never going to accept this relationship. Dmitri’s dangerous and manipulative gangster uncle is also none too thrilled that these two are together, and wants Jamie out of the picture. On top of that, Jamie’s still reeling from a recent breakup, and Dmitri is unavailable anyway. Isn’t he? No way should this thing between them be happening. Getting involved with Dmitri Teplov was never part of the plan. But sometimes, the best plan is the one you make up as you go along.This book is an erotic gay romance. It contains explicit language, a touch of kink, and lots of steamy sex between two hot guys. FOR ADULT READERS ONLY. Word count: 79,310 (less)",
