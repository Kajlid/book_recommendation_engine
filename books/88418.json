  "title": "Reece Winner For The Win: the making of a teen humanitarian",
  "description": "When twelve-year-old Reece Winner's parents buy a pub overlooking the stunning coastline of North Cornwall, his life appears perfect and probably would be, if it wasn't for the bullying he occasionally has to deal with. But things take an unexpected turn for the worse, when his parents split up and his father's potential bankruptcy threatens to destroy everything he values. He is befriended by Kara, a classmate who is carrying her own emotional baggage, following her father's suicide three years previously. She offers Reece consolation and support, while helping him to face the tragedies that conspire to overwhelm him. However, she becomes much more than a shoulder to cry on and inspires Reece to chase an ambition that most teenagers could only dream of.",
