  "description": "1941. The exotic city of Alexandria is virtually under siege by the Afrika Korps. It's the Royal Navy's major Eastern Mediterranean base, and a particularly lethal threat to warships is being posed by Italian frogmen and their so-called \"human torpedoes.\" It's hardly the time or place for a British submarine commander to fall in love â€” especially as the girl in question is half Italian. Interspersed with scenes of naval action portrayed in gripping and authentic detail, the human drama unfolds, its actors ever aware of the mounting threat of a German breakthrough.",
