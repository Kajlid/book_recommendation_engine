  "description": "Being a running back for the Charleston Pirates and a single father doesn’t allow for much free time. But an invite to spend the Fourth of July weekend in the Hamptons with friends is an offer too good to refuse.While there, the opportunity for a no-strings hookup with a stunning brunette presents itself and I jump at the chance. At the end of the weekend Leah will return to Boston and we’ll never see each other again. Now, with the pre-season about to begin, a shoulder injury has me sidelined. I’m sent to work with the team’s new athletic trainer and come face to face with Leah, my Hamptons hookup—and our chemistry is as explosive as ever.The no-fraternization clause in our contracts should keep us from acting on our mutual attraction, but the close proximity my rehab requires makes her damn near impossible to resist. My five-year-old son is my priority and I can’t risk losing my job. No matter what, this baller won’t give in to temptation.At least that’s what I tell myself.",
