The case takes an alarming turn when the killer boldly advertises his new exhibition to be a replica of the famous ‘Mother with child’ portrait, Stephen knows he must stop the deranged killer before he kills again. When a team member is killed while in pursuit of the killer, the case turns personal to Stephen, and his team, and they swear to find the killer who seems to stay one step ahead with every new body that is found.",
