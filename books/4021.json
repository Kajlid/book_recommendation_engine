  "description": "Fort examines Italy through its food and the people who produce it. He discovers a land where regional differences are still alive and uncovers the rich connection between history, tradition and cuisine. The enticing sum of these parts--the food, producers, ingredients, consumers and eating occasions--is nothing less than a contemporary portrait of the country.",
