  "description": "An alternate cover edition can be found here and here.Brie Baggio thinks she’s ready… for marriage, kids, the whole shebang. She’s pushing forty, and even though she’s the Senior Anti-Aging Ambassador at Los Angeles’s hottest med spa, Botox can’t paralyze that nagging feeling that it’s now or never. But when she witnesses a wild act of public sex, Brie tears her marriage plans apart and composes a sexual bucket list of scenarios she wants to experience before she settles down. She has life yet to live, lessons to learn, and someone to find—herself—along the way. Smart, sexy, chock full of pop culture, Conquest is a love letter and instruction manual to modern women everywhere struggling to find love. Brie’s list will take her into the murky waters of adulthood, make her tangle with Sexbots, undergo Trinidadian cleansing rituals, and engage in full-scale social media self-sabotage, but will it lead her to love?",
