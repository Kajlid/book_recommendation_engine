  "description": "Shalia’s happily-ever-after is in full swing, and life couldn’t be better. Fulfilled in career, success, and love, she imagines the dark days are behind her. Then a message arrives, a message that could have come from only one man. Despite the combined resources of Shalia’s protective clan and Kalquor’s best law enforcement, there is no guarantee she and her infant daughter Anrel will come out all right in the end.Shalia has readied for this moment, but she’s still taken by surprise when her past nemesis shows up to steal her happy ending. Love and affection denied turns into violence and hatred…both for Shalia and the enemy who would destroy everything in his obsessive need to possess her.",
