  "description": "With her twins, Fitzgerald and Hemingway, back in school, Jane Steward can finally focus on her work again--managing Storyton Hall, and breaking ground on the resort's latest attraction: a luxurious, relaxing spa named in honor of Walt Whitman. But when the earth is dug up to start laying the spa's foundation, something else comes to the surface--a collection of unusual bones and the ragged remnants of a very old book. The attendees of the Rare Book Conference are eager to assist Jane with this unexpected historical mystery--until a visitor meets an untimely end in the Henry James Library. As the questions--and suspects--start stacking up, Jane will have to uncover a killer before more unhappy endings ensue . . .",
