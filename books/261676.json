  "description": "Portland is about to get a lot weirder.Adam Saint was never much of a sorcerer to begin with and would rather be at the bottom of a bottle than anywhere near the supernatural world. For ten years he’s done a pretty good job of that—and even managed to get his demonic possession issue under control. That little vacation is about to come to a very painful end.When Adam is approached by the Coven to find not only a powerful young witch who can see the future, but also his mysteriously vanished uncle—Portland’s supernatural sheriff—he doesn’t much of a choice in the matter. Old Saint Pete is the only thing standing between Adam and the wrath of the Sorcerer’s Enclave. Problem is, the people responsible are already on someone else’s radar. Vanessa Moreno’s life is about to change forever. She’s got two homicide cases that are equally horrifying, a foul-mouthed drunk raving about monsters and magic and other impossible things, and a man who spends half his time naked and the other half in the shape of a jaguar. The world has clearly gone insane—but if so, Vanessa must be mad as well.Because monsters, magic, demon kitties, warlocks and ancient gods hungry for new life are deadly serious, and this dysfunctional dream team may be all that stands between us and the End. A tide of vengeance and magic is approaching, and billions of lives are on the line. Maybe they can stop it. Maybe they can’t.One thing is for sure: survival in this world comes at a steep price. Always.",
