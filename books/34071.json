  "description": "Hung over and tired, twenty-four year old Jessica finds she has made a crazy bet to get a date with her favorite celebrity, Ian Drake. Of course the bet would be unthinkable except for the small problem that she made it with her enemy, Erik. She decides to use the bet as a way to prove to herself and others that when she sets her mind to something she can truly accomplish it.Erik is astounded to realize that Jessica has taken the bet seriously but refuses to come clean on the reason she made it to begin with… as a result of his asking her out. He’s just grateful she apparently doesn’t remember that part of the conversation, and in fact wishes he could forget it as well. Only…somehow Jessica has started to get under his skin, and not in the annoying way she has in the past. While Jessica is doing everything she can to win the bet, Erik finds he is doing everything he can to spend more time with her. Jessica learns that Ian Drake has a vacation home somewhere in Lake Tahoe and decides to go there for a month over the summer to track him down. Her schemes lead her into many hilarious situations. And, although things don’t go exactly as planned, Jessica learns a lot about motivation, determination and love…. Not to mention making bets.",
