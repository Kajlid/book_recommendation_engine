  "description": "The reason for writing about â€žThe Power of Intention in Islam - The Niyya\" is my critical reflection on the social spirit: \"Why does our German society primarily emphasize the material end result of a work?\" Despite material progress and our focus on material perfectionism, we are generally unhappy as industrially-developed people. Why is this? I try to find an answer and a solution for this.",
