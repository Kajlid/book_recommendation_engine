Haunted by her father’s death, Annie seeks out his protégé in the CIA, James McKinley, and is thrust into a secret shadow world that sends shivers of terror through her. For she finds James is no longer the conservative bureaucrat she remembers, but a mysterious, tortured fugitive—very armed and very dangerous. Annie and James are thrown together on a wild run that draws them closer to each other. Yet Annie is still not sure who James really is—a tender, passionate lover or a ruthless assassin? Who can she possibly trust with violence exploding all around her...and love perhaps the greatest snare of all…?",
