  "description": "Elizabeth Zimmermann's Knitting Workshop guides knitters from beginner to master status through carefully created lessons. Included are: Learning to knit, knitting with two colors, Elizabeth's Percentage System (EPS) for sweater design, yoke style sweaters, drop-shoulder sweaters, and knitting garter stitch, lace, arans, guernseys, and fair isles. Zimmermann's workshop, originally a PBS television series, has been a bestseller since its release. Now, it has been updated with color throughout and expanded with editorial notes, technique photos and drawings, and more detailed directions and sizing for some garments. The pattern section contains Elizabeth's famous Baby Surprise Jacket, now with row-by-row instructions, the Epaulet Sweater, the Heart Hat, and many more of EZ's beloved designs. A wonderful book for beginning, intermediate, and master knitters, who often remark that they return to Elizabeth's books time and again to remind themselves of her innovative knitting techniques and construction methods. The updated and expanded edition enhances an already classic reference and pattern text for modern knitters.",
