  "description": "Through stunning images, acclaimed photographer Rick Smolan tells the astounding story of Robyn Davidson, who crossed the desolate Australian outback accompanied only by four camels and a dog. Now, Davidson's exhilarating wilderness adventure is a major motion picture, and this remarkable volume presents both Smolan's original photographs along with those from the movie, TRACKS. As an exciting bonus, the book incorporates Aurasma technology that enables readers to point their smart devices at one of the pictures from the original journey and then watch that scene as it is brought to life in the movie.",
