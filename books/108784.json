Guy uses the child as a cover to search for his missing son, but guarding the boy hampers rather than helps Guy's efforts. He is soon entangled in not only the boy’s life but also that of the child's sister, the rebellious and utterly captivating Lady Joia. Lady Joia, betrothed to a man she despises, tries to enlist Guy in her plots to free herself from marriage. All of Guy’s warrior skills are useless when it comes to resisting Lady Joia. But should he? Or should he succumb to the passion simmering between them and learn the true meaning of love before they are separated forever?",
