But the race is on. Will America be able to save itself in time, and lead a stunning turnaround–or will it succumb to a European fate?With creativity, flair and his trademark wit, Australian Nick Adams deftly exposes why political correctness is behind every problem in America today, and why it is every American’s patriotic duty to defy politically correct mandates. He explains Americans face a momentous choice in this election year, and lays out a roadmap for an American renaissance.",
