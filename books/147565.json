  "description": "Banal. Lifeless and Colorless. These are the words that describe my life. I’ve made the right choices, done all the right things. I’m strong, intelligent and highly successful. I’ve lived scrupulously, loved greatly, and shared my blessings equitably. But life hasn’t been fair with me. Now I’m drowning in the middle of the ocean, desperately searching for the shore, surrendering to the fact that I will never be happy. Then he came along. Life is unpredictable. You can play it safe and resist change for fear of the unknown. Or you can close your eyes and take the leap with the knowledge that your life will change forever. Which one will I choose? My name is Jade Richmond and this is my story.",
