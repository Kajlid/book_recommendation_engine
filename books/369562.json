  "title": "The Goldilocks Enigma: Why Is the Universe Just Right for Life?",
  "description": "\"The Goldilocks Enigma\" is Paul Davies eagerly awaited return to cosmology, the successor to his critically acclaimed bestseller The Mind of God. Here he tackles all the \"big questions\", including the biggest of them all: how come the universe is so weirdly adapted for life?Paul Davies shows how many different aspects of the cosmos, from the properties of the humble carbon atom through to the speed of light - even the laws of physics themselves - seemingly conspire to encourage the emergence of life, and hence observers. Along the way, he describes the latest discoveries that are allowing scientists to piece together the story of the universe in unprecedented detail. And he explains why, despite spectacular progress, scientists are now more divided than ever on such fundamental questions as: What are the laws of physcis and where do they come from? Is a theory of everything within our grasp? What is the universe made of and how did it begin? Is there just one universe or many? What happened before the big bang? Above all, why is the universe so uncannily bio-friendly?When tackling these questions, and so many others at the forefront of research, Paul Davies gets to the very heart of what makes the universe tick. Whether he is explaining dark matter or dark energy, string theory or the multiverse, Davies skillfully decodes the science and traces the profound implications for our understanding of mankind's place in the universe.",
