  "description": "As a pilot and a smuggler, Lenna has spent her life flying under the radar in Coalition space--taking care of herself, not relying on anyone. She's always liked it that way.  But now she's stranded without any resources on a stone-age planet, and the only way to survive is to hook up with a bunch of cavemen. She'll do whatever she needs to do in order to survive in their world--even if it means letting one of them take her as a mate.  She doesn't expect to like it. Or like him. Or lose her heart in the process.",
