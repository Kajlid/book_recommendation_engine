  "description": "The Scream is a single story by Rohinton Mistry, to date his shortest book! And what a gem it is.Set in a Bombay apartment, The Scream is narrated by a man at the end of his life, who is angry at the predicament of old age, at his isolation from his family and from a world that no longer understands him. He rails and raves in ways that are both hilarious and moving, and which touch us with recognition. Printed originally in a limited edition of 150 copies that was sold exclusively by World Literacy of Canada as a fundraiser for their organization, The Scream was exquisitely produced and featured original artwork by the celebrated Canadian artist Tony Urquhart. This is the first trade edition of this treasure, which will retain beautiful production values as well as all of Tony Urquhart’s colourful, dynamic artwork, which was inspired by the story. This gorgeous little book is a must-have for all of Rohinton Mistry’s fans, for their own shelves as a collector’s item and as the perfect gift.",
