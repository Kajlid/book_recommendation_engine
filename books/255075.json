I call it clever research.It gets me what I want and when I want it.When I get bored, I move on.My system works like a charm…Until a little ray of SUNSHINE shows up.***Dating is nonexistent for me.I’m quirky, silly, and inexperienced.This means my romantic life is certainly lacking.I don’t date because no one’s interested.Some say I’m an independent woman who doesn’t need a man.But I know I’m on the fast track to becoming a lonely cat lady.How many cats are too many cats anyway?My boring world stays that way…Until my future stepmother’s STALKER shows up.",
