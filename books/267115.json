  "description": "It’s that time of the month.Bills. Bills. Bills. They’re piled up on the counter, and I don’t earn enough to make ends meet, not when I have student loans and I’m responsible for the payments for my mother’s treatment. If she knew how much her illness put me out…she never would have forgiven herself. A mother’s love is unconditional…but so is a daughter’s. I can’t survive like this much longer, not if I want to eat and sleep in a bed instead of a cardboard box on the street.So I do the unthinkable…and contact the Cherry Popper. I don’t know the guy, but I know his reputation from whispers on the street. He’ll pay top dollar to be a woman’s first—and I’m so desperate for money that I’ve lost all my dignity. I submit an application to be considered and feel equally relieved and sick when he selects me.When I see Slate for the first time I’m speechless—because he’s gorgeous. So gorgeous that I would sleep with him for free. Our eyes would meet across the bar, and I’d be the one buying him a drink instead of the other way around. But I quickly realize how complicated this enigmatic man really is. He’s got a dark past, and instead of just doing my job and taking the money, I find myself wanting to know more.Wanting to know everything about this beautiful man.Pick up the first installment of this v-card romance now by clicking the BUY NOW button at the top of this page.
