  "description": "Without a morsel of exaggeration, its publisher describes this debut novel as \"a comedy of manners set in Victorian London full of werewolves, vampires, dirigibles, and tea-drinking.\" At the center of Soulless's \"parasol protectorate\" is Miss Alexia Tarabotti, a young woman who lacks not only a suitor but also a soul. And those are not her only problems: When she accidentally kills a vampire, it begins a series of events that she must set out to resolve without the help of any proper authorities. A charming mass market original.",
