  "description": "Derek Robinson, author of the highly praised wartime novel A Piece of Cake and many others, now does for the RAF's Bomber Command what Cake did for Fighter he goes beyond the clich√©d stereotypes of the wartime RAF and paints an indelible picture of real people at war. The young pilots of 409 Squadron are flung into battle over Nazi Germany, where their training, tactics, and aircraft are all found wanting. Their lively spirit of gentleman amateur fliers simply flickers and dies in the harsh glare of searchlights over the Ruhr. As they struggle, the reality of war comes vividly and painfully into chaos, confusion, and comradeship in equal measure.Robinson is simply the best aviation fiction writer in the business.",
