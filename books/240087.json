  "description": "When Stuart marries Marie after a serious illness, he doesn’t foresee her leaving him within four months of their honeymoon. She becomes passionately involved in protesting the badger cull, abandoning him to join fellow activists in the Gloucestershire woods. Stuart refuses to admit it’s over, feigning an interest in badgers in order to win her back. Though he’s accounted for her attachment to the badgers, he hasn’t considered her burgeoning interest in Henry, a handsome protester. As tensions rise and new relationships form, secrets bubble to the surface – including some which may have been best left hidden.",
