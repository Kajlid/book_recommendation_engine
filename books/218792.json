  "description": "Dr. Ivy Green likes to play by the rules. But when she gets coaxed into crashing a party, she runs into the last man she ever thought she'd see again, her one and only one-night stand. It's been ten years since they've seen each other, but their chemistry is just as palpable as it was that night so long ago. Only problem is, she's leaving in one month for a fellowship across the country. Luke Walker likes to keep everything close to his chest, but when he sees Ivy again, the woman he was never able to get out of his mind, he wants her. It doesn't matter that his dark past and dangerous present mean he cant keep her. After all, she's leaving in a month. What's the worst that could happen? Warning: strong language and moderate sexual content",
