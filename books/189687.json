  "description": "Bria Lawrence is an immortal ethereal beauty plagued by the culture of her kind. Vampire social order sanctions blood bonds, a union in which vampires become mated. This ancient tradition ties blood mates together in a binding contract, requiring them to drink from and love only each other. This archaic decree becomes Bria’s greatest offense when she grasps that she has inadvertently mated with not one, not two, but three different males... Alexander Stanton is Bria’s deeply buried past mate. His blood-red eyes, fiery hair, and demonic temperament have haunted Bria for over 100 years...Landon Pratt is Bria’s lingering present. His tempting dark features, admirable status, and professional success keep tugging at Bria’s affection...Aidan Collins could become Bria’s future. Aidan’s effortless companionship, charming nature, and handsome figure strike a chord in Bria, making her consider what could be...While Bria finds her past, present, and prospective self at odds, the malicious Stanton Brothers tip off the ancient authorities of Bria’s unforgivable crime. The Ambrosios are forced to punish Bria according to vampire creed. Faced with a Venn Diagram of tragedy, Bria must choose which male lives: Alexander, Landon, or Aidan. Love, betrayal, and forgiveness surface as Bria realizes each male’s precious life dangles on the tip of her tongue.",
