  "description": "A memoir from my early years of wandering. My life had slipped away to drugs and alcohol. . . Who am I kidding? I went willingly. Not brave enough to face the world, I languished in the throes of narcotics and booze and those unsavory sorts who dealt in misery. They became my guides on a nightmarish journey lasting for many years. I became something I'm not proud of. I wasted a lot of time. For too long, chains of regret and despair chafed my soul in a forgotten corner of cold memory. No more! Behold my reckoning, flawed though it may be. It's my truth. Sometimes the truth sucks.",
