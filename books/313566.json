  "description": "Our relationship is fake, but my feelings are growing more real by the day.Max sweeps me off my feet at our bus stop. He becomes my friend. Then, just when I think he might be into me, he throws me a curve ball by asking me to be his fake date to a wedding. He claims his buddies won’t leave him alone about finding a plus one. The catch is, the ceremony is months away, so we’ll have to be pretend datemates for a while.I suspect there’s more going on than Max’s inability to handle confronting his meddlesome friends. Especially once I meet them all and see how much they care about Max. I keep going around in circles trying to figure out how he truly feels about me, all the while trying not to fall for him.Plus One Bonus is the fourth book in the Table Topped series. It is an M/X (genderfluid) romance between Max, the newest member of his gaming group who misses home, has a secret penchant for manties, and can’t handle confrontation and Si/Simon/Simone, a snarky genderfluid tea seller.CW: History of neglectful parents and parental abandonment, a side character’s infertility struggles are mentioned.",
