  "description": "Does stuff like this happen to the Abolisher? Avenger Girl: I can't go on a simple dinner date without someone challenging me to a death match. Please, tell me that my cocktail dress shredding during the fight won't be on YouTube? TakeDown: Do you have any idea how much good Kevlar costs? But even Martha Stewart doesn't have any tips for getting super-puke out of body armor. Tesla Girl: Oh my God, surely I didn't just accidentally tase Iron Angel on my first field assignment. So much for being one of the Protectors. Lord Vile: Damn weather machine is causing hurricanes in South America when it's supposed to be giving me fog in Dallas. And all my henchmen do is gripe about their dental coverage. Remedy: The bastard's going to kill my partner, my beautiful Angel, and I can't stop him. Civilian vigilante laws be damned. I'm never going into combat without a real gun again. Bagboy: Wouldn't want to interrupt the self-congratulatory Protectors press conference, fucking posers. I'll just take care of the terrorists, and the bomb they're planting, myself.",
