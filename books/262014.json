  "description": "Marna Holm has never been in control.After the death of her lover drives her to deadly recklessness, she casts aside her trident and lives in self-imposed exile on a houseboat in Copenhagen. There, she gathers intelligence on local supernaturals for her father, to ensure the world is safe for the return of the Merfolk.When those same supernaturals begin to go missing, an annoyingly persistent local requests her help. Marna suspects that the Deep Dwellers, the enemy that poisoned Salacia’s seas, are also intercepting her messages and agrees to investigate...and perhaps avenge her lover’s death.But there are more powerful forces at play than Marna imagines, and the mastermind behind the abductions is someone she never suspects. Stopping them will be a gamble, one where losing control might be the key to success...or might trap her people in poisoned seas forever.",
