  "description": "Young people have stories to tell. They have things to say. Their feelings need expression. What better way to release pent-up energy than speaking, vocalizing from the theatrical masks of drama? A great outlet for emotional issues. Auditions, or classes. Easy to memorize. Ages 11-20 years, but never too old to relate to feelings and read this volume on Monologues for Youth.",
