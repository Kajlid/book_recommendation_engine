  "description": "Kaidia Valengaard is a warrior of noble birth. She is a callous, reclusive woman of twenty-five years who has lost that which is most precious to her and has become a mercenary in the wake of her tragedy. She deals only with those she sees fit until one night when the fates bring her younger sister, Nadia, and a host of assassins to her home all in one evening. The attack brings intentionally forgotten history back to the surface, re-opens old wounds, and sets into motion events that hold consequences for all of Valen.",
