  "description": "T.C. Boyle's dazzling new novel, The Women, will let you know. Having brought to life eccentric cereal king John Harvey Kellogg in The Road to Wellville and sex researcher Alfred Kinsey in The Inner Circle, T.C. Boyle now turns his fictional sights on the colorful and outlandish Frank Lloyd Wright. Boyle's incomparable account of Wright's life, as told through the experiences of the four women who loved him, blazes with his trademark wit and inventiveness. There's the Montenegrin beauty Olgivanna Milanoff, the passionate Southern belle Maude Miriam Noel, the spirited and tragic Mamah Cheney, and his young first wife Kitty Tobin. Boyle deftly captures these very different women and, in doing so, creates a sexy, gripping drama about marriage, the bargains men and women make, and the privileges and pitfalls of genius and fame.",
