  "description": "Eight hundred and eighty days. That’s how long it’s been since my no good ex broke my heart. And I was doing just fine without him. But now, with both of us playing hockey for Boston University and running in the same circles, I can’t seem to avoid him—no matter how hard I try. And boy do I try.It seems my former boyfriend is cockier than ever—if that’s even possible. He thinks by aiming his crooked, dimpled smile my way, all the pain he caused will be forgotten.Not a chance.No longer the same naive girl, it’ll take more than striking good looks and flirty banter to trip up my plans for the future.I’ve got goals, and giving Donovan Archer a second chance with my heart isn’t one of them.",
