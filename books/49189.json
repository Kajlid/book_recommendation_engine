  "description": "Tribes of the Hakahei Book 1Kim almost runs over Robin Hood in her car. 'Sir Doug' hits on her. She's stalked by an elf and a dwarf. Things couldn't get much worse.Well, that's what she thought until the aliens attacked.And that's just the start of the problems. When various governments start annoying her in all sorts of different ways she decides that it's up to her to end the war. But when she doesn't know what the enemy want, or why they want it, all she can do is do what she thinks is best, even if others don't agree. A bad attitude, a stubborn streak and a wonder bra are her only weapons and, for once, they may not be enough.The Space Between is the first volume in a 4 book series. It draws on myths and legends of ancient Earth, weaving a tale that moves from Sherwood Forest to distant worlds and outer space. It involves, amongst other things, magical gateways, Area 51, Sherwood Forest, sentient spacecraft, a 50 thousand year old intergalactic war, Machu Picchu and strong coffee.",
