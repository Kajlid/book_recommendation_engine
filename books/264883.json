  "title": "The Treasure in the Little Trunk",
  "description": "In the adventurous 1820's, when a boy or a girl's father and mother decided to sell their farm in New England, pack the family belongings in a covered wagon, tie the cow on behind and go West to build a new home--that boy or girl knew thrills and adventure and courage daily.That is what the Armstrong family does in this splendid pioneering story. Every detail of twelve-year-old Kanah's and ten-year-old Patty's journey from Vermont, over the Mohawk Turnpike to the new farm in western New York State, is alive with truth, color and interest, and the treasure in the little leather trunk, hidden away in the covered wagon, plays a large part in the wonderful year.",
