  "description": "Release Date: June 28It was just supposed to be a week long vacation for my brother’s wedding. I wasn’t supposed to find her. A woman I was inexplicably drawn to. A woman I couldn’t keep my hands off of. A woman who didn’t hesitate to ask for what she wanted. So what happens when the week is over and we return to our homes? Me to Las Vegas to prepare for the next season, and her to California, where she has a career she might just love more than I love playing hockey. It was supposed to be a fling, but I want more. And I’m not going down without a fight. It’s my shot… and I’m taking it.",
