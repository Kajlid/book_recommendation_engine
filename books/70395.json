  "description": "Being kidnapped sucks…but then you find your mate…Maddy Lane did not enjoy the whole “being kidnapped” thing. Then her knight in tight leather showed up to rescue her lioness-y ass and he turned out to be her O-M-G mate. Rawr. Sure, she’s a Sensitive. And, yeah, Sensitives are usually pushovers. But Maddy has been getting “badass” lessons and she’s got no problem telling her hotter-than-hell mate where he can shove his orders and domineering attitude. Of course, it’d be a lot easier to be growly with him if he wasn’t so damn sexy. Ricker Croft, council tracker and ferocious tiger, can’t figure out what to do with his deliciously curvy mate. She’s a study in contradictions and he never did well in school. As a Sensitive, Maddy is supposed to be sweet, pliant, most importantly, his. She sure as hell wasn’t supposed to be a vicious she-cat who sliced and diced a man attempting rape. And she shouldn’t have disregarded a direct order from a more dominant shifter. Even more, the words “get the steel rod out of your ass” should have never passed her tempting lips.Ricker knows that mating doesn’t equate to love, but he’s going to do his damndest to convince the woman who holds his heart that she can’t live without him. Even if it means turning his life upside down and embarrassing himself in the process.Pages: 158 ~ Words: 37000",
