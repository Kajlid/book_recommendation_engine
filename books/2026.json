  "title": "Fireproof",
  "description": "February 2002. A helpless nation watches as the city of Ahmedabad in India is rocked by religious violence. Before sunrise the next day, more than a hundred Muslim men, women and children will be killed, most of them burnt alive. Above the smoke and flames, the dead get together and decide to intervene.So begins Fireproof, Raj Kamal Jha's new novel, in which the murdered help script the plot, whispering from the footnotes, placing photographs between the lines. At the heart of the novel is its narrator Jay - a man who carries with him an unspeakable secret and a newborn baby - and a mystery woman, who writes with her fingers on glass, drawing man and child out of their home and on a journey across the burning city.From the author of The Blue Bedspread and If You Are Afraid of Heights, comes a work of fiction that challenges the way we look at the most twisted events of our times. Evoking both terror and tenderness, Fireproof is a testimony to the ordinary nature of collective evil, and to the extraordinary power of individual conscience.",
