  "description": "David is curious about meeting Amanda, the daughter of his new stepmother, Molly. When Amanda arrives, David is immediately intrigued. Amanda is a student of the occult--complete with a ceremonial costume and a crow named Rolor. Before long, Amanda has recruited David and his younger siblings into joining her in her studies. When she sets out to prove that there's a ghost in the house, David can't be sure if she's serious. Could the ghost be the real thing, or is it just Amanda's rather strange sense of humor? A 1972 Newbery Honor Book.",
