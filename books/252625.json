  "description": "Disaster arrived and found a home, a pair of coronal mass ejections destroyed the world's electric grid. Two hundred years later, pockets of survivors scratch out a living. This morning, a storm threatens as Tillion sets out alone to fish the Bonneville Sea, a sea born anew due to climate change. He must leave his sister with their father, a broken, untrustworthy man. \"Fill the barrels and return\", Tillion tells himself. But the sea's waves and the winds of the storm have other plans--to wreck his boat and force him to drift, as he may, north into the hands of the Blues and their righteous sense of justice.",
