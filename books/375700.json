He’s never forgotten his first taste of innocent love and the desire that consumed them—or the pain he brought upon her…But now she belongs to another…Her long ago brush with submission awakened a longing in Ren that drove her to walk the darker edge of desire. She’s become a beautiful woman at ease with her sexuality and unapologetic about her need for a dominant man. When Cole finds her again, he’s gutted that she belongs to another.

And though Cole agrees to this bargain, he knows he will never be able to let Ren go again…",
