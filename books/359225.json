  "description": "It was an accident, I swear. Jensen Vaughn may be the absolute worst, but I didn’t push him down those stairs. Not intentionally, anyway. It was supposed to be my graceless butt lying in a broken heap at the bottom of the steps. But no, the golden boy firefighter and beloved town hero had to take the fall meant for me. He saved me. And now the whole town thinks I maimed him on purpose. So despite our mutual disdain, I’m compelled to help the surly man determined to endure his recovery alone. Fortunately for him, I’m not deterred by doors slamming in my face. Because the physical therapist most qualified to get him back on his feet (literally) is me. Convincing him to put aside our differences long enough for me to help with his recovery was hard. Accidentally falling for the jerk? Stupidly easy.",
