  "description": "Music class and recess totally rock, but being teased in school and ignored at home totally stinks. Stefani Lucas is a rockinâ€™ sixth grader who loves music and dresses like a mini hipster in all black, but there's one thing cramping her style - her lame baby brother who manages to hog all the attention from her parents. When classmates tease her about her clothes and even double dare her to (gasp!) wear another color, Stef decides a minor makeover may be in order. Can Stef change for others and still stay true to herself?",
