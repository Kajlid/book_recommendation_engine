  "title": "The Magic Pudding: The Adventures of Bunyip Bluegum",
  "description": "In 1918, because of an argument with a literary critic who thought children were interested in fairies, whereas Norman Lindsay thought they preferred food, The Magic Pudding was first cooked. Thousands of children (and, just quietly, their parents) have been relishing ever since.Almost seventy years later, its rotundity and flavour undiminished, the cut-and-come-again puddin’ is served afresh in this special edition. Here, as well as the original illustrations, are eight beautiful new colour plates of all the favourite characters. There’s Sam Sawnoff and Bill Barnacle and Bunyip Bluegum and even the pudding itself looking dour but debonair under a clean white basin. All are studies of his characters which Norman Lindsay painted as a guide for the puppet-makers when the story was made into a puppet-play.For all puddin’ fans and for those who have not yet tasted this puddin’s magic delights.",
