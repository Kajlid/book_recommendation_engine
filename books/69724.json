  "description": "Get shipwrecked with Moomin on an abandoned island in the eighth volume of the beloved Moomin hardcover seriesLars Jansson returns with the eighth volume of the classic Moomin hardcover comic series, and the whole gang is back in action. Sniff is causing trouble with another of his get-rich-quick schemes, Moominmaiden falls in love with the inspector's bad-boy nephew, and Moominmamma is offering up plum cake to whosoever should need it. As always, the experiences of the Moomin family are poignant, melancholy, and strangely wise, with just a dash of the drolly funny and a pinch of slapstick. Without a doubt, Jansson's Moomin Book Eight is a treat for the whole family.ALSO AVAILABLEThe Book About Moomin, Mymble and Little My / 978-1-897299-95-1 / $16.95Moomin & the Comet / 978-1-77046-122-2 / $9.95Moomin & the Sea / 978-1-77046-123-9 / $9.95Moomin Book One / 978-1-894937-80-1 / $19.95Moomin Book Two / 978-1-897299-19-7 / $19.95Moomin Book Three / 978-1-897299-55-5 / $19.95Moomin Book Four / 978-1-897299-78-4 / $19.95Moomin Book Five / 978-1-897299-94-4 / $19.95Moomin Book Six / 978-1-77046-042-3 / $19.95Moomin Book Seven / 978-1-77046-062-1 / $19.95Moomin Builds a House / 978-1-77046-108-6 / $9.95Moomin Every Day / 978-1-77046-043-0 / $22.95Moomin Falls in Love / 978-1-77046-107-9 / $9.95Moomin's Winter Follies / 978-1-77046-098-0 / $9.95Moominvalley Turns Jungle / 978-1-77046-097-3 / $9.95Who Will Comfort Toffle? / 978-1-77046-017-1 / $16.95",
