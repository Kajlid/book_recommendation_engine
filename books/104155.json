But when her former master tracks her down, she has no choice but to turn to the one wolf who can protect her.Hunter thought ten years apart would diminish the craving he has for Angel. But when he discovers the rogue wolf in his territory, he must face the fact that time has only fanned the flames of his passion for her. To claim her as his mate, he's going to have to fight for her--and give her a reason to stop running.",
