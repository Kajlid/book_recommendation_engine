  "title": "Decolonizing Academia: Poverty, Oppression and Pain",
  "description": "Refreshing and radical, Decolonizing Academia speaks to those who have been taught to doubt themselves because of the politics of censorship, violence and silence that sustain the Ivory Tower. Clelia O. Rodriguez illustrates how academia is a racialized structure that erases the voices of people of colour, particularly women, and their potential. She offers readers a gleam of hope through the voice of an inquisitorial thinker and methods of decolonial expression: poetry, art and reflections that encompass more than theory.Decolonizing Academia is the voice of a Latinx academic mother passing on the torch to her Latinx offspring to use as a tool to not only survive academic spaces but also dismantle systems of oppression. Rodriguez presents ideas that many have tried to appropriate, ignore, erase and consume in the name of \"research.\" Her work is a survival guide for people of colour entering academia.",
