  "description": "Lillyport House was one of Britain's most haunted residences. Originally home to Viscount Eldon Davenport, one of history's most controversial poets, the house was sold by Davenport's parents after he was found dead of a gunshot to the head, the pistol that killed him in his hand. Reclusive painter Cameron McKenzie is the latest owner of Lillyport, and he doesn't believe in ghosts, at least until he accidentally raises Eldon from the dead. Enter parapsychologist Malcolm and psychic Trudy, each with their own agendas. Malcolm wishes to sever the link between Cameron and Eldon, while Trudy is attempting to keep them together. Will she be able to unravel Lillyport's secrets or does the answer to Eldon's survival depend on Cameron, a painting, and a guilt-ridden 19th century stable boy?",
