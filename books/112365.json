Kelli sees changes in Erik and takes advantage of her opportunity.This is what everyone wished for in Book I and did not get to read. Erik and Kelli 'doing', and less 'thinking'.Prepare for a ride like no other, this book takes us on a journey through the lives of many, primarily Erik and Kelli.Teddy, Heather, A-Train and the Bone are a few of the other characters that we are exposed to in this book.",
