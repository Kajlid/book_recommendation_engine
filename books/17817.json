At first, her focus was on worldly success and fame, but when she found herself unable to obtain satisfactory answers to her doubts about religious traditions, she began a spiritual quest for the truth. She emerged from her cocoon with Islam by her side, to guide her in her life and travels.In this autobiographical account, the author uses a series of flashbacks to weave back and forth among important events and places in her life, before and after she embraced Islam. She explains what attracted her to Islam and describes the effects of her choice on key relationships in her life. Her narration is laced with personal anecdotes and heart-felt advice about being patient in the face of adversity. Her experiences are woven together to create more than just a simple narrative; this is a unique account of \nthe Metamorphosis of a Muslim.",
