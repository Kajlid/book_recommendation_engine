When Chas Porter catches Samantha Redfern bidding on an antique candlestick that rightfully belongs to him, he’s furious! As his senior appraiser, she should be in New York, not flying solo at an estate auction north of London. But this is no ordinary candlestick; it’s the perfect mate to the only possession of worth Sam’s beloved grandparents took when they fled England. What she doesn’t know is that it’s part of a much larger collection Chas will do almost anything to recover. Even if it means insisting the delectable Miss Redfern accompany him to Porter Hall… \"A tale of passion, obstinacy and grandeur with more than a hint of intrigue! I loved it!\" Carol E. Vidal \"Great characters, rich history, steamy parts were lovely! More, please!\" Barbara Stolzenburg",
