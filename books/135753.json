  "title": "Tallaght - A Place With History",
  "description": "A historical Account of one of the largest suburbs in Dublin, Ireland. Tallaght is steeped in history and even counts composer Handel as one of its former residents. Tallaght and its neighbourhood has remained a place of historical interest, down through the centuries. Its ancient name, Taimhleacht, \"A Plaque Burial Place\" relates to its first settlers, a colony from Greece who were destroyed by a plague and interred here. In the eight century Talagh became home to St Maelruan and it remained a place of Monastic settlements until the twelfth century. Then the settlers of The Pale took ownership of the district and fortified it with their castles. Followed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by the gentry. This book recalls some of the people and events that have made Tallaght - A Place With History.",
