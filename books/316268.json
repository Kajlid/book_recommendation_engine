  "title": "Burning Questions: Essays and Occasional Pieces, 2004 to 2021",
  "description": "This brilliant selection of essays—funny, erudite, endlessly curious, uncannily prescient—seeks answers to Burning Questions such as: • Why do people everywhere, in all cultures, tell stories?• How much of yourself can you give away without evaporating?• How can we live on our planet?• Is it true? And is it fair?• What do zombies have to do with authoritarianism? In over fifty pieces Atwood aims her prodigious intellect and impish humor at the world, and reports back to us on what she finds. The roller-coaster period covered in the collection brought an end to the end of history, a financial crash, the rise of Trump and a pandemic. From debt to tech, the climate crisis to freedom, from when to dispense advice to the young (answer: only when asked) and how to define granola, we have no better guide than Atwood to the many and varied mysteries of our universe.",
