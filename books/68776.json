  "description": "Fifteen year old Fitch Boyd doesn’t mean to be bad. He just doesn’t like pointless, unfair rules. The trouble is Fitch’s idea of fairness hasn’t been the same as his foster families’, so one after another they’ve shipped him on. Now Fitch has run out of options - his next stop is the group home, more rules, and no chance of resisting them.Fitch has a secret weapon, though. His way with words has earned him a summer job working with scientist-geeks at a New England university, transcribing the memories from the brains of whales. There are rules here too, but they’re different ones and if Fitch can stick to them, while getting the geeks believe his ideas, he might be able to build himself a life away from the group home. In the emotional whirlpool generated by his family this becomes more like an impossibility than a challenge. It will take everything that Fitch has learned about himself and about the world, to keep his head above water.",
