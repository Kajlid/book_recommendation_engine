Hers: I am weak. I am lonely. I am a slut. I am strong. I am Dominant. I am independent. I am Seven James.  My entire life, no one has wanted me, and that was fine, because I sure as shit didn't need anyone else.

Five years, and a booming career later I am here to collect my revenge.  That was until a delicious plaything walked into the kink club I frequent, and rocked my typically un-rockable world. Causing me to break the one rule I have lived by since Daniel Alexander walked out of my life, never have sex with the same person twice. Ever.  Warning!!!! Hers contains sexually explicit situations that may be uncomfortable for some. These include FF, FMF, and MFM interactions.  Finding Willow: Where do you turn when all the bridges you have built in life have gone up in flames? When the ones you love donâ€™t protect you from the monsters lurking in the dark?  I never thought at twenty-eight-years-old I would have nothing to show for my life. A child given away for strangers to raise. A childhood ruined. A life full of dead ends, drug abuse, and one night stands.  I'm at a crossroads, and I have a choice to make. I choose salvation. I choose life. I choose myself, for the first time ever.  I will find her. I will find the life I was forced to give up. I just pray that he stays out of my way.  I am Starburst Bloom and this is my story.  Kink the Halls: Best selling author Dawn Robertson treats us to a short Christmas novella featuring your favorite characters from the Hers series.  'Tis the Season for an dysfunctional Christmas tale!  Seven and Levi are celebrating their first holiday together. Star is pretending to be domesticated. And new love is blooming.  Seriously, what more do you expect from the Seven James-Parker/Star Bloom crew?  One thing is for sure, this is a Christmas no one will be forgetting anytime soon!  This Girl Stripped: My innocence was shattered one steamy October night, when I sold my soul to the devil to pay for a week in a dirty motel room. Thinking I could rid myself of him, I fled the safety of the nomad lifestyle I had embraced my entire life for the security of a small upstate New York town, alongside my big sister Star.  What I never anticipated was a green eyed stranger that would steal my heart and never look back. And a dark eyed man on a motorcycle, who would teach me how to trust again. Both of them completely shattering every wall I ever put up to keep men out of my vulnerable world.  I am Paisley Bloom, and this is my devastating story.  Seven's Diary: Once upon a time, I had a life before Levi. It's a time that is sometimes hard for me to remember. But with our lives on the brink of disaster caused only by my own actions, and solely my past... It is time for me to give the world a look at my deepest and sometimes darkest thoughts.",
