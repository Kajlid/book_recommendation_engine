  "description": "When the evening started, Megan didn't know extraterrestrial life existed. That was before she was suddenly and very unexpectedly beamed from a bar to a spaceship, unceremoniously stripped naked, and then given a painful, humiliating spanking over the well-muscled thighs of a huge, infuriatingly sexy alien named Chaz as punishment for daring to resist his treatment of her.Soon Megan finds herself crying out in helpless, desperate abandon as her beautiful body is mastered completely by an alien warrior who is well-equipped to wring every bit of pleasure possible from a conquered female. Her best efforts to hate Chaz prove unsuccessful, and even when he makes her wear nothing but a collar it merely increases her shameful desire for him.But Chaz is not the only one out there with an interest in Earth women, and when enemies of his people seek to take Megan for themselves, he will have to decide whether to defy the laws of his world to save her. How far will Chaz go to protect the feisty little human he has grown to love?Publisher's Tamed by the Alien is the first entry in the Sassy Captives of Corolla series. It includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.",
