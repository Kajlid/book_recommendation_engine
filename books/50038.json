  "title": "The Coffee House: A Cultural History",
  "description": "When the first coffeehouse opened in London in 1652, customers were bewildered by this strange new drink from Turkeyâ€”hot, bitter, and black as soot. But those who tried coffee were soon won over, and more coffee-houses were opened across London, America, and Europe. For a hundred years the coffeehouse occupied the center of urban life, creating a distinctive social culture. They played a key role in the explosion of political, financial, scientific, and literary change in the 18th century, as people gathered, discussed, and debated issues within their walls.",
