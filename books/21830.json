  "title": "A Spark of Death: The First Professor Bradshaw Mystery",
  "description": "Seattle, 1901 -- University of Washington Professor Benjamin Bradshaw discovers the body of a despised colleague in the Faraday cage of the electric machine, and his world shatters. The police shout murder--and Bradshaw is the lone suspect. The public wants Bradshaw behind bars. The killer wants Bradshaw dead. To protect his young son and his own life and liberty, Bradshaw must find the killer, but questions abound. How had the Tesla coil delivered a fatal shock? Was the murder personal or connected to President McKinley's visit? Why had Bradshaw's best friend, Henry, fled to Alaska on the day of the murder? When Henry's niece arrives, her unorthodox views and femininity intrigue him, but danger and death lurk everywhere disguised as accidents. Has he come alive again only to lose all he holds dear?",
