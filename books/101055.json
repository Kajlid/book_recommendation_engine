  "description": "Five nymphs with special powers are called together to form an elite team to fight against natural and supernatural disasters. One of those called to serve is an idealistic young apple tree nymph named May. May joins the group hoping for a better life than he had amongst his sisters and father, who all shunned him for being only half-Epimeliad. But unless he finds his tree, May’s time with the team may be short-lived; his missing tree and lack of powers are a huge liability.The river-god Cydnos goes to the meeting to discover who is trying to manipulate him and for what purpose. What he finds is an old apprentice turned warrior turned trainer who knows more than he’s letting on, a couple of nymphs who can handle themselves, and a couple of naïve kids who believe they’re there to help save the world. On top of that, Cyd learns he has a unique bond to one of the kids, a distraction the centuries-old warrior doesn’t need. He intends to walk away, but his conscience won’t let him leave the untrained kids there to get themselves killed.When May’s powers suddenly begin to manifest, Cyd has to figure out the secret of May’s tree before May accidentally kills himself. If Cyd doesn’t, the team may end up lacking a member. Or two.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event.
