Yet his brilliance as an artist has often been overshadowed by the tabloid frenzy that surrounded his unusual life.

With each chapter, Vogel takes the reader back in time, placing the music in its social and historical context, discussing its relation to Jackson's personal life, and revealing never-before-heard stories from the studio. Featuring a foreword by Rolling Stone contributing editor Anthony DeCurtis and a wealth of color photos, this unique book provides the first comprehensive assessment of the \"man in the music.\"",
