  "description": "Gabriel had everything. He was a successful attorney, engaged to the mayor's daughter. He was handsome and charming. His career was poised on the brink of taking off, and it looked like nothing could stand in his way. So why did he risk it all to have one night of blazing passion with a male prostitute? When Gabriel met Nicky he had no idea what he was getting himself into. Manipulative and clever, the beautiful young waif was involved in the seedy underworld of the city. Would Gabriel be able to turn his back on the young man, or would he let himself be sucked into a world that could destroy his entire life?",
