  "title": "The Mill",
  "description": "Michael struggles to come to terms with the death of his wife. He has visions of her calling to him, inviting him to the beyond. At the Bereaved Partners’ Group, he learns that he is not the only one left behind who can hear the departed beckon them… to the Mill. This Greyhart Press eBook is a novelette, a book for people on the go. It's longer than a short story but brief enough to read in one extended sitting. What others are saying about The Mill : “West's writing manages to be both upliftingly happy and in the same moment breathtakingly sad.” — The Eloquent Page “...this one grabs your heart-strings and twists them like a knife.” — Matthew Fryer’s Hellforge",
