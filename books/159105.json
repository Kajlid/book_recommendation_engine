  "description": "Sometimes when you're trying to save the world, what you need is a different perspective.Amelia is not like an ordinary fairytale princess. She's airborne, literally. Prone to loop-de-loos and throwing lavish parties. She's a giggler, a carefree simple soul, who can't ever touch the ground.Hank is a worrier. About the increasing water shortages, the drought. Big worries—hunger, thirst, and the fate of his village. He carries them deep, but what can he do? He’s just a guitar-playing, surfer boy after all.But then Hank asks the Princess to intervene with the King and his big, looming dam, and sets in motion a chain of wacky events, a concert by Stampeding Fists, a cascading tree, the fall of a person with no gravity, the injustices of a jail cell, and a possible Political Protest gone wrong.And at the height of it all, Amelia asks, \"Guitar Boy, will you play me a song?\" and causes Hank's heart to play the beat before he can even answer, \"Yes, Princess, I wrote one for you.\" ______________________________“Such a such a fun read.\" —RB“a cleverly written magical fairytale\" —T Williamson\"love the modern twist and the addition of the issue of water shortage and poor water conditions.” —H Hawkes",
