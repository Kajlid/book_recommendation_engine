What’s certain is that they’re here and they’re going to destroy our world.But, hey, there’s no mileage to be gained from telling the kiddywinks that monsters are real.Morag Murray is one of the god appeasers, an end of life carer for an oblivious planet, keeping everything calm and under wraps until the day the world ends.But in the city someone’s buying souls and dealing the kind of magical drugs that guarantee a really bad trip and, if Morag doesn’t do something about it, the end of the world might just happen a lot sooner than anyone planned.",
