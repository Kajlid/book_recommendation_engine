As the snow recedes and the flowers bloom the birds migrate to Domino Park, and in some cases a little too early. The beetles emerge from the muck at the bottom of the pond, to everyoneâ€™s delight. Let the games begin. Chickens are found running amuck, and the Easter Bunny makes an appearance at dawn, to the horror of the raccoons. The whole crazy adventure concludes with a very unfortunate Easter Egg Hunt. That could only happen in Domino Park. 31 pages of full color comic strips.Show more Show less",
