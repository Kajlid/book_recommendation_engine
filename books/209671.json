  "description": "Sinclair Vinemont, an impeccable parish prosecutor, conducts his duties the same way he conducts his life--every move calculated, every outcome assured. When he sees something he wants, he takes it. When he finds a hint of weakness, he capitalizes. But what happens when he sees Stella Rousseau for the very first time?  Sinclair is a prologue to The Acquisition Series and is told entirely from Sinclair Vinemont's point of view. It can be read in one sitting.",
