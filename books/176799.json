  "title": "Vaccines: What Every Parent Should Know",
  "description": "Here is a straightforward presentation of the facts surrounding the controversial topic of vaccines, a book that confused and worried parents can turn to for answers and reassurance. Most parents have questions about vaccines that doctors are too busy to answer, and too many parents, as a result, are not having their child vaccinated at all, thus putting them at risk. This timely book answers such questions as:Aren't most of these diseases eliminated anyway? Should my child have the new chicken pox vaccine? Could my baby get a bad batch of the vaccine and end up getting infected? Comprehensive information on the history of vaccines, the diseases that can be controlled through vaccination, and the risks and benefits associated with each vaccine will help parents decide whether or not to have their children vaccinated and which vaccines to approve. With this essential resource, parents can make the right decisions for their childrens' health and safety. New! In September 2000, Paul is launching a vaccine education page on the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia website. Check it out!",
