  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Kalle Torvalds is about to be murdered. Five times. And it’s his birthday. Sure, he already has a hole in his heart, huge and inoperable and determined to kill him. Sure, he’s died a bunch of times already, fading out whenever his heart stops, waking up face down on floors all over his dismal foster home. But, on his birthday, it all goes from sad to savage when a homicidal math teacher, a lemon-haired monster man, and a team of teenage mercenaries from a death cult called Farm 5 drop into his world, all with a single goal: kill Kalle. Kill him to prove that he can’t die. They believe Kalle is a rare person--a Sentinel--born once a generation, with almost limitless vitality and strength. Farm 5 is determined to exploit him for him for his gifts to use him to rule the world--or perhaps to save it.",
