In persecuted three sisters and their merchant father have recently come upon hard times and have moved to the country to seek other lodging. They are directed to an uninhabited manor or so they think…Just who is the mysterious “beast” that lives there and his silent companion? Will the “curse” of the Masonic revolution ever be lifted from the land? Meanwhile, in neighboring many scheming mothers are hoping that their daughter will be chosen to wed the Prince. Rumor has it that he is in disguise searching for a bride. Will he find her? And will he be able to save his kingdom from being taken over by the Masonic Revolutionaries who wish to conquer Graceland as well? Written from a Catholic perspective, the two plots are woven together until a happy ever after ending is reached–complete with glass slipper and a beast transformed! (The first volume of the Catholic Once Upon a Time Series.)",
