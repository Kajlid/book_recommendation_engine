  "title": "The Administration",
  "description": "The inspiration for the Administration series of stories is a maxim of Chris Boucher, script editor of Blakes 7—There are no bad guys. There are no good guys. There are only better guys, and worse guys.One of the worse guys is Val Toreth. In a world where torture is a legitimate part of the investigative process, he works for the Investigation and Interrogation Division .One of the better guys is Keir Warrick, a corporate director. His small corporation, SimTech, is developing a 'sim' system which places users in a fully-immersive virtual reality.Their world is the dark future dystopia of New London, where Europe is controlled by a totalitarian bureaucracy, which shares political power with powerful corporations. The oppressive government uses torture, violence and the various Divisions of the feared Department of Internal Security to maintain power. The corporations fight amongst themselves, using lethal force under the euphemism of 'corporate sabotage', uniting only to resist attempts by the Administration to extend its control over them.The series follows Warrick and Toreth, and their families, friends and enemies as they struggle to survive and hope to prosper.Oh, yes—and there is sex, and violence, and other things that upset the people who rate films. You may want to know that: * Most stories set in the Administration contain m/m or m/f sex scenes. * Many stories in the Administration contain consensual BDSM of varying degrees of severity. * Some stories contain non-consensual sex and/or violence. * Some stories contain 'issues of consent', such as a superior exploiting a subordinate, or other cases where full consent is in doubt. * Two stories contain references to child abuse.",
