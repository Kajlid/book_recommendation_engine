  "title": "Evil Is Always Human",
  "description": "If you’re inclined to Southern gothic, this is the book for you. Narrated by the oldest son of a family of Georgia sharecroppers in the early 20th century, the story evokes the chilling truth—that neither good nor evil manifests itself until it comes into possession of the hands, feet and heart…of humans. If you shivered reading the short stories of Flannery O’Connor, you will when reading the work of this new Georgia author as well.",
