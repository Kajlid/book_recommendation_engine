  "title": "A Family for Old Mill Farm",
  "description": "A raccoon real estate agent is showing his animal clients—families of finches and foxes, deer and ducks—the woods, fields, and pond of Old Mill Farm. At the same time, a human realtor is trying to find a suitable house for a human family. Cabin on a mountaintop? Vine-smothered cottage? Mobile home on the prairie? None of those will do, and finally the tired realtor suggests one last possibility—a tumbledown property called . . . Old Mill Farm. Lively verse and funny, endearing art transport the reader to an intriguing variety of locations and make this quest both entertaining and satisfying.",
