He’s forced to entertain the possibility that someone he loves is a killer.Determined to find out the truth, Marty uses his after school job as a reporter at the local paper to gather facts and search through the grisly evidence from the crimes. Marty finds his answers, but a final showdown at the pool forces a choice that could leave him ashamed to look at his own image in the mirror.",
