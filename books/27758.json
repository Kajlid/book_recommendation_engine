  "description": "Kabuto Tokugawa was no novice when it came to war. He'd fought through his fair share of conflicts in the past, but this one was different. It wasn't about nation against nation or conflicting ideologies. No, his keen instincts told him the secrets held by the alien ships found at Alpha Centauri were the impetus for this new struggle. So dangerous was the information that he was willing to do anything to keep it out of the wrong hands.Gideon Krieg didn't join the Earth Federal Space Marines to become a hero. He was not sure why he signed up. Maybe it was to impress the girl he was madly in love with, or maybe it was to prove to himself he was worth something. Deeper still, perhaps it was due to the woman that plagued his dreams...sometimes his nightmares. Whatever had drawn him into the war, it did not prepare him for the destiny that lay ahead.Alphonse Zhukov risked everything: his career, his position, his friends, even his life in order to free his people from the iron-fisted grip of the Solar Empire.Each man's intentions were different, but collectively their destinies were rapidly intertwining on a path that would change the course of human existence forever and invoke the wrath of The Stygian Conspiracy.",
