  "description": "10 lives. 10 cities. 10 stories. Wide, Wild, Everywhere is a trip through various lives, experiences, attitudes and adventures. From a man who bristles at the kindness of others, to a woman desperately trying to piece together the life she has never lived, or a girl haunted by her hatred for her long-dead sister... and all things in between. A reminder of how all life is connected, except when it's not. And how much we need each other, except when we don't. The stories weave in an out of each other, shedding light onto what it means to wander this world, and the heartbreaking (or heartwarming?) fact that wherever you go...there you are.",
