  "description": "My name is Fynn Young. Fynn is pronounced as it sounds – F-I-N-N. I live in Mississippi in a small city called Tupelo. I was born in 1901. If you guessed my age to be 114 years old, you are correct. So how am I still alive? I am a female wolf shifter. I was born in 1925. When I was 24 years old, I learned I had a unique gift. I could change into a black wolf. I will forever look as though I am in my early 30s now. Being a shifter is something I have struggled with for 90 years. Coming to terms with it, I mean. I live in the South and I haven’t come into contact of any of my kind but once and he was no help. I don’t want to live in a pack, although they say packs are healthier and are more adjusted. I don’t have very much information as far as being a wolf shifter. I don’t know anyone else like me. So while I do my tracking, I also look for people like me who can hopefully answer my questions. I do know a little about what I can do. I can shift anytime, I don’t need a full moon. Silver does hurt very badly and will kill a shifter if it isn’t treated immediately. I don’t kill humans when I shift, I hunt for small game animals. I do love dogs. I actually have a dachshund named Riley. And as far as I know, there is no cure for Lycanthropy. When I shift, I transform into a 110 pound female wolf with hazel green eyes and thick dark brown, almost black fur. I chose to use my, curse, as I call it, for good. I track down missing people. People who may be missing by choice, or who may not be. I also track children who are lost, kidnapped, or are runaways. I work alongside my trusting companion Riley and two other friends. This is our story.",
