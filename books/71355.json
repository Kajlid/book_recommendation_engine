  "title": "Tears of No Return",
  "description": "When infected by the brain of an extraterrestrial, Karen discovers, among other bizarre powers, the ability to read minds. As she tries to grasp her situation, a secret branch of the military, devoted to paranormal and supernatural phenomenon, starts their dogged pursuit. They will stop at nothing to catch her, dead or alive, because Karen is contagious with a virus they hope to control. A virus that, if spread, would end the world as we know it. On the run, Karen meets Morgan, an ex-agent of the team that's on her tail, a vampire-turned-vampire hunter. Together, they struggle to stop the government from seizing the virus, a fate worse than contagion. A future of chaos, from which there is no return. “David Bernstein has a knack for getting to the heart of a story, and with Tears of No Return, he’s taken a classic tale of lovers on the run and made it boldly and genuinely his own. Reading Bernstein’s latest, I felt like I was reliving everything I loved about The X-Files, and Dean Koontz, and Buffy the Vampire Slayer...yet filtered through a tough, original voice, one that maintains perfect control over the story at all times. I’ve said before that Bernstein is who you should be reading now, and this book is absolute confirmation that Bernstein is a storyteller of the first stripe.” —Joe McKinney, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Flesh Eaters and Inheritance",
