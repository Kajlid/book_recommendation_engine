  "description": "They say dreams are for those who feel the need to be a part of something bigger. They say fantasies exist in the minds of those who are free spirited. They say illusion is what every man carries through his life until death opens his eyes. Everyone feels the need to get away from their own lives where predictability and monotony threaten to crush their spirits. They long to escape to a place where life keeps them on their toes and the risk of losing everything is always just around the corner. This story, which has been buried and forgotten in the waters and sands of time, has no boundaries, no safe havens. Fawcetta is a world of mystery, drama, deceit, romance, and is filled with action and adventure. The emperor of Fawcetta struggles to hold not only his empire together, but also his family. No one suspects they are being purposefully manipulated and deceived by one power-hungry man. Anger divides children from parents, loss and betrayal spurring vengeance and hatred. The fate of the once peaceful paradise is placed in the hands of a young Guardian named Kaina. She must find a way to find her soul-mate in order to open the one gate that will save their beloved planet from falling into total darkness. Othewise, Fawcetta's days are numbered.",
