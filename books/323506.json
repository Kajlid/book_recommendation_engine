A treasure hunt, in the heart of the Amazon Rainforest, for a rare blue pearl that serves as a poignant emblem of the aging tycoon’s childhood. If Calvin brings it back, Freddie will sign over his entire fortune.Calvin naively accepts the offer, but his mission quickly deteriorates into a fight for survival. He then meets Sheshoo, a native tribesman from the Komoro clan, who agrees to help him find the blue pearl in exchange for Calvin’s assistance with finding the black butterfly, the animal spirit of an enemy tribe’s chief.Through the remotest jungles on earth, Calvin and Sheshoo encounter life-threatening situations, but it's Calvin whose greed transforms into a longing for immersion into these immaculate forests. When rescue finally arrives, Calvin faces a startling decision — return to NYC and the posh life he always wanted or embrace the deeper sense of purpose he’s discovered.",
