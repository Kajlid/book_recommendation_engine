  "description": "Annie can’t wait to join the Book Bugs Club at the library, but Henry isn’t so sure. He likes to do outside things with his dog, Mudge. Reading is an  inside  thing, right? Henry is surprised to learn you can read anywhere! And after a wonderful summer of reading, Annie and Henry get to go to a Book Bugs picnic! Annie is excited when her new friend Sarah invites her over to play. Sarah’s house is full of frilly things—and frilly things are Annie’s favorite things! Annie and Sarah explore the garden and, using their imaginations, construct a magical house perfect for fairies and fun-loving little girls.",
