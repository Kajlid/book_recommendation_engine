  "description": "When Merleena, age 16, moves with her family from Las Vegas, Nevada to Summerland BC Canada she encounters Owen, an unusual English teenage boy who plays guitar in a local band. He's hot and talented - she's drawn to him instantly - it's love at first sight for both, a smoldering connection. His kisses are from worlds too deep to talk about. All elements at play are like reflections in a perfectly cut jewel and although Owen is a talented, powerful sorcerer he can't protect Merleena from warlock rivals all the time - they're attracted to all things shiny! The Farley coven is wannabe warlocks who need spells to sell to finance their drug addictions - but the murderous Blacklords are their leaders who won't hesitate to destroy all in their path, including Merleena, for profit and greed.",
