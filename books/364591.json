  "description": "\"WHAT'S THE USE OF ELABORATING what, in its very essence, is so short-lived as a modern book? Though I wrote the Gospels in this century, I should die in the gutter.\" --Herman Melville, in a letter to Nathaniel Hawthorne, 1851ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS HAVE passed since Herman Melville wrote his masterpiece. Yet Moby-Dick endures as an indisputable literary classic that continues to speak to readers today. Join Captain Ahab, an eerily compelling madman, as he pursues an unholy war against a creature as vast and dangerous and unknowable as the sea itself. In his monomaniacal quest, Ahab focuses his distilled hatred and suffering--and that of generations before him--against one single creature, and pursues it relentlessly.More than just a novel of adventure, more than an encyclopedia of whaling lore and legend, this is a haunting, mesmerizing, and important social commentary populated with several of the most unforgettable and enduring characters in literature. Written with wonderfully redemptive humor, Moby-Dick is a profound and timeless inquiry into character, faith, and the nature of perception.",
