  "description": "USA Today called Jo-Ann Mapson's national bestseller Bad Girl Creek \"a valentine to oceans of good women who survive bad beginnings and worse men.\" Now the author, hailed as \"one of the most gifted writers of the contemporary urban West\" (Los Angeles Times), brings back the hard-luck women of her acclaimed previous novel—and introduces another indelible character into their midst.  After finally wising up to her drunken rodeo crooner lover, Mary Madigan saddles up her twin border collies and takes her act on the road, leaving miles of heartache and highway behind. When she meets Rick, a charming and persistent journalist haunted by his own ghosts, she suddenly has a travel companion and a new lover (with an all-too-familiar set of tricks).  Their travels ultimately bring them to Bad Girl Creek, where the waters have already been troubled. Phoebe's pregnancy is life-threatening, Nance's break-up diet has turned dangerously successful, Beryl is still struggling to adjust to life after prison, and HIV-positive Ness is distancing herself from the \"healthy\" world—if you can call it that.  But these are the Bad Girl Creek ladies: they are resilient. The ways they pull together, cheer each other on through good times and bad, and cope with every curve life throws at them make up the heart and soul of this powerful and big-hearted novel.",
