  "description": "After the death of a friend at the hands of demons, Genesis Green lives and breathes a single Vengeance. Still under the watchful eye of Seth, her Guardian, Genesis now works with those who protect her. The goal? To minimize or undo the damage the Diabols are inflicting upon her seaside town. But Genesis, the hunter, is also desperate to find Viola—to make her pay for what she’s done. When the Guardian Council discovers Genesis is serious about taking Viola out of this world, they send Mara, a warrior, to help her prepare. But with her visions growing increasingly unreliable and her behavior more reckless by the day, Seth is finding it more and more difficult to keep her safe, especially from herself. When a single act of violence threatens to separate Genesis from Seth forever, she'll face the most painful decision yet to save the Guardian she loves or risk losing the one thing that matters most. Fans of the Twilight and Hush, Hush sagas will revel in this story of a battle that has raged for millennia in a second series installment that has been called ”intense,” ”gripping,” and ”a thrilling ride.” Download Today!
