  "description": "The third and final part of the Crystal Fragments trilogy.Purity comes in the darkest colours.At last, Kris Avelar realises that if she is to be all she wants to be in life, then there can be no one else for her other than Daniel Stone. With the demons between them laid to rest, she is at last ready to submit to everything that he wants, and to become the woman that he needs most in the world.Yet behind their perfect bliss she is troubled by suspicions that Daniel has not been completely honest about some of the dealings that he has engaged in, and that while she has found sexual fulfilment with him there remain dark predators on the edges of their lives who are waiting to circle in and destroy everything that they have.When Daniel is taken away from her, caught up by his own dangerous past, she sets out to save him and to show that while everyone else will turn against him, she is determined never to let him downâ€”or let him go. It is at that time that she discovers that her own submission, what she has thought of as a weakness inside her, is actually the source of her greatest strength.",
