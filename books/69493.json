What we need is a legendary hero, but what we've got is Cucumber, a boy who's better suited to studying than monster-slaying. He's just been accepted to the school of his dreams, but because his dad thinks his dreams are kind of lame, it's up to him and his much more heroic sister, Almond, to save the world . . . even if that may be a little more complicated than they think.Webcomic 01-137.",
