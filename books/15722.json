  "description": "Aiden has a few simple goals in life—teach his students well, find a stable lover and stop lusting after the sexy local sheriff. He’s pretty sure the guy is straight, after all, his son is one of Aiden’s students. It’s best for everyone if he keeps his eyes (and hands) to himself.But Knox has other plans. The prickly little tutor who teaches his son is pretty damn sexy and so easy to tease. When they find themselves alone for the evening, he decides he’s only going to get one chance to see if Aiden is always that uptight or if he lets loose when he’s in bed.",
