  "description": "'Would you like to watch us?'Shira is deeply, achingly in love with her best friend, Jean. This is unfortunate, because he's gay. But with one flippant invitation, Shira, Jean, and his boyfriend, Sebastian, begin their obsessive journey into the dark heart of sexual excess. When even their own edgy subculture refuses to accept them, Sebastian builds a new world with new rules to shelter the threesome. But the baggage they've brought with them can't simply be left at the door and, when the real world breaches the carefully constructed walls, it does so with tragic consequences.Beautiful Losers is the first novel-length work by erotic fiction writer Remittance Girl.(This is not a romance. I NEVER write romances. If you're after one, please don't read this.)",
