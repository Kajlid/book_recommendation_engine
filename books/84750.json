Growing up in an abusive home, he is left alone at the age of thirteen to raise his kid brother. Years later Chad still fights the pain he felt as a child, and the anger it causes, despite being a wildly successful rock star. “Chad [tries] to play his heart out on the stage; but he [can] never quite seem to leave it there.” Three years have passed since her husband, Paul’s, death, but Beth’s life is still shadowed by sorrow.The lunch lady/writer is thrilled to be enjoying a Trapped Under Ice concert with her daughter, Cassie. But when the concert is over, they are followed and attacked by two men in one of the stadium’s bathrooms. When Chad and his bodyguard, Pete, come to their aid, an instant attraction sparks between Beth and the tall singer. Will Chad and Beth be able to leave their pasts behind? Or will they remain TRAPPED UNDER ICE?They have to face difficulties from without, (ex-girlfriends who resurface, crazed fans who don’t want to take “no” for an answer…), as well as difficulties from within, (jealousy, anger, fear…). And just as the two seem to be able to work through their problems, someone starts sending Chad death threats. Will their story end before it even begins?More \nROCKIN' ROMANCE\n\n \"Abandon All Hope\" \n\n \"Between Rock and a Hard Place\" \n\n \"Rock Me, Gently\" \n\n \"Pitchfork in the Road\"",
