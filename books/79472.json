Freedom is nothing but a halfhearted dream until Pallo, a young count bound by his own unwanted destiny, chooses the beautiful Norla to be his suryan, the mistress of his household. Resourceful and fiercely independent, Norla plans to use her new position at the palace to secure her mother’s freedom.Norla does not plan on catching the eye of the powerful but wicked King Vaskel, who sets an impossible quest; if Pallo can accomplish it, Norla’s mother will be freed. If Pallo dies trying, however, Norla will belong to the king—a life of slavery far worse than any on the mountain.So begins the quest for Penumbra, an infamous criminal whose capture will bring them favor, fortune, and freedom. But Norla and Pallo soon unearth much more than a criminal: masked assassins, ancient armies, and a mysterious man who carries the heavy fate of kingdoms upon his dusty shoulders. Before the quest is over, Norla and Pallo must decide what they believe, who they believe, and how much they are willing to risk for true freedom. (YA Inspirational Fantasy)",
