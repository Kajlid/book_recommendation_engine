  "description": "Billionaire businessman in need of a fake fiancée… It should be the easiest job ever for an out-of-work actress, right?  All I have to do is pose as Grant Caldwell (the Third)’s fiancée for a fancy-pants weekend in the Hamptons. Easy. Wear designer clothing and sip champagne? Don’t mind if I do. Flirting with Grant? It’s so delicious I should be paying him.  Nothing can go wrong as long as I can keep my hands off of him. But that’s the hard part. And I do mean hard.  Because Grant is sexy.And bossy.And surprisingly sweet, a real rarity in his pretentious family.  Oops. I’m not as good at faking it as I thought. Or maybe they call this method acting. Because it’s getting harder to figure out where my character ends and I begin…It just might be the role of a lifetime.",
