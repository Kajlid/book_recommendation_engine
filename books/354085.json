  "description": "Sally and Brian are in love. But at the end of a wonderful ski weekend together, a car accident leaves Sally fully paralyzed. This powerful book details Sallyâ€™s struggles from her first moments of terror in the hospital through the months in traction. When her vertebrae have healed and she remains paralyzed, she must face the prospect of never recovering. Guilt-ridden at causing pain to her family and boyfriend, she enters rehab, navigating an emotional roller coaster ride and eventually hooking up with a dangerously angry fellow patient who introduces her to drugs and alcohol. After months in a hospital ward, she visits the beach with her therapist, and realizes that her life may not be over. First published to wide acclaim in 1987, this striking novel is based on the author's own experience of suffering a similar accident to Sally's at age 25. This edition includes a foreword by Sandra Richmond's sons, who plan to donate the profits to breast cancer research.",
