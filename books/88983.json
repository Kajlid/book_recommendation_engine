  "description": "In a small town off the coast of Maine, life seems ordinary—predictable even. People leave their doors unlocked and everyone knows who you are. But what if the things everyone thought they knew about you were a lie? What if the picture-perfect family was anything but perfect? Lexie lives this life every day. She’s learned to hide secrets, and the walls she’s built around her, have kept her alive. But Lexie’s about to learn one of the hardest lessons in her young life; secrets can kill. A year after Lexie Stone loses her sister, Angela, to a brutal murder, Lexie's self-obsessed mother walks out, leaving her with her alcoholic father, Brian. When Lexie becomes the target of Brian’s physical abuse, she makes a life changing decision...to keep her secret from everyone. A secret she hides well, until the night marking five years since Angela's death, when the secret Lexie has kept almost kills her—forcing her to face the aftermath of her decisions. The one thing that gets Lexie through the darkness is the love she carries for her sister, Angela. A love reinforced by their dysfunctional family and Angela’s passion for astronomy, which even in death cannot be broken. But it’s this same love that threatens to destroy anything good in Lexie’s life—including her relationship with Ben—if she can’t learn to let go of the things that are out of her control. And it’s not long before Lexie realizes that letting go may mean leaving behind everything she has ever known.",
