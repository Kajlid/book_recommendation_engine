  "description": "I got my big break in an Italian men’s club. Honestly… you can’t make these things up.All I’ve wanted was to travel the world and have enough money to do it. Simple, right? Wrong. Florence has become a second home to me. I’m in love with the city and everything it has to offer, but it hasn’t really loved me back. Making enough money to travel isn’t an issue when you don’t even have enough to make rent. But then I meet a hot billionaire. Yes, in the club, and he offers me a job. And get this… I can keep my clothes on in this one. What?!I’d be crazy to refuse him. Even if being attracted to one’s boss can never be a good idea. We work and play well together, but forever isn’t in the cards. He’s from Florence and I’m an American. Neither of us are willing to give up our homes. On top of it all, Italian mothers aren’t like American mommas, and this situation we’ve created isn’t going to be as easy to clear up. Neither is me having to explain not one, but two little heartbeats that just popped up on the doctor’s monitor.",
