Shadows shift when no one’s looking. Objects fall when she walks into a room. And sometimes… she just knows things before they happen. Her family dismisses it as coincidence. Her friends don’t notice a thing. But she feels it—the pull of something unseen, the whisper of a world beyond the boundary. The girl sees connections where others see chaos. Invisible threads. Strange synchronicities. Forces at play just beneath the surface.Growing up in a quiet village by a misty lake, her childhood was filled with summers and winters at her grandmother’s house, exploring the deep woods with her cousins. But even there, where the barrier between the known and the unknown was thin, she never truly understood what kind of being she was.A Tale of Secrets and Hidden PowersEmily Smith wasn’t just different—she was an Indigo. A child born with abilities that defy logic, a mind that perceives what others cannot. But without a name for her gift, she spent years trapped in uncertainty, trying to blend into a place that never felt like home.And now? The whispers in the wind are getting louder. The woods seem alive and watching. The deeper she searches for answers, the more reality itself starts to unravel. Some truths should never be uncovered. But Emma has never been one to turn away from a mystery...If you've ever questioned the nature of reality, Indigo Diaries will take you on a journey into the unknown—one that reveals what you've always felt but never dared to believe.NOTE: The Indigo Diaries series offers two different versions of its first volume: Gods’ Food for adult readers and The Adventures of Emily Smith and Billy Fifer for preteens and teens. The story continues in A Dream of Two Moons: Alien DNA.",
