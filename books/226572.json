  "description": "A lady out for vengeance collides with the one man that can stand in her way.The lady bent on vengeance.Lady Canton has a list. A list of men she is ruining, one by one. The work is satisfying—as each and every one of the despicable men deserves it—and if Livia has to bend the rules of propriety for success—so be it. What she doesn’t anticipate is a past love barging into her life, determined to stop her.The man that will stand in her way.Lady Canton threw him over years ago to marry a lecherous old fool for his title, so the last thing Lord Reggard wants is to entangle himself with her again. But when Livia threatens to ruin one of his best friends, Tieran is forced to take matters into his own hands to stop her.A second chance at first love.Livia never stopped loving him, and Tieran is intent on using that fact to his advantage. Never mind the callousness of his actions—his loyalty to Livia died years ago and he has no desire to revisit the past with her. Yet the past may be the one thing Tieran cannot escape, and he may very well discover he never stopped loving her as well.Note: The books in the Lords of Action series by K.J. Jackson are each stand-alone stories and can be read individually in any order. These historical romances are set in the Regency and Victorian eras, and do not shy away from scenes with steamy heat, occasional naughty language, and moments that might possibly make you squirm.",
