  "description": "If you're a literature fan looking for laughs, look no further. This collection of cartoons - many previously published in The New Yorker, American Scientist, Punch, Playboy, The Critic, even the Wall Street Journal - will make you think, maybe even think twice, and very likely make you laugh out loud. We could say more, but why waste words. The cartoons between these covers speak for themselves.",
