  "description": "Dr. Jared Gies had always considered himself a lone wolf. But when his oldest friend mysteriously disappeared from one of Dallas's hottest nightclubs, he was first on the scene. Getting past sultry club owner Elena Cabrera to investigate was easy. Remaining unaffected by the unexplainable pull he felt from the passionate woman, and keeping his shape-shifting a secret, was another story....Even more troubling was the sudden death of two more shape-shifters. Now, to uncover the threat to a world he must protect--and safeguard the one woman he can never have--Jared must completely embrace the wolf within.",
