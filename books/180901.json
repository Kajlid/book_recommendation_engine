  "description": "This is an alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B008E95UOK.KAHAYATLE. My name is Bryn Mathis. I'm seventeen years old, and I live in a neighborhood outside of Orlando, Florida. Iâ€™m here alone because my dad died almost a year ago, along with all the other adults in the world. I'm almost out of food, and the gangs of kids that roam around my town are getting more vicious by the day. It's time for me to leave and find another place to live ... a place where I can find food and shelter ... a place where they won't be able to find me. Alone, it might have been possible, but now I've got company. I'm worried that I don't have what it takes to get from here to my final destination, and I have no idea what might be waiting for me when I get there.",
