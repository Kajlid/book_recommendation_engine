  "description": "My name is Ace Bisset, and after a lifetime of proving magic doesn’t exist, I’m learning how to be a witch.If you’d told me a few months ago that I’d be burning sage and staking vampires, I would have laughed in your face. And yet here I am, casting spells and brewing potions while I relentlessly search for a way to lift the curse that binds my four lovers to the night.But just when I think I’m getting a handle on my powers, ghosts from my past surface…literally. These spirits bring danger to everyone I hold dear while hurting innocent bystanders in the process — which is something I can't allow, no matter the cost.My dark protectors will do anything to keep me safe, but as far as this new threat is concerned, I’m on my own. For even the strongest warrior can’t fight an enemy they can’t see, and if I don’t find a way to defeat these spirits, we might end up trapped in the darkness…forever…",
