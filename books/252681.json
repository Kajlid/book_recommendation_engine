  "description": "A likeable, intelligent high school senior, Mateo Bernard is new to Little Rock. Cody Redan has lived there all his life. Yet, when they meet, there's a familiarity, a sense they've known each other before. By turns funny, romantic, insightful, and sad, this evocative novel brilliantly recreates the landscape of late adolescence, when friendships seem eternal and loves reincarnate. Memory and Madness is a unique contribution to coming of age literature.",
