  "title": "The Six, and the Crystals of Ialana",
  "description": "What is Ialana? It is a mysterious continent in a world that once suffered enormous catastrophe due to misuse of crystal technology. The inhabitants of Ialana no longer remember their history. Are they doomed to repeat it?  Who are the Six? The first book in the series sets the stage for the emergence of six young healers to rediscover their connection to events that took place 500 years previously. There is no lack of action and danger as the six, with a seventh who may be a traitor, set out on a perilous journey across the continent of Ialana.  In their search for the crystal they must navigate over dangerous mountain passes, pursued by a vicious army recruiter, and through caves and tunnels guarded by mutant monsters. Who is the mysterious shape-shifter they encounter in the mountain passes and what role does he play in their quest?  In this first book of the Ialana series, the Six discover that what they always thought of as magic is only an understanding of the true nature of reality and the construct of the universe. Will they survive long enough to use their new-found healing knowledge for Ialana? (The Six and the Gardeners of Ialana is the second book in the series. It is helpful to read the first in the series before reading the second, although both are complete books in their own right. It is possible to pick up the past events by reading the second, but will be more enjoyable if youâ€™ve read the first.) The Author.",
