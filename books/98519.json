  "title": "Stitches: A Handbook on Meaning, Hope and Repair",
  "description": "From the bestselling author of Help, Thanks, Wow comes an honest, funny book about how to make sense of life’s chaos. What do we do when life lurches out of balance? How can we reconnect to one other and to what’s truly important when evil and catastrophe seem inescapable? These questions lie at the heart of Stitches, Anne Lamott’s captivating follow-up to her New York Times–bestselling Help, Thanks, Wow. In this book, Lamott explores how and where we find meaning in our modern, frantic age, especially after personal and public devastation; how we recapture peace and balance after loss; and how we locate our spiritual identities in these frazzled times. We begin, Lamott says, by collecting the ripped shreds of our emotional and spiritual fabric and sewing them back together, one stitch at a time. It’s in these stitches that the quilt of life begins, and embedded in them are strength, warmth and humanity.",
