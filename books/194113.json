The materials are very inexpensive and nearly everyone has a lawnmower blade or can get one free or for a buck or two. Each step of the projectprovides a skill to learn and builds to the next step. At the end of the project, a beginner would have gained experience cutting metal, done some basic forging, texturing, drawing out, bending and twisting and finishing metal objects. A more experienced person might look around at his or her scrap pile and be inspired to add this type of project to their own established list of products. This is a simple, quick and easy project which recycles discarded common scraps into a useful thing of beauty.
