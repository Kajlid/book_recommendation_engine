But in Brisbane in the Fifties, the age of pony tails, rock 'n'roll and backstreet abortions, those who go their own way are not rebels but delinquents.In the eyes of the world - that is, of their mothers, welfare and the cops - they are unprepared for adult responsibilities. Despite outsiders' attempts to separate them they prove themselves capable of surviving in a world to which they give a love and understanding that is seldom returned.",
