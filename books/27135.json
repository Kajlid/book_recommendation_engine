  "description": "Excerpt from The Bible in India: Hindoo Origin of Hebrew and Christian Revelation; Translated From \"La Bible Dans L'inde\" To religious despotism, imposing speculative delusions, and class-legislation, may be attributed the decay of nations. Spain is in the midst of her revolution against wax candles and holy water - let us suspend our judgment. Italy has not yet perfected the consolidation of her unity. Rome is preparing in a General Council to denounce all conquests of modern intelligence, freedom of thought, liberty of conscience, civil independence, &c. Excommunication attempts to revivify its impotent thunders, and once more to bind emporors, kings, and people to its yoke. English bishops strive in the name of Luther to establish a unity of dogma that shall make them powerful - and they proscribe Colenso. England stifles the groans of Ireland. The followers of Omar oppose and proscribe in Allah's name, the reforms that might save Turkey. Poland exists no more, the Muscovite sword has realized the prediction of dying Kosciusco. The Czar of Russia is Pope. And yet - enter temple, church, or mosque, everywhere is intolerant persecution placed under the AEgis of God.",
