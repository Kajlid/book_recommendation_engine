  "description": "Their dance video--and their love--is about to go viral...Dalton Cunningham has always been the comic relief in his family. And he's worried they may never see him as anything else, and that they might be right. It might be too late for his father to see Dalton prove himself as an adult capable of helping build the family business, but it's not too late to show his brothers and his mom. His tool of choice? Social media. He's got the marketing down pat, and when he pulls in a classical dancer to build his brand, things really take off. The problem? That dancer is Rae Trask, and she doesn't appreciate some goofy hot wine guy stealing her dance videos and making a mockery of them. She's busy trying to save her studio and her dream. Even though no one else seems to believe a dream is something to build a life around. When Rae and Dalton combine forces, they set the app on fire, and find a little heat erupting between the two of them. Can they work together to accomplish their goals? And will their spark burn into something much hotter?",
