  "description": "Ellie Benton lost all contact with her childhood friend, Tyler Stuart, when she moved with her family to New York. For seven years she’d mourned the loss of the copper-haired boy whom she’d secretly admired her entire life. Saddened by the thought that he’d forgotten her, Ellie carried on with her life, but nothing could fill the void he’d left in her heart. When an unexpected trip reunited them after such a long time, Ellie found herself unable to resist the strong pull she felt toward him, nor control the feelings she’d fought so hard to keep at bay. Tyler’s initial coldness at the sight of her made her question if he’d ever cared about her, but soon she discovered things she’d never even dared dream of, secrets that turned her soul inside out and brought her more joy than she’d ever experienced. Tyler proved to be the man of her dreams, exactly how she’d imagined him. But, as they embarked on a passionate relationship—just when she thought she’d finally found her happiness—demons from their past and present threatened to separate them. Will their love overcome all the obstacles they have to face?",
