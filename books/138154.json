  "description": "John Slic, a low level spy, is sent into outer space on a probe to investigate abductions believed to be the work of \"physicians\" from the Sirius solar system. When Slic bungles the job, beautiful CIA operative Juice Gilligan is sent to rescue him.When things go wrong, the government has to quarantine Slic and Gilligan, now identified as Meddlers, people who have been sent back in time when they are abducted by the Physicians. Meddlers, or so they are called, tend to interfere by interacting with their former selves, friends and relatives. It is from this condition Slic and Gilligan must escape.You are along for the ride on a trip to the next punch line, intended to be as fast paced as a good sit com.In an attempt to orient the reader, if the book appears far fetched, the author has included commentary on the sci fi elements of the old testament.The author is quick to point out he is God fearing--God trembling--God terrified--and doesn't go outside during thunderstorms.",
