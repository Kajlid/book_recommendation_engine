  "description": "When special effects artist Lilly Rose agrees to design the vampire Allegrezza for the blockbuster film Feast of Saints, she’s made a grave mistake. The violent subject matter and the grueling schedule are a far cry from the G-rated children’s fantasies she’s used to, as is the actor who plays the villain. Jake Durant never plays a nice guy. He’s an entertainment powerhouse who runs a business empire that includes L.A.’s most prestigious talent agency. During the intimate process of transforming Jake into Allegrezza day after day, his commanding personality and intense sexual interest in Lilly become a constant source of conflict as Lilly repeatedly rebuffs him. He’s her client and her boss’s boss and Lilly’s learned from watching that women never come out on top in the kind of relationship she believes Jake has in mind for her. Her resolve to keep their relationship strictly professional is further fueled by stress-induced nightmares in which Jake appears as a demonic beast intent on setting her on fire. Feast weaves and the magic of Hollywood special effects into this steamy, contemporary romance to create an enduring love story that brings fantasy to life.",
