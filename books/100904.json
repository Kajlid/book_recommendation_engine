  "description": "John Watson, as we all know, is a doctor of medicine. In the spring of 1887, he prescribes rest and relaxation for Sherlock Holmes after a strenuous case on the continent. Watson had actually gone to Lyons, France to minister to him. It's the habit of Holmes to forgo sleep when involved in an important case, and it caught up to him.Watson takes Holmes to the estate of a friend near Reigate in Surrey. While there, Colonel Hayter tells his guests about a recent break-in at a neighbour's home. When he hears about what was stolen, Holmes remarks, \"What an extraordinary assortment!\" Soon there was another break-in. And a murder. Holmes finds that his services are needed, but he also finds that his recent illness serves him well.",
