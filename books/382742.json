  "description": "The Seattle Times said of Angry Candy: \"Ellison's stories rattle the bars of complacency that people put around their souls . . . Razor sharp . . . piercingly profound.\" Once again, Ellison's writing defies all labels. These seventeen stories by a modern master are an \"assembled artifact\" of anger and faith - as bittersweet as a\"jalapeno-laced cinnamon bear.\" The sixteen stories collected here are spread over the farthest stretches of time and space, but even the bleakest of them is warmed by a passionate faith in the endurance of life and its ultimate possibilities.",
