  "description": "A New York Times and USA Today Bestseller! Scandal transcends time in the Big Easy Feisty reporter Corlis McCullough isn't afraid to push boundaries in the name of journalistic integrity. When passion for the truth lands her in New Orleans in need of a job, an assignment at a TV station pits her against her old college nemesis, King Duvallon. The sultry streets of the French Quarter, the glamorous Garden District, derelict riverfront cotton warehouses, and gritty back alleys come alive as the reporter's story inexplicably slips between the nineteenth century and today. A long-forgotten drama of blackmail, swindles, and a love affair that is still changing lives leaves Corlis and King wondering if their burgeoning, unholy attraction will render them pawns in a matrix of mystery and deceit. \"A must read...Ware transports you to New Orleans...and captures all its charm.\" ― Rendezvous Reviews \"Vibrant and exciting… such an intriguing plot full of rich characters that I couldn't wait to see what happened.\" ― Literary Times \"Well-researched and entertaining… excellent.\" ― Library Journal",
