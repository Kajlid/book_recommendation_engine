  "description": "Pilot Frank Towns & navigator Lew Moran ferry passengers out of the Jebel oil town of the Libyan sahara: workers, a couple of British soldiers & a German who was visiting his brother. A sandstorm crashes the plane, killing two men, severely injuring the German. T The survivors await rescue but worry as the storm blew them off course, far from where searchers would seek them. Captain Harris marches toward a distant oasis together with another passenger after several days. His aide Sergeant Watson, feigning a sprain, doesn't join. A 3rd man follows them. Days later, Harris barely manages to return to the crash site. The others are lost. Water runs low. Stringer, a precise, arrogant English aeronautical engineer, proposes a radical solution. He claims he can build a new craft from the wreckage of the old, using the undamaged boom, adding skids to take off. They set to work. They spot a nomadic party, possibly Arabs. Harris decides to seek help. Watson refuses to accompany him. A Texan named Loomis, goes with him. The next day, Towns finds their looted bodies, throats cut, nomads gone. Towns learns Stringer designs model, not real, aircraft. Afraid of hurting morale, he & Moran keep the discovery secret, tho believing Stringer's plan doomed. They're wrong. The aircraft works. It flies them, strapped to the fuselage, to a civilized oasis.",
