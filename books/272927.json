  "title": "A Helping Paw: Modern day life observed through the eyes of two cats and an Englishman",
  "description": "Our modern, hectic lifestyles have helped create dissatisfaction, illness and disassociation with our true selves. Although they are often puzzled by the human races actions and therefore, are incapable of knowing everything about the human world, through intense observations, Mr Midnight and Sir Winston thought it apt to lend a helping paw to perhaps put the modern individual back on track. They attempt to open the eyes of the modern individual to the important things in life; namely, to not take oneself too seriously and to enjoy what life has to offer that much more.",
