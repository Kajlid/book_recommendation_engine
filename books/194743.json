  "description": "Have you ever wondered, If i'm more than a conqueror, then why can't I quit smoking? Why can't I stop overeating? Why am I living in defeat? If you're a Spirit-filled believer, you have the power to be victorious. But you may not be aware of a subtle strategy that Satan uses against you. In How to Discipline Your Flesh, by Kenneth Copeland, you'll learn the truth about Satan's deceptive weapons and how you can use the power of the Holy Spirit to take control of your body. When your flesh is in charge, your spirit isn't. And it's this loss of spiritual power that prevents you from obeying the Holy Spirit promptings inside you. Don't let the enemy sneak up behind you and cause you to lose your victory. Learn How to Discipline Your Flesh and have the victory every time!",
