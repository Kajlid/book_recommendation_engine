  "description": "Fiction. PHALLOS is the tale of a tale, recounting the pursuit of mystic knowledge throughout the Mediterranean world in the reign of the emperor Hadrian. Filled with wit and erudition - and deeply homoerotic - this is a Lacanian riddle to delight and intrigue the growing number of admirers of Delany's more recent fiction, Hogg (1995), and The Mad Man (1996). Delany is a novelist, critic, and professor of English at Temple University and has also written an award-winning autobiography, The Motion of Light in Water (1988).",
