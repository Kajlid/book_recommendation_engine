  "description": "How Children Lived enters the lives of 16 children living in times past Can you imagine what life was like for children living long ago? How Children Lived enters the lives of 16 children living in times past: from Hori, a trainee scribe in ancient Egypt, to Jack, the son of an American drugstore owner in the 1920s. Beautifully detailed illustrations conjure up the fascinating worlds in which these children lived, while photographs of historical artifacts show the real objects they would have used. See a Roman boy's model chariot, a Viking girl's ice skate, and a Moghul Indian boy's board game. Learn what an Aztec girl's clothes were made of, whether a boy in ancient Greece went to school, and how a Dakota girl decorated buffalo skins. Discover where a boy in ancient Egypt slept, how a maid in ancient China entertained her mistress, and what a trainee samurai wore. Produced in consultation with history experts, this book offers a new approach to history for young readers, enabling them to compare their daily lives with those of children from the past.",
