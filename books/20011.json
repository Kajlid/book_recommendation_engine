  "description": "When forced to switch to a rival high school before the end of her junior year, Blythe’s carefully laid out plans for a perfect future begin to unravel. At first she thinks that being the principal’s daughter is the worst part, then an unflattering viral picture of Blythe has everyone laughing at her the first day. Although vengeance was never her thing, Blythe vows to abolish the Senior Scramble, a long-revered school scavenger hunt. Afterwards, things don’t go to plan, though. To make amends, she teams up with Senior, Luke—the surly head of the hunt and so-called-journalist who first posted her picture. Together they defy Blythe’s father and take the Senior Scramble underground. Blythe soon realizes that Luke isn’t so bad after all. In fact, she’s drawn in by his sly geekish wit, spontaneous Shakespearean quotes, and peering gaze. As Blythe speeds through the scavenger hunt, she faces expulsion, an arrest, and a split from her best friend. But she won’t give up. If she wins the Senior Scramble, she just might win back her reputation. And maybe even win Luke’s heart.",
