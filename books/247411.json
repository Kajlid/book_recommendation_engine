  "description": "Designed with budding readers in mind, each of the 8 fairy tales has been given a new twist and is set in three columns and three colors as a script for two voices to read separately or together. From the tale of Jack and the Beanstalk (in which Jack negotiates for the ogre's hen!) to Goldilocks (in which Baby Bear helps the famed intruder find her way home!).",
