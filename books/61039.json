  "description": "Surgical resident Matt Stone has uncovered a heinous secret, and the truth must come out-even if it costs him his medical career. Real-life surgeon Harry Kraus skillfully weaves together politics, bioethics, and hidden agendas in this compelling medical thriller. Matt Stone, a promising young surgical resident, discovers that chief surgeon Dr. Michael Simons and local abortionist Dr. Adam Richards are secretly running experiments on live aborted fetuses, \"stealing\" their hearts to give to infants with congenital heart problems. Both doctors' reputations depend on the secrecy of their research, which is a serious violation of hospital policy. Meanwhile, Layton Redman, pro-choice candidate for governor, has a secret of his own-a staff volunteer is pregnant with his child. Redman arranges an abortion for the mother, but a serious car accident brings her to the emergency room, where Stone saves the life of her unborn child. This pits him against Simons, who was counting on the aborted fetus for his repulsive research project. Now Stone must gather enough evidence of the undercover experiments and expose Simons-before the vengeful chief surgeon ends his career.",
