Chauncey will be the perfect mate if Curtis can get his dads to stop interfering long enough to let Chauncey claim him. Chauncey is fascinated with his mate. But it seems every time he opens his mouth, his extra-large foot goes straight in it. He gives Curtis anything he wants, even when Curtis decides he wants his own apartment instead of moving in with the bear. Curtis thinks life is great with his new mate until his past comes back to haunt him. Can Curtis get past a betrayal from long ago, and can he keep Chauncey from getting blood on his hands when he hunts the one who betrayed him? Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection focuses on a different romantic couple.
