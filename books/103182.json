  "description": "Dear Author,I always considered myself straight, had girlfriends in high school and a few here at college. But I’m taking this Sociology class and I’m in a group with a guy who’s openly gay. The first time I met him, I felt like I’d stepped off a cliff. He has beautiful peach skin with a cute red blush on his cheekbones, a super lean tight body (smaller than mine), and the most beautiful eyes and smile. I’ve tried to ignore the attraction, but now I find myself dreaming about him― a lot. Like crazy, hot dreams. What should I do? I kind of want to explore this, but even if I worked up the nerve to say something, why would he want some clueless, supposedly straight guy like me?Photo Description: A young man sleeps on a bed with white sheets, his arms curled above him, and his expression furrowed in dreams.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
