  "description": "First published in 1936, this is the story of Elizabeth von Arnim's extraordinary life and her equally extraordinary dogs. From her Pomeranian idyll (celebrated in her famous first novel Elizabeth and Her German Garden ) to less happy days in London following the death of her first husband, from the beautiful solitude of her Swiss-mountain hideaway, to the First World War and a disastrous second marriage, the author takes us on a disarmingly witty and poignant journey of canine companionship.",
