  "description": "It's 1752 in flourishing Philadelphia—a time of great promise for young people. But Martin Krane is brooding in a seedy bar. Distressed by his younger sister's pneumonia, he can think of nothing he wouldn't give to keep Claudia alive. An odd stranger next to him claims to have a “cure for death.” Martin soon discovers that this cure requires a terrible swap—his soul in exchange for his sister's health.",
