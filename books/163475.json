  "description": "Jillian McClout is on a mission. She's determined to bring smiles to the faces of at least three people in one day, and to do it she's created the Happy Scouts. Trouble is, so far her troop has just one member, herself, and Jillian soon finds that the task of getting people to smile is easier pledged than done. From the all-too-happy people in the park to the busy shoppers downtown, Jillian is scouting every face she sees on her quest to turn frowns upside down before the stroke of midnight. Can Jillian find a way to put smiles on three unhappy faces?",
