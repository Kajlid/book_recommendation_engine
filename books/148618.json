  "description": "Winner in the Chick Lit category of the 2015 Next Generation Indie Book Award and Finalist in the Chick Lit category of the 2015 International Book Awards!Root for Jen as she overcomes the death of her fiancé and is forced to start over and rethink everything. This fun, light read proves that the best stories sometimes arise from the worst tragedies. For less than the price of checking that extra bag, follow along as Jen rekindles her dreams of travel writing, traversing Europe and ultimately ending up in the place where she discovers what, and who, has been missing in her life. Fall in love with Jen’s friends Zach and Sarah and find out how the folk-rock front man and the English professor keep everything together (check out Zach and Sarah's own novella, How to Fall).Foodies beware - this book will make you hungry and the twist at the end is the salted caramel icing on the delicious little cake you just devoured.If you read only one romantic comedy, it should probably be Jennifer Weiner’s Good In Bed, but if you love inspiring personal journeys, How to be Alive will leave you with less regret than ordering spaghetti on a first date.",
