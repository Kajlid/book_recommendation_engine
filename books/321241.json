  "description": "\"I could never predict what was going to ruin me and what was going to rescue me...\" Ilyana Meyerovich has never been very far front disaster and loss. A self-described \"suicidal, strung-out, psychotic Jew under thirty\" Ilyana retreats into her astonishing mind, prays to obscure Catholic saints, and seeks her equilibrium in six white lines laid out on the kitchen table of a squalid Lower East Side apartment. Masochism and nihilism form the twin poles of Ilyana's heroin blurred existence, but this was not always so.",
