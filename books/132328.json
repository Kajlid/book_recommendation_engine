  "description": "\"I need to learn,\" I said in a very small, quiet voice. \"You have to teach me…\" I faltered here as the whole thing was really just too sordid to put into words. I thought I had a good grasp of the English language, but I had no clue how to put my dilemma to him.  \"Teach you…?\" He prompted.  \"Teach me it!\" I finally choked out. \"What happens when you actually like the…touching and the….the…fondling and the…it, you know.\" I had never been so embarrassed in my life. The age old 'you could have fried on egg on my face' adage actually seemed kind of plausible I felt that hot and flustered. But - would you believe it? - Jack still hadn't cottoned on to what I was on about. He looked at me completely blankly and I could almost see his mind whirring as he tried to connect the bits…  After a rather hideous break up with her boyfriend due to her inability to 'put out’, Talia bullies her brother's best friend into teaching her the complexities of a 'full' relationship. Turns out uni courses have nothing on life lessons!  Please note this story contains some mature language and content.",
