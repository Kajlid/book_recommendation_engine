  "description": "Unemployed and single Josephine Vitale felt like her life couldn’t get any worse, or so she thought. On Valentine’s night her best friend Sandra called announcing her engagement. Since Sandra had been planning her perfect wedding since she was twelve, Josephine knew she was in for one hell of a ride, especially after she was assigned the “honor” to be Sandra’s Maid of Honor. Even though Josephine struggles with her duties and the Barbie pink bridesmaid dresses, butterflies flutter in her stomach when the wedding bliss reunites her with a past love interest. Maid of Honor is a story that shares the bond between two women and the lengths one will go for the other when they get married. Josephine takes on everything from the bride’s mental breakdowns to wearing latex gloves when handling the wedding gown to driving across half the state for the perfect vases… all for her best friend.",
