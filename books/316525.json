  "description": "What if the reflection staring back at you had become a stranger?Inside, I was dying—empty, dark, alone.Keeping it all together was exhausting and the ‘perfect’ mask I wore was beginning to slip. Pretending to have it all together wasn’t working anymore as the lies I had to tell weighed heavier each day. I’d done everything right my whole life and I still ended up divorced, childless, and alone. All I had left was my job.Maybe it was time to be a little bad? Seductive choices pulled me over into darkness and I no longer had to pretend. The escape was addictive as recklessness marred my skin and desperate decisions led me into the arms of unknown danger. The hardest part was knowing whether they would save me, or destroy me. Because their destruction was beginning to taste like salvation and I didn’t know if I could walk away.After all, the sweetest lie was the one you told yourself, especially when the truth was the most dangerous confession of all.*Author's note: This is a why choose novel, meaning the main female character doesn't have to choose between love interests.
