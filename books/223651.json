  "title": "Ouija: The Devil's Doorway",
  "description": "A group of young friends form a club to investigate occult subjects. From witchcraft, to mysticism, to magic. They get together on Sunday mornings and Wednesday evenings. In the beginning, nothing much comes from their persistence but then one of them suggest they test the workings of a Ouija Board to see if there is any truth to its fabled abilities. Their objective is to see if they can use it to summon invisible forces from the other side. Their experiment quickly gets out of hand and all but one abandons the project. This last standing member of the group takes the Ouija Board home and continues using it to contact spirits. Demons or Angels? He can't be sure until they turn on him leaving little doubt in his mind as to what he has been dealing with.",
