  "title": "Don't Tell the Newfoundlanders: The True Story of Newfoundland's Confederation with Canada",
  "description": "The true story, drawn from official documents and hours of personal interviews, of how Newfoundland and Labrador joined Confederation and became Canada's tenth province in 1949. A rich cast of characters--hailing from Britain, America, Canada and Newfoundland--battle it out for the prize of the resource-rich, financially solvent, militarily strategic island. The twists and turns are as dramatic as any spy novel and extremely surprising, since the \"official\" version of Newfoundland history has held for over fifty years almost without question. Don't Tell the Newfoundlanders will change all that.",
