  "title": "The Gods",
  "description": "Every culture has its gods. According to Ingersoll, every culture has failed to develop properly in moral and spiritual ways, mainly because the gods of man were made by man. They originally appeared within our flawed minds, and therefore resemble their flawed creators. The Gods cannot \"rescue\" us when they, like us, are in a constant battle for recognition and supremacy, either among themselves or with the gods of other religions. This book will make you think about the nature of deity and will challenge your critical thinking skills. The author continually brings to our attention the nagging feeling that something is not right, especially as it relates to what we have been traditionally taught. Many of his arguments are strong and compelling, while others may be challenged and debated through deeper examination. Whatever the case, this is an insightful book that is well worth exploring.",
