  "description": "This is in response to those asking for more of my conventional writings. For those who read A Perfect World, this story takes place in the same universe and is the story of Laura Whiting and the Martian Revolution. I started it several years ago, wrote to Chapter 13, and then set it aside because I felt it was too complex. I picked it up again after \"Intemperance\" was complete and it is now tying nicely into A Perfect World. This is a science fiction and political story. http://storiesonline.net/s/46291:i",
