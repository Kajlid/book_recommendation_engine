This unknown skill, along with the surprising relationship he develops with the violin's owner, pushes him to question his role in the war of good and evil.An emotional, character-driven adventure, at times humorous and fun, and at others dark and horrific, Wings of the Divided is the first book in an epic trilogy that explores the sacred bond of friendship, the universal power of music, and the question of redemption.",
