  "description": "Atia Selene is the premiere magical university on the continent, and Verity Fen is its brightest star. Handsome, spoiled, and too smart for his own good,Verity has his pick of his fellow students, breaking the heart of any young man who falls into his bed. One of the privileges of Verity's position is a servant who he treats with disdain, who may prove to be the one man Verity can't use and use up.Iskander cares for his master with grace, skill, and discretion, along with a heavy leather belt and a thoroughly commanding attitude. Though sex with Iskander is the hottest he's ever had, and submission is a bigger turn-on than Verity imagined, he'll do anything--including a jealousy-provoking affair with another student--rather than submit gracefully to Iskander's control.Academic life proceeds as normal until a professor orders Verity to assist him with a secret project. Suddenly, the battles of lust and control with Iskander are not the biggest challenge in Verity's life. As Verity's sanity begins to unravel under the influence of an undead sorceress, will Iskander's love be powerful enough to protect him?About the Kannan Feng lives next door to Lake Michigan and her current interests include mushroom recipes, deconstructing superheroes, oracles and the Byzantine Empire.

She will welcome great fortune and love in the new year (in bed) and her lucky numbers are 5, 8, 22 and 19.",
