  "description": "Young Robin Hargreaves is looking for something to occupy his time and spice up his life. Apparently by chance, whilst perusing the wares in a second-hand shop, he is introduced to Game of Aeons, a computer simulation.In the game, he meets up with a young lady, Ellie, who takes him under her wing. Despite her youth, Ellie has risen to the ranks of a veteran in the game and as well as a loving heart, she has a wise head on her shoulders.Robin soon discovers that like life itself, Games of Aeons is not all beer and skittles. As he becomes more and more involved and immersed in the game, it becomes increasingly real and at times frightening. But by the time he realizes this, it is too late to back out and there is too much at stake - not only in-game but also in what we commonly and mistakenly think of as the Real World.Game of Aeons is a short, 60,000-word novel in the genre of soft science fiction. Like the in-story game of the same name, the book is more about people rather than technology, so you don't need a degree in quantum physics to understand and enjoy it. Nor is it a shoot 'em up, so you don't need an interest in computer gaming.",
