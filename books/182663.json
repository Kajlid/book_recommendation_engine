  "description": "How far would you go for someone you love?  Stand up for them? Shield them? Fight for them? Kill for them?  Emma's been waiting for Jared for eight years. Eight years of knowing how much he's given up for her. Eight years of wanting him back. But when he's released from prison he doesn't call and doesn't visit. Then she finds a note.  Jared went about as far as a person could go to protect the girl he loves, but now that he's free he knows she's better off without him. The last thing she needs is an ex-con like him to tie her down.  Years ago, her stepbrother made the ultimate sacrifice, but will Emma ever be able to convince Jared that loving him is no sacrifice at all?  This is a novelette featuring a sexy, tormented, tattooed hero and a heroine who's fed up with waiting. 18+ readers only.",
