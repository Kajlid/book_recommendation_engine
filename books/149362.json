She’s reduced to ghostwriting the memoirs of a loony little man who claims to be a shapeshifter. And why does Cornelia’s decadent, way too attractive brother, Ian, always show up whenever Milagro is away from Oswald? When a series of accidents interferes with the wedding plans, Oswald worries that Milagro is cracking under the pressure? Is she just paranoid, or is a hidden enemy trying to make sure Milagro doesn’t wed the undead?",
