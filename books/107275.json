  "title": "Sunstrike",
  "description": "When a massive solar storm sends a pulse of electro-magnetic energy towards the earth, the world's electricity supply is destroyed. The damage is so widespread that repair will take decades. People everywhere struggle with the loss of technology, transport, communications, and the usual infrastructure for supplying food and water. In suburban Auckland, Averie Brown finds the disaster shakes her out of her rut as she learns new skills to survive. After her previous uneventful life, still mourning the loss of her husband and missing her absent son, she finds the new challenge a welcome adventure as members of her neighbourhood rally to support each other against the fear of a cold and hungry winter. But the teenage waif she takes under her wing is not all he seems. (Also available in Kindle and standard paperback.)",
