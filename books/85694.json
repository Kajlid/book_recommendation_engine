Denslow has a very nice and kind ending, which will be appreciated by kids.“Little Red Riding Hood named the wolf, Towser, and sent him to his friends in the wild wood to tell them how well he was treated, and what a good time he had at the home of Riding Hood, so many wolves came, and lived in the cottages of the woodmen and farmers of that country and proved to be useful.And it is to this little girl, of the olden time, so long ago, we owe our thanks, for giving to us, that trusty and faithful friend;—THE DOG.”The “Animedia Company” e-book edition (2013) contains more than 30 original extraordinary colorful illustrations by William Wallace Denslow, which were carefully restored by a publisher. This edition is modified especially for the e-book format.",
