  "description": "Fantasy Silver Medalist 2018 Independent Publisher Book Awards.One human soul and a little respect isn't too much to ask for, but both are hard to get if you've only been a death for a thousand years. Littlest Death yearns for the respect given to grim reapers who bring human souls from Overworld into Underworld. She works hard at the jobs she's given. Really hard! No other death gathers in MILLIONS of souls at time like she does. Okay, they are just the souls of fungi, bacteria, and single-celled critters like amoebas, butâ€”MILLIONS! If she could bring in just one human soul, the other deaths would stop looking down on her. Desperate to become a real death, frustrated by humans, and hounded by a Hell Puppy, she sets out to spy on the most accomplished death in the history of dying, Oldest Death. Her actions threaten the eternal flow of souls between life and death, and by the time she understands the damage she's done, it may be too late to save herself and the souls she has hurt.  An Afterlife Fantasy by award winning author Eric Witchey.",
