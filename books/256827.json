  "description": "Carrie Fitzgerald is the luckiest girl: She is the only sophomore on the varsity basketball team, she always had the lead in the school play, and she has the cutest boyfriend in school. Carrie Fitzgerald is also the most superstitious girl: She attributes all of her good luck to a Moroccan T-shirt that her father sent her from one of his distant jaunts around the world. When her mother accidentally donates Carrie's lucky T to Help India and her good luck starts running out, Carrie does what any logical girl would do -- she travels halfway around the world to get it back. But as she scours a foreign land for her luck, she finds a lot more than she ever expected. She's going to need more than luck to find her way back home again.",
