  "title": "The Britannia Conspiracy",
  "description": "Throughout its turbulent history, Britain has produced its fair share of heroes, men and women who have fought bravely, sometimes to the death, to protect and defend their nation. Boudicca was one of the first, a fierce warrior-queen who, in AD 61, united Britain’s tribes, and led them to glorious victories over the occupying Roman armies. During these great battles her hordes mercilessly killed around 100,000 legionaries and hung, burned or crucified any survivors.Two thousand years later, those same Roman soldiers have returned from the dead, emerging from their graves with an insatiable desire for vengeance, and a ravenous thirst for blood. When traditional weapons fail to destroy them, a new generation of heroes must rise and step forward; ordinary people, with extraordinary skills, willing to risk their lives in a battle against the living and the dead. They have just hours to uncover a secret that has been hidden for nearly two millennia, and recover the one relic that can send this invincible Roman army back to hell. If they fail, they will be the last heroes Britain will ever have, because the nation’s history will come to a devastating and cataclysmic end.Every minute counts in this highly entertaining, fast-paced action thriller, full of engaging characters and a relentless stream of cliffhangers that will keep you thoroughly engaged until its breathtaking, devastating finale.",
