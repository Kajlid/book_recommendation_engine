It s not just good, it s fanfreakingtastic! Trouble is, he s persisting with his story about not wanting a relationship and not being good enough for her even as their friendship blooms into something looking a lot like love. Gabriel has ached to make Charity his for years, and finally having her in his bed, not just enduring but enjoying his darker urges is more than he d ever imagined it could be. Despite what she says, he knows she deserves candlelight and roses, not candle wax and ropes. He ll enjoy her while he can and let go when she finds the right man. Charity knows Gabriel s game and she s not having any of it. A man can like it rough in bed and still be good and kind. He s exactly the kind of man she wants to marry and she will. She loves him and she knows he loves her and she s not taking no for an answer. So when he runs off to think just after Christmas, it s up to her to let him know that good girls can like it dark and rough and bad boys can be good men.\"",
