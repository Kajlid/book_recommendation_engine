  "description": "If you are a man dealing with a narcissistic woman, this book is for you.Â \nAdditionally, if you are not sure whether your wife or girlfriend is narcissistic, you will find out.\n\nReading this book, you will learn:\n \n   How to recognize a narcissistic woman before engaging a relationship with her. \n   How to recognize a narcissistic wife, then divorcing and co-parenting. \n   How to protect your children from parental alienation. \n   How to recognize financial abuse and recover from it. \n   How to heal yourself from codependency and narcissistic abuse syndrome. \n   How to change your old toxic pattern of relationships and learn to appreciate healthy, empathetic, rational adult women. \n It could be extremely difficult for men to consciously recognize and admit when a woman has abused them. This is just how culture has raised us, as admitting abuse has become shameful for men. Men have a lack of understanding, a lack of resources, they are more shameful to admit that they are being abused by a woman, and it does not help that mental health industry is hyper feminized.I wrote this book for male victims of narcissistic women in hopes to restore the right balance about self-help resources.\nIf there were fewer female narcissists, there would not be as many narcissistic mothers! \nNarcissistic women are highly destructive, horribly abusive, often extremely covert and can ruin another person. Furthermore, men tend to have a lack of resources. As a result, many good men decide that they are not going to be around women anymore. Narcissistic women are destructive, and men have labeled all women based on their individual experience with usually one or maybe two women in their life. Men are not supported and even the online community let them alone. Here is the main issue.\nBefore this book was published, male victims of narcissistic women were not considered the way they deserved to be, and female narcissists were not represented the way they should be. \n\nIf you are an empathetic man, you have a harder time because of the way our society is, but this book will finally help you to get rid of your toxic relationship and start healing from narcissistic abuse.\n\nIf you need to start changing your life, don't miss this book!",
