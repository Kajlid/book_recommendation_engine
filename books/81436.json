When Helena attempts and fails to slay the bridegroom, she does the next best thing…abducts his right-hand man, the witty and dashing Sir Colin du Lac, and demands her sister as ransom. But her plans go awry as her captive—amused and enchanted by her wild spirit—becomes a willing participant in her scheme, and Helena soon finds her own heart held hostage.",
