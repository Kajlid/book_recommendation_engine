  "description": "A wild, zany - and very funny - romp as a motley crew of athletes save the London 2012 Olympics from the bizarre machinations of a crazed dictator. P G Wodehouse meets Tom Sharpe-with a dash of Spike Milligan! In this novel, set in Wales, the land of poets and sporting heroes, Rowan Jones, the up-and-coming Welsh poet, accidentally finds himself attracting a motley crew of disaffected athletes from all over the world to his eccentric farmhouse deep in the heart of Wales. From here they discover and brilliantly thwart the plans, and earn their place in Olympic history.",
