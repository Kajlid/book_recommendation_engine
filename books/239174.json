  "description": "Magic is real. Shifters exist. Trixie Russell knows this. Everyone does. But no one told her about the monster lurking in the basement of the dragon’s castle. Not until it was too late.Viktor Petrov is ancient, and vampires his age should not lose control of their hunger. And yet that’s exactly the problem which landed him chained in a dragon’s dungeon. Then in walks a human female with cotton candy hair who smells like sunshine, her pulse a sweet melody in his parched ears, and the fragile thread of his control snaps. Again.Like it or not, Trixie is now tied to Viktor's, and he seems short a few marbles. She plans on making his eternity a misery until he reveals they have an enemy in common. Trixie is totally on board with helping him escape so she could get her revenge. After that, she’s done. They’re over. She wouldn’t be his vampire.",
