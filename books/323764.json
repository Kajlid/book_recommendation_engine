  "description": "His hollow heart called to me.Charred black from years of his own torture.An urge to fill the empty spaces that I was responsible for when I left him.He thought I deserved the same wrath he endured all those years ago.I came when I was summoned.Unaware that my past was waiting behind closed doors.One look into those eyes that wore dark shades of fury, and I knew this was part of his plan.With time, I started to see fragments of the boy I once knew.Before long, he was a man holding the key to my heart. Now that I’m ready to give him all of me, he’s gone and all that’s left is the broken pieces of my shattered heart. Book Two of the Fallen Kingdom Duet. It is recommended to read Book One, His Hollow Heart, first.",
