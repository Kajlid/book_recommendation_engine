Unfortunately, we’re both after the same criminal. Normally, that wouldn’t bother me since I always get my man, but Antonio’s boss has ordered us to work together or go to jail. Now I’m wondering who I’ll take down in handcuffs first-- Detective Baby Daddy or the trafficking scumbag Torres.If you ask me, she’s a bounty hunter with a chip on her shoulder the size of Texas and a bad attitude to match.
