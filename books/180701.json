  "description": "**This series contains explicit language and sexual content. 17+  HOLDING YOU  Deep breath … I am peaceful, I am strong.  Free-spirited Addy Brecken is Milwaukee’s most talented vegan chef and co-owner of Sage Leaf Café. She has a genius IQ, a padded savings account, an amazing view of Lake Michigan, and a heart that won’t stop beating.  Deep breath … I am peaceful, I am strong.  An early April morning finds her drowning in the seductive fragrance of lilacs and the warmth of the morning sun when she’s nearly hit by a car in front of her café. The peaceful existence she’s desperately tried to maintain after the horrific loss of her family is suddenly shaken by the Range Rover driving, arrogant, sex-on-legs Quinn Cohen.  Deep breath … I am peaceful, I am strong.  A successful, Latino businessman from New York, Quinn has a taste for the finer things in life. A typical playboy, he has the money, the houses, the cars, and the women. Quinn is everything Addy avoids. Where she lives simply and prefers to help the less fortunate, he has no problem spending an obscene amount of money on a briefcase. Their opposite personalities lend to several heated encounters, and Addy finds herself propositioning Quinn for the one thing she never imagined needing … sex.  Offering only her body, Addy tries to keep Quinn at a safe distance from her heart and a world away from her past. Their passion-filled connection makes Addy feel something unfamiliar, alive. But with passion comes more feelings: anger, jealousy, love. When Addy surrenders to the unimaginable and lets go of her past, she’s faced with the impossible … holding on to her future.  Deep breath … I am peaceful, I am strong.  RELEASING ME  A tragic accident. A hidden past. An unbreakable love.  Never goodbye …  I thought Addy stole my soul.  Her beauty blinded me. Her heart called to me. Her touch healed me.  She gave everything and asked for nothing. Then I broke her. The depths of her pain were veiled by the reflection of my own. I didn’t deserve her, but I wanted her––I needed her. In my darkest hell, I heard her voice. That’s when I knew …  Addy was my soul.   Deep breath … I am peaceful, I am strong.  Quinn was worth the risk.  He took away the numbness and gave me unfathomable pleasure. Every emotion felt magnified, every moment felt like the last.  My heart found purpose. My body came to life. My soul returned.  His weakness gave me strength, and his past held my future. He saved me by … releasing me.",
