  "description": "Fiction. The characters of THE DECLINE OF PIGEONS chart a similar course, yet in their isolation they are singular creatures. Facing loss, these lonely people journey away from places they no longer belong and to places they aren't sure to recognize. Yet in a landscape irrevocably altered by disappointment, Janice Deal has laid markers—flag-draped bay windows, diseased phlox plants, and half-filled baby pools—to guide them. A repo man tries to reclaim his own goodness. A married twenty-something amputee tests new bounds. Rivalrous sisters confront their father's death. These characters, flawed yet hopeful, exhibit the bravery that profound loss demands; even as they make choices that might damn then, they are magnificent in their potential to break free.",
