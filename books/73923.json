  "description": "As dusk falls over the ruins of an ancient castle, David feels a strange presence behind him. He looks around nervously and sees a mysterious shape standing in the shadows of a ruined tower. When he peers more carefully he makes out a ghost with an arrow stuck in his chest!  Not everybody can see ghosts but David could see this ghost, whose name was Llewellyn. Now David was faced with a big question, was Llewellyn friendly or did he intend to hurt him? In addition, evil was afoot, much closer to hand than David realised. Greedy men, who would stop at nothing, had hijacked new science and were planning to use it to hold the country to ransom. Eventually, David, and his new friend Jemma, were all that stood between good and evil. If Llewellyn was friendly, how could a 700 year ghost possibly help two young people stop evil triumphing in todayâ€™s world?",
