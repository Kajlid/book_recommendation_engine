  "description": "Not everything dangerous is bad. From the moment Angelina laid eyes on him, she fell into a fantasy. Mysterious, foreign, gorgeous, Haithem offered her what she needed most—a chance to feel again. But Haithem is much more than he appears to be. He lives in a world of danger where everything comes at a price. For Angelina, that price is her future. He's made sure the life she's left behind is in tatters. Made her family believe she's dead. Still, he talks about protecting her, about keeping her safe, but she can't distinguish his truth from his lies. She can't separate her pleasure from his betrayal. Haithem warned her. He told her he'd make her heart race, her body come alive and her most primal needs rush to the surface. His for the taking. He didn't say she'd come to love the devil who's destroying her, even as he keeps her prisoner.",
