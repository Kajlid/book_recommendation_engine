  "title": "Alpha Wolf's Calling",
  "description": "Life in a quaint, isolated Bavarian village withstands constant threat from the surrounding Forbidden Forest, a place Elsa Gutz's parents warn her never to go. Childhood myths passed down through the ages depict the Forest as a place of evil and corruption, full of golden-eyed lions, fire breathing dragons, spiteful witches, venomous warlocks, and demonic werewolves. Those who enter the Forest never return, and if they do, they come back as something entirely different. One day, Elsa meets a man named Theo with whom she falls deeply in love, but who harbors a terrible secret involving the Forbidden Forest. What she soon discovers about Theo may force her to cross the border into the darkly magical place from which there is no salvation or escape, in order to save the one person she truly loves. Alpha Wolfâ€™s Calling is a standalone romance novel with a happily ever after ending, no cliffhanger, and one scene of graphic lovemaking. Just who, or what, resides in the Forest and watches Elsa at night in her sleep? Read on to find out which path Elsa will take--to love a lion shifter for the rest of her life in her village, or to love an alpha wolf shifter, for eternity in the dark and mysterious Forbidden Forest.",
