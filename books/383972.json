But the king wants the fortune for himself and his army is right behind you! Which way do you go? If you go through No Man's Forest, turn to p. 74 If you risk the Dragon of the Ledges turn to p. 77. Be careful! In this mystical land, anything can happen! What happens in the story all depends on the choices you make. And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not one, but many incredibly daring experiences!",
