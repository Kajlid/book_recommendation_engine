  "description": "BROKEN PIECESShattering, Captivating & Emotional; written in First Person POV in the voice of a child. The words latch on to your brain and never let go. Some people would say that a child is incapable of writing with such depth, clarity, thinking and philosophical musings that are akin to an adult. But it’s a child’s naivety, a sobering voice that’s grown in the midst of struggle, humility along with plainness of speech and unpretentious honesty that can send chills through one’s body. This is a heart-wrenching story of child neglect, abuse, and the resilience to overcome childhood experiences that shape and mold us all. The book tells the story of Abigail Marie Pena, more often known simply as Abby, as she struggles to overcome a traumatic and violent childhood as she moves forward in life. From a broken home, dysfunctional family and physical and emotional abuse, as she becomes an adult, Abby finds herself in a bad marriage with two sons. It seems like she’ll never escape from the cycle of violence and degradation she’s been stuck in for as long as she can remember. But with the strength of will and determination, she makes a place in the world for herself. All that’s missing is a man to share it with–and then two come along, bring with them ghosts from her past and forcing her to make a decision on which all her future happiness depends. Broken Pieces will appeal to readers who enjoy the reality of everyday life without sugar coating. Written in a gritty, straightforward style that nevertheless recognizes the potential for love and compassion to illuminate our lives. In the midst of change, we often discover wings we never knew we had–this is a novel that will live with you for a long time after you read it.",
