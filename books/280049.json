  "description": "Daylight tells its stories easily showing all to everyone, but for those who know to look and listen, the night is so very much more than boisterous day.  Dr. Sophia Katsaros had a nice orderly life. Cold hard facts and science were her treasured companions. That was until her brothers went missing and magic was no longer just for fairytales. Since then she has learned that the world holds far more than she could ever have dreamed and that nightmares arenâ€™t just for sleep. They ancient myths said that the goddess Selene leveraged everything to be with the man she loved, Prince Endymion of Ellis. But every story has a kernel of truth. The trick is figuring out what is real and what is fantasy in a world that no longer follows the rules that Sophia once knew. With the help of Arthur and the Lykanos pack they hunt a serial killer who has begun to terrorize the area. Will they be able to find the monster before it finds its next victim? Will Sophia be able to marry science and magic and forge something new? There will be new friends and even older enemies as the Sophia Katsaros series continues.",
