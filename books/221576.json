  "description": "One touch and I’m addicted. I need more, even if it ruins us both. I’m a man of honor. My chiseled body and rough exterior are just bonuses. I’m willing to put my life on the line for what I believe in. The Silver Star on my uniform proves that. But my desire for Lindsey puts everything in jeopardy. She’s filled with an innocence that threatens to ruin everything I’ve worked for. I’m an Officer—she’s an enlisted. The Army says we can’t be together. And as hard as it was to walk away last time, we got off easy at the Academy. Four years later, I know we shouldn’t get involved again. But the look in her beautiful eyes says everything I need to know. She wants me. And I sure as hell want her. Her tempting curves beg me to risk everything for her. But she’s been hiding something from me. She has a son. He has my eyes—he has my chin. And I realize I have something more important to take care of. I have a higher duty. Duty is a full-length romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
