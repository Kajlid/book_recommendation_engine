Each task leading me to the next. Where I go, what I do, and ultimately, who I become.I know exactly what my next steps are going to be.At least I thought I did, until Killian Adair came crashing into my life.The frontman for Everything After, a hot new rock band breaking out onto the scene; Killian embodies the rock star persona. With looks that have women flocking to him in droves, the only thing hotter than his appearance, is his sexy Irish accent. Unpredictable and wild, Killian and I couldn't be more different.One look and I knew I was in trouble. Sometimes that's all it takes.That's the funny thing about moments; just one, can change everything...",
