  "title": "True Friendship",
  "description": "In a culture where online communications and communities can be set up in seconds, it is striking that loneliness is still rampant. Even in the church, a place where we might hope for an oasis of love and acceptance, we can find interactions awkward and superficial. It is for this reason that Vaughan Roberts takes us back to the Bible, and challenges us to consider our need for true friendship. He is both honest and clear in his approach as he shows us that knowing and being known by God is the hope we need to begin to deal with the sickness of our self love society. So whatever the state of your friendships, take heart and take hold of this book because as you do, you'll see that we can live out our true humanity as we sacrificially love others for God's glory. Each chapter includes thoughtful reflection and discussion questions to help change us as we read, as well as practical suggestions for how we can make a real difference to our friendships.",
