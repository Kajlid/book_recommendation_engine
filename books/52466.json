  "description": "It's been 60 years since the last Lord Peter Wimsey/Harriet Vane mystery, and 40 years since the death of their creator, Dorothy L. Sayers. Yet here is Thrones, Dominations, picking up practically where Busman's Honeymoon left off, in the early months of the Wimseys' marriage in 1936. Turns out Sayers left a partial manuscript and outline for the book, which has been neatly and stylishly completed by Jill Paton Walsh. It's a treat for lovers of the earlier books, as Peter investigates the murder of the beloved wife of a theatrical producer -- and Harriet asks all the right questions. All \"very fair and Mayfair,\" but we wouldn't want it any other way. Â—Nancy Pate",
