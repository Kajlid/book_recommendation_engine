  "title": "A Traveller's History of the Hundred Years War in Peace: Battlefields, Castles and Towns",
  "description": "A journey to France can be a journey through history-tragic and stirring names from the past scatter the French places such as Agincourt, Crecy, Aquitaine, Rouen-where Joan of Arc was burned by the English at the stake, a stretch of beach on the Cherbourg peninsula where Edward III knighted the Black Prince, and many more. This useful book will pinpoint the places for the visitor, explain their historical significance in the context of the war, and also show, with photographs, maps, and sidebars, what there is to see and do in the town or at the site today. Many people only remember the Hundred Years War through Shakespeare's famous speeches in Henry V that relate to the Battle of Agincourt. In this excellent book, the author explains how the conflict began, how the tangled dynasties of France and England led to the years of clashing over the royal crowns, and where and how the skirmishes and battles were fought. A Traveller's History of the Hundred Years War in France helps both the tourist and historical enthusiast alike mingle present-day pleasures of touring and enjoying the beauties of the French countryside with a fascinating explanation of the historical significance of the towns and places.",
