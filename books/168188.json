  "description": "A Whales and Tails cozy mystery series is set on Madrona Island, a fictional island within the San Juan Islands off the coast of Washington State. As a fourth generation islander Caitlin Hart is struggling to make her way as the economy and culture of the island evolves toward a tourism based industry. Cait lives in a cabin on her aunt's oceanfront estate where she helps her aunt run Harthaven Cat Sanctuary. When she isn't working with the cats, she helps best friend Tara, operate Coffee Cat Books, a coffee bar/bookstore/cat lounge.Like all Kathi Daley Cozies, this series will include close friendships, a romance element, and recipes. This series differs from the others in that there is a ‘light’ paranormal element as Caitlin is helped in her investigation by Bella and Tansy, two very intuitive women who sell herbs and tell fortunes, and a series of extremely helpful cats who seem to show up and point her in the right direction at just the right time.In book 2 of the series, a beautiful white cat named Alice comes into Caitlin’s life. Although Cait is expecting Alice’s arrival, she is unprepared for the fact that the fury feline is about to lead her down a rabbit hole in which nothing is quite what it seems. Not only does Cait find out that a very unlikely person is behind her Aunt Maggie’s illness, but when a body is found in the church, the only real suspect is someone Cait’s heart tells her couldn’t possibly be a killer.",
