  "description": "The third novel in Trollope’s Palliser series, The Eustace Diamonds bears all the hallmarks of his later works, blending dark cynicism with humor and a keen perception of human nature. Following the death of her husband, Sir Florian, beautiful Lizzie Eustace mysteriously comes into possession of a hugely expensive diamond necklace. She maintains it was a gift from her husband, but the Eustace lawyers insist she give it up, and while her cousin Frank takes her side, her new lover, Lord Fawn, declares that he will only marry her if the necklace is surrendered. As gossip and scandal intensify, Lizzie’s truthfulness is thrown into doubt, and, in her desire to keep the jewels, she is driven to increasingly desperate acts. This revised edition of The Eustace Diamonds includes an updated introduction which explores Trollope's depiction of a society that worships money and highlights his concerns with truth, honesty, and honor, as well as new explanatory notes and suggestions for further reading. For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
