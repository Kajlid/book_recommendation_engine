  "description": "Many young women ‘long to put the clock back to the post-war years when life seemed prettier and nicer.’ In this book Jessica Mann demolishes such preconceptions about their mothers’ or grandmothers’ young days, showing that in reality life was uglier and nastier.Born just before WW2, she grew up in the post-war era of austerity, restrictions and hypocrisy, before anyone even dreamed of Women’s Lib. The Fifties Mystique is both a personal memoir and a polemic. In explaining the lives of pre-feminists to the post-feminists of today, Mann discusses the period’s very different attitudes to sex, childbirth, motherhood and work, describes how she and other young women lived in that distant world with its forgotten restrictions and warns against taking hard-won rights for granted.",
