  "description": "My name is Mal. I'm a cop in Los Angeles. I can tell you, I thought I'd seen everything...turns out, I was wrong. One night, on a forced vacation, watching a sunset on a lovely beach, I intercepted a call for a homicide. It wasn't my jurisdiction, but I decided to respond until the locals could get there. I secured the scene on a lonely stretch of road near the ocean where a naked man had been shot in the head. God, the man was perfect, big, sexy, I had to stop myself from touching him and contaminating the crime scene. I promised him that we'd find his killer. It broke my heart that such a magnificent man was dead. He was dead, yes...but apparently, not permanently. What the hell? I fell backwards in shock when he took a breath. No, in all of my years on the street, this, I had never seen! Then the night got much more interesting when he abducted me!The last thing that Ahmose expected when he finished a swim in the sparkling Pacific Ocean was to get a bullet in the head. To be fair, if he'd expected it, it would never have happened. Now, as he revives from the gunshot, a beautiful detective is insisting that she needs to call for an ambulance to help him. He needs her help, but not like that. Blood, and plenty of it, is all he requires to heal from a simple death.Book 8 of the Bestselling series \"The Firsts\" is finally here, the story of the first blood vampire, the Leader of the children of the moon, Ahmose's story, back in L.A. for more heat!",
