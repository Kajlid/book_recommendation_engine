  "title": "Vanilla: The Dominant Ingredient",
  "description": "No home, no more job - such as it was, anyway - and his only possession is the pair of leather pants he ran away in. Things can only get better from here. Right? But what Ajay doesn't realize is that better isn't necessarily good enough. He meets Cameron, a Dom without a sub, who gives him a place to stay. Cameron can get sex anywhere, and is astoundingly impervious to Ajay's charms. Just when nothing seems to be working, Ajay discovers an interesting fact about vanilla and is willing to defile the Mackenzie dining table and risk the Mackenzie crystal to prove that he is worthy. And hopefully change Cameron's mind.",
