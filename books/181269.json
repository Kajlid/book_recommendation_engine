  "description": "Elijah Paulson is a phoenix rising. Redefining himself after the brutal demise of an eight-year marriage, he’s finding his wings. This transformation is vigilantly shepherded by Michael Ward, the founder of an elite SMBD club tucked into the underbelly of the Los Angeles arts community. In Elijah, Ward sees the makings of a great Dom, as well as a second in command for his growing fraternity. Elijah meets Reid Hayden for the first time during this vulnerable juncture and is irresistibly drawn to the young man’s sensual magnetism.But Reid, a fiercely talented dancer, senses a red flag in this beguilingly handsome older man. Not even their white-hot attraction can override this gut feeling. What he doesn’t yet know is the very thing that drives him away at first will ultimately save him from himself.The forming of Elijah’s new ballet company reconnects them years later when Reid’s instinct sings a very different song. Stunned by the young man’s talent, Elijah hires him for the company and their attraction reignites in full force. As their romance and the company both blossom, so does Reid’s curiosity about leather play. What they experience together fully reveals them to each other, and to themselves.",
