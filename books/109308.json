  "description": "A visceral portrait of life at a crossroads, The Orenda opens with a brutal massacre and the kidnapping of a young Iroquois girl, violently re-igniting a deep rift between two tribes. The girl’s captor, Bird, is one of the Huron Nation’s great warriors and statesmen. Years have passed since the murder of his family, and yet they are never far from his mind. In the girl, Snow Falls, he recognizes the ghost of his lost daughter, but as he fights for her heart and allegiance, small battles erupt into bigger wars as both tribes face a new, more dangerous threat from afar.Travelling with the Huron is Christophe, a charismatic Jesuit missionary who has found his calling among the tribe and devotes himself to learning and understanding their customs and language in order to lead them to Christ. An emissary from distant lands, he brings much more than his faith to this new world.As these three souls dance with each other through intricately woven acts of duplicity, their social, political and spiritual worlds collide – and a new nation emerges from worlds in flux.",
