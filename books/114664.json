  "description": "First Benny's father died. Now a bank robber wants him dead. When will God show himself?  Ten-year-old Benny found the drunken cart driver who caused his father's death, but he's got bigger mysteries to solve. A long, sharp knife, a bag of disguises and a savage black stallion don't reassure Benny about his traveling companion to frontier Missouri. Still, Benny can't shake the Scripture's promise that God \"will never leave thee nor forsake thee.\"",
