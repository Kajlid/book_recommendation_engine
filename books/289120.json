  "title": "Dystopia: How The Tyranny of Specialists Fragment African Cities",
  "description": "A revelation of the spatial atrocities committed by specialist planners in the development of African cities. For more than fifty centuries, cities were planned and developed by generalists. The town planners were Jacks of all trades yet masters of none. But, in the last fifty years, this changed. Town planning dismantled into various specialists - masters of a single trade.  Traffic engineers; urban environmentalists, modernist architects, town planning regulators, housing specialists, postmodern and Marxist scholars . As these specialists focus on their specialities, they operate in isolations. In  Dystopia , Archimedes Muzenda reveals the destruction specialist planning has caused in cities across Africa. He reveals the extent of spatial atrocities perpetrated by specialists on urban societies. In doing so, Muzenda set a basis for specialists to find one other if they are to create prosperous, sustainable, and just cities - cities that are liveable.",
