The only test is Charity's ability to love with her heart while surrendering to the pleasures of the flesh.Jonah isn't interested in a \"lady\" wife.

The final test of their love will be the willingness of his bride to be shared.Reader This story features scenes of shared partners, spanking and voyeurism. For those who like lots of heat with your historicals!",
