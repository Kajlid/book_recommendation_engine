  "description": "On the move as they have done many times before, the ‘Boghelis’ were relocating in a rural area of South Carolina. That is until ‘Italia’, the youngest and only single member of the vampire family felt compelled to continue further south. Drawn to the boy who would change her life forever, Italia and her family settled in Newnan, Georgia. Too excited to wait until her first day at Newnan High, Italia secretly visited Jarrett as he slept, leaving him believing their encounter was just a dream. But later, when the opportunity presented itself for the two to meet in reality, a murder of someone close to Jarrett caused Italia and her family to seek out the killer. Thinking they could easily solve the problem and get things back to normal, proved to be more difficult than they thought. This was no ordinary killer, something none of the vampires had ever encountered before, causing them to search for assistance in a different course of action. Now, the Witches were drawn out of hiding and unexpectedly more involved than they could imagine. Not only was their Dynasty in danger of becoming extinct, but they were being accused and challenged by a group of angry, temperamental, teenage Werewolves, who believed they were casting spells on their friends at their school. Fighting for power, freedom, and peace to exist, all three supernatural groups of teens, residing in the same county, attending three different schools, brought about a constant flare of danger that Newnan had no idea they were subjected to. This is a story that has been developed at a pace that will draw you into the pages of Supernatural living, and hold you captive until its finished. No worries, the series is six novels long, with plenty to keep you reading … turning pages",
