  "description": "My name is Bailey Millhouse, and I’m so very, very lucky. I’m the daughter of a senator. I have a loving family and a bright future all planned out for me. But every last word of that is a lie. My whole gilded life is a lie. My real name is Natasha Dubrova, and my mother hid me as a baby to save me from an arranged marriage with the son of a mafia boss. She didn’t hide me well enough – because now my real family has come calling. And now they’ve taken me “home” – to my fiancé, Matteo Rossi, a beautiful sadist whose punishments batter my flesh and bruise my soul. He says he’s going to break me and make me his. I’ll never give in. I’ll never accept that this is my life. I’ll submit and pretend in order to survive - but I vow I’ll escape this house of beauty, pain and secrets, and find my way home. The longer I stay, though, the harder it is to leave. Underneath Matteo’s cruelty is a strange and mysterious tenderness – and a big, big secret. What can’t he tell me? Who’s the real master of this family? And why is everyone here so afraid I won’t survive until my wedding day?",
