  "description": "An Explosive Novel of Romance and Bondage by the #1 Bestselling Author of Erotica! Lorinda has dark sexual desires no man has been able to fulfill. Her political savvy has helped elect handsome, charismatic Michael Haff state senator. And Lorinda is no more immune to his charms than any other woman. Then the kiss Michael gives her while they celebrate his election victory leaves no doubt in her mind--it is passion not gratitude that lies behind the kiss. Lorinda believes that in the magnetic senator she sees the dark strength she has been seeking. But is Michael the strong man who can take her as she longed for? Or will he, too, leave her yearning and unfulfilled? Soon Lorinda finds herself in love, swept irresistibly into Michael's bed, where he turns out to be everything she has wanted and more--pushing the limits as he plays bondage games and she responds as never before. But the games grow harsher, the submission Michael demands grows deeper, and Lorinda begins to wonder if it is love Michael feels for her--or is she only a plaything of the Senator's dark desires?",
