  "title": "TEACHERS IN THE FOREST: Essays from the last wilderness in Mississippi Headwaters Country",
  "description": "This collection of essays, from one of Minnesota's prominent voices for the environment, discuss the author's connection to the wild. He shares his experiences living off-grid, harnessing solar power from the sun, pumping his water well by hand every day, hunting, fishing, and gathering, all as part of the natural world, and not above it.  This is also a philosophical adventure, as Babcock discusses how traditional scientists and native American spiritual leaders have arrived at the same concept of protecting our environment, but by use of completely different methods, theories, and practices of living.  Babcock has been active in defending Minnesota's environment for more than two decades, and was recently featured in the documentary film: MEDICINE OF THE WOLF.",
