  "description": "A Heroine in Distress...  In the span of one afternoon, Maggie Sampson lost everything—her job, her fiancé and her inheritance. The thing she’ll miss most though is her mind. What else could explain her vision of the handsome and enigmatic stranger who retrieved her engagement ring when she hurled the rock into the Atlantic Ocean? Normal people just don’t do things like that. Sometimes fantasy is better than reality.   A Hero Who Needed Saving...   To the rest of the world, Neil Phillips is a decorated war hero, a Navy SEAL who has what it takes to get the job done. In private he is a raw wound with two boys, a broken marriage and a nasty case of PTSD, but despite his personal struggles he helped Maggie when she needed it most. Now, Maggie is on a mission and she’s not going anywhere until she returns the favor—with interest.  Who Needs A Hero?   A warrior with a broken heart, a woman with nothing to lose—there are no victims here, only courageous souls, both in need of rescue.",
