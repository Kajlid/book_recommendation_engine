  "description": "He’s the tattooed bad boy her mama warned her about. She’s his hot mess — but mostly hot — next door neighbor. Until a two-night-stand gives them the surprise of a lifetime... \nJillian Morris is a workaholic who forgets to watch the time. And to eat. And to change her shoes. And to keep even a house-plant alive. And to have any kind of a personal life. Now an eccentric millionaire has left her eight million dollars. And eight penguins. Yes, real live penguins. She’s a wildlife vet who specializes in penguins, so that makes sense. Kind of. She can, and does, keep penguins alive and well. She now just has to move them cross-country to her friend’s new animal park.So if anyone deserves a one-night (or two) stand with a hot, younger, tattooed bad boy on a motorcycle, it’s her. Or so Jill tells herself when Zeke Landry flips his bike in front of her motel and she stitches him up. If only she’d known who he really was.And that he was the fall-hard-and-fast type.And the protective type.And that one night would turn into more like nine-months of being... sigh... very personal.",
