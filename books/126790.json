  "description": "Mood swings and insomnia are one thing, hot flash-induced psychic visions are quite another. When Olivia Wilde realizes the visions she’s been experiencing in the midst of hot flashes are actually premonitions, she has to learn to understand and trust what she sees in order to help a friend, preserve a piece of history, and save a life.Deftly weaving together elements of history, mystery, menopause, humor, some Jersey girl attitude, a bit of salty language, and a healthy dose of female friendship, Flashes of Insight marks the start of a new “Jersey Cozy”* series sure to deliver laughter, intelligence, and lots of heart.When Liv’s friend Jane's antique store in Fredericksburg, Virginia is robbed, Liv finds herself in the midst of a quest to find a secret cache of letters written by President James Monroe and his wife Elizabeth, which historians thought Monroe destroyed long ago. With the encouragement of her \"Monthly\" dinner party girlfriends, Liv begins to learn how to harness her newfound abilities, along with her smarts, to help uncover who is behind the break-in. It's a quest that nearly costs two lives, including Liv’s, and teaches her the often-hidden price of small-town life and generational family secrets.*Cozy Mystery reader beware! The author and protagonist both hail from New Jersey, so there is some profanity not usually found in traditional cozy mysteries. You have been forewarned!",
