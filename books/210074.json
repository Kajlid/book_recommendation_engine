  "title": "Monica",
  "description": "Opinion on Monica has been deeply divided since its publication in 1930. Saunders Lewis's first novel was fiercely attacked by Welsh-speaking critics for its portrayal of sexual obsession and manipulation. For the first time the psychology which was such a feature of the work of contemporary authors was brought into Welsh fiction. And for the first time sex, prostitutes and venereal diseases were given prominence in a Welsh novel. Despite outraged accusations of immorality, Monica is a novel with deep moral foundations, describing as it does the short-comings of a relationships based on infatuation and physical passion.",
