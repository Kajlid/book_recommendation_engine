  "title": "Deathly Waters: Harper’s Landing",
  "description": "Harper’s Landing is one of those middle America towns loved by people who cherish close friendships, continuity, loyalty, and a calm, peaceful life far enough removed from the hurly-burly of the city for them to enjoy a nice cup of coffee and a piece of pie at the local diner. For Jim Burch, Harper’s Landing is perfectly far away from cities and his former life, until investigating mysterious deaths forces him to uncover the town’s past and the occult evil attempting to expand its reach after being hidden for untold ages. “With DEATHLY WATERS, Shoshana Edwards takes us deep into the darkness of American folklore while creating genuine contemporary thrills. Absolutely terrific!” —Jonathan Maberry, NY Times bestselling author of INK and V-WARS",
