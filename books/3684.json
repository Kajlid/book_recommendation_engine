  "description": "Riley Andrews had the perfect life. A beautiful son, a rewarding career, and a husband who loved staying home and keeping the whole thing humming, until one day he decided he didn’t want to anymore. Riley goes from consummate working-woman to stay at home single mom in no time flat. For a person who detests not knowing how to do something—whether it’s making frosting or the inner-workings of the PTA, being below the learning curve could just about drive her crazy.It doesn’t take long for her to realize success in her new life is through joining the PTA. Fighting off sabotage, parental miscues, her soon-to-be ex-husband and the hierarchy of the PTA, Riley realizes she’s in way over her head. She needs help, as hard as it is for her to admit. Enter Sam Aldin, a widower who moved to town looking for a fresh start. The only dad in the PTA, he knows what it feels like to be an outsider. Riley and Sam bond instantly as they quickly realize the women of the Hubbard School PTA are not exactly thrilled by the newcomers in their midst. But their power-play decision to chair THE fundraiser of the year might turn the whole PTA upside down, and just might make Riley see there are more then her way of doing things. One thing’s certain, for a woman like Riley to survive the PTA, it sure doesn’t hurt to have a man like Sam in her corner.",
