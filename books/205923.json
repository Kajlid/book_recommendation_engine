  "description": "Who Is Wax Williams? Ted Wax is the ne plus ultra--the ultimate, nothing beyond him, nothing greater. His loss will affect the porn industry in myriad ways. He brought people into the stores. Renee People always ask me if Wax Williams was the love of my life. I tell them that he was the love of this life for me. And maybe he was the love of a past life, too. The older I get, the more I realize that everything I do is guided by my past lives. We are born and born again. Sex is the connector. Lyle I am not a thief. I'm a man who met up with a boy with a tremendous cock, and I rode that cock to the bank. Ty I am Lyle Mammon's amanuensis. He hired me to transcribe dirty dictation. Plus I have some ideas of my own. Over the years I have developed some expertise at the double entendre. And I am a tireless pursuer of the koan-like single entendre. Todd Wax's stardom in the world of adult films coincided with porn's largest growth spurt in public consumption. Wax People are always so critical of porno actors. We might not be good actors, but the truth is nobody knows how to act before they have sex--or after. Interweaving traditional narrative with consumer profiles, faux interviews, court depositions, and a film script, Without Wax is a fictional biography that provides an intriguing glimpse into the adult entertainment industry.",
