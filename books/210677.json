  "description": "Voluptuous P.I. Savannah Reid's culinary cravings come second only to her appetite for adventure. Of course, every girl needs a little down time, and Savannah adores curling up with a box of chocolates, a steaming Irish coffee, and an even steamier romance novel--preferably one with sexy Lance Roman on the cover. But when she meets her dream hunk in person, things take a decidedly nightmarish turn. . .As a special birthday treat, Savannah's friends have arranged for her to compete for Lance's affections on a reality TV show called Man of My Dreams. She and four other women will be living in a medieval \"castle\" with Lance, trying to win his heart.Unfortunately, the antics take a sinister turn when one of the show's producers, Tess Jarvis, turns up dead. It appears she was felled by a carton of Killer Fudge ice cream, but Savannah's convinced there's more to the story.Turns out she's right. It seems no one liked Tess. . .not her unhappy husband, or the scheming contestants, or all the disgruntled employees she so heinously wronged. This show is quickly turning into the worst kind of soap opera--with some footage that'll never make it on the air. . .\"Added to a well-plotted mystery, the very funny depiction of a different side of reality television makes Murder á la Mode a delight.\"-- Mystery Scene\"Savannah retains her buoyant good humor throughout.\"-- Publishers Weekly",
