If he brought the graceful Calcutta Eagle into Boston from Melbourne ahead of Mayo Keys' Emperor, he would win a half ownership of the Eagle. He would also prove his right to the name of \"Prince of Sea Captains\" and be acknowledged the most skillful and luckiest clipper-ship captain of his day.For Jenny Broadwinder, aboard her husband's ship, the race had special significance. Red-haired but cool-headed, always astute where her husband was rash and flamboyant, knowledgeable of ships and sailing, she sensed that the race against the Emperor somehow would be the supreme challenge of hers and Philip's lives. Yet not even Jenny knew just how supreme a challenge the race was to be for also aboard was George Cartwright, owner of the Indian Commercial Line, keeping an eye on his ship, his captain -- and his captain's wife.",
