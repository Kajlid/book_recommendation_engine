His latest assignment is the new killer stalking the streets of Seattle.

Lena  who doesn't know she is part Kyth  has the ability to see fragmented flashbacks of the crimes she's investigating through her sense of touch. And when she meets Sandor, she feels suspicion  and desire  like she's never known.\nIt's only a matter of time before they touch....\nWith dark forces closing in, Sandor must keep Lena from digging deeper and exposing the existence of the Kyth. The only way is to convince her of his innocence. But how can he, when he can't keep his hands off her?",
