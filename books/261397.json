  "description": "Things have gone from bad to worse. Dr. Bastian Gibel is determined to right the wrong he’d made centuries before, and while the old man works on a way to eradicate immortals once and for all, the threat of the proxy worms grows stronger. Skyfall is in a dire place, but even with their world falling apart around them, the royal family is still fighting amongst themselves.  And not just the royal family, Reaver and Killian are on opposing sides, with Killian defending Elish, and Reaver defending Silas. Both of them think they’re doing the right thing, but only time will reveal the consequences of their actions, and what permanent damage it will do to, not only the family, but their relationship.  But with Skyfall acting as ground zero to numerous growing threats, including rogue genetically engineered proxy worms, and Bastian’s rebellion, relationships and family troubles may be the least of their worries.  Not to mention Elish’s mental state continues to deteriorate. The cold chimera’s moments of clarity are getting few and far between, and it’s a race against time to figure out just what is wrong with him. Elish needs to find out fast, because the proxy worms that he’s bred to obey him and Jade have developed their own nefarious plans – plans that will bring to Skyfall… a new king; a king that was once a man that some people knew quite well.",
