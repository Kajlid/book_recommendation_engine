  "description": "Aspiring psychologist Amanda Rykowsky's schedule is certifiable. Between study, bartending, and an internship with a sex therapist whose techniques would make a Playboy bunny blush, there's zero time for romance. Still, Amanda is flattered to receive an anonymous Valentine?until the messages take a sinister turn.Stockbroker William Sloan swears he's not the one sending Amanda cards, but he suspects the culprit's intentions are more dubious than sharing a box of Godiva. Something about gorgeous, determined Amanda brings out the usually reserved William's inner he-man, and he insists on acting as a decoy boyfriend.With a fake relationship masking some very real lust, it's only a matter of time before William and Amanda give in to the sweetest of temptationÂ­s. And once he's dealt with her secret stalker, William's next mission is to strike Amanda with Cupid's arrow?.",
