  "description": "Excerpt from William Shakspeare's Complete Works, Dramatic and Poetic, Vol. 1 of 2Some distinction he probably first acquired as an actor, but no character has been discovered in which he appeared to more advantage than in that of the Ghost in and the best critics and inquirers into his life are of opinion, that he was not eminent as an actor. In tracing the chronology of his plays, it has been discovered, that Romeo and Juliet, and Richard ll. And III., were printed in 1597, when he was thirty-three years old. There is also some reason to think that he commenced a dramatic writer in 1592, and Mr. Malone even places his first play, The First Part of Henry VI., in 1589.About the PublisherForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
