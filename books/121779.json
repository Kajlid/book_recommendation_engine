  "description": "When you stop fighting windmills, imaginary or otherwise, you tend to end up with a lot of time on your hands. Of course, Aleksey Rider-Mikkelsen, Lord of Light Island, isn’t going to get bored. And if he did, he obviously wouldn’t join a preposterous hunt for sunken treasure with Ben and his annoying friends to keep himself entertained. He only has himself to blame, therefore, when a fun adventure suddenly turns deadly serious. There’s a reason some treasure should stay hidden. What he is about to unearth in the sub-tropical paradise of Scilly could have profound implications for the origins of all peoples of the world. And some of his companions are willing to kill to make sure that story is never told.",
