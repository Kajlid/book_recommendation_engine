Two males -- brothers -- both killed by bullets from a Russian automatic fired at close range. The cops have a a man Deputy Sheriff Carl Houseman busted five years earlier and the county's lead suspect in a series of recent robberies.Houseman knows they have the wrong guy. He also knows they've got something bigger than a burglary gone bad ... especially when the FBI starts showing up in Maitland. The brutal double homicide is just the tip of the iceberg in a case where a killer's trail keeps disappearing like footprints in freshly fallen snow, and where one bad break can send a good cop into a deep freeze.",
