  "description": "The Noble Eightfold Path—the Buddha’s first teaching—is a timeless truth. One starts with a vision, a moment of insight, then transformation of thoughts, and follows in the light of that truth. This teaching is explored in relation to every aspect of life and is a treasury of wisdom and practical guidance. The reader is taken deeper than in most introductions, while always remaining practical, inspiring, and accessible. This is the first in a new series, Buddhist Wisdom for Today. Sangharakshita is a leading Western Buddhist teacher and a popular author of more than thirty books on Buddhism.",
