But when the sun rises she finds herself jobless and homeless in Cardiff city with barely a penny to her name.She responds to an advert in the local paper—Room to let, wanted, girl to share.

Fortunately for Ariane, rent is the last thing on their minds.She discovers the men are bound together by a turbulent past. Liam, a computer whiz, keeps a painful secret hidden beneath his buff exterior, whilst Quinn, a pioneering neurosurgeon, wonders if he’ll ever meet a woman who can live with his controlling ways. They admit the one thing missing from their lives is a woman just like Ariane, who can handle them both in and out of the bedroom and who, together, they can keep satisfied, loved and most of all, safe.",
