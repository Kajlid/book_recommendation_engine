  "description": "I’ve known my daddy’s boss since I was nothing more than a little girl staring up at him with big wide eyes in my parents’ backyard. I’ve known my daddy’s boss as a powerful, smart, amazing millionaire businessman for as long as I can remember. And now I’m older. Old enough to take a summer job of my own alongside him, as his assistant. His good girl assistant. Old enough to learn from him, listen to him, and try my best to make him smile. Old enough that I now want my daddy’s boss so much it hurts. It’s only when I start to catch the way he looks at me right back that the little flutter in my tummy tickles harder. Moves lower. Turns naughtier. Because Mr Lindon isn’t quite the man I thought he was. Not even close. It turns out that Mr Lindon isn’t just my daddy’s boss. He’s my daddy’s dirty boss… And now he’s the boss of me too.",
