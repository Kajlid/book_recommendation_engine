  "description": "In The Complete Book of Zen, Shaolin grandmaster Wong Kiew Kit explains the principles and practice of Zen with a clarity that can only come from true understanding. Zen is the mystical essence of civilisation. Zen training and practice may also enhance concentration and emotional balance, help reduce states of chronic and degenerative disease, allow inspiring glimpses of cosmic reality and ultimately lead to supreme spiritual fulfilment. This book gives an expert account of the origins and development of Zen, and then outlines a series of exercises that offer the reader both a spiritual appreciation of the practice and also an actual physical experience of Zen. Irrespective of religion or spiritual beliefs, The Complete Book of Zen allows every reader to explore their spiritual potential.",
