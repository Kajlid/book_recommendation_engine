The once-proud title of Social Justice Warrior has been dragged through the dirt of prejudice and hate long enough.

Moretons Bestselling author of A Game of Rapes  “Nice job you’ve got there, oppressor. Funny, I happen to have your home address handy. Your daughter’s in middle school, right? And oh look, your boss’s phone number…” -Sam Piddle Respected columnist for Stawker Media",
