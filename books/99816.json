  "description": "A story about a man struggling to juggle two lives. He wants to fit in and be normal but can't fight the temptation of making quick money for the finer things of life. He can't walk away from his past life and is haunted by his terrible past. A true story that shows the feelings and thoughts of what people are like who live a life of crime. A womanizer, genius, humble ball of confusion wrapped up in one man as a walking example of what saying two things and doing another is all about. To see a relationship from a mans side that has a unique perspective on what it's like in today's dating world.",
