  "description": "“I laughed my way through this novel. A must-read from Meredith Schorr.” – Chick Lit PlusIt’s more about finding yourself than finding a man.Jane Frank is ready to fall in love. It’s been a year since her first and only relationship ended and far too long since the last time she was kissed. With the LSAT coming up, she needs to find a boyfriend (or husband) before acing law school and becoming a partner at her father’s firm. There’s just one problem: all the guys in New York City are flakes. Interested one day and gone the next, they seemingly drop off the face of the earth with no warning and no explanation. In her misguided belief that life doesn’t really start until you get married and have kids, Jane jumps from one extreme to the next trying to force a happily ever after until she breaks. Will she ever find her path, and can she do it without alienating her friends and family and risking her career in the process? A State of Jane is a hilarious, heartwarming, and honest coming-of-age story of what happens when a good girl discovers there is more to finding love than following the rules.Books by Meredith Schorr:JUST FRIENDS WITH BENEFITSA STATE OF JANEHOW DO YOU KNOW?The Blogger Girl Series:BLOGGER GIRL (#1)NOVELISTA GIRL (#2)Part of the Henery Press Chick Lit Collection, if you like one, you'll probably like them all...",
