  "description": "Love bites . . .Big time. And probation sucks, especially when it means I'm forced to partner up with a redheaded, backstabbing vixen. I can thank Dante for that fun little treat. Speaking of my reckless \"mentor\", he's in full flirt mode. Fane's tactics are far more ruthless, but what can you expect from a boy who bites?Something carnal has awakened in me and neither boy is helping tame my cravings.A member of our unit's team has been murdered and now Valerie and I are being sent after a suspicious vampire in Sitka, along with our psycho chaperone, Jared. I suspect the killer's much closer to homeâ€¦And I could be the next target, which leads me back to how my discovery all started: LOVE BITES!",
