  "description": "This is the entire Empathy series including, Empathy, Desolate, Vacant and Deadly. This is a dark romance series...read with caution. Blake: I am a brother I am a police detective I am a contract killer I don't want to love I don't want to feel I don't want ... EMPATHY. They say some people are born with decreased activity in the front central lobe causing them a deficiency in empathy. Maybe that's true about me but whether I was born this way or created in a moment of evil, empathy was something I didn't possess until her green eyes met mine in the mirror and I couldn't take her life. I didn't want to feel, didn't want this woman in my life complicating how I lived but she was there at every turn. Sent to haunt me for my sins. Her light so bright she provoked a shadow from everyone she touched. When a job turns bad quickly altering my life forever I'm forced to feel. When nothing is making sense I'm forced to face truths I never would recover from. When life drowns you in its cruelty you don't know which way the current will drag you or who you'll become once you re-surface.",
