  "description": "Luc, Carter, and Jake make up the Buffalo Intimidators' top scoring line and play together both on and off the ice, with a history of sharing women. Each of them is also a client of massage therapist Eva. When they decide they want to be more than just clients, they approach her about having a ménage a quatre.Eva's been secretly lusting after the guys for months, but was afraid to say anything in an attempt to keep her relationship with the guys on a strictly professional level. Besides, how could she pick just one when such mouthwatering displays of masculinity are spread out on her massage table every day? She agrees to the ménage, but when serious health problems begin to plague members of the team, will she want more than a quick score with her hockey boys?",
