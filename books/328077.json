The girl is devastation wrapped in a black, seductive bow.A knockout.A dream.Turns out, she needs a job, and I need the help. Now I have a vixen strutting around my shop, and I'm the fool who's itching to reach out and take what he can't have .But neither of us can ignore the burning attraction.

Because monsters like me don't deserve love.Only Salem has a secret, too. She's been running for years, and her past just caught up to us...",
