  "title": "The Writer's Path: A Guidebook for Your Creative Journey : Exercises, Essays, and Examples",
  "description": "Walton and Toomay have published numerous stories, essays, poems, books, and screenplays while teaching creative writing classes at various West Coast venues. They combine efforts here to share insights into the writing process and offer exercises designed to stimulate creativity and develop skill. Although the chapters include the basics of style, character, and story, this is definitely not a handbook or style manual. Each of the eight chapters focuses on an aspect of the writing process, providing a series of exercises that work on that particular technique and are designed for independent work, writing teams, or groups. The authors also provide examples of completed exercises that illustrate the focus of each chapter as well as ideas for classroom and group settings. Sidebars scattered throughout offer additional perspectives.",
