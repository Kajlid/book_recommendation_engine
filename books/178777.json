  "description": "Beyond broad shoulders and heaving bosoms.It takes love to face reality and conquer messy feelings. Short Synopsis: A modern-day pastiche of Jane Austen novels. Elise is a bright, beautiful law student, focused on a career and distrustful of men. She butts heads with Greg, an alpha male haunted by past relationships. Heartache and the specter of revenge. Unable to deny their feelings, they spend a night together. A jilted fiancée exacts revenge and forces them to face who they are and what they really want.A love tale of this day. A delicious romance with a literary slant and spiced with a twist of whodunit, this escapist fare also takes us into the inner life (thoughts, hopes, and doubts) of the main protagonists as they contend with realities that often face couples in compelling relationships—revenge of a jilted lover, past relationships, abortion, career choices, reactions of friends and relatives.",
