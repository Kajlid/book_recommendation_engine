  "description": "Lucy in the Sky Barbara Elsborg When you wake up to find a spaceship in your backyard, what do you do? Choose from three: Phone the police. Scream. Go yell at the alien for wrecking your garden. Lucy storms out of her house to confront the inept pilot and the last option turns out to be both the right and wrong choice when she finds the gorgeous hunk's name is Three. She's torn between fury that he's crushed her roses and decapitated her statue of Eros, and a longing that he enliven her boring life and whisk her to the stars. Three doesn't give her a choice when he throws her over his broad shoulders and takes her into space. Lucy soon finds herself exploring alien territory in ways she never imagined. Three's efforts to hide and protect her on the mother ship are stymied by his inability to keep his hands-and other body parts-off the luscious Lucy, and it looks as if her immediate fate might be a solo trip into space without a spacesuit. Reader advisory: Contains hunka-hunka-burnin' male/male sex scenes. Score!",
