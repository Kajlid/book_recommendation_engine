  "description": "When life knocks you flat on your back, and you know you've had enough, try telling that to a dog demanding his walk.Jay Walker is a fake. He acts full when starved and happy when sad. How else is a guy who has a deadbeat for a mother and a sister battling cancer supposed to feel? And isn’t walking a pet just a chore? Too bad the dog doesn’t know that. The dog lives in the now, embraces life to the fullest and gives his whole heart when offering love.Off Leash is unique because it showcases issues of poverty that transcend countries, age and color. Alternatively told between the POV of both Jay and the dog, Ollie, it shows the reader how a boy who wants a job to make some quick cash so he can buy food for his cancer-stricken sister struggles with trying to do the right thing in a world that has treated him wrong since birth. Off Leash has alternative endings.Check out Off Leash book trailer at http://youtu.be/8TlPncNAzNQ",
