  "description": "This book follows the strange and unusual life of Amy Mah (Vampire) a very bored and downtrodden teenage vampire girl. What makes the book different from the normal run of the mill vampire novel is the main character's cynical view of the undead world around her, and to help bring the undead world to life the contains sketches by the famous manga artist Heby scattered throughout the book.The Plot: Amy Mah was a Vampire, a blood sucking denizen of the night, or she would have been if it was not a school night, and to make matters worse she had just bitten herself (again), instead of her snack for the evening, a nice large and very bloody raw steak which having dropped out of her fingers was now leaving a very interesting stain on her new white t-shirt, and no matter how interesting a stain it made it did not make her mood any better. Amy knew from bitter experience that being a teenage vampire was not as much fun as the movies showed and as for the books about vampires, well they were all so wrong, for a start she could not fly but she could eat garlic, and as for going out in the sunshine, she did not glow or burst into flames, all that strong sunlight did was give her spots. So yes without sun block and a baseball cap the sun was dangerous as she could be the first teenager in history to die from terminal acne.",
