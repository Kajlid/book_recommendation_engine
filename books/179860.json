It's more intense than ever.I hate him, but I'm drawn to him, to the darkness, to the man buried deep inside the monster.He despises me, but he wants me. I'm the one that got away, and he's hell bent on making me pay. He's the fighter, but I'm the survivor, and I know if I get back in that twisted ring of passion and pain with him, I won't escape twice...Thorn is the third installment of the bestselling Carter Kids series. It's a story full of chemistry, anger, sexual tension, and pushing each other's buttons. Due to its explicit content, bad language, fighting scenes, and graphic sexual content, Thorn is recommended for mature readers of seventeen years and above.",
