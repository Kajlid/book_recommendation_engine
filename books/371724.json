  "description": "Two very different men. One magical world. An adventure that could cost everything.Dashing soldier of fortune Valentine Strange needs a fortune—he owes just about everybody, including his betrothed. Happily, the wealthy Holy Orders of Harappu are desperate to retrieve the diadem of the Goddess Purya from an ancient temple deep in the White Mountains.It’s to be a dangerous journey, but the pay is too good to refuse. Though the addition of a reputedly mad—and strangely attractive—witch makes Val suspect there’s more at stake than the retrieval of a mere religious relic.Aleister Grimshaw is a reluctant companion on Val’s quest. The same evil that surrounds the diadem once hunted him—and still threatens his sanity in terrible dreams. Cruel experience has taught him to keep to himself, but Val fearlessly defends him against all manner of curses, bandits and unnatural creatures. Grimshaw dares to hope that here is someone worthy of his deepest secrets…if the brash, beautiful Val will only listen to his warnings.But he doesn’t, and both men find themselves imprisoned by the masked priests of an unholy order. Grimshaw succumbs to a demonic power that will force both men to face the destruction of the only lives they have ever known.This book is previously published, and is available for the first time in digital.Warning: This book contains one dashing cad, one half-mad witch, two vengeful ghosts, various assorted demons and enchanted creatures, a pinch of revolution—and the illicit use of pith helmets.",
