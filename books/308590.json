If they're sweet, it's only to trick the gentleman into doing what they want, and once they get it, they're on to the next gentleman. So when he discovers the money he expected to win in a wager turns out to be the dowry of his future bride, he wants nothing to do with her.But whether Kitty or Aaron want the marriage or not, it's going to happen. And heaven help anyone who tries to make the marriage a love match.",
