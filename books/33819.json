  "title": "Tex and Molly in the Afterlife",
  "description": "Molly's and Tex's abrupt and accidental deaths have granted them a unique opportunity to brazenly reinvent their personal realities--not to mention a chance to commune with various forsaked ancient deities and down-and--out woodland spirits. But a pair of gentle souls once firmly rooted in the Earth cannot so easily vacate this corporeal plane. There are despoilers, witches, wolves, outlaw hackers, and rabid survivalists running wild through the soon-to-be corporately mutated Great North Woods. And Tex and Molly aren't about to vanish forever into the fast-moving eddy of Time until they take one last shot at profoundly influencing Eternity and this Life that is no longer theirs. Like a racous pagan dance in Thomas Pynchon's garden, here is a novel rich in intelligence, wit, unrestrained joy, and serious strangeness--a truly breathtaking flight of the imaginatino--written with style and heart by an award-winning storyteller whom the Washington Post once proclaimed \"either a genius or a madman.\"",
