  "title": "The Cornish Coast A Travellers Tale",
  "description": "A compact visitors guide to Cornwall and a brief overview of the history and attractions of each of the coastal towns in this beautiful part of the world.The book is not designed to be the only guide you will ever need, merely an appreciation of the beautiful towns to be found in this wonderful part of the world.My first hope is that it will encourage those who have not yet taken the step of enjoying Cornwall to make some plans to do so.But also, to those who have already visited Cornwall and have enjoyed it as much as I have, it will hopefully bring back to mind memories of holidays past and sustain you until your next visit!",
