  "description": "Wedding Album , the latest play written by renowned playwright Girish Karnad, is a hilarious and moving spectacle that is deeply revelatory about the India that we live in today. The central characters of this play portray the modern, middle-class, Indian a daughter who lives in Australia with her husband and children, a son who is a media professional, a younger daughter who is willing to marry a 'suitable' boy from the US whom she has never met, a doting mother, an ageing father rapidly losing his authority, and a loyal cook.Wedding Album operates at two it explores the traditional Indian wedding in a globalized, technologically-advanced India even as it juxtaposes the very different life experiences and expectations of the family and the loyal cook. By doing this, Karnad reveals how particular notions of wealth, well-being, sexual propriety, tradition, and modernity form the basis of middle-class society in contemporary India.This play has already been staged at numerous venues and was translated by Karnad himself from Kannada into English. An outstanding addition to OUP's corpus of plays by Girish Karnad, this volume will be of value not only to students and teachers of modern Indian drama, but also to general readers.",
