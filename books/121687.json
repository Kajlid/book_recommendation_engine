  "description": "My life has been a hard one. Sometimes seeming unbearable. But things have been on the upswing in years since I took the reins back. That was, until I seen Emery Stanner, C.E.O. of Stanner Enterprises on the news. Something about his eyes, his face, brought the nightmares I’ve fought for years to keep away. All the therapy, all the hypnosis, went right out the window. Now, I’m hellbent on getting closer to him. To getting rid of the nightmares for good. By getting my revenge. When Carina Eder walks into my office, her curvy body short-circuiting my brain instantly, I don’t fully comprehend the danger she poses. Something about her is familiar. Something about her has memories my mind repressed for years flooding back to me like tidal waves of ruination. I’m obsessed with knowing the truth. Knowing what I did to her. Knowing why she’s here. She’s the most beautiful thing I’ve ever laid my eyes upon. When she’s at home, her hair disarrayed, her thick-framed glasses on, is when she’s at her best. I can’t help the way she calls to me. I’m not the man for her. But neither are the men she’s surrounding herself with. And if I have to show myself, put myself between her and her demons, to keep her safe, I will.",
