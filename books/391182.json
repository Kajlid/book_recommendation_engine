  "description": "At the Grand Falls Fire Department, brotherhood is the key to everything. It's the glue that holds firefighters together through thick and thin. When Garrett O'Neal realizes the brotherhood he shares with his mentor and best friend could be something that fulfills the erotic fantasy he has of sharing his wife, Carrie, it begins a journey that none of them will escape without being plunged into the depths of flaming passion. A hot and intense tryst becomes so much more than just a bedtime fantasy. As the three begin to navigate the boundaries of love and desire, the fires of passion and their passion to fight fire threatens to tear the three of them apart forever.",
