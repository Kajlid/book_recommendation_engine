  "description": "A mother and daughter turn a hopeless old house into a loving family home with faith, hard work, and the support of their community.When a girl and her mother are forced to start over, they find themselves feeling isolated and defeated. Longing for their former neighborhood and friends, and overwhelmed by the repairs their new house needs, they finally realize they can't do everything alone - the only way to make things better is to ask for help. They both learn that when you reach out to the community, people answer with kindness. As the house gets rebuilt, so does their sense of belonging.Stunning illustrations from Thomas Gonzalez, New York Times best-selling illustrator of 14 Cows for America, give the backdrop to Jo Kittinger's inspiring story that reveals how communities are created--or recreated--when people work together. The House On Dirty-Third Street will touch the heart of anyone who has faced starting over in difficult circumstances.",
