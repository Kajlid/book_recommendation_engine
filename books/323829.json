  "description": "Leaving Pontotoc The Odyssey of Two Young Women in World War II, is the story of two young wives whose world is turned upside down following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Like every other young woman of their generation, they must constantly face the real possibility that America will lose the War and their husbands will never return. In the face of such adversity, they attempt to establish an independent life for themselves that they never dreamed possible. Along the way, they encounter love triangles, severe rationing of every commodity imaginable, film noir, Greek Mythology, the legacy of the 1921 Ku Klux Klan massacre in Tulsa, loss of faith, and the horrors of the Dachau concentration camp.",
