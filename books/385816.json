  "description": "This new slant on history is more up-to-date than Herodotus, more digestible than Gibbon, more fun than a barrel of Toynbees. It is stranger than fiction, but definitely not fiction. No one could make up this stuff!Think you know history? Who were the good guys during the Petticoat War? What did Marie Antoinette see in Louie XVI? Did Casanova ever find true love? Why did Benito Mussolini stop wearing bowler hats? Why did Joan of Arc hang out with the world’s wickedest man? Who was Cupid Dewey and why should you care? Get up-to-date with this entertaining and informative book of irreverent revelations about the jokers in history’s deck. Because history is not just a boring litany of dates and battles, it is a cockeyed cavalcade of lunacy.",
