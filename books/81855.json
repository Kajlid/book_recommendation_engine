  "title": "The Zuni Enigma: A Native American People's Possible Japanese Connection",
  "description": "\"A stunning and carefully supported argument that should stir useful discussion.... [An] exciting, groundbreaking work.\"― Booklist Did a group of thirteenth-century Japanese merge with the people, language, and religion of the Zuni tribe? For many years, anthropologists have understood the Zuni in the American Southwest to occupy a special place in Native American culture and ethnography. Their language, religion, and blood type are startlingly different from all other tribes. Most puzzling, the Zuni appear to have much in common with the people of Japan. In a book with groundbreaking implications, Dr. Nancy Yaw Davis examines the evidence underscoring the Zuni enigma and suggests the circumstances that may have led Japanese on a religious quest―searching for the legendary \"middle world\" of Buddhism―across the Pacific to the American Southwest more than seven hundred years ago. 72 black and white illustrations and 17 maps",
