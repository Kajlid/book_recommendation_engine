  "description": "In old KalDathia, a frightened king makes a fateful mistake that spells his country's doom and unleashes an ancient and terrible scourge upon the land. Beset by barbarian invaders, he Awakens a legendary hero known as Rakkoth, the Sleeping Savior, not knowing that the Savior is, in truth, a Dark sorcerer who nearly destroyed the world with his black arts before being cast into ensorcelled slumber eight centuries ago. Once revived, this sadistic sorcerer seizes power, conquers an entire continent, and forges an empire built on blood and death. Meanwhile, across the Luminous Sea in the Kingdom of Calderia, Crown Prince Killian grows to manhood, unaware that he carries within him a seed of divine power instilled by the gods. This power has been gifted to a mortal once in each generation against the time of Rakkoth's return-and must now be Awakened, if Calderia has any hope of prevailing against the evil emperor who has turned his malevolent gaze upon Killian's homeland as his next conquest. But to do so, the human prince must help to forge an alliance with other warring nations and races of Balleterria, including his blood enemies, the Elves, and their warrior princess, Ellianthia, who would sooner slit his throat and watch him die than join with him in common cause. Somehow, these sworn foes must refrain from killing each other long enough to learn how to work together, gathering other companions along the way as they undertake a long and perilous journey to solve an age-old mystery, find a magic talisman, seek out a lost mage, and save their world from descent into oblivion.",
