  "description": "November 2002, and sixteen-year-old Clare is travelling from Glasgow to Florence with her older brother Danny to be a part of the anti-capitalist demo. Amidst the crowds they meet Julian and Letitia, two alluring and seductive anti-capitalists from down south. Over the next few years the lives of Danny, Clare, Letitia and Julian become impossibly entangled in the personal and the political as each decides what is and what's not worth shouting about. But how will they come to shape the world - and how will the world come to shape them?",
