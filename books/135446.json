  "description": "Graduating from college is exciting, except for the part where you have to go back home.I had it all planned out–I’d take the long, cross-country route so it would be a whole week before I have to face the inevitable.Then home decided to come to me.My mom remarried unbeknownst to me and her new husband says he’s flying all the way out here to drive back with me, because he’s concerned for my safety.With every night we spend together on this trip, I begin to wonder if maybe that ring on his finger should match one on mine instead.",
