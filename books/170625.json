To the participants, whether dead or alive, two pairs of eyes observe the event. However, are they reliable witnesses and more importantly, how likely will they come forward to report what they saw to authorities?For Sergeant Malcolm Hobbs and his elite X-Men Homicide Squad this new investigation exposes case evidence that the victims were members of the Atlanta Police Department.The crime sets off a series of events that reveals an underbelly of criminal organization that involves Fabrice Mousassi and Julianna Delacroix. Payback fuels the fire inside of them that in turn races against the tick…tick…tick of a past windfall. Mousassi and Delacroix won’t allow it to slip away and by any means and method necessary, there will be retribution and long overdue compensation.The intensity of these threads and their connections increases the pressure on the X-Men to solve the crimes in the swiftest manner possible. However, painful pasts, guilt, innocence, societal rule of law and street justice will all collide with collateral damage that resonates to the highest levels of the APD.",
