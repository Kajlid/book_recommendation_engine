  "description": "From bestselling author Harriet Evans, acclaimed worldwide for storytelling that is \"fabulous\" (Sophie Kinsella) and \"brilliantly observed and emotionally charged\" (Daily Mirror, London) comes a dazzling new novel of heartbreak, loss, and healing, in which a young woman must cross an ocean  and the chasm in her own heart  to discover the love of her life.\n\nIn London, Kate Miller had an enviable life: an exciting job at a fashion magazine, an engagement and a wedding to plan. Then it all fell apart  spectacularly, painfully, and forever. That was three years ago...and she fled to New York City to live with her mother and stepfather. Now Kate is a true New Yorker, in love with the pace and rhythm of Manhattan. But deep down, she knows her life is in a holding pattern, that there is something  someone  more to love. But when her father becomes ill, Kate realizes it's time to return and face the friends and the memories she left behind. What really happened before Kate left London? Can she pick up the pieces and allow herself to love life again?",
