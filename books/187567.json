  "title": "Laboratorio: Poems from the Mullard Space Science Laboratory",
  "description": "In 2014, poet Simon Barraclough spent a year visiting UCL's Mullard Space Science Laboratory in Surrey. While happy to find inspiration for his own work, his chief aim was to discuss, disseminate, and generate poetry with the staff and students of the lab. Laboratorio presents the fruits of this year-long experiment and also showcases two guest poets who developed links with the lab. In these pages you will find experimental sequences; collaborative pieces; one-off lyrical gems; moving and humorous meditations upon cosmology, history, the Multiverse, scientific careers, the engineering of spacecraft, and the limits of language. Plus the intellectual appetites of silverfish. Laboratorio revels in the poetry of science and the science of poetry.",
