  "description": "Word Almost 39,000 High School bullying seldom involves the prototypical jock harassing the school nerd. More often than not, bullying involves one group picking on others because they are different or as a tool to harass, cajole or influence people they disagree with. Equally common is the idea that bullying always involves people from the same age cohort. The bullied boy series portrays a boy who has been the victim of both physical and vocal harassment. Having been demeaned, ignored and debased our protagonist withdrew from any interaction with his classmates. As the series progresses, the protagonist breaks out of his shell encountering different types of bullying and the stories revolve around how things are dealt with. The third book deals with the breakup of a high school power couple. The girl reacts inappropriately. Issues involve vandalism, social media, identity theft and false accusations embraced by the masses. An adult is involved in manipulating the students. Students evolve into a mob mentality adopting accusations as fact. As friends start getting hurt, feelings center on abandonment and hopelessness. With his past, our hero sees through the accusations and interrupts an attempted suicide. ********** There are no gruesome details as the situation is dealt with at armâ€™s length to allow the younger reader to try to understand the turmoil and mental challenges forced on the people involved in this situation.
