  "title": "My Love Nikola Tesla",
  "description": "A new aspect of the greatest scientist of all times is brought forth in Ana Atanasković’s new book. The author dug deep to discover a softer side of Nikola Tesla. His social gatherings with the most famous individuals of his time, friendships with poets, writers and other visionaries, his impeccable sense of style were all kept on the margins of Tesla’s scientific brilliance. Ana masterfully revisits his ties to a woman whose life was forever changed by the Serbian wizard in a story full of emotions of the noble female heart. The reader is transported to the late 19th century New York with a flick of the page, to the time when magic existed, wizards walked the earth, and the heart of a dutiful wife contained the secrets of the universe.",
