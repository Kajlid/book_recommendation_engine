When the photographer is murdered, and Nigel Jamison reveals to Sherri that the \"alien\" is actually his sister, the situation gets intriguingly complicated. Unwillingly swept up in Nigel's quest to rescue his sister, Sherri can't help being fascinated with him. By the time she finds out he's a vampire, the fascination has become mutual... And too strong to resist.",
