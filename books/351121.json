  "title": "A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom, Volume 2",
  "description": "First published in 1896, this two-volume history of the conflict between theology and science quickly became a landmark text. It was widely recognised, along with John William Draper's History of the Conflict between Religion and Science, as a defining study of the relationship between religion and science. A distinguished educator, scholar and writer, Andrew Dickson White was the first president of Cornell University. White held the view that religion was historically opposed to progress in the field of science. He argued that any interference on the part of religion in science had always proved disastrous, whereas scientific investigation, no matter how seemingly damaging to religion, had always resulted in the highest good. A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom is the culmination of thirty years of White's research, publication and lectures on the subject. Volume two discusses medicine, insanity, mythology, political economy and comparative philology.",
