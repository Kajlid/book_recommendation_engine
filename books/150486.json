  "description": "Note to self:  If an arsehole tells you he’s yours, believe him.  If a good guy tells you he’s yours, be dubious.  Good guys lie, because their ‘good’ reputation makes it so easy.  Arseholes never lie. Because they have no reason to. They don’t care about your ‘feelings’. They just slap ya’ with the hard truths.  And nothing hurts more than the truth, right?  So basically, Hard Truth is an arsehole’s most precious weapon.  I wish I’d known all this. I wouldn’t have been so distrustful, nagging, annoying, and jealous. I wouldn’t have been the girlfriend every guy hates to have.  Keeping Jahleel shouldn’t have been that hard. I had him. He was mine. He loved me. He assured me of this. Over and over. And I should’ve believed. I should’ve kept my mouth—and legs—shut. I should’ve believed when he told me he was mine, and mine alone.  Because arseholes never lie.  ****This is a follow-up novella to the previously published contemporary romance, JAHLEEL. It is required that JAHLEEL be read before KEEPING JAHLEEL****   *****Contains strong sexual content and adult language (Tons of F-bombs). Recommended for ages 18 and over.*******  *****GRAMMAR POLICE***** Please note that the author strives to present the most polished story to her readers.
