  "description": "As a high school senior, Alix is worried sick about finding a date for the prom. It's a big deal, but soon Alix will find herself caught up in something that makes the prom pale in comparison: a thousand-year rivalry between a werewolf and a vampire. For the past millennium, Rancour has dedicated himself to ridding the world of vampires, while Shay has kept busy thwarting Rancour's efforts. Despite fighting for years, these combatants are on the verge of becoming comrades -- both have an enemy stalking them, and he's doing so backwards through time. James McCann's unlikely love story integrates maps and striking illustrations into the plot, and packs scares and laughs for even the most reluctant reader.Author is available for school visits.",
