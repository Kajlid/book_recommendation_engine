  "description": "Emo the Bunny preferred gloomy days, walks over a cliff and misery of any sort. One day while hiding from sunlight, he saw something unusual. Normally he'd take a nap and try to forget about it, but this time he took an interest only to discover a conspiracy the likes of which no child would ever suspect!Ducks, bunnies, chickens, squirrels, geese, bears, cows, robins and The Easter Bunny all play a part in the disturbing events which show that woodland creatures aren't always as cute, fuzzy and innocent as they lead us to believe!",
