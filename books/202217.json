  "description": "Sabella was created by the government—raised as a pet to become a shifter warrior. But once the program was discontinued, Sabella was out on her own. No family, no friends, and a whole lot of secrets. Now she wants nothing more than to live her quiet, respectable life…until a girl from her past shows up in the form of a curious, intelligent, and very sexy young woman. Lilly’s led a sheltered life with little mystery. But when she notices her sexy professor’s cat necklace, one small mystery from her childhood rises to her consciousness.

And will they have the courage to not only explore their desire, but look past the secrets to see their love through to the end?
