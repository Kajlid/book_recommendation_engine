  "description": "Based on the solo show by critically acclaimed playwright and actor Ins Choi, Subway Stations of the Cross is a journey of an ancient faith in today’s restless world. Inspired by a real-life encounter with a homeless man, award-winning playwright Ins Choi ( Kim’s Convenience ) has originated an astounding work of artistry and imagination in these fourteen spoken-word poems and songs that make up Subway Stations of the Cross . Part public disturbance, part performance artist, and part modern-day prophet, Ins Choi embodies the form of a nameless vagabond who is both beggar and seer. He creates a rich tapestry of the profane and the sacred, the humorous and the banal, the contemptuous and the poignant in both poetry and lyric. It is a holy communion for the urban soul. This relevant and challenging show is captured here in book form with illustrations of subway drawings by Guno Park, whose work has been featured internationally.",
