  "description": "~Editor's Pick~  Two people meet in the dark to have hot, sweaty, anonymous sex...  But Whitney is increasingly drawn to her stranger. He’s powerful but gentle, and murmurs to her in Greek. But if he saw her face, it would all be over. Whitney’s looks make her unphotogenic. If she wants her promotion, she’s going to have to make some drastic changes. How will her stranger feel about that? He means more to her than he should.  Reporter and thriller writer Jay has his own problems, but he doesn’t count Whitney among them. She’s the lover he’s always wanted. He doesn’t give a damn about her face, but how does prove it? Once he tells her the secrets he’s holding, she’ll kick him out of her life, but he’ll have to take that chance. Even if he wants her far more than he should.",
