  "description": "Raphael is an Angel of Order. . . sort of. His affinity for chaos makes him the perfect choice to investigate the trespass in Alaska of supernatural creatures not seen in eons. But the locals in Juneau have been keeping a secret for thousands of years –the disgraceful offspring of an angel and a demon. Raphael should execute her on the spot, or at the very least throw her into Hel with the rest of her kind, but Raphael has never been one to follow the rules.Ahia has lived for thousands of years with the Alaskan natives and werewolves, told that she’s a Nephilim and must stay hidden lest the angels find and kill her. But when interdimensional rifts begin opening up throughout Alaska, swallowing humans and spitting out dangerous monsters, the angels are the only beings who can help. Of course the angel they send is smoking hot, and demands she assist him in closing the rifts. Far from the stern, enforcer of rules, this angel is fun and flirty, tempting Ahia to drag this project out far longer than she should. But when one of the rifts takes the local Alpha as well as a group of humans, the situation becomes urgent. Ahia will need to risk everything - her life, her heart, and all she's believed true to bring them home, because whatever the angels might call her, she won’t abandon those who trust her to keep them safe.",
