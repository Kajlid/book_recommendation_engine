  "description": "The ultra-cool cutting-edge thriller from Japan's new literary star.The body of a young girl is found at her home in Yokohama, contorted in fear, but the cause of her death is a mystery. Soon afterwards the bodies of three more teenagers are discovered - dead in chillingly similar circumstances.Sensing a story, journalist Asakawa becomes fixated on unravelling the cause of this bizarre sudden-death syndrome. He discovers that the four victims had shared a log cabin for one night, exactly seven days before their deaths.In the cabin, Asakawa finds a nightmarish secret - a curious videotape which plays not a movie, but a strange collection of abstract, subliminal images, concluding with a portentous message:'Those who have viewed these images are fated to die at this exact hour one week from now. If you do not wish to die, you must follow these instructions exactly...'Then the tape cuts to static.This slickly plotted page-turner reverberates with a terrifying supernatural twist. It inspired the cult Japanese movie and the US remake of the same name.",
