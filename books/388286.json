  "description": "Finally reunited, Noah and his siblings are celebrating their first holidays together in two decades. Not only that, but it will be his first Christmas with the love of his life, Seth. In other words, Noah has just about everything a Jaguar shifter could need. In fact, he’s so happy that it almost doesn’t matter that his sister is fighting with her wolf shifter boyfriend, two of his brothers are at odds because one shot the other and their city has been hit with one of the worst blizzards in Michigan history.Everything changes though, when past baggage comes out to bite them on the tail and for Noah and his siblings, some issues aren’t behind like they’d all hoped. Then when one of his brothers, Andy, pulls a vanishing act, they all have to act together or risk losing him forever. Will Noah be able to get over his problems in time to save Andy, or will this Christmas be the last one either of them ever live to see?",
