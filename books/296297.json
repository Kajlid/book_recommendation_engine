  "description": "She holds the key to his heart, and he wants it back.   Rena is the youngest daughter of the Sea King, and she’s dreamed of the surface for years. But her first visit on her 16th birthday isn’t what she expects. She watches a Jinni fall from the sky—and chooses to save him, despite her mother’s warnings that all Jinn are evil.  Once she meets Gideon, she can’t get him out of her mind. And maybe, with a little help from the Queen of Hodafez and some magic of her own, she doesn't have to... The Jinni Key is a loose “Little Mermaid” retelling. Set in a world that humans share with mermaids, dragons, and the elusive Jinn, this is not the fairytale you remember…  If you enjoy clean romance, adventure, and intrigue, then try the books in The Stolen Kingdom series now! These interconnected fairy tale retellings each feature a different princess who has to fight for her happily ever after.",
