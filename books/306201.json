I forced my way into her life, and turned things upside down. Not only am I dealing with snakes in business, but her family, and friends think we shouldn’t be together. The only problem is that I’ll never let her go.SofiaIt wasn’t meant to be like this. I think back to the first time I laid my eyes on Joaquin Fuertes, and thought I could control my feelings and not get caught up with falling in love. Now I’m in a position to never see my family and friends again. I ask myself should I leave my life behind or try to make things work with him. The only problem is that I doubt he'll ever let me go, but do I really want to be away from him anyway?",
