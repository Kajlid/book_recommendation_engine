She shares an apartment with a lobster...\n  Hannah spends her days swimming with sharks, chilling with her pet lobster Levi and avoiding commitment like the plague.  Sam’s days are spent expanding his family’s empire, bickering with his cousin Tom and dodging scheming gold diggers.  They both want the same thing- A few months of fun and companionship with an expiry date and hopefully no restraining orders. Except, as their self-imposed deadline draws closer, Sam finds he’s had a change of heart.  Can the charismatic billionaire convince the eccentric commitment-phobe to take a chance on love, or will she sabotage them both with her trusty Starfish Method?     *The Starfish Method is a standalone, laugh out loud romantic comedy. The lobster loving, shark enthusiast and the workaholic billionaire are about to find out just how strongly opposites attract.",
