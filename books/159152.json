But when the body of a woman is discovered in her cabin, irritation escalates to panic. There's a murderer aboard The Beautiful Dreamer... and maybe something worse.The chilling, relentlessly suspenseful follow-up to The Three, Day Four is a heart-racing tale from Sarah Lotz, a writer Lauren Beukes hails as \"a ferociously imaginative storyteller.\"",
