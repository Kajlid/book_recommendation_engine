Some men were made to tame only one woman…After years of earning the hard-won nickname “The Reputable Dom”, Michael is ready to throw it all away. He’ll become the opposite of everything that name suggests for a shot at owning the strong-willed business woman who clings to her secrets with an iron-fist. He’s determined to do whatever it takes to unearth her mysteries and make her change her mind about him, even if it means he has to ditch his stellar reputation in order to claim her…by very disreputable means.",
