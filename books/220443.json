  "title": "In Search Of My Sexy Old Self: Re-discovering sex after sixty and beyond",
  "description": "Why has sex just stopped? That's the question Cathy asks herself when sexual intimacy dwindles and finally dies when she is in her early 70's and her partner not much older. Is this what happens to everyone? Is it normal not to have sex after a certain age?And how does someone who grew up in the repressive 1950's find answers to these questions when to talk about sex is just as difficult at 70 as it was at 17? What to do? This book is the story of that search with a self-help dimension to assist others who want to make a similar journey of discovery into the world of over-60 intimacy and sex.Cathy explores the subject through books, movies and the internet and gradually involves her partner Charlie in the search for answers. Their world begins to change as they discover the sexual exploits and experiences of other seniors - from grand passion to 'living together apart', on-line dating and sex just for fun - and the way seniors accept transitions in the ways they can do sex.We find out about our out-dated attitudes to sex, how our bodies change with age, the effects of ill-health on the sex lives of seniors and ways to stay healthy and fit.In Search of My Sexy Old Self discusses what it means to be intimate as we grow older and provides practical advice on ways to communicate about sex and awaken the libido. And that includes being prepared to try new things, positions, sex-toys and ways of having sex.",
