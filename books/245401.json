  "description": "Thousands of years have passed since scientists opened rifts into the Otherworld, Inferis, and technology disappeared. Now magic abounds throughout the worlds, linking them together.Sadie, a female Warlock, should have been killed as soon as her powers manifested. Such power is reserved only for men. When her father tries to marry her off to an abusive suitor, she does the only thing she can think of. She uses her powers to summon a demon to protect her.Thael has reined in his baser instincts and clawed his way to power as one of the Lords of Inferis. He holds lands in both worlds with an iron fist and punishes any who try to test the peace he has created. Far too powerful to be summoned, he is shocked when he finds himself in the bedroom of a delicious maiden. Little does he know the deal he is about to make will be for far more than her virginity.",
