  "description": "The Green Man has haunted our churches and buildings and global subconscious for countless generations, becoming just another forgotten mythology that is relegated to garden statuary and English pub signs.No longer. Witness as the Green Man rises to capture our imagination in this anthology of original new fiction, the Urban Green Man.This simple image of a green foliated, disgorging face represents a relevant need in today's world to cultivate a more harmonious and sustainable relationship with Nature. Carl Jung offered a theory of compensation regarding our myths â€” that an archetype will reappear in a new form to redress imbalances in society at a particular time when it is needed. Perhaps the Green Man is rising up into our present awareness just when we need him most.",
