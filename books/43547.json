  "description": "Fiction. America died while no one was looking. All that remains is the skeleton of a land riddled with demise and what had once been referred to as domestic those commodities we once called our friends, our colleagues, our neighbors.\"Michael Seidlinger's terrific new novel pruned my skin. Seriously, I was reading it in the bathtub one night and I stayed in the water for a good couple of hours, deeply engrossed. It's that immersive (so to speak). It also marks a confident new direction in his work. THE SKY CONDUCTING is elegant, disturbing, and important. Buy it and read it.\"â€”Nick Antosca",
