  "title": "The Seventh Taking",
  "description": "It’s summer in southeast Louisiana and eleventh-grader Joy Vincent is complaining about everything from her dad to the family vacation being forced upon her, but Abraham Wilson has other things on his mind—and it’s not the mosquitoes. He plans to break up with Joy, hoping to begin college with a clean slate. But Joy doesn’t take the news well, and Abraham feels a tinge of guilt, yet that’s nothing compared to how he feels days later when he learns Joy has disappeared in the Blue Summit Mountains of Tennessee after an argument with her father. Abe begs his parents to let him travel to the mountains and participate in the search efforts, but they will have none of it. Weeks later, there’s still no sign of Joy. Authorities determine she voluntarily ran away, and they stop their search. Beside himself with guilt, Abe finally convinces his parents to let him go to the mountains with his friends Brett and Charlie to see for himself. The day after their arrival, they realize there’s much more to the story than just a girl who ran away from home, and they also realize they’ve gotten in way over their heads. Afraid but driven, the trio sets off on the narrow trail where Joy was last seen and soon they find themselves fighting for their lives against man, beast, and the majestic mountain country that can turn deadly in a split second. Will Abe and his friends live long enough to discover the secret behind Joy’s disappearance, or will they meet with the same fate?",
