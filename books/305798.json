  "description": "A sexy best friend's brother romance from bestselling authors Lauren Blakely and Lili Valente!  I'm the wrong guy for her. She's sunshine, and cherry pie. I'm whiskey and fast cars. I'm also keeping one hell of a secret from the woman I've wanted for years. But when I find a list my sister left behind for Ruby, I've got no choice but to offer the sexy, big-hearted girl next door both a road trip and a chance. A chance to discover how big she can dream. And if some of those dreams play out in the bedroom? Well, there’s nothing wrong with a few -- okay, several -- hot nights together as we hit the beach, visit old stomping grounds, and test all sorts of limits, in and out of the sheets. Seven days, then I'm off, moving across the country, far away from her. No way can things get complicated in a week. Ruby and I aren’t the kind of dream that has a shot of coming true. Especially once she learns what I’ve done. GOOD WITH HIS HANDS is a sexy standalone romance in the Good in Bed series!",
