  "title": "It's not my fault. Self Discovery & Admission",
  "description": "Prepare to laugh out loud at this politically incorrect novel full of short stories that are just plain wrong. You will be shocked, humored, amused and aroused. A provocatively original must read. Based on the popular blog, \"It's not my fault.\" A fictional story of a young woman who makes all the wrong life choices, told in a \"dumb blonde\" first person narrative, finding humor in even the most disturbing of situations. Appealing to the audiences of Chelsea Handler and Tucker Max and inspired by the antics found in the top UK comedy series, Absolutely Fabulous. A brutally honest account of obsession, sex and the abuse of alcohol. This book is not a memoir, it is a highly exaggerated piece of filth. Shame on you for reading it.*For readers 18+",
