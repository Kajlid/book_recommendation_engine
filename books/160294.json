  "description": "This is a love story between an innocent girl and a jaded man…a pet and her Master…and a soul seer who has yet to realize she’s meant to save the world…and a powerful vampire who has yet to understand his heart still beats.  18-year-old Zari Baltimore is suffering from an identity crisis. Her new school La Scala Legaturia, a training ground for strengthening bonds between Masters and pets, wants Zari to take pride in her role as human pet to Alexandru. But how can she do that when the vampire seems secretly intent on releasing her from his possession? Maybe it’s time to start distancing herself. Maybe it’s time to stop thinking as a pet and start practicing her skills as a soul seer. And maybe, it’s simply time to look for a new Master. At least if Alexandru throws her away, Zari just might be able to survive it. But then Zari has a vision of someone killing her, and losing Alexandru becomes the least of her problems.",
