[He] accomplishes his goal of updating the genre, and he does so with commendable energy and imagination.”— The New York Times Book Review“A master of dark visions, Jeter delivers his most . . . ambitious book to date. . . . An SF equivalent, perhaps, of The Name of the Rose. ”— Publishers Weekly the sparkling metropolis at the new center of what’s left of the civilized world. Here wealthy men and women seek forbidden thrills through a system that enables them to indulge safely and anonymously in their wildest fantasies through the use of computerized simulations known as prowlers.  Then a young executive at one of the the world’s most powerful corporations is brutally slain and an ex-information cop named McNihil is called in to find the dead man’s still “living” prowler. McNihil knows he’s walking into a trap. But he wants a chance to redeem himself for a botched job that forced him into retirement years ago. Teamed with a ruthless female operative called November, McNihil is about to enter a world in which no one can be trusted and things are far worse than they seem . . . a world in which a vast conspiracy of evil is about to blur the razor-thin line between the sane safety of daylight and the dark danger of noir.“Impressive.”— Locus",
