  "description": "The primal rule of winning: don’t fall in love with the contender. Three months shy of her eighteenth birthday, Ness is forced to return to Colorado. Even though it’s been six years, and the wolves of her all-male pack don’t recognize her, she recognizes them. People who shun others because of their gender are hard to forget.Especially Liam Kolane—son of Heath, the crudest and cruelest Alpha to have ruled the Boulder Pack. Liam is as handsome as he is infuriating, as kind as he is punishing, and he makes Ness’s traitorous heart race, which isn’t good. After all, he’s a Kolane. Like father like son, right?When Heath dies, Liam vies to become the new Alpha and no one dares to challenge him. Except Ness. Thus begins a treacherous game. The rules: winner takes all…including loser’s life.\nFans of Kresley Cole and Cassandra Clare will devour A PACK OF BLOOD AND LIES.\n* Contains Alpha males.* Not suitable for children under 15.",
