No one knows until, to everyone's surprise, she kills herself.Her brothers are secretly relieved: abandoned by her husband for her strange, unpredictable ways, she had been nothing but an embarrassment and a responsibility. But her suicide tears up the placid life of her journalist nephew, Satya, who discovers that before her death Medha had laid for him a trail of clues that led him to places no one ever knew she had been. In each place, Satya finds stories and artworks she had hidden and it slowly dawns on him that he is rescuing the life-work of a genius. In doing so, he learns how dangerously close he is himself to the abyss that has swallowed her up.",
