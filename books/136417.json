  "description": "What happens when the hunter becomes the hunted?  As a budding newspaper reporter, Brianna Stewart knows that if she ever wants to move up in her career, she needs to break a big story. Her target: Rocco Antoniv - a great white shark of the business world whose methods are as enigmatic as his looks are captivating. She'd been following him closely and had a hunch that he had something big in the works. Blowing the cover off his plans would give her a professional thrill and elevate her reputation to a whole new level.  But Rocco didn't achieve his success by being naive, or by giving away his secrets easily. While Brianna's beauty entices him, he can see she is hiding something. Unfortunately for him, that element of mystery only increases his longing for her. Used to getting what he wants and all too aware of how to use his charms, Rocco turns the tables on Brianna by making her feel pursued instead of the other way around. As he overwhelms her senses and breaks down her defenses, she gets a peek behind the curtain - a dangerous, beguiling view into his world.  As their erotic dance continues, Rocco's business plans go in motion and Brianna's instincts are proven correct. Whose secret will become known first? Find out in The Russian's Dangerous Game, book two of The Friendship Series.",
