  "title": "Fay",
  "description": "She's had no education, and you can't call what her father's been trying to give her \"love.\" So at seventeen, Fay Jones leaves home, carrying a purse with half a pack of cigarettes and two dollar bills. She's headed for the bright lights and big times of Biloxi, and even she knows she needs help getting there. But help's not hard to come by when you look like Fay.  There's a highway patrolman who gives her a lift, with a detour to his own place. There are truck drivers who pick her up, no questions asked. There's a crop duster with money for a night or two on the town. There's a strip-joint bouncer who deals on the side. And in the end, there are five dead bodies stacked in Fay's wake.  Fay is a novel that could only have been written by Larry Brown, whom the Boston Globe called \"one of our finest writers -- honest, courageous, unflinching.\"",
