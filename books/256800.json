  "description": "A vicious battle halts, interrupted by a messenger from Réxura. His report is grave. The trade city has been completely destroyed, its civilians massacred. “Calahein” is his dying word—Appernysia’s foremost enemy believed to be extinct since the First Age. In this emotional finale to the Beholders series, Commander Tarek and King Drogan must resolve the conflict between their people—over a thousand years of murder and deception—in order to defeat this ancient threat. The union of Rayders and Appernysians seems an impossible feat, yet the impending extinction of humanity requires that they stand together. The greatest of sacrifices must be made by all.",
