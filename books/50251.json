  "description": "“I haven’t seen you around here before,” the boy said to me. “We just moved in.” “Oh, really? Where’d you move into?” “It’s out in the country,” I said, pointing in the direction I thought the house was. “Off the highway. A few miles back.” He looked where I was pointing to, and a strange expression came over his face. “Old white house, right by the woods?” I nodded. “That’s the old Donner place,” he said slowly. “What’s wrong with it?” I asked. “Nothing,” he replied, suddenly looking innocent. But I knew he was hiding something. And I was going to find out what. A long, dark driveway towards an old farmhouse. A new stepsister with a nasty streak. A little sister who runs off. Something sinister lurking in the woods. Cassie Quinn’s new home comes with . . . complications. Cassie never believed in ghosts before. But now she is receiving strange messages, telling her to stay out of the woods. Are the messages just a ploy by her stepsister? Or are they warning her of an evil that stalks the shadows of the woods beyond her home?",
