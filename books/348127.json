  "description": "THEY CAME SEEKING WEALTH AND VENGEANCE. THEIR DREAMS MIGHT FORGE A NATION - OR DESTROY IT.In the 1850s Australia was a land of fertile promise and bitter truths, a wilderness that could only be tame by proud men and passionate women like the Broomes and Tempests. It was also a land with a secret - a secret that would be revealed with the discovery of gold in the rugged hills and desolate outback.With that discovery Australia became a mecca for men like Luke Murphy - questing, adventurous, torn between the lure of wealth and the dictates of his heart. And for men like Jasper Morgan - unscrupulous brigands for whom gold was a hunger so consuming, it justified every excess, every savagery, every sin.",
