  "description": "free to read at:http://www.mariaandvlasios.com\"We all have heard of professionals in picking up women. But what happens with the rest of the professionals? How do they do it? How would a lawyer, an economist or a web programmer approach his \"target\"? The answer lies within this book! Have fun...\"This book is a humorous collection of 60 different male professionals trying to approach and seduce a woman in a 1-page 4-panel comic strip. Each strip shows only one character, \"the Pickup Pro\", speaking directly to the reader, as if the reader were the woman being seduced! The actual woman is not shown and her reactions are in most cases left to the reader's imagination (though sometimes they can be understood by the expressions or the words of the character). The book is divided, according to the type of each profession, into the following small chapters: Science, Business & Technology, Construction & Arts, Celebrities & Fashion, Nutrition & Sports, Healthcare, Spiritual & Sex Professions, Law & Order, Government & Security. At the end, there is a bonus chapter called \"the wrong guy group\", with some of the guys that women should definitely avoid!",
