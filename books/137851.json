  "description": "Twenty new paintings, made between 2008 and 2012, comprise this catalogue of an exhibition at Gagosian Gallery, Rome, in May 2013. Assertive compressed gestures, sweeping complex textures, a lush palette, and the dynamic interchange of light and dark are all traits of Howard Hodgkinâ€™s distinctive signature. With their maximalist gestures and saturated colors, his more intimately scaled paintings appear jewellike, while larger works are opulent and theatrical. With incorporated frames and painted wooden supports, they operate as both objects and images.",
