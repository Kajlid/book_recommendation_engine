  "description": "“Mixing humor with tender moments, Reichs creates an enjoyable journey with wonderful writing and likable characters.”— Library Journal   From the author of The Best Day of Someone Else’s Life comes Leaving Unknown —a funny and touching story of a young woman who, while traveling across country, finds herself stuck in the true middle of nowhere, a.k.a. Unknown, Arizona. Great writing comes naturally to Kerry Reichs (she’s the daughter of New York Times bestselling author Kathy Reichs, whose Temperance Brennan forensic mysteries inspired the TV series Bones ). With Leaving Unknown, Kerry has penned a bittersweet modern-day Odyssey that readers of Kristin Gore, Jennifer Crusie, Meg Cabot, and Jennifer Weiner will absolutely adore.",
