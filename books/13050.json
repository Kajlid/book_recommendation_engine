  "title": "The History Man",
  "description": "Now a twentieth-century classic, The History Man tells the story of Barbara and Howard Kirk, their very modern marriage and their equally radical politics. Set in the fictional world of Watermouth University, Bradbury brilliantly captures the complexities of academic life, from tedious meetings and workplace machinations to corruption and disruption at the highest levels. And as the unease and unhappiness behind the Kirks' relationship becomes apparent, so too Bradbury's ability to dissect the human heart and character. His insightful, profound portrayal of a marriage in crisis is utterly convincing and compelling.",
