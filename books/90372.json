After Hara’s meaningless death at his command, Inac finds himself feeling remorseful and ashamed for all the horrors he’s committed over the vast millennia in which he has lived. Eager to forgive himself, Inac sets out to find redemption. Not sure where he’s going, he finds himself back home near the village of his youth. But things have changed in Africa since he lived there last. The continent is rampant with violence, which threatens to force the darkness of Cain back into his soul. Afraid to lose even a shred of his hard-won humanity to the blood-lust waking within him, he gives up everything he’s ever known in an attempt to save himself. But he fears it may be too late.Redemption is the epic second book of The Cain Chronicles, which follows Cain as he travels the world seeking forgiveness. Without Hara’s presence, will he find it? Or will he end up a wanderer for all eternity?",
