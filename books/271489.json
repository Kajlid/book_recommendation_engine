There is one toy that Tommy treasures above all others … and that's his toy knight which he found at the bottom of the garden. But one day his treasured knight disappears and he doesn't know where to look to find it. At least he doesn't know where to look until he bumps into a little toy mouse called Rolly … a little toy mouse that possesses just a little bit of magic … and that's when the extraordinary adventure begins!",
