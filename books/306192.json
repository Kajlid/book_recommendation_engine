  "title": "Wolf's Christmas: A Christmas Story of renewed Faith, Hope, and Love",
  "description": "It was a cry for help and God had heard Patrick’s plea. After many years as Ellinwood’s seasonal Santa figure, he had misguidedly decided that he was a failure. The moment he was no longer able to see the importance of his holiday influence, he began to lose faith in his Christmas role, and even the understanding of his true purpose.Now, Patrick Wolf, one of Ellinwood’s most beloved citizens, must travel to the arctic north, after a catastrophic event alters his life forever. With less than a month until Christmas Eve, Patrick Wolf must rediscover the true meaning of Christmas through the help of Christkind and the North Pole Family. A race against time, Patrick must find his way home, just in time for Christmas Morning.",
