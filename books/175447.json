  "title": "Five by Endo",
  "description": "Five wonderful stories by the Japanese master. Winner of every major Japanese literary prize, his work translated around the globe, Shusaku Endo (1923-1996) is a great and unique figure in the literature of the twentient century. \"Irrevocably enmeshed in Japanese culture, he is by virtue of his religion [Endo was Roman Catholic] irrevocably alienated from it\" (Geoffrey O'Brian, Village Voice). It is this aspect that has made Endo so particularly intriguing to his readership at home and abroad. Now gathered in a New Directions Bibelot edition are five of Endo's supreme short stories exemplifying his style and his interests, presenting, as it were, Endo in a nutshell. \"Unzen,\" the opening story, touches on the subject of Silence Endo's most famous novel -- that is the torture and martyrdom of Christians in seventeenth-century Japan. Next comes \"A Fifty-year-old Man\" in which Mr. Chiba takes up ballroom dancing and faces the imminent death of his brother and his dog Whitey. In \"Japanese in Warsaw\" a business man has a strange encounter; in \"The Box,\" an old photo album and a few postcards have a tale to reveal. Finally included is \"The Case of Isobe,\" the opening chapter of Endo's novel Deep River in which Isobe, a member of a tour group, hopes to find in India the reincarnation of the wife he took so much for granted.",
