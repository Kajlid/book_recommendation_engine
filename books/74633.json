  "description": "Are you into Living Together Relationships? Personal Growth? Human Life Styling? Is your desire Creative Control? Sadomasochism? Staying MellowAt All Costs? Then you will relate to Cyra McFadden’s The Serial.To mark 35 years since it was first published, the novel has gone on sale in e-book form for the first time, with new artwork, bonus features, interviews and reviews from the time, plus a new preface by author Cyra McFadden. There are also bonus features, reviews and an interview with Cyra McFadden from the time, plus a look back at how the inhabitants of the San Francisco community reacted as their area – and habits – became the focus of world attention.Described by Newsweek as “one of the most delicious acts of cultural sabotage since Mark Twain” and author Lisa Alther as “the funniest book ever written”, it mercilessly satirises the inhabitants of Marin County, California in counter-culture-gripped 1976.Here, in 52 scintillating episodes, are the essential Kate and Harvey Holroyd, desperate fighters in the struggle to stay hip and loose in Marin County, California – a welter of lentil loaves, enzymes, whip fantasies, natural fibres, TM, Zen jogging and vibes both good and bad.Set at the very epicentre of the self-obsessed 1970s, when everyone talks (without ever saying anything) in the psychobabble of faddish self-help manuals, it’s the most sophisticated, liberated, high energy, naturally organic and hilarious adult soap opera ever!",
