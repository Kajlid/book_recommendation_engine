  "description": "Perplexing, unfathomable, and perhaps unimportant, the cases that Malmö’s Department of Sensitive Crimes take on will test them to their limits.\nLife—and crime—is not always as it seems for Ulf Varg and the other fearless detectives in Malmö's Department of Sensitive Crimes. There are always surprising new cases to take on, and the latest batch is no exception. And that's not to mention Ulf's struggle to contain his feelings for his colleague Anna Bengsdotter. All in all, things are distinctly difficult in Malmö, and it seems up to Ulf and the Department to set them right.",
