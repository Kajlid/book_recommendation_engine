  "title": "Go In and In: Poems From the Heart of Yoga",
  "description": "Here are poems that put words to the ineffable experiences that yoga practitioners have all the time, those moments when separation drops away, and body, mind and spirit become one. Inspired by the experiences of yoga and meditation, the natural world, and the challenges of life itself, these poems capture both the struggle and the delight of the author's attempt to live consciously. They speak in a voice that is both encouraging and uplifting, yet they are simple and accessible.",
