  "title": "Marilyn's Last Sessions",
  "description": "Blending psychoanalysis and film noir in a riveting tragedy, this prize-winning novel takes an intimate look at Marilyn Monroe's last days. In the years before her death, Marilyn Monroe came to rely on Dr. Ralph Greenson more and more, meeting with him almost every day. He was her analyst, her friend, and her confessor. He was the last person to see her alive and the first to find her dead. In this highly acclaimed novel, Marilyn's last years and her last sessions on Dr. Greenson's couch, are brilliantly recreated. This is the story of the world's most famous and elusive actress and the world she inhabited, surrounded by such figures as Arthur Miller, Truman Capote, and John Huston. It is a remarkable piece of storytelling that illuminates one of the greatest icons of the 20th century and the Hollywood world in which she lived and died.",
