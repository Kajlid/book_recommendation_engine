After another argument with her mother, she defiantly sneaks out to ski in Riverside Park. Much to her surprise she meets another cross-country skier, a cute, if odd, boy about her own age. Against her better judgment, she follows him into a snow-covered magical Otherworld inhabited by the monstrous Wyssun and the Skiers who hunt them. Mistaken for a boy, Anna is accepted by the peculiar Skiers as one of their own, and becomes trapped in the Wyssun' World. Run by elves, and not the Keebler kind, it's a confusing and dangerous place. Anna must get back home before the fairy tale turns into a nightmare. She has to unlock secret doors, make new friends, negotiate glaciers and battle tunnel-dwelling beasts, all the while trying to win the affection of the oblivious boy she likes and fend off the advances of a mysterious sorcerer she hates. As Anna struggles against the monstrous world, she fights the inner monsters as well. Before she discovers the truth about love, she has to learn the value of loss, only then can she find the way home.",
