  "description": "Queen Meg, pirate queen, Mistress of the seven seas, is a fable in her own lifetime. Her renown is due to her beauty, her psychic sense of tide and weather and her skill with dagger and sword. She is lusted after and feared in equal measure, but in the end, Meg must face what she strives to escape, and question the very heart of the buccaneering life she has carved for herself.",
