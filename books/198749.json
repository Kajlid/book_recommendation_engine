  "description": "Love can conquer all, if he’ll only believe…Roman Jonas has spent years recovering from a violent assault when he was just a teenager. He’s worked hard, and finally found his place in the world. Now, if he can only get his coyote to agree. As a medicine man for his pack, he isn’t able to shift. It’s frustrating to say the least, but not as frustrating—or confusing—as the feelings he has for former Ranger Abraham Evans.Abraham lost the ability to do his job effectively when he was shot. His right arm and hand are close to useless, and he’s had a hell of a time not dying over the past month. Sometimes it seems like it’d be so much easier to just give up, but a certain hazel-eyed man has captured his heart, and it won’t stop beating.When Abraham is discharged from the hospital, he moves to Del Rey to be closer to Roman, and because he has no one else in his life who truly cares about him.Slowly, he and Roman begin a tentative friendship that turns into something more enduring than they’ve ever dreamed of, but enemies from the past threaten everything and everyone Roman and Abraham love.Reader Advisory: This book contains reference to past sexual assault.",
