  "description": "Never run from a werewolf.My life has taught me to expect the unexpected.A serial-killer rampaging through the New York Pack?Sure. Why not?But a serial killer who smells like me?That’s a heck of a lot more than unexpected. With the Alphas of All poking around and my own Alpha on a rampage to figure out who the murderer is, it becomes a race to see who finds the truth first.I'll find the killer.Or the Alphas will find me.Either way, it's time to face the facts.There's a lot more to being \"Wolfsbane\" than suppressing my pack's shifting. And I'm pretty sure it starts with my freakishly red hair. If you love books by Melissa Haag, Olivia Wildenstein, or Jennifer L Armentrout, you’ll devour RUNNING BESIDE THE ALPHA*Recommended for mature readers",
