  "title": "The Road Less Traveled: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth",
  "description": "By melding love, science, and religion into a primer on personal growth, M. Scott Peck launched his highly successful writing and lecturing career with this book. Even to this day, Peck remains at the forefront of spiritual psychology as a result of The Road Less Traveled. In the era of I'm OK, You're OK, Peck was courageous enough to suggest that \"life is difficult\" and personal growth is a \"complex, arduous and lifelong task.\" His willingness to expose his own life stories as well as to share the intimate stories of his anonymous therapy clients creates a compelling and heartfelt narrative.",
