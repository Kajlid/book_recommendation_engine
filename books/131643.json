  "description": "Meet the operatives of the Carnacki Institute—JC the team leader, brave, charming, and almost unbearably arrogant; Melody the science geek who keeps the antisupernatural equipment running; and Happy Jack the terminally gloomy telepath. Their Do Something About Ghosts. Lay them to rest, send them packing, or just kick their nasty ectoplasmic arses… In a quiet London suburb, four university students participating in an experiment inside a reputed haunted house hold a séance that goes terribly wrong. What—or who—ever they summoned has taken their minds away, leaving them empty shells. Enter the Ghost Finders, ready to confront an enraged poltergeist for the students’ very souls. All in a day’s work—except the team doesn’t know that in another part of the city, a different entity has also breached the threshold between worlds. And this time what is at stake is not four lives—but the very existence of all humanity.",
