  "description": "Give up her colorful, independent life telling stories in the marketplace to marry the cold, ruthless Duke Gavrin? Princess Kaela vows \"Never!\" Flouting her father's wishes -- and resolving to ignore her sister's fears -- Kaela sets out alone for a distant kingdom, determined to make her own way and live her own life in the way she loves best: by weaving tales for anyone who will lend an ear. Her gift serves her well, for it is as the result of the first tale she tells in a village inn that she meets up with Kippen, the minstrel who accompanies her on her journey -- a journey that becomes perilous when the two discover that Kaela is being pursued by an unscrupulous sorcerer who has been sent by her outraged father to track her down.Living by their talents and their wits, Kaela and Kippen wander the back roads and byways of the kingdom, winning not only their daily bread, but many friends as well. Like a necklace of fallen stars, the stories Kaela tells along the way are strung together by strands of adventure and romance in this lively, forthright, yet magical tale.",
