  "description": "David is born of a curse, one that has rendered his father's kingdom helpless to an endless winter. Never seeing his father, raised with the knowledge that his birth killed his mother, David grows up with only his old nurse for company, watching the snow fall, wondering if it will ever end. When his father remarries, David gains a step-brother and sister, beautiful siblings who decide to take the fate of their new father's kingdom into their own hands, sending David to what they think is a quick end. But David escapes and meets up with a man like no one he's ever met, a miner named Alec, whose gruff ways and kind heart warm David up like nothing ever has. He would stay with Alec forever of he could, but things never quite work out as planned in a fairy tale... This retelling of a classic story has it all. Evil family, star-crossed lovers, and beautiful language. Read it and see what happens when the snow ends!",
