  "description": "\"You love me, Lady Green. Even as I love you.\"Gwyneth wasn't supposed to fall in love with Gawain. Not like this. Gawain was the May King—a sacrifice offered to the Goddess for a bountiful harvest in return. Gwyneth knows this. His fate has been decided by powers beyond her control. But the warmth of his touch and the taste of his lips have blurred the lines of what she knows to be true. Now Gwyneth is willing to risk everything to keep Gawain alive, even if it means losing him forever...In truth, in very truth, I do…\"A famous knight must rely on a woman to comprehend the chivalric virtues in this subversive and deliciously witty feminist retelling of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\"—Publisher's Weekly\"The book is unique in its presentation of Lady Green as a strong female character, and many teens will identify with the choice she made for love.\"—School Library Journal\"In her fine reworking of the medieval poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Crompton explores honesty, promise-keeping, honor, and the power of women. Recommended.\"—Library Journal",
