  "description": "Eleven-year-old Cerys is no normal little girl. The orphaned daughter of a fifth century Welsh king and queen, her only friends in the island kingdom of Môna are her old Pictish caregiver and a young chambermaid. The new queen wants nothing to do with her-- instead doting on her own son, who will one day rule Môna in place of Cerys. The people of Môna, royal and commoner alike, barely remember she even exists.It’s hard being a young princess without a kingdom or even a mother and a father. It’s even harder for Cerys because in addition to her other troubles, she was born mentally impaired. She lives her life in a perpetual fog of loss and regret, wishing more than anything to be like everyone else…to be normal.Then one day Cerys meets a new friend, one whose thoughts are as clear to her as speech, and she finds her own previously muddled thoughts growing clearer. It seems like a miracle to Cerys and the small circle of people who care for her. Now that her thoughts are clearer though, she knows she can’t ever tell anyone how she came by her incredible cure. In fact, she knows that if anyone found out her friend’s identity, it would surely lead to death for both of them. Like Cerys, her new friend is different from everyone else in the world.“The Forgotten Princess of Môna” is the first book in “The Dragon’s Treasure” trilogy.",
