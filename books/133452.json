  "description": "Even a tale of World’s End has a beginning.Rone, once a continent of austere beauty and mighty nations, slides inexorably toward dissolution. The Dalin Clan, led by their conflicted Warlord, Gor, live in the shadow of their former power, their bloody, warlike culture, no proof against murder and treason. Rivals see in the Clan’s fading might an opportunity to settle ancient vendettas, even as unseen forces from beyond the World of Men look to usher in the end of days – from the Outside, where the Fallen abide.A Warlord who values life, even as his humanity is constantly denied; a crippled bard, blind to his inner beauty, worthy of every song; a Seer, unable to see what is coming, but asked to guide his people. They are among the company of the few, the far fallen, and they are all that stands against the chaos that seeks their end.Literary-leaning and tragic, beautifully described and compellingly written, Few Far Fallen presents a world as complex, flawed, and real as the characters that inhabit it. Discover why it is only against darkness that light can be seen, and why even endings have a beginning.",
