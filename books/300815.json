  "description": "Lindsey Gillett is missing. And she’s not the first girl at Waverly High to vanish without a trace. To help cope with the tragedy, new history teacher Aubrey LaRoux organizes a student investigation team. But when the project’s key members start turning up dead across campus, Aubrey suspects there’s more going on than anyone is willing to admit. The murdered students all had something in common with Lindsey. They shared a secret. And what they uncovered could threaten the future of the historic school. At Waverly High, someone wants to keep the past buried—and you don’t want to get in their way.",
