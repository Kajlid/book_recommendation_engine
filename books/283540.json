  "title": "The Animal Penis Book: A comic filled journey of nature’s weirdest genitals",
  "description": "The longest penis in the world (by body size ratio) is wielded by the barnacle. Those crusty things that live on the side of docks, rocks, and boats by the ocean. Yep those guys have the biggest dicks in nature. well actually the BIGGEST is unsurprisingly the blue wales penis. That thing weights around 400 lbs. and can be between 8 to 12 feet long. That amount of dong weaponry seems dangerous to the general public honestly....Like seriously, did you know that female ducks have evolved corkscrew vaginas in order to stop male ducks unwanted advances. Nature is intense. If you want to learn more fun and interesting animal facts like these, take a look at my book. People always say to write what you know about, and for some strange reason, I have accumulated 50 unique and interesting animal genitalia facts. Each has a fun comic and a page or so of text to give you a small background on each animal, and why they have such strange parts.If this sounds interesting to you, please toss this book in your cart and let me know what you think of it :D\nCustomer Review\n“This book is the perfect blend of information and off kilter humor. It will be proudly displayed on my coffee table for the foreseeable future. Mr. Meadows did a fantastic job of researching and describing the subject matter, animal genitalia, and presented it perfectly. For those of you who appreciate nature documentaries, dry humor and dirty jokes (and who doesn't?), this is the perfect blend of all 3! I hope there's a sequel in the near future!”\"Quick, funny, interesting read. Really enjoyed it. Learned more than I needed to know about animal sex organs. Can't wait to spread the word.\"",
