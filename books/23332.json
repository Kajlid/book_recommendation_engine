  "description": "Ecological disaster looms in the Arctic. An eminent climatologist drops dead in his London apartment. Appointed executor and lawyer, Robert Spire is about to have his life turned upside down... Having relocated from London to Wales to run his own law firm, Spire is contacted by Doris Stanton, mother of the late UK climatologist Dr. Dale Stanton, with a request that he finds a suitable home for her dead son's legacy - a large sum left to global warming organisations. Spire sets out to investigate, but soon realises his life is in danger as he uncovers a conspiracy with far reaching global implications... A second climatologist drops dead in California, during a climate change conference, and Spire's involvement deepens; his investigations taking him to San Francisco, Paris and finally the Arctic, where he joins a US/French expedition to seed the Arctic Ocean with an experimental substance. The aim -to slow global warming in the region. Spire soon discovers that someone wants the climatologists silenced at all costs as he becomes entangled in an international conspiracy set to push the Arctic to its tipping point and the Earth to disaster.",
