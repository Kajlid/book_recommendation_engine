  "title": "Two Voices Falling",
  "description": "The year is 1758; the place, the Pennsylvania frontier. A young girl is helping her mother make breakfast while her father and two older brothers are outside preparing for the day’s labors when shots ring out. Within minutes the girl’s world is turned upside down. A world that, for her, will never be the same.Two Voices Falling is the true story of Mary Jemison, a fourteen year old English girl who is taken captive by a Shawnee war party at the height of the French and Indian War. Her mother, father, two brothers, and a sister are killed, but Mary is spared, only to be adopted by two Seneca women as a replacement for their brother who was killed earlier in the war.For the next 76 years Mary lives among the Senecas, one of the six nations in the Iroquois Confederacy. At first horrified at the thought of living the rest of her life like an Indian, she slowly grows to love her adoptive people and their way of life. Her story, spanning more than ¾ of a century, is a rare, eye-witness account of the fight for control of the North American continent by four great peoples—the French, the English, the Indians and, finally, a new breed of white men who called themselves Americans.",
