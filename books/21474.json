  "description": "Laura Palmer was introduced to television audiences in the opening scenes of Twin Peaks as a beautiful dead girl, wrapped in plastic. Now available in print for the first time in many years (and in e-book for the very first time!), The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer chronicles Laura's life from age 12 to her death at 17, and is filled with secrets, character references, and even clues to the identity of her eventual killer. Fans of the show will love seeing their favorite characters again, and Laura's diary makes compelling reading as she turns from a naive freshman having her first kiss to a \"bad girl\" experimenting with drugs, sex and the occult.\"As seen by\" Jennifer Lynch, creator David Lynch's daughter, The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer is authentic, creepy, and a perfect book for anyone who loves supernatural suspense.",
