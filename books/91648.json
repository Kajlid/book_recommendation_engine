When his latest movie takes him to Australia for a red-carpet premiere, he thinks he's ready for anything.But nothing could have prepared him for his raw, carnal response to his Aussie bodyguard. Sexual attraction to a man is a first for Chris. Now he realizes why his relationships with women have never felt quite...complete.Liev Reynolds is comfortable with his bisexuality, but his attraction to Chris is an inconvenience he must ignore. For starters, there's his professional ethics. Then there's the long trail of female broken hearts in Chris's wake.Hard as they both try to keep their minds on their jobs, desire and a little matchmaking tip them over the edge. But Hollywood endings aren't real life. And when the truth leaks out, their careers aren't the only collateral damage.Warning: A hunky Hollywood sex symbol. A smoldering, stubborn Australian. A desire so powerful it cannot be denied. A kiss. And a photograph. This \"isn't\" your normal boy-meets-boy story.",
