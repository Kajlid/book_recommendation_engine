  "description": "Bared to You: Gideon Cross came into my life like lightning in the darkness? He was beautiful and brilliant, jagged and white-hot. I was drawn to him as I?d never been to anything or anyone in my life. I craved his touch like a drug, even knowing it would weaken me. I was flawed and damaged, and he opened those cracks in me so easily? Gideon knew. He had demons of his own. And we would become the mirrors that reflected each other's most private wounds?and desires. The bonds of his love transformed me, even as I prayed that the torment of our pasts didn't tear us apart... Reflected in You: Gideon Cross. As beautiful and flawless on the outside as he was damaged and tormented on the inside. He was a bright, scorching flame that singed me with the darkest of pleasures. I couldn't stay away. I didn't want to. He was my addiction?my every desire?mine. My past was as violent as his, and I was just as broken. We?d never work. It was too hard, too painful?except when it was perfect. Those moments when the driving hunger and desperate love were the most exquisite insanity. We were bound by our need. And our passion would take us beyond our limits to the sweetest, sharpest edge of obsession? Entwined with You: From the moment I first met Gideon Cross, I recognized something in him that I needed. Something I couldn't resist. I also saw the dangerous and damaged soul inside ? so much like my own. I was drawn to it. I needed him as surely as I needed my heart to beat. No one knows how much he risked for me. How much I?d been threatened, or just how dark and desperate the shadow of our pasts would become. Entwined by our secrets, we tried to defy the odds. We made our own rules and surrendered completely to the exquisite power of possession?",
