  "title": "The Collected Dialogues",
  "description": "All the writings of Plato generally considered to be authentic are here presented in the only complete one-volume Plato available in English. The editors set out to choose the contents of this collected edition from the work of the best British & American translators of the last 100 years, ranging from Jowett (1871) to scholars of the present day. The volume contains prefatory notes to each dialog, by Edith Hamilton; an introductory essay on Plato's philosophy & writings, by Huntington Cairns; & a comprehensive index which seeks, by means of cross references, to assist the reader with the philosophical vocabulary of the different translators.Socrates' defense (Apology)/ translated by Hugh TredennickCrito/ translated by Hugh Tredennick Phaedo/ translated by Hugh TredennickCharmides/ translated by Benjamin JowettLaches/ translated by Benjamin Jowett Lysis/ translated by J.
