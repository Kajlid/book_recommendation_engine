  "description": "Once a down-on-her-luck clairvoyant, Cassie Palmer is now the supernatural world's chief seer. She’s overcome a lot to get where she is but may be facing her biggest challenge yet. Her lover, the part-fey war mage John Pritkin, is facing a battle for the throne of one of the great light fey kingdoms. Winning means gaining control of their army for the war with the gods that Earth is currently fighting. Losing . . .Losing wouldn’t be a great idea.In a race for a throne, there is no second place, and Faerie is not known for being forgiving. Cassie has to help her lover not only survive but come in first in a land that hates his human and demon blood and is determined to kill him rather than let him succeed. And as if that isn’t enough, an old villain from her past has a plan for revenge that might be even more dangerous than the fey.",
