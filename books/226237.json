  "description": "When Letters From Home make all the difference.  Ethan Miller, an Army Apache Helicopter mechanic, was on tour in Afghanistan, biding his time as he worked hard and played hard.  Brooke Thompson, a fourth grade teacher, was leading her class in a project to write to a soldier.  Through the letters and gifts, Ethan grew to care for the group of children…and their teacher. Making plans for meeting after he comes home takes a back seat when the war intervenes. Can two people, who’ve never met, find love? A standalone, no cliffhanger, and an HEA. For language that some may consider crude and for scenes of a sexual nature, mature (18+) readers only.",
