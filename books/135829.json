  "description": "Oxrun Station is different. Nobody can really explain it. You just have to understand that bizarre things happen there. No one knows why, they just do. Weird things. The kind of things you don't even want to dream about in your worst nightmares. Like what happens this Halloween to Sam Jones, Eleanor Trent, Tina Broadbent, Chuck Antrim, and Cody Banning... Maybe it really is the rare conjunction of Mars and Saturn with Venus, lowering the barriers between our world and another, shadowy realm...or maybe it is just that the full moon always brings out the strangeness in that place. Trick or Treat is crazy enough, with ghosts and goblins and witches and warlocks and all manner of other nasties roaming the street. But in Oxrun Station, the masks aren't always made of rubber. This year the fabric of the cosmos is unravelling, and dark and dangerous things are leaking across the borders... For five unsuspecting teenagers, their lives will never be the same again as they discover the hidden terrors lurking beneath the surface of their quiet town and experience the most horrifying Halloween of them all... Aimed at older teenagers and adults who like their horror stories to have a supernatural twist, this mosaic novel is meant to be read on any dark and spooky night.",
