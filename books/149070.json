  "description": "Rancher Jesse Breen was the last of a dying breed--a man of honor and integrity, a gentleman. Except when it came to a sexy woman in a pink Cadillac convertible--a woman who had hair the color of the setting sun and a body that drove him crazy. Of course, hitting her car and hurling his sheep onto her white seats weren't his smoothest moves... .Marnie Raines knew that the blue-eyed, macho rancher meant trouble the minute he and his sheep crashed into her life. Jesse disturbed her equilibrium and made her forget her priorities--like putting her life in order and forging her own independence. And no matter how much he tried to convince her otherwise, nothing and nobody was going to stand in the way of her independence. Not even love.",
