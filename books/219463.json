  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author Tawna Fenske comes a refreshing take on second-chance love―and the hilarious hurdles along the way. Allie Ross is not living the life she once dreamed. Her law career ended before it ever started, her parents landed in jail for running a Ponzi scheme, and she just inherited her grandmother’s B&B―which is nice, even if it is full of extra-toed cats. As for her love life…she’d rather not talk about it. When Jack Carpenter reaches out to reconnect with Allie, the girl who broke his heart in college, his plan is to impress her with the adult he’s become. Sure, he was a deadbeat then, but life has forced him to grow up. And it’s a relief to find out that things didn’t necessarily go the way Allie expected either. As Allie and Jack get reacquainted, they rediscover the things they loved―and hated―about each other. But who they are now isn’t who they were then, and secrets―old and new―will test whether they have a future together, or if the past is destined to repeat itself.",
