  "title": "The Sovereign of Eversun",
  "description": "Two societies of sentient Machina: the Arturians and the Mordrani, battle for control after a global cataclysm devastates the civilization that created them. At one time designed to entertain humans in epic battles modeled after the medieval knights, their existence is now defined by an unending schedule of hand-to-hand combat, they call The Battle Cycle. Eversun, the stronghold of the Arturians, basks in the radiance of continual daylight, providing a powerful and plentiful source of power to their city and Champions. During Battles, these Champions, led by Artur, fend off raids conducted by the powerful Black Knight. The Black Knight strives to capture Eversun and claim it for the Mordrani, who are relegated to the Shadow Zone, and limited by their dependence upon geothermal power. While the Mordrani have always succeed in acquiring vital resources during these raids, they have never been successful in capturing Eversun. The Arturians, meanwhile, despite winning every Battle, never achieve a victory complete enough to ultimately defeat the Mordrani. So for years, this cycle has continued, with the two titanic powers locked in a seemingly eternal stalemate. However when Bard, a neutral Machina programmed to record the events surrounding The Battle Cycle, discovers a young human girl named Calli, it sets into motion a chain of events that may finally unlock the stalemate, or destroy the Machina altogether.",
