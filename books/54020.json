  "title": "The Bane of Lord Caladon",
  "description": "Alonin was the rightful Lord of Castle Caladon. But the ancient and dread dragon Thudredid occupied the castle, terrorizing the countryside and destroying all who came against it. Every Lord of Caladon had gone against the dragon as soon as he had a male heir. And every Lord of Caladon had been killed! If he chose, Alonin could remain with his grandfather, King Clemmth, and become heir to a kingdom. But the ancient curse of his blood called him back to Caladon. He knew that his time had come and that he must challenge the might of Thudredid. Only by returning the dragon's stolen Dylcaer jewel would he have any chance to survive. But the jewel lay in the coffers of dread witch-queen Urganni, ruler of an island of invincible pirates. She alone was immune to the evil that haunted the Dylcaer. Dylcaer or Thudredid--Alonin knew he had only a choice of dooms!",
