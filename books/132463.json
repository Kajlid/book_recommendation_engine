  "description": "The SS City of New York is about to embark on its maiden voyage to England. It is August, 1888 and Madeline Donovan is a passenger on this ship, an unexpected trip she has taken because the thought of being in America or around anything familiar at Christmas when the tragedy occurred would be unthinkable. But everything abruptly changes when the local London papers arrive on board and the news of Jack the Ripper's latest victim are the headlines in every paper. She encounters Jonathan Franks, a reporter from The New York Times and other chance meetings that change her thoughts and path that will lead her directly to Whitechapel, the deadliest place to be.  Stalking Jack contains approximately 90K words and 310 pages long. If you would like further information about this book, please visit my website: http://madisonkentwebsite.wix.com/books",
