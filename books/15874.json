  "description": "For the Major and his wife Edelgard, the idea of a holiday touring Southern England seems perfect. But England presents more than a contrast of scenery to this German couple, as Edelgard seems to undergo a change of temperament. This is an account of an ill-assorted group of upper-class people grappling with the hardships of the open road.",
