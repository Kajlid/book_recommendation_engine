  "description": "An oracle tells of their coming: the six, born to right the wrongs of their ancestors. Sam, Adrianne, Teresa and Carrie are only children—and one of them is destined to die.For centuries, Earth’s sister-world, Ariatless, has maintained neutrality between the realms, a safe space for the patron races to co-exist. But when a baby is born of war, it becomes the perfect host for the Old World’s greatest evil: a spirit called Talicor. From broken homes, to the walls of school, four unsuspecting children are called to fight for a world they never dreamed existed. Each has their part to play and power to wield, but they must first overcome their fears. The Battle of the Worlds cannot be lost. It will end where it began—on Earth.",
