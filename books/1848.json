  "description": "Ten years have passed since civil war tore the Northern kingdom apart. Though peace has been declared, it is a fragile thing and new currents threaten to sunder bonds of blood and friendship. When Duke mac Cuill is taken by Southern runners, his friends must find and free him before poisoned whispers destroy the elven alliance forever. The elven scout, Gwendyrion, searches for his friend but fights a silent war of his own against the whispers of the sea that threaten his sanity. Giles, newly trained wizard and ward of Duke mac Cuill, heads south by land, determined to save the only person he calls family. But his magic has taken on a life of its own. Neither can walk away but saving their friend may ultimately destroy them both.",
