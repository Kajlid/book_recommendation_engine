  "description": "Winner of an American Book Award. Named one of the Best Books of the Year by Library Journal. A novel about two Vietnamese-American sisters, longtime rivals, growing closer as they \"grapple with their upbringing, their present circumstances and their shortcomings\" (Kirkus Reviews). Called \"A writer to watch, a tremendous talent\" by the Chicago Tribune, Bich Minh Nguyen makes her fiction debut with the deeply moving and entertaining story of two Vietnamese sisters. Aside from their petite stature, Van and Linny Luong couldn't be more different. Diligent, unassuming Van works as an immigration lawyer in the Michigan suburbs where she resides with her handsome, Chinese-American lawyer husband. Beautiful, fashionable Linny lives in Chicago and has drifted into an affair with a married man. When Van's picture-perfect marriage collapses and Linny finds herself grappling to escape her dead-end life, the long-estranged sisters are unable to confide in one anotherâ€”until their eccentric inventor father calls them back home to the Vietnamese American community they fled long ago.",
