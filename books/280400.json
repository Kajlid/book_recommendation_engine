  "description": "When a talking owl tells Kali she's more than just an average eighteen-year-old, her mind is convinced she's gone crazy. Once she finally accepts his words as truth, she spends an entire year conditioning her body for all that is to come on her next birthday. Except, when the day arrives, she realizes her little friend left a few things out...  Kali is the first descendant in decades to be born from two royal fae lines, but being special isn't always a good thing. Even though she's been training for the last year, Kali's ill-prepared to face the threats headed her way, and she'll need someone to show her how best to defend herself.  That's when Callen steps in, and once again, nothing is as it seems. Even though something about him draws her in, they butt heads at every opportunity. With Kali's future on the line, she does her best to concede to the changes in her new life, but being the hero Arvayta wants her to be isn't as easy it sounds.",
