  "description": "The detectives called it “graveyard love,” and it happened more than you’d think; a spurned lover would rather murder his beloved, than allow her to walk away. This case seemed no different than the usual—a murder-suicide, by someone who’d decided he couldn’t bear such a rejection.Doyle thought it was a bit odd, though, that the perpetrator worked for an armed transport company; you’d think he’d have been thoroughly vetted. And it was an interesting coincidence that the female victim had a connection to the Public Accounts investigation—the one that was giving Chief Inspector Acton such fits. Who would have guessed, that the cornered bureaucrats would put up such a fight? Certainly not Doyle, who was fast coming to the conclusion that there was much more to all this than met the eye, and plenty of graveyard-love to go around.",
