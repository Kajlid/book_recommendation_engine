I know what we had was real, that our love was once in a lifetime. Now she’s back from her Parisian fashion internship, and I'm ready for answers, desperate to understand why she couldn't just stay. Jordyn When I walked away, it was to protect him. Yet, all he knows, all he cares about, is that I left. Coming home is a bittersweet journey, each step heavier than the last. While I’m no longer half a world away, the obstacles in front of us make it feel like we’ve never been farther apart. I want to give him the answers he so desperately craves, and this time, I’ll get to say goodbye. However, what I didn’t plan on was Ryder’s fight. He’s not going to let me go so easily this time.",
