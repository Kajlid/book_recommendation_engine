Memories of Lisa’s father were shadowy ones, but she remembered him as generous in his love toward her. Her only memory was of her father saying, \"You’re so beautiful,\" just before her mother escaped during the middle of the night in a telephone truck during Boston’s record snowfall in 1978. Lisa also remembers hearing the name, “Whitey Bulger,” and the delivery of black roses to her doorstep.Forced to be a survivor in this world, and regardless of extraordinary obstacles, she refused to be the victim. In addition to searching for love and becoming a mother at a very young age, she slipped through the cracks in regard to education and other things. Lisa shares the intimate details of her life having undergone violence, which nearly took her life.The Girl with the Caterpillar Eyebrows is more than just a compilation of heartbreaking tragedies, lessons learned, and words of encouragement to others facing extraordinary obstacles. It’s also a story of never giving up hope no matter how difficult any situation, including the domino effect on business failures and difficulties due to the 2008 economic downturn and since.",
