  "description": "The worst thing an athlete can experience is a career-threatening injury. On April 22, 2011 rising MLS star Steve Zakuani broke his leg and his career was immediately put in jeopardy. In one moment, he lost everything he had worked his whole life for. There is no way to prepare for something like that. It took him 500 days to fully recover and get back on the field. People always ask Steve what that experience was like, and if he had any advice for someone going through something similar. This book is his recollection of the setbacks, fears, doubts, victories, advice, and encouragement he experienced as he fought for his career. Derived from the journals he kept during his 500 day recovery, it is his hope that this book will inspire you to face any adversity you encounter head on.",
