  "description": "\"This takeoff on teen horror novels is funny, mocking, and a surefire hit. . . . Should have teen-horror fans screaming with laughter.\" — SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL (starred review)In Paul Fleischman’s hilarious parody of teenage horror novels, Danielle and her friends from Cliffside High’s cruelest clique — the Huns — set out to crush a ravishing exchange student from Norway. Will they go as far as murder? They have before. But as they plot and plan, they start to realize that something ghastly has started to happen to them, something they would no doubt describe as a fate totally worse than death!",
