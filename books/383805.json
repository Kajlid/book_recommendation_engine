  "description": "\"All should know. Women and men have been and will always be equal in the sight of God.\" -Baha'u'llahAdvancement of Women presents the Baha'Ã­ Faith's global perspective on the equality of the sexes, including:The meaning of equalityThe education of women and the need for their participation in the world at largeThe profound effects of equality on the family and family relationshipsThe intimate relationship between equality of the sexes and global peaceChastity, modesty, sexual harassment, and rapeThe equality of women and men is one of the basic tenets of the Baha'i Faith, and much is said on the subject in the Baha'i writings. Until now, however, no single volume created for a general audience has provided comprehensive coverage of the Baha'i teachings on this topic and its many aspects. In this broad survey husband and wife team Janet and Peter Khan address even those aspects of equality of the sexes that are usually ignored or glossed over in the existing literature.Tactfully treating a subject that often provokes argumentation, contention, polarization of attitudes, and accusations, the authors elevate the discussion to a new level that challenges all while offending none.",
