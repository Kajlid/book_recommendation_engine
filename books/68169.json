  "title": "Islands and Insulin",
  "description": "The story of a girl, given a boat, one hundred nautical miles of ocean, and way too much caffeine to reflect on how an incorrigible disease has altered her voyage into adulthood, all wrapped inside a diabetes survival manual. It is a cross between the humor of Steve Markley's Publish This Book, the travel journal of Jimmy Buffett's A Pirate Looks at Fifty, and the sailing of Pete Goss's Close to the Wind minus the sixty knot winds, fifty foot waves, below freezing temperatures, and the slick escape from death... hopefully.",
