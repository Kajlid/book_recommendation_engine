  "description": "Hannah was lovely enough to make any man forget the past--any man except Buck Hogan. For thought she had more than fulfilled the promise of beauty in the 14-year-old girl he'd once known, Buck would always remember that back then he had been her father's whipping boy. Helpless no longer, he would have his revenge by taking the old man's ranch. The only thing he hadn't counted on was falling in love with Hannah. .",
