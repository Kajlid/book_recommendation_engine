  "description": "5 Shots. A graphic novel about death... crime ... deception ... and a mind reader caught in the middle. Jay Nova is a private eye. That's what the business cards say. More than that, she's the right person to call at the wrong time. Armed with a tough demeanor and hidden mind reading abilities she goes where others won't to do what they can't ... if the money's right. But when jobs get nastier ,and clients with things to hide have cause to want her dead, she'll need more than her semi-automatic and good aim to make it through. 5 Shots - crime drama in the dime pulp tradition - shows a place where violence isn't the best answer ... just the only one.",
