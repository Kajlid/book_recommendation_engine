  "description": "In Overwhelmed, West Virginia tall tale-teller Bil Lepp keeps a smile on your face as he regales you with stories about catfish-grabblin’, summer camp, moose-trappin’, and a mishap with the FBI.Being a five-time winner of the West Virginia Liars’ Contest makes Lepp a natural for his two a state employee and a Methodist minister.From childhood to adulthood, Bil’s wacky adventures often include his best friend, Skeeter Barth. Whether you find that Bil and Skeeter are trouble-makers or that trouble just follows them around, you’ll be laughing as they test smelly catfish-bait; get stopped by the sheriff; struggle with rock climbing; and get attacked by woodpeckers, catfish, and moose.Bil is often accompanied by his super-dog Buck, “whose mother was a German shepherd and whose father was a prolific and extremely determined basset hound.” With Buck’s help, Bil tries kayak dogsledding on the New River; stops up the Bluestone Dam; and takes the Monster Stick out for one last wild ride.\"Bil Lepp stars his gun-shy hunting dog Buck in a tale that grows taller and taller--and then even taller. Listeners are howling with the hilarity, tears of laughter streaking faces split with wide-mouth grins. When the young teller wraps up his story in one more burst of implausibility, the audience leaps to its feet, cheering. All hail the king!\"--Mary Ellen Botter, The Dallas Morning News.",
