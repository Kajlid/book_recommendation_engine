  "description": "The stories spoke of villainous mages that wielded lightning and made the blood boil in your veins, and the valiant knights who would defeat them. Maeve knew she was doing her part, she was valiant and had slain more men than any other knight in her lord's army. It was Rodric who was appropriately magey and yet all wrong. The nature mage was too gentle, too kind, and the cute little woodland creatures he talked to? No less than adding insult to injury. Yet the most vexing thing about him was that he did make her blood run hot with nothing more than a sweet, dimpled smile.",
