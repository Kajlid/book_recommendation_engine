To be touched.When she’s given the opportunity to rejoin the world of the living and experience exactly that, the muscle-bound immortal warrior with icy blue eyes is just what the doctor ordered.As soon as Nord sees Lina sitting at the bar, he knows she’s who he’s been searching for. The woman he’s soul-bound to protect.There’s just one problem.He’s helpless against the very thing she needs protection from: Her past.Lina might be the ghost, but she’s the one who’s haunted. Because the secrets of her past are coming for her.

If you adore overprotective, ax-wielding alphas, smoldering sexual tension, supernatural secret societies, and loads of banter, you’ve just found your next read!",
