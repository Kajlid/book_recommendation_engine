You have unique stories to tell the world, teachings and words that will inspire and encourage others. So what are you waiting for? It's time to unleash that writer within. This isn't your average writing book, with guilt-inducing lists of 'how-tos' in your search to become a writer...or a better writer. Instead, internationally renowned and beloved writer Cecil Murphey walks as a companion alongside as *Discover who you are. *Develop your voice and writing style. *Learn to write with heart. *Become authentic to your readers. *Grapple with the dreaded 'Writer's Block' (it's not the deadly monster it seems). *Harness the inner critic (and a few outer ones too). *Expand your comfort zone. 'We need to continue improving our writing skills, but in the process, we can't forget who we are. If we do, our voices become lifeless. The words may sound beautiful, but they won't express our true selves.'-Cec Murphey. New York Times' best-selling author and international speaker Cecil (Cec) Murphey has written or co-written more than 120 books, including the runaway bestseller 90 Minutes in Heaven (with Don Piper) and Gifted The Ben Carson Story (with Dr. Ben Carson).
