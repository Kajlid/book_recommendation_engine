She suffers through school, skips the extracurriculars, and runs home so that she can log-on to Renaria. High school parties? Yeah, right. Her weekends usually involve her prized headset, a pile of gummy bears, and her loyal feline companion, Sphinx, by her side.Unless her mother forces her to socialize more, she’ll be max level by winter. That is… until a magical storm, a handsome Elf Diviner, and a whirlwind of adventure turns Leda’s game into a reality. In the end, Leda will have to decide: Ignore the quest and turn off the game, or dive in and risk everything for a shot at escaping into a world she never could have imagined.",
