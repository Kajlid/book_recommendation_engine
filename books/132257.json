Work is Gabe's life. Which is why when she slugs a suspect, her boss orders her to leave town for three weeks of vacation she doesn't want.

William \"Bill\" Thomas is a widower who's decided to fish in the BDSM dating pond after years of failed attempts. When he meets \"Ella\" at his first munch, he suspects she's hiding a secret but doesn't know exactly what. Being assigned to a joint task force together forces Gabe and Bill to admit their true identities to each other and confront their feelings. Gabe has spent her entire life proving herself through her work, but Bill wants to show her what love and happiness feels like and convince her that she's anything but a broken toy. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
