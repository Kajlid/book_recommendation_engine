  "title": "The Sensationally Absurd Life and Times of Slim Dyson",
  "description": "Slim Dyson is a man about town. He's an artistically inclined urbanite, a ladies man, and a social butterfly. The only problem is that he's homeless. Well, he doesn't have a problem with that. In fact he doesn't have any problems at all, because Slim Dyson is the most optimistic man alive. In fact, his optimism borders on delusion. And when he accidentally becomes catapulted into fame and fortune, Slim finds himself thrust into a world where honesty and optimism come to die: Hollywood.The life of luxury is foreign to a man who would rather sleep on a shelter cot. Will Hollywood change Slim? Can even the purest heart survive the washing machine of Fame without fading? And what's the point of a toilet that shoots water up your butt, anyway?",
