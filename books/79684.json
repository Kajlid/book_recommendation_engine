With her memory, she invites readers to travel with her to Vietnam and go back to the time before and after the pivotal year of 1975. Anhthao also exposes her continuing journey in the United States, from the perspective of a newcomer, throughout nearly 100 short pieces of writing. Fish Sauce is dedicated to Cheri Johnson, Anhthao Bui’s best friend, who is scrutinizing and zealous about Vietnamese culture, tradition, and people.",
