But what if you could learn how to tap into unparalleled productivity and take charge of your time to redefine success, eliminate stress, and simplify your life?  There’s no question that in our fast-paced, modern world we’re constantly bombarded with interruptions -- social media, an email, talkative coworkers, and even our own distractive thoughts.
