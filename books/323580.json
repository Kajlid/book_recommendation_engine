  "description": "A creeping cloud, shimmering with sickness.Masked men, whose sticks explode with fire.When you’re a canine survivor of the world‘s worst nuclear accident, it’s hard to know which to fear most...Young strays Ony and Belka want nothing more than a safe patch to start their family. But a devastating explosion at the power plant turns their simple dream to ashes, and their home into an uninhabitable ghost town.Attempting to outrun old rivals, ruthless exterminators and the trauma of a troubled past, the pair encounter a human clean-up crew who seem eager to help. Can the ailing strays trust the creatures that have cost them so much? And can they find sanctuary before the spreading fallout finds them?Uniquely capturing the naivety of animals faced with the horror of a man-made disaster, this poignant story of survival – the first title in the Animal Eyes anthology series – is a timely reminder of humanity’s responsibility to the natural world.",
