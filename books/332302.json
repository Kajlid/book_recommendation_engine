  "description": "Princess Liliana Storidian is brilliant, gifted, and destined for nothing. Such is the fate of the third born. Ellegance Fournier craves the thrill of adventure but has settled for the taste of keeping the family bakery afloat. Consigned to their respective realities, both women squeeze out every drop of life and power their roles allow. However, one exhausted king's abdication changes everything. When the weary King Leo invokes the Monarchic Trials, all those who bear the mark of Imperium, God of power, are invited to contend for the throne and a glimpse of the power Imperium's followers seek. With this declaration, what is possible shifts for both women. Liliana, given the opportunity she has dreamt of, refuses to give in. Ellegance, finally allowed an escape from the monotony and a chance to improve the lives of those in her family, can't afford to lose. Both women will fight and claw their way to the crown, no matter who stands in their path.",
