  "description": "This isn't the first time that Jo Beth Sidden's life has gone to the dogs. But the bloodhound trainer-turned-sleuth's latest case has a trail so cold there isn't a scent for her trusty canines to trace. Thirty years ago, two baby girls were kidnapped and their nanny murdered. The estate owner's daughter turned up safe in a nearby church. The other, the gardener's child, was never found. The man convicted of the two crimes was a vagrant who insisted he was innocent throughout the three decades he served of a life sentence. Now, he's being paroled for health reasons and Sheriff Hank Cribbs is worried his return will stir up bad blood. Turning to his best friend, Jo Beth, Hank asks for help. With her beloved blind bloodhound, the two-year-old Bobby Lee, Jo Beth must sniff out the ghosts of the past and find the truth buried deep in a swamp of cunning deceit and murderous secrets.",
