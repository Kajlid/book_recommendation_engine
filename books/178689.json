  "description": "Scarlet, Alabama doesn’t know what to make of Sloan Averley. She’s an outsider, as wild as she is beautiful, and so much trouble even her Yankee parents didn’t know what to do with her. But she’s their beloved high school football coach’s granddaughter and this is THE year…The year that blue chip recruit and quarterback protégé Courtland Mackenzie carries them on his very capable shoulders all the way to their first state championship. As a surprising common goal is forced upon them, Sloan and Courtland’s very different worlds collide and clash. The town’s golden boy and the rebellious beauty: they have as much contempt for one another as they do fascination. Can Sloan find a way to accept the dark past she can’t change in the last place she every thought to look: on a football field? Will Courtland be able to create a balance in his life before his promising future slips away? They have to go through each other to get what they want, but time’s running out – the season’s almost over.",
