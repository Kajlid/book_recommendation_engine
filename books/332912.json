  "description": "I guess it’s naïve to say I thought I would be an actress.But isn’t that why everyone comes to Los Angeles? Fame?Then again, I’m from here.And after years of paying my dues, all that fame and fortune was shoved at me with the promise of care for my family.I’d grabbed for it without truly seeing what I was reaching for. Now I’m trapped in a role that owns my body and slowly steals pieces of my soul.I wanted to be on camera . . . I never wanted this.But when an intriguing stranger steps into my life, everything changes.For the first time in so long, I feel alive—cherished and adored.But as our stolen glances and secret smiles turn into shared nights and hidden passion, I know it’s only a matter of time before we fall apart.Because he has no idea what I do for a living, and he works with my boss . . .Now all my secrets are threatening to expose my deepest shame and ruin so much more than the façade I’ve fought to maintain.",
