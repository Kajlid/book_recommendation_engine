The timing couldn't be worse however as she has just agreed to become a surrogate for her sister and husband to give them the one thing they cannot have. Things do not go to plan when her brother in law calls a halt to the procedure to allow Emily to continue her affair with Matt. Emily refuses to accept this and breaks things off with Matt regardless as she concentrates on this one last thing that she needs to do for her sister before embarking on her own life aspirations. However, It appears fate has its own idea for Emilyâ€™s future.",
