  "title": "Armed Candy: A True-Life Story of Organised Crime",
  "description": "Gunned down in broad daylight on his own home patch in 1998, the young man's murder seemed like just another street squabble between drug dealers, and the police marked the file unsolved. But in a one-mile stretch of Glasgow's slums, the victim's bodies started falling, disappearing, overdosing, and meeting accidents. The police were at a loss. This is the story of organized crime gone paranoid and turning in on itself, seen through unusual eyes. Kay, a call-girl by profession, was a member of the inner circle of one of the countries most vicious gangs. Raised in a rural middle-class home, she spent her teenaged years in rough housing schemes, and was conned into prostitution by her mother. After a chance meeting with a gangster in a bar, she was recruited by him as his confidante. Soon she was carrying a loaded gun. She took a lover, the gang's equalizer, who was the young man gunned down in the street. For Kay it was the start of her way out.",
