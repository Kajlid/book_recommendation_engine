  "description": "A year ago Darcy had no friends. A year ago she’d believed that magic only existed in fairy tales. A year ago she would have laughed at the idea of other worlds. Now all that has changed.It is the summer before freshman year and Darcy and her five friends have come back to Cedar Cove Family Camp and Alitheia. This return is bittersweet because her elusive purpose in the magical realm continues to elude her. Egged on by Tellius, the boy prince she is prophesied to marry, Darcy rebels and impulsively “petitions” an entity called the Oracle, requesting it give her information as to her purpose. To receive her answer she must go on a journey, but the perils of the quest are nothing compared to what lies in wait for her in the lair of the Oracle.",
