  "description": "FINALIST: 2014 NM-AZ Book Awards. Literary Nonfiction. Memoir. Asian American Studies. DIZZY SUSHI is many things at once--a young woman's travels in Japan, a pilgrimage to a source of Zen, an inner journey, a love story, and a search for home and family. At a dizzy sushi bar tasty tidbits float round and round and this book is much the same--insight, detail, image, feeling and experience are all waiting to nourish the reader. Melissa J. White has captured the experience of Japan in the late 1980s and a world at the height of international economic influence. From the humorous potential of language to cultural misunderstanding and also appreciation, this memoir is full of moments both rough and tender.",
