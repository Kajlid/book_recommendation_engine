  "description": "The Man with the Ants in His Eyes is Oliver's tale, it has bikes, boobs and spirit level bubbles.Oliver is a sensitive, intelligent, thirteen year old trying to survive in a harsh, financially-derelict environment. He urinates into buckets of potatoes from the chip shop wall. He has a paper round, loves music and watches cartoons on a Saturday morning. He and his snot-nosed companions play football, ride bikes, break bones and find dead workmen with ants crawling on their sightless eyeballs.Pretty standard stuff.He also loves his dear old mum.Set in the late 1970s, The Man with the Ants in his Eyes is a black comedy and a murder mystery that will delight young adults and adults alike. It is soppy and sad, funny and frightening in equal measure. If you read only one book this year you're obviously a bit of a fool. Prove us wrong by making sure it's this one.",
