  "description": "(New Cover Edition)Is the simple life that simple? Lacey Williams is a driven and disciplined Annapolis real estate agent who has created success from scratch. It is, however, a life she has become disenchanted with. Yearning for a simpler way of life, she follows her heart and less-practical intuitions for the first time in order to seek out her version of a fulfilling life. There is no turning back once she sells her home, walks away from her career and moves to a rustic cabin in upstate New York. Eerie nights in the mountains, modest living quarters, harsh winters, and repeated sightings of an apparition in the woods become the least of her concerns when a river guide with a past crosses her path. Things are not always what they seem, though, and her strength and independent spirit fosters a new drive. Lacey Williams is focused more than ever on discovering her true self while carving out the life she was meant to live.",
