  "description": "In this Caldecott Honor-winning picture book, join Bartholomew Cubbins in Dr. Seuss's classic tale of one king's magical mishap.Bored with rain, sun, fog, and snow, King Derwin of Didd summons his royal magicians to create something new and exciting to fall from the sky. What he gets is a storm of sticky green globs called Oobleck, which soon causes a royal mess. But with the assistance of the wise page boy Bartholomew, the king (along with young readers) learns that the simplest words can sometimes solve the biggest problems.While Bartholomew and the Oobleck is one of Dr. Seuss's lesser known works, it is nevertheless totally Seussian and as topical today as when it was first published in 1949, addressing subjects that we know the good doctor was passionate about throughout his life: the abuse of power (as in \nYertle the Turtle\n and Horton Hears a Who); rivalry (as in The Sneetches); and of course, zany good humor (as in \nThe Cat in the Hat\n and the 43 other books he wrote and illustrated)! This is a perfect way to introduce new readers to an old classic or to reward existing fans.With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children as well as helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic 'Cat in the Hat', and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.",
