She was part of the seventh generation of Elite humans, genetically modified to be smarter, stronger, faster, and better than normal humans. When her twin brother went missing in the Mojave Desert outside of their home in Imperial City, she was determined to do whatever it takes to bring him home safely—even if it meant she had to seduce the infamous leader of the Underlings and infiltrate their military compound alone. For this to work, she couldn't have backup, and he couldn't know how much she wanted him dead.All her life, she believed Elites were better than Underlings at everything. But what if that wasn’t true? As Crystal wrestles with newfound emotions, she must decide whose story she’ll trust: the scientist who created her, or the Underling general who stole her heart.This high-action romance takes place in a future version of the earth as we know it, blending dystopian world powers and lively character dynamics to create a hopeful view of the future perfect for fans of Frank Herbert and Andy Weir.",
