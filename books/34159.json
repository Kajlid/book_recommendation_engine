  "description": "Contemporary Menage Genetic Attraction; Previous Genetic AttractionCaleb Martin faces a life crisis -- and he’s pretty embarrassed about it. A talented soccer star, he has the chance to sign a lucrative five-year contract and be rich and famous. Two problems -- Cal is gay and signing the contract means he has to stay in the closet, maybe for life. Plus, he’ll have to spend his years diving for soccer balls when he’d like to be helping people, like the rest of his family.A one-night stand with a beautiful man rocks Cal, but the guy vanishes only to reappear again later where Cal is house-sitting. Too much coincidence? Totally. And then a cute tomboy throws Cal’s life choices into confusion. How could he wind up with a commitmentphobic guy and a woman, especially one dedicated to work in Africa? If that's not confusing enough, he gets a big surprise in a snowstorm. Cosmic joker strikes again.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find anal play/intercourse, male/male sexual practices, menage (m/m/f).",
