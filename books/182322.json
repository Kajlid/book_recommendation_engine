  "description": "Kenzie Atwell doesn't settle for anything ordinary. Which is why she jumped at the chance to take a job as a veterinarian in the wild outskirts of Alaskan civilization. She came looking for adventure, but soon found herself feeling alone and isolated in the harsh Arctic winter.  Ryker Pearsons seems at first glance like just another one of the quiet, reserved men in Glacier Point—but he's hiding his own secrets and pain behind those gorgeous eyes of his. When he finds himself caught at death's door, Kenzie is his only hope for survival. But first, he’ll have to trust her with his deepest secrets.  Can Kenzie save Ryker's life? And can he save her lonely heart? Find out in the first installment of the Ice Bear Shifters Series.  Content Warning: This 26K word novella is a standalone with no cliffhangers. Don’t let the Arctic location fool you—the ice bears of Glacier Point know how to heat things up! Expect explicit love scenes and adult language. Rawr!",
