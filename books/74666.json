  "description": "Emily Keane has her life all planned out. She's played by the rules and never stepped outside her box, and now she will finally be rewarded with everything she always dreamed of: a job promotion, a fiance, and a future she can count on. But when her perfectly planned world falls apart, Emily is plunged into the wildest year of her life.From the beaches of California to Jamaica, New York, and Europe, Emily finds herself on a madcap race against time, running from an unscrupulous organ broker who wants her dead, all the while checking items off her unusual bucket list. On top of it all, she's falling in love with the most unlikely person, a man who can never return her feelings . . . but will his friendship be enough?Confronting one hilarious misadventure after another, Emily finally learns who she really is and how to seize the day . . .Note: Carpe DiEmily is a raunchy, fearless comedy in the same vein as the movie Bridesmaids, to which it has been favorably compared. Both female and male readers will enjoy this zany comedic adventure.",
