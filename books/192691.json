  "description": "Texas rancher, Adi McLaurin, gets more than she bargained for when she travels to her long-lost brother's untimely funeral and discovers she has an orphaned five-year-old half-breed niece. To do what’s right for the child, Adi must reach a understanding with Gray Renaux, the child's half-Choctaw uncle. But Gray’s not an understanding sort. He’s tall, dark and more attractive than Adi ever wants to admit. And while falling hard for a man like Gray might warm her body and heart, it could cost her and her family everything.",
