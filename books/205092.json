  "description": "Miss Politt has been waiting and waiting for Mrs. Spenlow outside Laburnum Cottage where Mrs. Spenlow lives. But to no avail. She nervously acquires the help of the next-door neighbour, whose gumption and persistence eventually reveal that Mrs. Spenlow is dead inside on the hearthrug. The whole of St. Mary Mead is convinced the murderer is Mr. Spenlow, who shows no emotion upon his wifeâ€™s sudden death. With characteristic diligence, Miss Marple reveals that it is perhaps not that simple.Librarian's note #1: the original name of the short story above does not have the word \"The\" in the title. And it has a dash. With or without either, it's the same great story!Librarian's note #2: this entry relates to the short story, \"Tape-Measure Murder.\" Collections and the other stories by the author are located elsewhere on Goodreads.
