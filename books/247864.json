He must teach the orphan to become a magician and together they must save the future king of Talia. Plotting to stop them is the wizard Norvora who is under the control of the three sister witches.  Book 2 continues with their quest. Along with all the characters, we have already met such as the Earth, Water and Fire Clan witches, fairies and demons, we also meet the goblins and ogres. The love that Idi receives from both Marcus and Katrina help him begin shredding the layers of insecurities and self-doubt.  Book 3 is the conclusion to Idi's story and shows his growth in understanding who he is and the power that words can have over a persons life. The battle at the end will bring the forces of good and evil together, where they will fight over the dominion of the world of Talia.  Together the books are a story of overcoming your past and believing in yourself. A journey wrapped in magic and adventure and a pile of compelling characters.",
