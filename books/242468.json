  "title": "Be Still and Listen: Experience the Presence of God in Your Life",
  "description": "The various crises we experience in society and culture today, at their root, reveal a spiritual a profound lack of meaning. The mystical truths revealed in scripture can surely help. Part One, “Entering the Desert,” introduces the reader to principles of awareness, deep listening, and contemplation as essential for “hearing” what Scripture has to say. Part Two details the importance of mystery and struggle in the process of healing from any past or present wounds. And Part Three explores the “undivided heart” that is possible when we come to know God in silence and stillness. With Be Still it is possible to explore the contemplative dimensions of the Bible, either on your own or in a group setting, as you perhaps never have before.",
