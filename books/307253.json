  "description": "Hey guys! It’s Tyler here, and this is the newest chapter of my life. Y’all are not going to believe this, but…I just joined the University of Wisconsin – Milwaukee’s Men’s Soccer team! No, seriously, I actually did! I’m officially a Panther now! I did well on my youth soccer team, and I destroyed the opposing team in high school lacrosse, so I should be ready for college soccer, right?I wish. My youth teams aren’t anywhere close to what college soccer is like. You see, two things came my way that I certainly wasn’t prepared for. Heading the soccer ball, which is something I have a huge fear of. And Jared, who is the cutest guy on the entire team.Yeah, you see where the problems are.Scoring the Goal is a cute YA love story that will make you wish you were on the soccer team.",
