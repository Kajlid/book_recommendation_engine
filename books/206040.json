With a heart filled with pride, Bella went in search for her husband, only to find him in a compromising situation. Gun in hand, bullets sprawled over his customized mahogany colored desktop, tears cascading down his handsome face, and a heart filled with rage, Bella walked in just as her husband had began to transform into the monster that he’d much rather avoid being.Bella is frightened, hoping that her words didn’t alter the love that had been administered between the two. She’s left wondering, is RahMeek capable of loving her the same even after secrets have been revealed and evils have resurface?",
