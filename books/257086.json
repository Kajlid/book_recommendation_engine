  "description": "How do you survive when you become the one thing you despise?\nIt’s vamps like Roric who make humans believe vampires have a right to live in human society. He doesn’t drink from humans, he’s never even taken a vein, and the idea of infecting a human is abhorrent to him. As leader of the Vampire Enforcement Agency, his job is to find and capture the vamps who betray humans’ recently-earned trust. Until one human woman tempts him to break all the rules.  When Roric intercepts a rogue vamp attack and finds Caroline dying, he can’t resist her blood or beauty, and in a moment of passion he does the unthinkable. But Caroline despises the monsters who killed her parents, and she’d rather die than be a vampire.  With vamp attacks at an all-time high and Caroline resisting Roric at every turn, his job, his family, even his life is at risk. Worse, Caroline's attacker wants her just as bad as Roric does, and he knows Roric’s secret. Roric will do anything to earn Caroline’s trust, but can he keep her safe long enough to convince her that life as a vampire isn’t a death sentence?  If you like sexy, thrilling paranormal romance/urban fantasy stories by authors like JR Ward, Bella Forrest, and IT Lucas, you’ll love Compelled by the Vampire.  This PNR/UF series is appropriate for ages 18+.",
