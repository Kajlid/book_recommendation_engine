  "description": "What do you do when you were the shy, bullied asthmatic who was always last to be picked during team selection at school?Give up and accept you’ll never be good at sport?Not Stephen Smith. As a young man he donned walking boots and set off on an adventure to climb The Munros – the 282 highest mountains in Scotland. Having completed that he hoped to settle down. But unable to 'find the one', he set himself a new challenge – to complete all the 1432 mountains of the British Isles. After twenty years of walking, and achieving 960 of the mountains, he met 'the one'. Then another life changing event led to him work through his obsessive workaholic nature and retire his walking ambitions.In this second volume of Stephen's hill-walking diaries you can follow his adventures from New Zealand's Milford Track and Australia's Wilsons Prom, to walking all the Welsh and English Nuttalls, the Scottish Donalds, half the Corbetts and seven coast to coast adventures across Scotland on the TGO Challenge.From 111 miles in five days catching up after a stomach bug to the sweltering heat of the Australian bush, Stephen recounts his walks, his life and his loves.'Stephen has a quirk to his style of narration with little anecdotes in among the description of place and adventure or misadventure that makes this easy to read and enjoy.'
