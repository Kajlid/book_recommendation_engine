  "description": "Synopsis: Have you ever seen a “work of art” worth millions, which looks like something your child just brought home from school?  The dual perspective of “Beauty is in the Eye of the Beholder” and just a little bit of “The Emperor’s New Clothes” is evident in this clever artwork story of a child who paints a fingerpaint print in class and then loses it in the wind on the way home.  Illustrated from the point of view of a child, whose identity is left to the imagination of the reader since all of the illustrations are what the child sees, the fingerpaint print is interpreted by official “judges” as well as by bystanders. Should people be influenced by what others see, or use their own self-esteem to make their own judgments?  This is the sixth rhyming children’s book by this award-winning author, whose other bestselling books include Manner-Man, Gimme-Jimmy, The Magic Word, Peter and the Whimper-Whineys, and Santa’s Birthday Gift.
