  "description": "Danica Heuer gave her word to her Uncle Arthur on his deathbed. She would take her inheritance and buy a castle. The remark was flippant at the time, but now that Uncle Art is gone, she is honor-bound to keep that promise. The castle Danica buys turns out to be the boon she needed to lift her spirits. Majestic and dignified, she falls in love with her new purchase immediately. The majordomo is helpful and very informative about the castle's rich history and lore. Things are perfect. Or are they? Danica's dreams become tumultuous. Strange sounds in the night wake her. The longer she stays, the more hushed whispers she hears in town about her castle. What will Danica do when she discovers the terrifying truth about her castle, contained deep Within These Stone Walls?",
