  "description": "Samantha was an earnest, purposeful, focused young woman at work. Her love of rules and discipline made her a successful bureaucrat. And with her tweed business suits and sensible shoes, she certainly looked like one. But after becoming friends with a man at work who was literally old enough to be her father, and letting his teasing and flattery grow on her, the previously staid, dull and almost naive young woman finds herself becoming immersed in a \"game\" of sexual dominance and submission. Reading and watching television were replaced by bondage and punishment games. Soon she was spending all her off-time naked and in chains, suspended by her wrists and flogged, and being taken by multiple partners as she begged for more. It all would have astonished her co-workers. It certainly astonished Samantha!",
