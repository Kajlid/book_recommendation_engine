  "title": "The Soprano State: New Jersey's Culture of Corruption",
  "description": "The Soprano State details the you-couldn't-make-this-up true story of the corruption that has pervaded New Jersey politics, government, and business for the past thirty years. From Jimmy Hoffa purportedly being buried somewhere beneath the end zone in Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, through allegations of a thoroughly corrupt medical and dental university, through Mafia influence at all levels, to a governor who suddenly declares himself a “gay American” and resigns, the Garden State might indeed be better named after the HBO mobsters. Where else - A state attorney general show up after police pulled over her boyfriend who was driving without a valid license? - A state senator and mayor of Newark (the same guy) spend thousands of dollars of taxpayers’ money on a junket to Rio days before leaving office? - A politically connected developer hire a prostitute to tape sex acts with his own brother-in-law and then send the tape to his sister? Only in the Soprano State.",
