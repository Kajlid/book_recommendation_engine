  "description": "L is surprised by how much she enjoys the transformation from mountain girl to a lady of Silvera. With a strong sense of self, she’s adamant that learning proper conduct, and how to speak and dress well, will provide her with a brighter future. She refuses, however, to give up her practical or straightforward nature. Or her crossbow. When L meets Fane, a soldier in the Royal Guard, all she sees is a smart-mouthed, straight talking young man who seems to understand her. L thinks nothing of befriending him. But Fane is not who he appears to be. Fane is a spy. And when war ships arrive on the coast of Silvera carrying Fane’s ruler, a mage more powerful than any of them could ever imagine, Phaedra is plunged into darkness as an old legend proves true. Reeling from the betrayal, L shrugs off the new her and pulls on the old. It seems once more… she and Rogan have a princess to save.",
