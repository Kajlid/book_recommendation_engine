  "description": "She has come from across the sea, cast from a land in its final throes of destruction. War and conflict have blighted the world, spreading to every far corner under the shadow of the demon king. On the continent of Amandia, the Order of Magicians, dwindling in strength and number, struggles to defend the Turian Empire from an overwhelming sea of foes. In their final hour of need, Samuel, Champion of the Order and Saviour of Cintar, is sent on a mission of the Empire's final hope, to slay the eternal witch-queen and return the kidnapped heir to the throne. But the Circle of Eyes has long laid plans for everyone, spread like a web across the world. Struggling with the loss of his magic, Samuel must rely on the unstoppable force of the Argum Stone, a relic from the time of the Ancients that threatens to destroy him with its every use. He must uncover the secrets of his own destiny if he is to control what lurks inside of him, marking him apart from all other magicians, except one.",
