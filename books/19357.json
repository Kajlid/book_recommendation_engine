  "description": "Inspired by her Sundance Festival award-winning film \"Daughters of the Dust,\" Julie Dash has put her cinematic vision on the page, penning a rich, magical new novel which extends her story of a family of complex, independent African-American women.Set in the 1920s in the Sea Islands off the Carolina coast where the Gullah people have preserved much of their African heritage and language, Daughters Of The Dust chronicles the lives of the Peazants, a large, proud family who trace their origins to the Ibo, who were enslaved and brought to the islands more than one hundred years before. Native New Yorker Amelia Peazant returns to her mother's home to trace her family's history. From her multigenerational clan she gathers colorful stories, learning about \"the first man and woman,\" the slaves who walked across the water back home to Africa, the ways men and women need each other, and the intermingling of African and Native American cultures.Through her experiences, Amelia comes to treasure her family traditions and her relationship with her fiercely independent cousin Elizabeth. Daughters of the Dust is ultimately a story of homecoming and the reclaiming of family and cultural heritage.",
