  "title": "Champion for Hire",
  "description": "William is just your typical engineer fresh out of college with a stressful job, a boring life, and not a lot of prospects of anything better in the future. Until one weekend while hiking in the woods he stumbles across a portal to another time, or perhaps another place. The more he investigates this new world the more he realizes that it may just be able to offer him a lot more than the one he's been living in. However, there are forces at work beyond anything that Will has ever come across before and the local Goddess seems to have taken a liking to him. Will may soon find himself getting an offer and cannot afford to refuse.",
