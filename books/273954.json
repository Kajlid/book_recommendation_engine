But then the gorgeous Teale shows up and throws her entire life out of balance. Not only does he remind her of the painful past she tried so hard to forget, but she also can’t stop when it comes to him. She can’t stop thinking about him. Can’t stop wanting him. And worst of all, she can’t seem to resist him, no matter how hard she tries.
