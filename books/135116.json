Sumi Antaxasis is the best assassin the League has ever trained and failure is not an option. When she is assigned Hauk as her target, Sumi is sure of her quick and easy success. However, things are never that easy and Hauk is far more skilled than the League thought. As Sumi hunts him down she discovers something that could not only destroy Hauk but all of Sentella. But she has her own enemies hunting her down and suddenly Sumi's only chance for survival is to place her trust in the man she was sent to kill but is he just playing a game that could send Sumi to her grave?",
