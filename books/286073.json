  "title": "The Legend of Dell Briggers",
  "description": "Dell Briggers was born in Vidalia, Georgia--or so he said--and I believed him, too. When we were growing up, he was my best friend and we told each other everything. But then he died and at his funeral I learned he was actually from Hot Springs, Arkansas; that his father had never worked at a top secret Navy base; and that his mother had never even been to Hollywood ... much less acted in movies or been mentored by Tallulah Bankhead. So, after the funeral, I decided to find out who he really was. And that's where story begins. Using vivid characters, superb writing, and unforgettable stories, Joe Hilley brings us tales that read like a front porch conversation--gossip we've longed to know, questions we've wanted to ask, memories we've tried to forget. The Legend of Dell Briggers presents contemplative fiction at its finest.",
