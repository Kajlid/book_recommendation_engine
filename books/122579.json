  "description": "With the pocket realm destroyed, Lark has no way to return to the fairy realm, and he’d likely be arrested even if he did. His only option is to get used to living among humans while hiding his bird fairy features.Finn’s on his own again, and he’ll probably be starving in a few months. Life hasn’t been kind to him, bad luck sticks to him like paste, and he’s sure his red hair is like a sign to mess with him. Perhaps together, the bird fairy and his little fox can find their way.This takes place shortly after the events of Valentine.",
