  "title": "Best of All Possible Worlds: A Novel",
  "description": "Gary Anderson's highly acclaimed, debut novel, \"Animal Magnet,\" was voted among the \"Best Books of the Decade\" and \"Best Literary Books of All Time\" by Goodreads. Join him upon the high seas on a new epic journey with Jacques the Anabaptist in the satiric spirit of \"Candide\" by Voltaire. \"Best of All Possible Worlds\" begins with the return of Candide to find his beloved tutor, Pangloss, destitute and abandoned on the streets of Leydon, South Holland. Then the story follows two brothers, Jakob and Robrecht Onderdonk, leading antithetical lives. Jakob is on a quest to abandon his life as a sailor for a more edifying life on land. In contrast Robrecht is determined fully to embrace a sinful life at sea. Like Candide, \"Best of All Possible Worlds\" explores, with a comic air of irreverence and a witty view of the absurd, the universal problem of evil in a world created by a perfect God.",
