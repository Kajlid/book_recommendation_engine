  "description": "ATLASWorking undercover at a strip club is not my usual kind of job. If it weren’t a great opportunity to show the Mike Bravo team I can run my own op, I wouldn’t have agreed to it.When my boss asks me to befriend the biggest gossip in the establishment, the person who knows everything, I’m even more reluctant. Because that happens to be one of the dancers. The only dancer to catch my attention in all the wrong ways.I need to be professional or I will never prove I’m leadership material.Only problem is, the guy with the stage name Lemon makes me want to be anything but professional. LEMONI’m sick of the new bartender throwing dirty looks my way. He’s as judgmental as he is hot, and let’s just say he’s really judgmental.I don’t know why he’s working here if he looks down on us dancers so much. He could bartend at a regular club.But when he saves me from a drunken customer getting too handsy, his attitude suddenly flips, and we find ourselves becoming … friends?Underneath the judgment, it turns out Atlas is a total sweetheart.Maybe more caring than anyone I’ve ever met.I’ve never had a relationship before, but something tells me it could be way too easy to fall for the gentle giant.",
