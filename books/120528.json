  "title": "Basali! Stories by and about Women in Lesotho",
  "description": "Basali means 'women ' and is one of the most common exclamations in the Sesotho language. These stories in 'Sesotho-ised' English reveal a way of life and a way of perceiving that is unique in African literature. The stores offer glimpses of traditional healers, circumcision schools, witches, bride-prices, and extended rural family life.",
