  "description": "If Spartacus was a girl This debut novel from Stevie O'Connor is a beautifully written literary addition to sci-fi cult classics, such as those by Ray Bradbury and Philip.K.Dick, which gives us a frightening, visceral glimpse into the life of splendid isolationist, Maja Larsen. In A Mirror City is a chilling, dystopian sci-fi noir about a girl who is trapped in a world that was broken long before she was born. Maja is caught up in this fast-paced conspiracy, aided and abetted by a ragged guard of criminals and thieves and hounded by authorities, that seem to know more about Maja than she does herself.",
