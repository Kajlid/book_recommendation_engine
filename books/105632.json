  "description": "They are the lost boys.Sons of mafia mistresses expected to keep their fathers’ sins in the shadows. The lucky ones are forgotten.Unfortunately for Valentino “Tino” Moretti, his brother Nova was too smart to be forgotten, and too valuable to risk when he resists a life of crime. So they punished Tino instead. Forced into the cruel world of the Sicilian Mafia at twelve, Tino was broken before he was old enough to know the man he was supposed to be. Now he’s what the mafia made him.The enforcer.A trained killer forbidden to love, but he did anyway. He's loved Brianna all along.Raw and beautiful, their romance was all consuming and far too dangerous. They were ripped apart a long time ago. It’s not until the borgata puts out a hit on her that Brianna falls back into Tino’s arms, churning up their dark past and unraveling all the Moretti brothers’ closely guarded secrets.This isn’t the end of the story. It’s only the beginning, and it is brutal.There’s a reason enforcers are considered too deadly to love.",
