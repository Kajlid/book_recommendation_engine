  "description": "My wife, Kat, died five years ago and now I’m alone on the Bar W. I have the cows, the horses, and my parents and Max, but I’ll never find another love like we had. It’s not that women don’t want me. That part is a real pain in the ass, actually. I just don’t want anyone but Kat. It’s caused more than a few arguments between me and Rande. Hell, one time some idiot lady was waiting for me, buck naked, in the barn. Because Rande put the idea in her head. Damn I was pissed. I will live my days out on the ranch, raising cows, starting colts and maybe finding a way to forgive my Dad. The only other thing that is certain - no more women for me. Ever. I’m done. Done with my life in Billings, done with my every move being controlled. I am starting over - putting miles and hours between him and me and I am going to be free. I want a life where I have a choice, where I have no fear and I am free to make and keep friends. Strategy so far? Keep my head down.",
