  "description": "The rib-thin, black-and-white rabbit hound turned up at Hal Borland's Connecticut farm one Christmas night in the middle of a nasty winter storm. Pat, as the dog came to be known, and his raffish travelling companion, a young pup, \"were even more unwelcome than the weather,\" but after a few preliminaries both settled in as members of the Borland household. The pup eventually found his permanent home elsewhere, but Pat became Hal Borland's true companion - and a local legend, the terror of woodchucks for miles around. With his keen sensitivity to the natural world, Borland here recounts, with deep affection and wonder, how a man and his dog can form a magical and unforgettable partnership. First published in 1961, THE DOG WHO CAME TO STAY \"will appeal to many sportsmen and to all people who have ever been closely attached to a dog.\" (The New York Times Book Review)",
