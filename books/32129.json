  "description": "Ghost stories became very popular in the first half of the nineteenth century and this collection by Andrew Barger contains the very scariest of them all. Some stories thought too horrific were published anonymously like \"A Night in a Haunted House\" and \"The Deaf and Dumb Girl.\" The later story is collected for the first time in any anthology since its original publication in 1839.The other ghost stories in this fine collection are by famous authors. \"The Mask of the Red Death,\" by Edgar Allan Poe; \"A Chapter in the History of a Tyrone Family,\" by Joseph Sheridan le Fanu; \"The Spectral Ship,\" by Wilhelm Hauff; \"The Old Maid in the Winding Sheet,\" by Nathaniel Hawthorne; \"The Adventure of the German Student,\" and \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,\" by Washington Irving; as well as \"The Tapestried Chamber,\" by Sir Walter Scott.As he has done with a number of other books, Andrew Barger has added his scholarly touch to this collection by including story backgrounds, annotations, author photos and a foreword titled \"All Ghosts Are Gray.\" Buy the book today and be ready to be scared.",
