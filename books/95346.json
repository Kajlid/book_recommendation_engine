  "description": "Life for young Leoric Swift starts out blessed and kind despite the horrors of war laying just beyond the night sky, but, once lit in the hearts of men, war engulfs all like a wildfire. Adversaries, uncertainty, doubt, and even his own past team up against Swift as he takes his first steps on a journey to end the conflict that tore out a piece of his soul. Swift needs a miracle in a world where nothing but the accidental and inevitable seem to exist, but with friendship, hard work, and the strength of an iron will, even miracles themselves can be made inevitable.",
