Among the survivors struggling to adapt, Tessa flees to her family’s cabin, only to find it already occupied…by fairies! After a companionable year with her new housemates, Tessa again has to adapt to a parade of creatures of myth and legend on her property—including a baby dragon and a tiny goblin. All the creatures aren’t so friendly, and Tessa soon learns she’s in the battle for her very life and the life of those she’s come to love. Driven by a maniacal monster with a personal grudge against Tessa, ogres hunt humans to make way for a new evil regime on Earth. Only Tessa and her small friends stand between hope and annihilation.",
