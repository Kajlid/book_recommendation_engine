  "description": "THE REST OF THE STORY: What the Bible didn't tell you! In this sequel to Perished: The World That Was, God's judgment of the world with a world-wide Flood leaves only eight people who survive, land on the Ararat Mountains and start a new life. But it isn't long before Satan causes trouble, raising up Nimrod, who quickly rises to power and leads the people into false religion. Called of God, Shem witnesses and records the rise and fall of Babel, the Confusion of Tongues, and the rise of violence and immorality. But he also watches as God's plan for the redemption of mankind begins unfolding, and finds he has a role to play.",
