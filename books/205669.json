  "description": "Gaylactic Spectrum Award finalist Jane Fletcher returns with another Celaeno World novel. The absence of men on the planet doesn't mean that there aren't any problems. Indeed, Sergeant `Chip' Coppelli has seen more than her fair share of them. She escaped her family's manipulative plots by running away to join the militia. After nine years in the elite Rangers, fighting thugs and wild predators, Chip has learned to spot trouble coming. Katryn Nagata joins the 23rd squadron under highly unfavourable circumstances. Katryn is clearly worried, and not ready to tell anyone why. The first time Chip sets her eyes on Katryn, she knows trouble is on the way. But Chip wasn't expecting murder.",
