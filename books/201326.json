Fresh from a stinging defeat at the hands of the Rebel Alliance, Darth Vader must rise again to reassert the Empire's iron grip on the galaxy.

And as other villains old and new play their parts-from Boba Fett and Jabba the Hutt to diabolical debutant Aphra, as well as the killer droids Triple Zero and BeeTee-how long until Vader's dangerous alliances blow up in his face? Join Darth Vader and feel the power of the dark side! Collects issues 1-12.",
