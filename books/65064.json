  "description": "In this, the fifth book of the bestselling Mystic Saga, we return to New York City to the very day in 1949 when Braxton makes his leap from the Empire State Building. Following the events in book four, it’s now known that Evelyn wasn’t in New York alone that day. Over the past two years, Cyan has found time to get a job and settle down in New York to be close to the one he loves.With the police closing in on a curiously powerful man who has no history prior to Roswell 1947, and a Mystic closing in on Evelyn, there’s not much room for mistakes. Especially when all the while, the Earth itself is in danger of something far worse brought on by the blatant disregard for the laws of causality (in book 3).",
