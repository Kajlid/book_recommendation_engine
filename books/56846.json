  "description": "It has been justly said that there are two great national schools of the French and the Chinese. In this unique book Mrs. Chen supplies the key to the world of Chinese cuisine. Exquisite, subtle, different recipes are here, but this book provides much more than that. It shows how and where to shop, how to select meats and vegetables, how to buy and how to prepare. You will discover the correct way to make Chinese tea, prepare rice, and use chopsticks, and you will learn about the three great regional schools of cooking within Cantonese, Mandarin, and Szechwan. Mrs. Chen carefully explains, and demonstrates with illustrations when necessary, all the processes of preparing food the Chinese way. Her recipes are simple, clear, and flexible enough so that you can find substitutes for ingredients that may be hard to procure. As world-famous heart specialist Dr. Paul Dudley White points out in his foreword, “Joyce Chen’s recipes are commendable for several reasons. In the first place, they are a delight to the gourmet; secondly, they represent real Chinese cooking at its best; and thirdly, they are good for the health.”",
