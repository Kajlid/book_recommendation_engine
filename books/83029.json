  "description": "In a place far away, or perhaps close by, lies the Land of Wy. It is a magical place powered by Witch and the gypsy waters of Jinn. The Land of Wy has been shaped by a tale of love lost, a tale which invoked the outlawing of love for all its residents. Now, the rogue Witch Niyya has come to the human world to engender the help of seventeen year old Ivy May in her illegal quest for love. A settling must occur in order for Ivy to discover who she is and who she must be.",
