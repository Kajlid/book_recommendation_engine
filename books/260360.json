  "title": "Pictures of the Times: A Century of Photography from The New York Times",
  "description": "Selected from 17 million prints preserved in the archives of The New York Times , the spectacular photographs in this book provide a spellbinding sample from the rich archive that is the twentieth century, as seen through the eyes of a great newspaper. Revealed is the extraordinary and omnivorous breadth of photography's vivid pictures of both World Wars; of presidents, mayors, dictators and celebrities; of Beatles fans and Halley's comet; of victims and perpetrators, riots and disasters; of Bill Bradley on the court and Willie Mays sliding into home--and a great many more. Underlying them all is the gripping immediacy that makes news photography not only an indispensable presence in the daily paper but a vital part of history. This book includes an illustrated chronology that traces the evolution of the technology and business of news photography, with special attention to the role of The New York Times and to the recent rise of digital technologies in newspaper production. Originally published to accompany an exhibition at The Museum of Modern Art, New York.",
