  "description": "My name is Gianna Weston. I am Vampire. I was thrust into a world I didn’t know. Given a life I didn’t think I wanted. I have had my world turned upside down and my life shredded before me. All this time holding onto the love of a man who breathes life into me and I into him. His very existence sets fire to my cold skin. He is my maker, my husband and the father to my children. But even love can no longer fight the demons inside of me. Not after all the tragedies. The death, the pain, and the heartache are haunting me with a relentless vengeance. This darkness has me by its nails scraping sinfully at my core. It’s time to stop running and hiding from the darkness. These demons I speak of won’t let me rest until I accept what I am. A nightmare. A killer. A blood thirsty animal.Are you afraid? You should be. I. AM. A. MONSTER.",
