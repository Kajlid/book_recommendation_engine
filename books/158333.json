  "title": "Devoted",
  "description": "James Laird was once devoted to sex, fame, and money...but now this former porn star is devoted to his lifelong best friend turned fianc√©e, Lola Caraway. He wants nothing more than to give her a dream wedding: white dress, long veil, and a big reception with the whole family. James' family is the only problem--he's not sure if he can deliver on that part of the dream. They haven't exactly been there for him \"for better or for worse.\" In fact, James's parents haven't spoken to him in six years--not since they discovered his double-life as a porn star. As James and Lola work to build their life together, they discover mending the past could be more difficult than either of them expected. Will devotion be enough to take them one step closer to happily ever after?",
