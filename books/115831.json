  "description": "Henry Steegman is hardly \"Mr. Personality\" aboard the Mars-bound Algonquin 9. Yet it is he who bungles upon the spectacular Macy's-like city beneath the Red Planet's crust. For better or worse, the name Steegman will be immortalized by a discovery that will transform millions of lives. For a struggling screenwriter, the Martian beings could mean a big story, big bucks, headlines...and more women than any many his size has ever known... For an exhiled Russian rocket man, the are a possible route to America's space program, and the land of opportunity... For a flying-saucer faker of flickering fame, the possibilities are out of this world. In a brilliant near-future look at the human condition, Frederick Pohl has honed his satire-sharp science fiction to a steely new edge.",
