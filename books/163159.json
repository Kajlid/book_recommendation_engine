  "description": "Sexy contemporary romance about mistaken identity and deception. Second in the series about the lives and loves of three friends, Rosa, Tamsin and Sarah (the Three Graces), this story focuses on the fiery and passionate Tamsin.   Sleeping with the Enemy  She thought he was her perfect man – until she found she was sleeping with the enemy.  Her hand slashed across his face leaving an imprint on his tanned skin. “You bastard! How could you lie to me like that? How could you take advantage of me? You …” She paused, struggling to regain control of a body quivering with fury. Benedict advanced on her slowly, putting his hands gently but firmly on her shoulders and resisting her attempts to pull away. “You didn’t want to know the truth Tamsin, because then you wouldn’t have got what you wanted – me.” She shook her head in denial but knew he was right. And it was mortifying to realise how much she still wanted him – despite everything.",
