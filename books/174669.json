His immortal father has no intentions of vacating the throne anytime soon, but all good things come to those who wait…and plan. Bit by bit, Kirill is gathering political allies, forming alliances with goblins, trolls, and any other magical creatures who will speak with him. Unfortunately, his ruthless machinations can only get him so far. Some situations just require a woman’s touch. If only the fiery maiden with the power to help him didn’t strain his control over his lust for blood…and more. A rebellious siren with a song to soothe the savage heart...Irina will not cower. Not from her evil sorceress stepmother, and not from the vampire prince whose fangs threaten her with death even as his lips raise the heated desire of her bloodline. With a dagger at the ready, she agrees to a bargain -- her aid in his pursuit of political alliances with creatures beyond the veil in return for a reduction in the royal tithe her people are forced to pay the crown. If only sharp fangs and a sharp tongue weren’t such an incendiary combination...Even an undead mastermind can’t foresee everything...",
