Moonlight on the Nantahala is set in the Appalachian Mountains of Western North Carolina. It is a contemporary and woman's fiction novel with a hint of supernatural mixed in. Who is the phantom dancing in the mist on the Nantahala River? This tale of Edward Caulfield stands as a testament of the love he held in his heart for a woman he was never allowed to grow old with. Fate took Celia from Edward early in their marriage. On her deathbed Celia vowed they would be together again, not even death would separate them. In his twilight years he moves closer to town yet keeps the old home by the river that he and his beloved Celia shared. He maintains the old home as a shrine to her to cope with his grief. Betty, his strong willed housekeeper and friend keeps the widower on his toes with her humorous criticisms. Lena, a young woman, often trespasses on the old man's property to sit by the river in deep thought. They exchange their secrets and stories eventually. Lena's emotionally abusive husband and crumbling marriage weighs heavily on Edward. He sees her like the daughter he never had and wants to protect her. Loneliness and learning to trust again forges a critically needed friendship for them. On the Nantahala River's edge under an aging oak tree could the legacy of \"The Perfect Rose\" forever change a troubled heart?",
