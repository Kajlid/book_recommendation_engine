Dorothy is surprised when Ozma appoints her to rule Oz in her place; Ozma reminds Dorothy that she is a princess of Oz, and will have the support of the Wizard.The scene shifts to the inside of hollow Mount Illuso, next to Mount Phantastico across the Deadly Desert from Oz.

The Mimics have one special trick: they can copy the shape of humans simply by stepping into their shadows.",
