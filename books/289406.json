  "description": "This book is about the lottery known as lotto, which has one of the longest odds for the big one. Four main problems are solved. • Learn principles of chance so you can be in the game but lose less• Learn that there is no strategy but improve the frequency of small wins• Use the object called 'spectrum' to compute combined chance of many blocks of numbers • Teach those who erroneously think that the utility-to-risk ratio is too small in lotteriesWhile the main text is about odds and ways of playing and is easy reading as a daily newspaper, the large appendix explains the 'why' to the mathematically inclined. The appendix is also a source of probability problems for high school students. Implicit in the chapters on 'lotto designs' is a countable infinity of Ph.D. research problems. The vast subject of probability began centuries ago with a dice problem solved by great mathematicians. Here now is guidance on lotteries, from a mathematician! Here is help in your play against the long odds in the most popular lottery so it will not be a \"lootery\" on you!",
