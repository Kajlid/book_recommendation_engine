  "description": "It was a magnificent May morning, crystal clear skies, temperatures in the mid-seventies and no humidity. Terry and I stood on our balcony, mugs of coffee in hand, staring up at the gorgeous rocky mountains in all their glory. It was hard to believe what the news vids and feeds were saying. I turned on my iEye with a tap on my earbud, and instantly my favorite vid feed appeared in front of me. Terry, my wife of twenty-five years, and I had chosen the contact lens version of the iEye although several friends had said they were glad they had chosen the implanted version. Technological advancement is incredible. It was just 38 years ago that we were getting all our information from tablets and handheld communication devices. Some of the older folks could still be seen carrying them around. The same company that designed some of those devices had also designed the iEye. Some said it stood for “Intelligent Eye,”but I thought the company meant “Information Eye” for that was what it truly did-give us all our news, entertainment, communications, and announcements on one device linked to our eyes. My “all news” vid feed was again talking about the government’s morning announcements. We were being told the same thing on all the feeds. To be sure I looked up to the right corner of my screen and it opened a list of all my favorite feeds. By looking at the name of one feed for more than two-seconds it changed to that feed. Friends called me old fashion because I preferred the live commentators to the digitally rendered ones.",
