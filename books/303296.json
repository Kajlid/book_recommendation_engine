  "description": "When JUDAH MADDEN flees his tiny suffocating home-town in New Zealand, for the dream of international ballet stardom, he never intends coming back. Not to Painted Bay. Not to his family’s struggling mussel farm. Not to his jerk of a brother. Not with his entire life plan in shreds. And certainly not into the tempting arms of MORGAN WIPENE, the older, ruggedly handsome fisheries officer who seems determined to screw with Judah’s intention to wallow in peace.But dreams are fickle things. Shatter them and it’s hard to pick up the pieces. Hard to believe. Hard to start again.But the hardest thing of all? Finding the courage to trust in love and build a new dream where you least expected it.",
