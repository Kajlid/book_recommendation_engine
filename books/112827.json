  "description": "Shanghai, WWII Internment Camps, and a bizarre New York City murder case intersect in the first issue of DR. 2, a kinetically visceral thriller set in a frightening, yet eerily plausible, future. A physician with a mysterious background, Dr. 2 is the most sought after expert on \"unsolvable\" crimes. But nothing can prepare him for the maelstrom of chaos that awaits as he's forced to delve into a world of passion, destruction, and tragedy, all connected to a woman from his own past. This issue serves as an introduction to DR. 2: A FEAST OF SCENTS, the full graphic novel, that will be releasing at a future date.",
