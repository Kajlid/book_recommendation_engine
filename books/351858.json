  "title": "The Moon Spun Round",
  "description": "Sally Lavender has been betrayed. With the sharp, jagged remains of her life still capable of drawing blood, she takes refuge in the village of Hallowfield, a place of peace where she can lick her wounds. Slowly her pain is eased, the emptiness filled - where she expected solitude, she finds friendship, and a strangely insistent sense of connection. As the moon slowly turns, Sally discovers how strong and deep are the ties that bind her to this place and to the five very different women who take her under their protection. When one of the four is murdered, those ties demand retribution and the sharpening of claws. Power can take many shapes, and in the moonlight a small grey cat casts a long shadow in this gripping tale of love, hate and envy from a mistress of magical realism. Elenor Gill was born in England, and now lives and writes in Gisborne. An accomplished Celtic musician with a lifetime interest in folk music and the paranormal, this is her third novel. Her earlier books, In the Shadow of Trees and Miriama's Talisman, have been published to critical acclaim.",
