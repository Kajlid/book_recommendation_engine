After years of being unwanted by his family and any potential mates, all he wants is a quiet life alone. His two close friends and quilting hobby are enough to be happy... aren't they?Crimson is one of seven unmated alpha dragon brothers—and most importantly, not the one with the lizard-brained idea to host the Dragonfate Games.

As alpha dragons, the instinct to find an omega to bear their eggs is impossible to ignore. But Crimson would never fall in love with the type of man who'd enter a dating show, for Holy Drake's sake...When Taylor is tricked into entering his name into what he thinks is a quilting sweepstakes, he's thrown into a ridiculous dating show. Taylor nearly walks off—until he locks gazes with a particular ruby-eyed dragon that changes his life forever.Alpha Dragon's Tiger is a fun, sweet mpreg novel with low angst and high stakes! Fluffy HEA guaranteed.",
