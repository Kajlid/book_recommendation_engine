  "title": "Resorting to Murder",
  "description": "Resorting to Murder is the first book in the Resorting series. It’s a perfect, sparkling, turquoise morning on St. Croix, that jewel of an island in the Caribbean. The palms are swaying and the rum is running sweet. But the taste in guest services director Nola Stewart’s mouth is distinctly sour. Two new guests – the rst, quiet, intriguing, the other, loud and obnoxious – have just checked in. Together they’re turning the beach, the pool and the weekly Pirates’ Feast into a four-alarm food fiasco. Then, as one of them turns the heat at the annual KweeZeenArtZ chef competition up to a high rolling boil it would seem that murder is on the menu.",
