  "description": "AinsleeLife has been cruel to me over the last five years. Things happened back home which resulted in me deciding to move across the pond. Where do I call home? Queens, New York. I’m prospecting for the Iron Vex MC after meeting Iris at a pottery class I was taking at the local college. We quickly became friends, and one thing led to another.Now I’m a super bad bitch, or at least that’s what I think.I’m not from this life, but after everything with my family went south I decided I needed a change. I needed to live for my own happiness, not theirs. Coming out meant losing them forever, but I couldn’t hide who I was anymore. At least the club will accept me for who I am.So much has changed from my confidence, to even the color of my hair. I’ve become accustom to change, though. So, it wasn’t a big deal when Boss asked me to be the regent for the Iron Vex MC. Yet again, everything is changing. I had no problem getting down to Franklin. It was my job to be in Horse’s club, so I’d be there.Little did I know a ghost from my past would be walking through his front door.FinleyI knew there was going to be someone coming down from New York to be the regent for the Iron Vex MC. It seems a bit historical to me, using the word and whatever, but here I am. One of our own is supposed to be going up to New York as we speak. An even trade off, ensuring our alliance is smooth sailing.I didn’t expect much from one of them showing up. To be honest, I don’t know what I expected but it certainly wasn’t seeing Ainslee again.Now here we are . . . and I wonder if this is our chance to see what we could’ve been all those years ago. From her appearance so much about her has changed, but selfishly I hope her heart hasn’t.",
