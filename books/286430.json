  "description": "This book is dedicated ä¸€ \"To all but Entropy - and especially to Mark Twain, Don Marquis and Lewis Carroll\".i dyl, i dyll, (i'd'l), n. [L. idyllium;Gr, eidyllion, dim. of eidos, a form, figure, image]. Webster's New World Dictionary of American Language.Introduction by Eric Kimball.Jeff Jones is an artist of immeasurably rich gifts, and in 'Idyl' he has given us something very special. A creation that exists concurrently on many different levels, it is, most immediately, a series of glimpses into a lush pastoral world of beautiful and moodily evocative landscapes. Populating this world is a cast of such diverse and highly unlikely characters as reasoning fish, talkative butterflies, contemplative leopards, turtles, and birds. Over it all presides the wistfully enigmatic central character of 'Idyl'. Poised, aloof, and maintaining a somewhat ambivalent relationship to her surroundings, she still somehow seems to possess some inner knowledge of its mysterious laws; and it is with and through her that the work - as well as the world - begins to unfold and transcend its immediately apparent bounds.",
