  "description": "Lydia Maxwell:One moment Taylor is scowling at my tardiness and the next moment he is propositioning me.What do I say to that? Of course, I hold my tongue from insulting him and his family any further. The man has the power to save my company or let it wither before it even gets a chance to blossom.I just have to tolerate him for a year.Certainly, I can do that.I can keep up the ruse as long as he keeps his end of the bargain.Fingers and hearts crossed that nothing changes.Taylor Hirano:I’ll admit that it's hard for me to open up.It’s not easy for someone to hold my eye. But Ms. Maxwell is proving otherwise. Something about her that makes me want to open up just a little bit. To tell her about the demons that I hide. Perhaps it’s her Oscar-worthy act that’s getting to me. I shouldn’t get too close. When the time comes, she’d be gone, and I’d be alone as she found me.",
