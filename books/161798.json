  "description": "DARK EROTIC ROMANCEI’m not a demon, but there’s something dark in me. Something evil. Something I hide behind a mask of smiles and pleasantness. It comes out at night, creeps up on me like a shadowy stalker. A dark craving. Depraved and wrong, but growing more irresistible every day. I don’t know why I’m still fighting it.I’m not a good man. I tried to be a long time ago, but sometimes it’s time to come to terms with the true nature of yourself, and my nature is monstrous. I’m tired of resisting. When I lay eyes upon Jenna for the first time, I knew it was a losing battle. She is everything that’s good and pure in the world. Everything I’m not. And I want to take that from her. I want to consume her, want to make her mine, want to possess her in every possible way. Body and Soul.My dark craving has come out to play. I’m done resisting.Warning: adult content",
