  "description": "Debra Driza's MILA 2.0 is the first book in a gripping Bourne Identity â€“style trilogy about a girl who discovers she is actually an android. Mila was never supposed to remember her past, or know what lurked beneath her synthetic skin. She was never meant to learn that she was \"born\" in a secret computer science lab and programmed with superhuman skills. But when a group of hooded men show up on her doorstep, hoping to strip her of her advanced technology, she has no choice but to run for her life. In every direction there are dangerous people, hunting her down. They will do whatever it takes to capture Mila, including hurting the people she cares about most. Filled with secrets, action, and even romance, MILA 2.0 is perfect for readers who love sci-fi thrillers like the Partials series and I Am Number Four .",
