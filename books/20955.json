  "title": "The Book Nobody Read: Chasing the Revolutions of Nicolaus Copernicus",
  "description": "After three decades of investigation, and after traveling hundreds of thousands of miles across the globe-from Melbourne to Moscow, Boston to Beijing-Gingerich has written an utterly original book built on his experience and the remarkable insights gleaned from examining some 600 copies of \"De revolutionibus.\" He found the books owned and annotated by Galileo, Kepler and many other lesser-known astronomers whom he brings back to life, which illuminate the long, reluctant process of accepting the Sun-centered cosmos and highlight the historic tensions between science and the Catholic Church. He traced the ownership of individual copies through the hands of saints, heretics, scalawags, and bibliomaniacs. He was called as the expert witness in the theft of one copy, witnessed the dramatic auction of another, and proves conclusively that \"De revolutionibus\" was as inspirational as it was revolutionary. Part biography of a book, part scientific exploration, part bibliographic detective story, \"The Book Nobody Read\" recolors the history of cosmology and offers new appreciation of the enduring power of an extraordinary book and its ideas.",
