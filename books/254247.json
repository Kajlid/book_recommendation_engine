  "description": "AngelAfter the death of my parents, I learned life was way shorter than anyone could’ve predicted. I found myself lost in writing my dreams and fantasies down on paper until I published my first book. Then reality smacked me in the face when I caught the one man I’d planned to spend my future with giving his secretary a cavity check. Cue in bat-sh*t crazy girlfriend.When I thought my life was taking a turn, all it took was one phone call to put it in a different direction.Carter Living life to the fullest has always been our family’s motto. Cancer wore heavily for a few years, but we never let that dampen our spirits because my father would have never wanted that, but the bills that piled up sent me on a new path in my life…cover modeling.At the beginning, it was an ego boost to be on so many authors’ covers. Eventually, it fizzled into wanting more out of my life. I found more in Angel, but outside our bubble there was one person who didn’t want to see us succeed. This is a standalone book. This book is meant for an audience 18 and older. There are some scenes that may not be suitable for some readers.",
