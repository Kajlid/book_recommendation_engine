  "description": "In the year 1933 an elderly Dr John Watson is looking back over his life and his time spent with his brilliant friend and master of deduction Sherlock Holmes. He writes in a letter to the reader that he has assembled a list of seven untold adventures that span from his and Sherlock's early years until the time of Sherlock's retirement. Watson explains that he wishes to leave, not only his family but the public with a final compilation of Adventures that he and Sherlock shared while he is still able. In these seven stories Holmes and Watson are caught in the middle of multiple Government Scandals (Acquitted Client & Diamond Jubilee) cold blooded murders (Poisoned Affair & Saint Mary's Murder) and Terrorist groups (The Yellow Handkerchief). As well Holmes and Watson come face to face the spirits of darkness (The Haunted Hotel) and in a story that works through over a decade of Holmes's cases, we learn the truth about Watson's marital life and what happened to his wife Mary after Holmes's apparent death at Reichenbach (The Solved Problem).These Untold Adventures of Sherlock Holmes will engage Holmes fans from all over and will bring them deeper into the world of Sherlock Holmes and the complexities within.",
