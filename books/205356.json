  "description": "Pets have a special place in our hearts and homes -- but do they share our destiny after death? World famous psychic, spiritual teacher, and New York Times bestselling author Sylvia Browne exercises her astonishing insight to illustrate the very special purpose our pets have on Earth -- and what animals experience after death. Cats, dogs, horses, and other creatures not only inhabit our homes but also our hearts. With their never-ending loyalty, heroic deeds, comic behavior, and vibrant personalities, pets are companions but can also be our closest friends and dearest confidants. The death of a pet is always heart wrenching and tragic. Legendary psychic Sylvia Browne provides comfort for those grieving over the loss of a beloved animal by showing how pets continue to be with us even after their deaths. Sylvia uses forty years of research and decades' worth of true stories culled from readings and her own experiences to show how our pets have unique personalities, quirks, and habits that make up their spirit and soul. Sharing heartwarming stories from pets on both sides of life, Sylvia Browne examines how our animals live in the afterlife, whether we will see them on the Other Side, how their presence affects us daily, and where animals fit into the whole of Creation. In All Pets Go to Heaven, Sylvia Browne explains how pets, like humans, have a spirit that travels to the Other Side.",
