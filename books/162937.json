  "description": "A year ago, Jim Thomas met Charlie. Now, the Thomas family is enjoying life with their new, hairy family member. But Jim knows that something is still missing from Charlie's life, and he's determined to find it. Where is his family? Are there more like Charlie? Making it his summer mission, Jim discovers a promising place to look.  The road to Jim's target brings family and unexpected revelations. Along the way, they're guided to a place that seems to be ground zero for strange Bisby. This small Texas town is like any other small town—everyone knows everyone and everything that happens.  Not good for a family with a secret.  In a turn of good fortune—or perhaps bad—the family encounters an amateur TV crew investigating the alleged sightings, and they invite Jim along. The crew has arranged to look around on Hoke Farm, the place that seems to house the strange creature. With their entrance to Hoke Farm assured, Jim and Jack are able to investigate for themselves to see if there are any more of Charlie's kind.  With threats from the TV crew, curious Bisby residents, and small-town folks who don't appreciate any outside interference, Jim and his family must navigate through the new terrain to secretly find out about the mysterious residents of Hoke Farm.",
