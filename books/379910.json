  "description": "A Woman With A Past. . .. . . Six years ago, Rebecca Tremaine, the daughter of a vicar, became pregnant by her fianc√©. When he died unexpectedly, Rebecca was heartbroken and disgraced. The child was stillborn--or so Rebecca believed. Now, she's both shocked and jubilant to discover that her relatives arranged for her baby girl, Lily, to be given to a distant family connection--Cameron Sinclair, Earl of Hampton. The widowed earl reluctantly agrees to let Rebecca visit Lily over Christmas at his home in Kent, where she finds that the little girl, while a darling, is alarmingly spoiled. . .and the handsome, confident earl is attractive beyond measure. . . A Love For All Seasons. . .  Graceful, tender-hearted, and completely captivating, Rebecca fills Cameron Sinclair's home with warmth and light. There's no denying that her concern for Lily's behavior is well-founded. Just as he knows there's also no denying the ache he feels at the thought of her departure. After his wife's death three years ago, Cameron was adamant that he could never love another woman. But as the holiday season draws to a close, he can only hope that it is not too late to admit the joy of being proven thoroughly, delightfully wrong. . . Praise for Adrienne Basso's The Christmas Heiress. . .  \"In her latest sinfully sensual historical, Basso neatly blends beautifully nuanced characters with a plot rich in Christmas cheer.\" --Booklist",
