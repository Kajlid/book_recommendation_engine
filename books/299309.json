  "description": "Keep your secrets to yourself, and you won’t get hurt; it’s none of their business anyway.Catch and Release at Club Angelus no longer holds any appeal to Dr Michael McIan; the kind of play he favours is intimate, and it hurts too much to let the submissive go after the scene.But one day a couple walks into his surgery, and they respond so sweetly to him, his resolve to stay vanilla weakens. He should keep his distance; he refuses to get in the middle of their marriage.Then they come to him with the most tempting offer…*This is an MMF romance with MF, MM and MMF scenes.",
