  "description": "Every 100,000 years or so, the Essences of the Earth convene in a Great Council. Often times this meeting is held to determine if the inhabiting species of the planet are worthy of the very air they breathe. The last time this council met, it resulted in an ice age.  The Essences of the Earth have kept their existence hidden from humans since man’s first step. But with a vote looming on the horizon, even the Great Council is not immune to the deceit and hidden agendas of politics. In a play to impose their will and swing the majority of the council, the Vines bring a small group of young humans into the fray. A charter fishing boat marooned on the submerged island that houses the Great Council, proves to be the unpredictable variable in the formula.  Edison, a deck hand and foster son of the ship’s Captain, becomes severally dehydrated by his seasickness. In an effort to help him, Ellie, a young girl on vacation with her family, feeds him bucket after bucket of water. The water is one of the Earth’s essences, which immediately merges with Edison. The young boy soon discovers that he has the ability to control water. This makes him a target of the Waters’ rival Essences on the Great Council. Edison and Ellie find themselves in an adventure where they are running for their lives from a giant venomous vine snake, befriended by talking trees and flowers, battling Ellie’s beautiful and possessed older sister and trying to save 7 billion people.  In an effort to help bring the world of Earthlings to life, the author collected illustrations from 13 different artists. Ron Frenz (The Amazing Spider-Man), Robert Atkins (G.I. Joe), Terry Moore (Strangers in Paradise), Chris Yamber (Bart Simpson Comics) and more . . .",
