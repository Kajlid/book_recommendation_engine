  "description": "Falling through time and falling in love - neither is simple. Still mourning the loss of her beloved grandmother and shaken by her mysterious, dying request to “find the baby”, Abbi has arrived at uni to start her first year. But on her second day, she wakes up to a different world: 1983. That is just the first stop on Abbi’s journey backwards through time. Will is a charming student from 1927 who travels forwards through time. When Abbi and Will meet in the middle, love adds another complication to their lives. Communicating across time through a buried time capsule, they try to decode the mystery of their travel, find the lost baby and plead with their champion, a kindly physics tutor, to help them find each other again ... even though the tutor gets younger each time Abbi meets him. This page-turning story full of romance, twists and delightful details about uni life then and now will stay with readers long after the book’s satisfying end.",
