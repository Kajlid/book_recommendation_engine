  "description": "The Just So Stories for Little Children were written by British author Rudyard Kipling. They are highly fantasized origin stories and are among Kipling's best known works. The stories, first published in 1902, are pourquoi stories, fantastic accounts of how various phenomena came about. A forerunner of these stories is \"How Fear Came\" in The Second Jungle Book (1895), in which Mowgli hears the story of how the tiger got his stripes. The original editions of Just So Stories were illustrated with woodcuts by Kipling himself, though later editions have included illustrations by other artists. - Excerpted from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.",
