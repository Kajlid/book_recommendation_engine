  "description": "Jay puts pressure on Faren for more than she's willing to give. With the discovery of a deeper secret than she can keep to herself, Faren commits to lying no more. Though the goal of her mother's debt has been absolved and is safe from transport, Faren struggles with concerns over her long term care. When Mick finds out the absolute truth, the dynamic of their relationship changes to include something she never expected to have: hope. On the cusp of a new reality, with more than just herself to be responsible for, Faren elicits Thorn's help to take down the corruption that's closing in around the tight group. How long can Faren and Thorn keep those at bay that wish to destroy the fragile happiness between Mick and Faren? Will blackmail be successful in ruining the one thing Faren's decided she wants even more than her own life?",
