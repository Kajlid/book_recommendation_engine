  "description": "Since the Mayflower brought the first five Cubi to America, the race has looked forward to this day. But an overlooked historical detail can bring everything they have worked toward to an end.  Daniel is settling in and trying to find a rhythm after the latest change in his life. With the help of Seldon, Caledon, and the Grand Lady Geodin, Daniel begins his education and development to rise as a full-fledged Incubus.  Seldon is not a man who rattles easily, but the latest changes to his life after the Cubi Court’s verdict has sent the old Incubus out in uncharted territory. Falling madly in love with a human raised boy does not help uncomplicate things—especially when that boy is not yet versed enough in the Cubi ways to not mistake feeding for love or love for feeding.",
