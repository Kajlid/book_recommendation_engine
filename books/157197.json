Fast-forward to present day, and American scientist Sam Quick and her team are attacked while on mission to the island, setting off a chain of events that ricochets the scientists around the capitals of Europe and into far deeper and darker places than any volcanic mineshaft. And at the center is a brutal Russian billionaire who is hell-bent on rewriting history. But in the highest-stakes experiment of her life, can Sam Quick stay alive along enough to stop him?",
