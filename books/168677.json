When he sees the way his vice-president is treating his ol’ lady, he tries to keep his thoughts to himself. The one thing Bull insists on in his club is respect and loyalty: respect for the patch, respect for your brother, and loyalty to the club. However, after finding Babs in a harsh predicament after a run in with Locks, he can’t help but step in. Crossing lines and hurdling around life’s unpredictability, will they find refuge in each other or will they have to endure what life gives them?Warning: This is not your typical happily ever after.
