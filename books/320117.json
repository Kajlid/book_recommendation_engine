  "title": "Throw Out Fifty Things: Clear the Clutter, Find Your Life",
  "description": "\"Our lives are so filled with junk from the past-from dried up tubes of glue to old grudges-that it's a wonder we can get up in the morning,\" exclaims motivator, best-selling author, columnist, and life coach Gail Blanke.\"If you want to grow, you gotta let go,\" is Blanke's mantra; and that means eliminating all the clutter-physical and emotional-that holds you back, weighs you down, or just makes you feel bad about yourself.In THROW OUT FIFTY THINGS she takes us through each room of the house-from the attic to the garage-and even to the far reaches of our minds. Through poignant and humorous stories, she inspires us to get rid of the \"life plaque\" we've allowed to build-up there.Once you've hit fifty-you'll be surprised how easy it is to get there-and once you've thrown out that too-tight belt and too-small view of yourself, you'll be ready to step out into the clearing and into the next, and greatest, segment of your life.",
