  "description": "When hot and handsome Vince Moretti walks into Ashley Santoro's life, she ultimately has to decide whether she will continue to hold onto the bad-girl, biracial routine that has her looking for love in superficial relationships onlyâ€”or if what she has with this star basketball player is true love. Emotionally neglected and abandoned by her mother and father, the Ashley series details a courageous journey of a young adult fielding her way through alcoholism and overeating into her own discovery of how to love and how to be loved. Accused of soliciting sex from three New York Knicks players at a party in Manhattan, Ashley abandons her promising new relationship with Vince, a partnership that she feels she does not deserve. Caught up in a cycle of self-defeat, will Ashley continue her downward spiral and ultimately sabotage her first true love, as well?",
