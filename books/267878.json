  "description": "The Regency in England! This period boasted Jane Austen and Lord Byron. High society, the gentry, the working classes--they all knew their place. From coaches and curricles to Almack's, from lorgnettes and quizzing glasses to Drury Lane and Pall Mall, it's all here, from chambermaids to the Prince Regent himself! Add Miss Ariana Forsythe to the intoxicating mix of fun and inspiration, and what do you have? The first Christian Regency on the market today! Welcome to this delightful world, and prepare to fall in love with Ariana and her cohorts. From her home in the village of Chesterton to the very ballroom of Carlton House, you will follow her journey of faith--and adventure-- to its heartwarming conclusion.",
