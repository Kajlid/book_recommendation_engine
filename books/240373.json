  "description": "Georgette DeLuca’s life is a mess and she knows it. She wasn’t supposed to be here, working a dead-end job, living in a crappy apartment, and staying home alone every night. Deciding to make one last attempt at a real life before giving up for good, she crosses paths with Bear, a gentle giant of a dog, and his arrogant yet alluring owner, Asher Wright. Georgette is determined to just be friends, but soon Asher’s stubborn pursuit and her own unexpected feelings of attraction begin to crack her carefully constructed walls. As the demons of her past begin to surface, Georgette must decide whether she will flee or find the strength within herself to face her past with Asher and Bear by her side.",
