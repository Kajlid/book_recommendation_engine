Only…it’s literally out in the middle of a field, and her orders are so vague, she can hardly tell what she’s supposed to be investigating. But as she begins to uncover a sheep-led worker’s rights revolt and an alien invasion conspiracy—not to mention a spooky haunting at the abandoned S.U.I.T. field outpost—Cilantro steps into her own V.E.S.T. as a valued member of the team. Joining this series is co-writer Chris Hastings and artist Pat Lewis, with John heavily involved in guiding the Agents along this standalone but complementary saga.",
