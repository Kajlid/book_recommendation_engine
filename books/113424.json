But her impeccable training at Miss Hepplewhite's Young Ladies Academy in Philadelphia is hardly preparation for the colorful characters and crude life that await her in Washington Territory. Thrown upon her wits in the wild, Jane must determine for herself whether she is truly proper Miss Jane Peck of Philadelphia, faultless young lady and fianc√©e, or Boston Jane, as the Chinook dub her, fearless and loyal woman of the frontier. An exciting new novel from Jennifer L. Holm, author of the Newbery Honor Book Our Only May Amelia.",
