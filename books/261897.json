  "description": "Here is the story of five little lads before they became five really big Founding Fathers, from New York Times bestselling creator and Caldecott Honor recipient Lane SmithOnce there were four lads . . .John [Hancock],Paul [Revere],George [Washington],and Ben [Franklin].Oh yes, there was also Tom [Jefferson], but he was annoyingly independent and hardly ever around. These lads were always getting into trouble for one reason or another. In other words, they took a few . . . liberties. And to be honest, they were not always appreciated. Until one day, they all played a part in securing America's freedom.\"Deftly drawn, witty, and instantly appealing, the illustrations creatively blend period elements such as wood-grain and crackle-glaze texturing, woodcut lines, and formal compositions typical of the era, with gaping mouths and stylized, spiraling eyes typical of modern cartoons,\" wrote Booklist, and School Library Journal declared, \"Exercise your freedom to scoop up this one.\"",
