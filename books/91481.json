  "description": "For fans of Debbie Macomber comes Sweet On You, the first installment in the Cupcake Diaries series.Everyone knows business and pleasure don’t mix … or do they?Andi Burke has a dream—a kitchen big enough to dance in, regular income to support her daughter, and a chance to find true love. So when she enlists her sister Kim and their bubbly best friend Rachel to help open Creative Cupcakes, it all seems perfect.Especially when hunky local reporter Jake Hartman offers to finance the store for them. Andi hasn't dated since her divorce, but the way Jake keeps looking at her might make her change her mind. After all, what could go wrong?Plenty! There's a shady tattoo parlor behind their shop, a crowd of crazy Zumba dancers out front (chanting \"Lose the fat, dance with Pat!\"), and about the only thing going right is Andi's romance … until Jake’s media crew captures a story that could shut the two of them down forever.",
