  "description": "Roger Storm has it all: money, a beautiful fiancée, and a career as an advertising executive for a major airline. But when a mysterious stranger dressed in a 1940s train porter’s uniform convinces him to restore the Santa Fe Super Chief, America’s most famous old luxury train, for one last run from Chicago to Los Angeles, Roger’s life will never be the same. Given a guest list and orders to arrange for all of the expenses out of his own pocket, Roger will risk certain financial ruin in order to find out shocking revelations about his own life and attain a happiness he never knew was missing. Field of Dreams meets An Affair to Remember on a mystical train ride. Infused with a magical realism and spirituality that is missing from most books, this is a truly touching novel that opens our eyes to the sometimes supernatural forces that mysteriously and unexpectedly give us glimpses of heaven while providing healing and hope. With an endearing urge to touch readers in a way that few novels can, author Douglas Folsom does an excellent job of making readers actually experience the underlying message in his heartwarming tale.",
