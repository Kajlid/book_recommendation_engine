  "description": "Though it's been years since Experiment in Terror ended, Perry and Dex Foray are back in front of the camera, only this time they aren't hunting ghosts but instead using their special \"skills\" to communicate with the dead. When they're invited by a cruising company to make contact with the dead crew members of La Paix, an infamous tall ship with a mysterious past, they set out to help uncover the mystery behind the hauntings.Except, this won't be as simple as spending one night on the ship. They set sail from New York City to Southampton, England in order to fully immerse themselves with the ghosts, on a sixteen-day voyage across the Atlantic.But while finding out what happened to the ghost crew of La Paix is harrowing enough when you're on a ship in the middle of the ocean, things take a turn for the worse when something bizarre happens, leaving Dex with his memory wiped.He doesn't know who his wife is, and he's never heard of EIT.It's like his life after he first met Perry in her uncle's lighthouse never happened.Now Perry has to do all she can to make sure he remembers--or risk losing him forever.",
