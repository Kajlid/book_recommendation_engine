  "description": "For years, infertility followed me like a cloud. But finally, the sun has risen. Finally, I am pregnant.Except now a new storm rages in the distance - one I have no choice but to pass through. I have no idea if the child I'm carrying belongs to my husband... or to the man I've betrayed him with - a man I've come to love but whose name I don't know.What I do know is that I'm a cheat. A liar. Undeserving of this baby inside me.I don't know how this will end. But I do know it won't be without casualties, because this is a story in which a true happy ending cannot exist.A story of how my love for one grew into three but must end with only two.",
