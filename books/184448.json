  "description": "Librarian's Note: This is a new cover edition for ISBN 1326116177/9781326116170Encounter is a collection of poems written mostly in free verse but with some traditional poetic forms included. The poems are divided into three themes - love, nature and life, but of course, themes overlap. Linda has experienced all sides of love - the joy it brings, the pain when it goes wrong, unrequited and learning to move on. Her aim is to show that it really is possible to overcome heartbreak and start again with hope and confidence. She is constantly inspired by nature and she invites you to share with her the thrill of a new spring, mercurial summer, the glorious colours of autumn and the frozen wonders of winter.",
