  "description": "[Siren Allure ManLove: Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance] Despite being different, Zacky has maintained a strict level of denial, although his inability to digest anything but meat, preferably raw meat, is impossible to hide or deny. His puritanical and violent father controls him with religion and fear, and he leads a quiet, lonely life. After his twenty-first birthday, he starts to lose control of everything he's repressed, especially when he meets Tyler, a man who fascinates and terrifies him. Tyler and his friends force him to realize that he is not only gay but not quite human. Now he can no longer digest anything but blood, and his growing desires for Tyler and for blood conflict with everything he's been taught is right. He fights it, even knowing that he's hurting himself and Tyler in the process, and even when he accepts that he has to leave his home when the time comes for them to move on. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
