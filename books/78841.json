  "description": "Breathing was not an option when their gazes locked. Alexander’s hauntingly beautiful eyes seemed to penetrate her soul, unfurling all her secrets. And his smile – Oooh, his smile could end wars or start them, depending on his mood. But his dangerous good looks were irrelevant. He was an Unseelie faie and a wicked prince at that, while Roxy belonged to the Seelie Court. Their destinies should have never intertwined. Nevertheless, it didn’t slow Alexander’s determination to get her tangled between his bed sheets. With the Unseelie prince’s insanely addictive kiss lingering on her lips, Roxy is appointed by the Seelie Court to investigate their king’s murder. As more faies turn up dead, Roxy must find the killer before accusations push the two courts into war. One problem: the killer orchestrates a twisted game of hide-and-seek, as if amused by the web of lies they create. The catch: all the clues lead to an Unseelie prince being the killer mastermind – the very faie whose touch Roxy craves.",
