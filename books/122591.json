  "description": "An all-new and addictive dark, why-choose, captive romance from the USA Today & Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Tracy Lorraine. All my life I’ve been a prisoner. Locked away by men who think they hold all the power. First my father. And now him. The devil himself. Reid Harris. Even my husband can’t save me from the most infamous man in Harrow Creek and his loyal best friend. I’m tangled up in their twisted games. One woman. Three dangerous men. They expect me to cower. To beg and plead for mercy. But Reid’s about to discover that not everyone bends to his will. Because I don’t care who he is or what he does, I will not break. Not for any man. And certainly not for him.Dear Reader,Merciless is book one of four in the Harrow Creek Hawks series. It is a dark why-choose romance, meaning our leading lady has several love interests and never has to choose to find her HEA. These three a-hole alphas are certainly no heroes; their morals are questionable at best. If you're looking for a good guy, then you're in the wrong place. Enter at your own discretion.",
