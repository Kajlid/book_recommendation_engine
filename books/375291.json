  "description": "Looking Africa in the face.  An homage to the continent of contrasts  \"\"In the footsteps of courage and catastrophe [...] – a 30-year journey across the dark continent by the world’s greatest photojournalist.\"\" - The Sunday Times Magazines , LondonSebastião Salgado is one the most respected photojournalists working today , his reputation forged by decades of dedication and powerful black-and-white images of distressed people taken in places where most wouldn’t dare to go. Although he has photographed around the globe, his work most heavily concentrates on Africa, where he has shot more than 40 reportage works over a period of 30 years . From the Dinka tribes in Sudan and the Himba in Namibia to gorillas and volcanoes in the lakes region to displaced peoples throughout the continent,  Salgado shows us all facets of African life today.  He knows exactly how to grab the essence of a moment and his images artfully teach us the disastrous effects of war, poverty, disease, and hostile climatic conditions. This stunning book brings together Salgado’s photos in three the first concentrates on the southern part of the continent  (Mozambique, Malawi, Angola, Zimbabwe, South Africa, Namibia), the second on the  Great Lakes region (Congo, Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya), and the third on the Sub-Saharan region  (Burkina Faso, Mali, Sudan, Somalia, Chad, Mauritania, Senegal, Ethiopia).  Texts are provided by renowned Mozambique novelist Mia Couto , who describes how today’s Africa reflects the effects of colonization as well as the consequences of economic, social, and environmental crises.",
