  "title": "Mary Emma & Company",
  "description": "The protagonist, Mary Emma Moody, widowed mother of six, has taken her family east in 1912 to begin a new life. Her son, Ralph, then thirteen, recalls how the Moodys survive that first bleak winter in a Massachusetts town. Money and prospects are lacking, but not so faith and resourcefulness. \"Mother\" in Little Britches and Man of the Family , Mary Emma emerges fully as a character in this book, and Ralph, no longer called \"Little Britches,\" comes into his own. The familyâ€™s run-ins with authority and with broken furnaces in winter are evocative of a full and warm family life. Mary Emma & Company continues the Moody saga that started in Colorado with Little Britches and runs through Man of the Family and The Home Ranch . All these titles have been reprinted as Bison Books, as has The Fields of Home , in which Ralph leaves the Massachusetts town for his grandfather's farm in Maine.",
