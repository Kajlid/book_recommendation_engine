  "description": "Country mouse meets city cat.Owen may be a bit of a country mouse, but he loves his vacation in London, even more so when he meets the sexy and arrogant Malcolm Kavanagh. But eighty-hour weeks at a trading desk don’t leave Malcolm much time for meaningful relationships. In his world, everything’s a competition—even sex.Their vacation romance turns serious, but that’s just the first chapter in their story. Anyone who’s ever been in love knows that happy endings take a lot more work than declaring your feelings.Malcolm has never been in love, or even in a relationship. Everything is a struggle, from accepting Owen’s low-status job to putting his boyfriend above his personal trainer. Luckily, Owen knows a little more about these things. From the art galleries of Cambridge to the tawdry majesty of the Dominion theatre, Owen adapts to England while Malcolm adapts to the whole human race. Maybe, if Owen is patient enough and Malcolm learns to give, the two of them can make it past Relationship Armageddon to a real happy ending.",
