  "description": "First in an ongoing Heroic Fantasy series, 'Revenge of the Elf' promises unrelenting action, oddball mages, and a foul-mouthed wisecracking heroine tougher than a hardboiled egg. Following in the footsteps of Conan, Drizzt, the Gray Mouser, Elric, Druss, and many more heroes of Sword and Sorcery, the elf called Nysta will carve her own epic path. And that path will be bloody. --- \"So, I'd like to make a truce. You don't try opening my veins, and I won't melt your face off. The thing is, I want to sleep easy for one night without having to keep hold of my magic just in case. And I'm sure you don't need any more practice after what you did to those two out there. So, what do you say, Long-ear? Think we can agree to be polite?\" \"Sure, Chukshene,\" the elf said, sheathing the blade and plunging the wagon's interior into darkness. \"I reckon we can mind our manas for a bit.\" --- For Nysta, outcast assassin from the ruthless city of Lostlight, trouble was no stranger. This time it came in the form of nine killers who made the mistake of leaving her alive. It was a mistake she was determined to make them regret. Relying on brutality and violence, she ventured deep into the savage heart of the frozen wastes. Hate guided her every step and rage burned in every vengeful thought. But there were worse things in the Deadlands than a band of treacherous mercenaries. Worse even than draug and their insatiable need for flesh. Evil had survived long enough to be called legend and it still walked its bitter path. A path which now led to her. In its shadow, darkness would be unleashed. Unleashed to fight. Fight. And fight again.",
