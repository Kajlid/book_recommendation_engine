  "description": "Is it really a dream come true if it means losing the one thing you never knew you needed?  Willow Parker is excited to move to Podunk, Nowheres-ville. That’s what she’s telling herself, but it’s not working until she meets a dark-eyed, honey-voiced cowboy. That’s when her new small-town life starts looking a lot less temporary. Bobby is a big-hearted storyteller, wrapped in a sexy, gruff, hard-working, family man package that makes Willow’s pillow-soft heart race and body hum. She should’ve known love’s never that easy though.  Bobby Tannen knows exactly who he is – a farmer, a brother, and last but not least, a singer-songwriter. He’s made his peace with his biggest audience being the folks at the local honkytonk, and knows his future lies in the dirt of the land he’s worked his whole life. With beautiful Willow at his side, he’s one step closer to a happily ever after he’s only written songs about.  Until a hotshot music executive comes to town and offers Bobby everything he’s ever wanted. But it may come at too high of a price… his new relationship with Willow.  Who truly holds Bobby’s heart – the bright lights of Nashville or his sweet Willow?",
