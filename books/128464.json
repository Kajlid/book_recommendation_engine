  "description": "A Classic Derek Robinson story: three groups of men converge for a final battle in the western desert during World War II. An SAS patrol travels through the Sahara to attack a German airbase hundreds of miles behind the lines; a German intelligence officer, with a personal grudge to settle, plans to play the SAS at their own game. And our old friends from Hornet Squadron (A PIECE OF CAKE) are overhead - only just - now committed to suicidal ground-attack missions to satisfy their commander's determination to keep his job. Note: First published in 1992.",
