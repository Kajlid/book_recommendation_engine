  "title": "Catching Hell",
  "description": "Anna Benson is an eager \"May\" to Zach Ormond's downright sexy \"December\".  At age thirty-seven, Zach is a veteran catcher in the last years of his contract, grateful for a no-trade clause that will let him retire a star in Raleigh. Twenty-five-year-old Anna has grown up in the Rockets' front office; her grandfather has long groomed her to take over the team.  When Zach finally realizes Anna is no longer a star-struck kid, their passion flares like a game-winning grand slam. But after a freak accident injures a young phenom and forces the team to land a new player, Anna must sacrifice Zach for the Rockets, convincing him to forfeit his hard-won no-trade guarantee.  There's hell to pay. He's doing everything in his considerable seductive power to make her keep himâ€”on the team and in her bed. How can Anna and Zach live happily ever after when their romance will destroy the team they love?",
