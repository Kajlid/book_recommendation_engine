  "description": "Bishop Ryle's Expository Thoughts on the Gospels were first issued in 1856 and immediately met with a warm welcome from evangelical Christians of all denominations. In the 20th century the growing popularity of Ryle's spiritual approach has led to three reprints of the series in ten years. The author did not prepare the work for scholars, but instead that the volumes were for family and private use. Like all his writings, they were intended to help the ordinary man and woman. \"I have a strong conviction,\" he wrote, \"that we want more reverent deep-searching study of the scriptures in the present day. Most Christians see nothing beyond the surface of the Bible when they read it. We want more clear knowledge of Christ, as a living person, a living priest, a living physician, a living friend, a living Saviour soon about to come again. Most Christians know little of Christianity but the skeleton of doctrines - I desire never to forget those two if I can do anything to make Christ and the Bible more honourable in these latter days, I shall be truly thankful and content.\"This volume covers the Gospel of St John.",
