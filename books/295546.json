  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Reason Cansino has learned the painful truth that she - like her mother, grandmother, and new friends Tom and Jay-Tee - must face a choice between using the magic that lives in her blood and dying young, or refusing to use the magic and losing her mind. Now a new threat leaves Reason stranded alone in New York City, struggling to control a power she barely understands. But could the danger she faces also hold the key to saving her life? \"Magic Lessons\" is a stunning follow-up to Larbalestier's debut novel, \"Magic or Madness, \" which earned multiple starred reviews and a spot on the Locus 2005 Recommended Reading List, along with being named a Best Book of the Year by \"School Library Journal\" and the Young Adult Round Table of the TLA.",
