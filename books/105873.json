  "description": "Sweet and pristine, the dark inhabitants of the woods knew not to touch the young woman that lived in the depths of the forest.Yet the beast that stalks her has nothing to fear of being cursed. Nothing to lose if he claims her innocence.This scorching novelette contains dubious consent and breeding by a werewolf, and a romantic, twisted, happily ever after.~~Excerpt:\"What've you got?\" he asked in a masculine tone, as if he were some regular passer-by and she some travelling merchant hocking her wares.\"Huh? Just food and things,\" she said honestly, though her voice quivered with the fright of him stumbling upon her. She caught herself and stood upright, her head tilted so that she could stare at him directly, \"Nothing to trade.\"She watched as he looked to the side at her cart with those strange eyes of his, the pony having stopped a few feet ahead once it noticed she was no longer by its side. \"A shame,\" he said, and with lightning fast speed he flipped up the small cloak draped over one arm and shoulder and grabbed for her neck.It was a strange experience, a first for her, to have someone's hand about her neck, choking off her breathing. He pushed her to the side, pressed her against the side of the cart and as if out of nowhere, she saw a shining dagger pointed to her bulging jugular. \"Then I'll give ya a choice,\" he said, his dark gaze penetrating her as he pressed up to her. \"Yer grandmother's food and supplies,\" he hesitated for just a fraction of a moment, his gaze dipped down over her form, \"or yer virtue.\"",
