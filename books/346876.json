  "description": "This Caldecott Honor book from beloved illustrator Peter Spier is a spirited take on a classic American folk song.\"[Spier's] finely detailed, action-packed New England autumn vistas are almost startlingly beautiful.\"— The New York Times  Over fifty years after he won a Caldecott Honor for  The Fox Went Out on a Chilly Night,  legendary illustrator Peter Spier went back to this time-honored favorite in 2014 to paint the half of the book that was originally printed in black and white. In this glowing, restored vision of Spier’s beloved classic, follow the wily fox as he roams a sleepy New England town in search of a meal, with tones and textures so vivid you can almost hear the crackle of crisp fall leaves and the ripples of the river in the moonlight.",
