But the urge to touch him is too strong -- and to touch him endlessly with unquenchable passion. When the warrior's memory returns, he realizes that Amber is his enemy. But how can he forsake the woman who has healed his body and his heart? Now he must defy to the death the dread forces that have proclaimed their love forbidden.",
