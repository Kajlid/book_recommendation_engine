  "description": "𝐑𝐞𝐦𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐭𝐨𝐧It's been four years since one night changed our lives... I lost my heart, my soul, the love of my life. She left without a word and never gave me a chance to explain. Was I mad? Hell yeah. But I never stopped loving her. So I wrote her a letter, and then another one, and then another... Now she's back again and I can't help the feelings I'm having. Just like before, she's the oxygen in my lungs and the sun in my sky. Except, she's hell bent on never giving me another chance. 𝐅𝐚𝐢𝐭𝐡Four years ago, Remington made one decision that changed our future. It hurt too much to relive that night over and over again, so I ran.I went to the city and started over, ignoring all things Remington. But after losing my job, I have no choice but to move home. Back to Moonshine Springs. Back to where my heart was shattered into a million pieces. He seems to think we stand a chance, that we can move on and be something to each other once again. I'm not so sure I can trust him, though. Or that I'm willing to risk the pain that comes with loving Remington. All I can do is agree to finally read his letters and see if my heart survives.",
