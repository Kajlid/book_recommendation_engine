Benji has a special loving relationship with his Poppy and Mimi. They spend quality time with him. They take him to the park or out for an ice cream cone. They read to Benji. They talk to him. They provide new experiences for him in order to develop his curiosity.  Today's adventure is a visit to a farm as told in the words of a 3 year old in rhyme. Benji learns how to milk a cow. And he gets to ride on a tractor.",
