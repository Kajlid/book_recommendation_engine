  "title": "Good, the Bad, and the Data: Shane the Lone Ethnographer’s Basic Guide to Qualitative Data Analysis",
  "description": "Data analysis is often the most difficult task facing students and novice qualitative researchers, including Shane the Lone Ethnographer―a grad student with fond visions of the Wild West―and her horse Transcriptor. In this comic-style textbook, we follow Shane as she attempts to corral her data and make sense of it for publication. Shane learns how to read, sort, code, write, and assess the analysis of a qualitative study in the traditions of ethnography, grounded theory, discourse, and narrative analysis. Along the trail, she receives helpful advice from experienced researchers who explain their analytic practices in detail. Written in a friendly, comic book style, Shane’s Wild West adventures in data analysis will be both instructive and an enjoyable read.",
