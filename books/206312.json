  "title": "Diabetic Devil: How a 50 Year Old with a Death Wish Saved His Own Life",
  "description": "Diabetic Devil is the true story of Chuck Hirsch, a man who ignored all the warning signs of an impending diabetic disaster that nearly cost him his friends, family, career and life.Throughout much of his life as a successful marketing executive, father, husband and type one insulin-dependent diabetic, Chuck Hirsch lived on the razor’s edge. He partied his way through the clubs of 1980s New York City, rubbed elbows with celebrities and reached impressive heights in some of NY’s most prestigious ad agencies. But Chuck faced a pivotal crossroad in his life when he turned 50. After decades of poor eating habits and incredible levels of alcohol and drug abuse, even in the face of alarming health results, Chick needed to find a way to fix himself, or continue a slow descent into financial ruin, poor health and eventually death at an early age.Through a unique “food + exercise + common sense” life transformation plan and the meaningful lessons learned along the way, Chuck safely lost almost 100 lbs and dramatically improved his odds for a healthy and happy future. Diabetic Devil chronicles the peaks and valleys of Chuck’s amazing life story , and while, not calling itself a diet of exercise book, details an easy to follow blueprint for change for the better. Told in a frank and self-deprecating voice, Chuck Hirsch recounts his journey with an emotional honesty and genuineness that will leave no reader untouched, and no diabetic unmotivated to help themselves.",
