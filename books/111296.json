  "title": "Dominoes: Part 2",
  "description": "The dominoes keep falling as this story winds its way to a midpoint and surprise when an unlikely character becomes a suspect in an ongoing investigation. Read on to learn what befalls Maeve, Jenna, Will, Laney, Horace, Sally, Ardina and others as Dominoes continues. All characters in this novel are fictional and any similarity to a living person is completely coincidental. Please note that all but the ending pages of this book were written in 2012, and the novel was copyrighted before the Supreme Court overruled California’s Proposition 8, therefore references to California’s marriage laws reflect conditions during the time period between the passage of Proposition 8 and the Supreme Court’s recent ruling.",
