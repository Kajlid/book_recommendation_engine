  "description": "Lord Devlin White, Duke of Winterbourne, is the last in a long line of powerful witches who assist the Demon Lord of London in keeping control of the Nightwalkers living amongst normal men. With all but one of his siblings gone to the new American colonies, his proud family line all but ended, Devlin is kept from gloom and despair by his friend Barra, and his unusual ward, Midnight.Neither alive nor dead, but a draugr caught somewhere in between, Midnight is content to spend his life at Devlin's side, though he longs for the day Devlin sees him as more than a ward. Then Devlin is summoned to solve a problem involving draugrâ€”a problem that threatens to take Midnight from him, and leave them and countless others dead if he cannot find a way to stop it.",
