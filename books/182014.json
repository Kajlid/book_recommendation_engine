  "description": "Ask Jesse Cruz how I died.  In life, Samantha Wheaton often got the last word—and not much has changed after her death. To find out what really happened to her sister, boundary witch Allison “Lex” Luther will travel to Los Angeles to talk to Cruz, the former LAPD detective who investigated the murder. When Jesse proves reluctant to talk, however, Lex must find more of the people connected to the Henry Remus case –including a young woman with a very ugly dog and very familiar powers.  As she searches for answers, Lex finds herself venturing deeper down a rabbit hole—one that may lead her to a big bad wolf.  Note: This story is set between Boundary Crossed and Boundary Lines.",
