So, he wondered, why was he now leading three of his friends through an old cemetery in the middle of the night?It was cold, and it was creepy, but his friends wanted to see a ghost. How could he disappoint them? As he sat his Ouija board at the base of an ancient tree, a tree thought to be the hanging tree of a witch, he began to wonder if this was such a good idea. He knew better. He’d had his fair share of ghosts and things that go bump in the night. He’d tried to put it behind him. He just wanted a normal life but normal just wasn’t in the cards.Dark Places is a cautionary tale of what can happen when innocent curiosity mixed with ignorance and fear open a doorway to a nightmare that seeps into the very core of your existence, settling deep within, and begins to fester.Can Sessy and his friends escape the ancient evil awakened in the cemetery, or will the darkness consume them? They should have heeded the chilling message from the spirit board, beware of dark places…",
