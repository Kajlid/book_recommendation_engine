  "title": "Haunted II",
  "description": "Have you ever heard a door creak open in the middle of the night when you knew everyone was sleeping? Is there a cold spot in your house that never seems to warm? Does it leave you with a feeling of dread every time you pass through it? Ghostly footsteps in your hallway, or maybe even whispering voices when you are home alone? This mini-novella is a collage of short stories about a few of the otherworldly encounters I've experienced. Although they are not movie worthy, you may find them interesting. All the stories are %100 true. Nothing has been added for dramatic effect.",
