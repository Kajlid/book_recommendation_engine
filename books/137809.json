  "description": "One Wild Night Wild Rush Prequel (Short Story) The first in a sexy, boundary-pushing New Adult series (Can be read before or after THIS WICKED RUSH, Wild Rush Book 1.) One night can change your life... \"Come on, Caitlin, let me help you get what you need.\" The way he says it, it’s about so much more than money. It’s about the way he makes my skin hot and my lips tingle, it’s about the way he makes my heart race and banishes the exhaustion that’s been my constant companion since I quit school to be a full-time surrogate parent. It’s about the flicker of hope he lights inside me. That flame isn’t much bigger than a candle right now, but I can sense how easy it would be for it to grow, to rise higher and higher until it sets my world on fire. I’m standing at the threshold of a moment that will change my life, and not necessarily for the better. I know that, I know it with everything in me, all the way down to the marrow of my bones. But still I nod. And take his hand. And let him lead me out into the night. Fans of Lauren Blakely and Jasinda Wilder will love the edgy, sexy, boundary-pushing Wild Rush series.
