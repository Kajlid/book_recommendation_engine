  "description": "I've never been one to follow the rules...or the law, for that matter. But when you find yourself behind bars and being offered the opportunity of a lifetime, you take it. I agreed to race motorcycles for Johnny Knight. A very powerful man who wanted me on his team, even knowing I was a liability. But will he still feel that way once he finds out that I had a one-night stand with his daughter? I didn't mean for it to happen. I didn't even know who she was until she walked into his office wearing my shirt from the night before. Too bad that was all she wanted-one night. It really didn't matter who she was, I wanted more. So when she ran, I followed. I should have let her go. That would have been best for both of us. But I have never done what was right, why start now? I've always been willing to take a risk, no matter what it would cost me. And I knew she was worth it all. I'm Erik Dashling, you can call me Dash. This is my story of how I willingly risked one dream for another. But everyone knows that now all dreams come true.",
