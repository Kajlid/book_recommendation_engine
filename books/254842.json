  "description": "A humorous take on women's fiction with just the right amount of romance and suspense to leave you wanting more...Single, thirty-something Emily Potens would just as soon stay on her couch with a pillow over her head than face what her life has become. In a downward spiral of misfortune, she’s lost everything she holds dear—her parents, her job, her home…even her cat. Falling through the porch of the decrepit sorority house at which she now works is only the icing on the cake. And then she meets Michael, with those deep blue eyes...Determined to start over, Emily throws herself into her new life. While learning the finer points of adulting, such as how to live on a budget and how to get a man that’s not gay, Emily begins to unravel the mystery surrounding her parents’ untimely death—the catalyst of her own misfortune. But as she gets closer, Emily must ask herself if she’s willing to risk her own life, and a new chance at love, to learn the truth. Because sometimes, digging up the past can have deadly consequences.",
