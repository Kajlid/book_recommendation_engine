  "description": "They say money can’t buy happiness. Quinn Jacobs wasn’t sure she agreed. After all, she had everything she needed — the perfect marriage, loads of cash, and not a care in the world. So, it never dawned on her that she’d end up in her current situation. Deceived and divorced. After being betrayed by her husband and best friend, Quinn has no choice but to pick herself up and move on. Tyson Reed might not have millions, but he’s got one thing money can’t buy. Loyalty. In the form of a large, loud, in-his-business family and dozens of friends. They’re all his, and he wouldn’t dream of changing that. The last thing Quinn needs is to hop into another relationship, but when Tyson shows up to install her new security system, she finds him irresistibly charming. As Quinn tries to find a way trust a man again, Tyson works to heal her battered heart. And as the sting of betrayal begins to fade, Quinn learns that loyalty is something that can never be bought.",
