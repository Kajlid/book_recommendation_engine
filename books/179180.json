  "description": "Jenny loves to house-sit, looking after a stranger's enviably perfect home and pretending to be someone elseâ€”just for a bit. Her latest booking is a beautiful, disheveled old rectory in the Home Counties owned by the uber-successful Lewis family. Freed of teaching duties for the summer, and her own teenagers spending time with her objectionable ex, Jenny readies herself for a life of walk-in larders and sparkling water taps. Battling to control the riotous family dog and stay cool in an unrelenting heat-wave, she discovers skeletons in the Lewis closet that further threaten to disrupt her idyll. But then a seductive new friendship offers her a surprise second to open herself up to love again and to finally live life on her own terms. Laugh-out-loud funny, touching, and romantic, this is the new summer novel from the much-loved Fiona Walker.",
