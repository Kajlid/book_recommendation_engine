  "description": "People can be mean but they only hate what they can’t have or the people they can’t be.  The quiet, small town of Higbee is the perfect place to see the upcoming Northern Lights. People from all over the country are flocking in droves to see the brilliant cosmic show as the town celebrates this remarkable event.  Levi Lennox’s entire life has been spent in Higbee and it hasn’t been easy. Raised by difficult parents, his time in school was spent acting out, and earning the respect of his peers. As an adult, he’s tried to better himself, earning a living as the town’s electrician, due partly to the Xenaki’s help.  Alexander Xenaki returns after ten years to speak at Higbee’s festival honoring the Aurora Borealis. Always a target of high school bullying he finds himself haunted by bitter memories. All he wants is to be as gone from Higbee as fast as possible.  He’s stunned and embittered to find that Levi, his worst tormentor, regularly visits his parents. Worse yet, the crush he had on Levi hasn’t faded, but neither has his anger. Thrust together inadvertently, secrets are revealed and they must both face past mistakes, and perhaps build a better future for themselves.",
