  "description": "After leaving the hippie commune she grew up on, Summer Rains set a modest goal for herself: earn enough money to live a normal life in the real world. \tMaybe she was aiming too high.When she wished she could get rid of the platinum-selling pop star who was stalking her, she didn’t mean ‘get rid of’ in the permanent sense. But someone did. And being a suspect isn’t the kind of attention she wants from the gorgeous-but-entirely-too-condescending detective investigating the case. As if that wasn’t bad enough, her only help comes from the man she’s been in love with since her hormones kicked in…and his beautiful girlfriend.Sounds like a good time to reassess her goals. ‘Living a normal life’ moves down the list, and ‘figuring out who the real murderer is before she gets thrown in jail’ moves all the way to the top.But crime-fighting wasn’t part of the home-schooling curriculum back on the commune. So solving the case is an on-the-job kind of thing. Along the way, she learns other skills—how to fold hospital corners, how to keep herself from becoming the next victim, and how to deal with all the insanity of the ‘real world’.*** This novel is a fun comedic-mystery, similar in tone to the books of Janet Evanovich, Meg Cabot, and Stephanie Bond. It is not paranormal romance or dark urban fantasy.
