  "description": "Joyce wrote the first draft of a work he called Stephen Hero between 1901 and 1906, but was dissatisfied and later wrote and developed it. He partially destroyed this version in a fit of rage when it was turned down by a publisher, and again rewrote the work in the form in which it was finally published in 1916 as A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.",
