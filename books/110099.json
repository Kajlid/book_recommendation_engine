  "description": "Casper Best first met Bailey Ulrikson through mutual friends back in Buffalo over a year ago, though she barely remembers. She was too busy with her own boyfriend to care. Oh how times have changed.Feeling disconnected from friends and family during the first few months at Rutgers University, Bailey is out of her element for the first time in her blemish-free life. When her family comes to visit, her little brother insists on attending Medieval Ages Feast and Tournament for his birthday. A Theatre major, Bailey is mortified to be going, but relents to please him. A chance encounter with a dashing young knight pulls her out of her numb state of depression. Initially embarrassed, she soon laps up the attention until she realizes the knight is none other than Casper Best, the dirtbag friend of a friend from Buffalo. Her dreamy illusion of chivalry shatters and Bailey’s sensible, practical side wins the battle for love – temporarily. Casper is persistent and ever gallant in his attempts to court the fair Bailey’s heart. Avoiding his abusive home life, Casper submerses himself in all things medieval, resorting to knightly tactics and Shakespearean sonnets to gain her favor. But Bailey is far from a willing participant...until she realizes how fragile Casper is beneath his shining armour.",
