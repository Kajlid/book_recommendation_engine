  "title": "Crossing the Boundary: The Early Years in My Cricketing Life",
  "description": "Described by the media as \"the David Beckham of cricket\" and regularly gracing the tabloids and broadsheets alike with his trademark hairstyle and vibrant personality, Kevin is fast becoming the poster boy for English cricket. But he is also in possession of a prodigious talent—fearless, bold, and with unflappable nerves. His unique batting style has produced hundreds of runs and many outstanding innings for his county and country this summer, culminating in his extraordinary triumph at The Ashes. Recounting Kevin's remarkable journey so far—from growing up in his native South Africa to the opposition he faced from his national cricket board, from his move to England and his career at Hampshire to winning a place on the England team—this book provides a rare insight into the mind of an international cricketer, on and off the pitch. Told with wit, intelligence, and attitude, this memoir reveals the riveting story of a young, hugely talented star who helped England win their 1st Ashes in 18 years.",
