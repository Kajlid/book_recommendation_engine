  "description": "Matt sells sex because he has to take care of his little brother, Sam, and, while it sucks, it’s not that much different from the abuse he'd endured that he was a teenager. He’s exhausting himself trying to keep them together and out of the greedy jaws of the foster care system. When he ‘meets’ Kevin, things start looking up. Kevin’s not the first john to give Matt the maybe this could work outside of work vibe, but Matt is surprisingly hopeful, for once. On the other hand, it’s really not a good time to be meeting someone. He has a new \"job\" exchanging his services for Sam's tuition at a fancy boarding school. People who treat him badly either end up murdered or disappear. And Kevin’s just a little too perfect. He's rich, generous, and an all-round-blowjob-genie-in-a-bottle. Something’s got to be wrong with the guy. Nothing much, really. Kevin’s only a prince of the fae. And, hey, Matt just might be Kevin's king. Uh, king? And the questions keep piling up. Why is a rich man taking a bus on a snowy December night? Why does Kevin disappear at the same bus stop where a man who had been bothering Matt is found murdered? And most importantly, why does Kevin keep acting like it’s Matt who will leave, when it’s Matt who’s the broken one?",
