  "description": "The philosopher faced with the mutually exclusive choice between moral principle and the survival of your family, which is the correct path?Philosophers love to pose such questions, and in the day-to-day struggle, such thinkers rarely attain to a level of relevance rivaling that of the simple hunger pang. Their careful considerations dissipate under the leveled gun. We do not feel their disapproving gaze when The Others draw near.When the world sends doom, the survivors do not hesitate. The survivors do what is necessary.",
