  "description": "He is Renault, Merlin’s unofficial leader of his spy network. Refined. Loyal. Tenacious. Resourceful. Cunning. Mercurial. Deadly and sadistic, he’s as complicated as he is cruel and remorseless. He’s also the only hope Merlin has when it comes to doing the impossible. His current mission: rescue General Crixus of the Sandanistas aboard a train that has been commandeered by about seventy Sene-Gaulian soldiers.  For him and his deadly crew, it should be a fairly straightforward objective- at least it would have been if half his crew hadn’t sold him out. With his objective at stake, the lives of several innocent people on the line as well as the lives of his loyal brethren, Renault has little choice. He must push headlong into a difficult mission that now has become an impossible one.  When a deadly enemy from his past resurfaces to settle an old debt, his position becomes even more precarious. In an unbelievable act of charity, he has created a haven for the unfortunate- but that haven has also been breached. Just what will become of those innocent souls? With an elite group of assassins on his tail, half of his men gunning for him and an army at his doorstep, just what is the greatest spy in Round Table history to do?",
