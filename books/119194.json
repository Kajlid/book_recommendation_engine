Pushed to his absolute excellence, Linc felt the real path for him was different than his parents’ hopes and dreams. On the most important night of his father’s reelection, Linc makes a choice that will lead to a lifetime of regret. Deciding to start a new life, he and his best friend, Daulton, purchase a rundown tattoo shop called Cursed Magic. While restoring Cursed Magic, Linc’s faith in life is put to the test in more ways than one. Faced with the horrors of the bleak, starless nights and the women that come and go, he decides to give up all together, until one fateful night with a stranger. Will one night shape his future forever? Can he turn the Curse he’s endured into a blessing even though all odds are against him?",
