  "description": "No one promised Dianne Brennan that her volunteer work as a foster home for Rottweiler Rescue would be easy. And no one warned her that the job would be murderously hard! Yet murder is what Dianne faces when she takes a dog to his new home, finds the adopter dead, and sees the killer leaving the scene. Worse, although Dianne cannot identify the killer, he begins stalking her with deadly intent. The sheriff's investigators in Douglas County, Colorado, are convinced the killer is a member of the victim's family. Dianne is sure he will be found where the victim worked - in the world of dog shows and dog people. Can she keep herself and her dogs safe long enough to prove she is right? Can Dianne and her Rottweilers collar the killer?",
