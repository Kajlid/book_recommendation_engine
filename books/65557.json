  "description": "Lily Hamilton has only one thing on her survival. Unexpectedly, her world turns upside down and fills itself with the kind of monsters from a horror flick. She's doing just fine on her own, but four people she believed to be dead suddenly turn up on her doorstep.  For a while, things seem to be almost-normal. But when Lily is uprooted from everything she's ever known, she has to rely on the skills her dad taught her when she was a kid.  But has everything been one horrible lie?  Tayler Wright grew up reading books, writing stories, and racing dirt bikes, all of which she still does today. When she isn't doing those things, she's spending time with friends and family and going to college. \"The Outbreak\" is her first completed novel.",
