  "description": "12-year-old Elliott Harkness wants nothing more than to join his family as part of the Freedom Force, the world’s greatest super-hero team. There’s only one problem, he’s a “Zero,” that’s super-speak for powerless. Frequently abandoned by his crime-fighting family, teased by his older super-sister, and picked on at school, Elliott is miserably ordinary in his heroically extraordinary family.All of that changes when a mysterious new girl comes to town. She believes Elliott is far from ordinary. In fact, she thinks Elliott is the only one capable of capturing a strange and powerful orb that crash-landed on Earth before it falls into the wrong hands. To succeed, Elliott will have to do more than just find the orb. He’ll have to fend off menacing supervillains, face globe-conquering aliens, and figure out who’s truly on his side. But when Elliott realizes he’s the planet’s last hope, will he find the power within himself to be the epic hero he’s always wanted to be? Or, will he always be just an Epic Zero?",
