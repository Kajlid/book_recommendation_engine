  "description": "It is said that the greater moments of our lives become treasure within our memory. And for those fortunate enough to maintain a healthy gift of recollection, that treasure is certain. Yet as is often the case, age and at times, disease, denies that gift. For that reason I journeyed from my residence in Argentina, South America to Hot Springs, Virginia, to the place I once called home.Lorena Nelson will turn 92 this December, 2015. She is the woman who taught me the difference between right and wrong, who kept me dry, fed and warm, and whom I imagined would always regard me as the son she adores. Yet, with my mother’s faltering memory, I feared it was just a matter of time before the early years we shared would soon evaporate from her mind like a warm breath against cold glass.Subsequently I set out to spend a week in Virginia, documenting my days with this lovely lady in a tender photo essay I refer to as my “Last Visit Home.” This touching, honest and relevant piece depicts the raw beauty and bittersweet moments that were passed between us – highlighting details that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.This pictorial tribute will resonate with anyone whose lives have been shaped in one way or another by a parent, relative or friend whose memory may be starting to falter.http://lastvisithome.com/home/",
