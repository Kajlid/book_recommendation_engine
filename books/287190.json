  "description": "A stolen glance across a darkened restaurant. A kiss under the Italian moon. A proposition I never would have made in my former life. Our story began just like all fairy tales do...Once upon a time.Once upon a time, a mysterious, passionate man opened my eyes to things I'd been blind to, my heart to feelings I never thought imaginable, my mind to endless possibilities.Once upon a time, I experienced something I didn't think existed in real life.Once upon a time, I learned how to fly.Little did I know it was with broken wings. How can we have a future when he’s still tormented by his past?How can I give him my heart when experience tells me to keep it guarded?How can I still love a man who would lie to me so recklessly?They say life is simply a series of roads, each fork a decision that can change everything. For the first time, I’m faced with a decision of my own. Do I stay in the clouds with Dante? Or do I return to the safety of the ground? Only fate knows the answer…",
