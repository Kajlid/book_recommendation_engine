  "description": "'By seeing fertility issues through the eyes of 23 real women, it will show you that you're not alone and help you to make the decisions about treatment that are right for you. It's an infertility lifeline.' Emma Cannon, Fertility Expert. 'I don't know how long you've been trying for a baby, which fertility investigations or treatments you've had, or what your chances are of getting pregnant. You could be thinking about having IVF. You might be a veteran IVF-er who's had multiple cycles, or you may be just starting out on your first cycle. Whatever your situation, this book is for you. If I think back, I can still feel the feelings of inadequacy, shame and loneliness that I felt when I couldn't get pregnant. That was my motivation for writing this book, and the 22 amazing women's stories and experiences -- and mine -- that will help you cope with every key moment and decision you may face along the way. Hopefully, this book will show that, for every desperate moment, and heart-breaking test result, or difficult decision you face, someone has probably been there before. And she's here -- and happy -- to share her story.' Brigid.",
