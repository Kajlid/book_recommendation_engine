  "description": "Hold onto your hats. You’re not in Kansas anymore. You’re inside the mind of the Shadow of Oz. Dorothy, a young girl with a natural talent for the dark arts, has been pushed beyond her breaking point. When she finds herself in the fantasy world of Oz, her daunting task is to free all the kingdoms ruled by cruel, overbearing leaders--or so she thinks. Her rise to great power may be nothing more than a descent into madness after experiencing the unimaginable. She is forced to find the most unlikely allies and use her new-found magic to destroy evil before it wakes up and destroys her for good. All the favorite Oz characters are here, re-imagined in new dark and horrific ways. New characters come to life in a way never portrayed in the movie. Come visit a world that's so familiar, yet dark and twisted into something altogether different. You'll never look at the Wizard of Oz the same way again.This is not the story from your childhood. This is not the bright-eyed innocent Dorothy Gale as portrayed by Judy Garland. This is a story of abuse, tragedy, depression, and the lengths a person will go for the ones they love.",
