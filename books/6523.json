  "title": "Beautiful Sins: Olivia Lowery",
  "description": "My name is Olivia Lowery. I’m a wealthy socialite residing outside of the Dark Coast, on the Upper East Side no less. I’m beautiful, I’m privileged and I can have just about any guy that I want. That is… until the morning of my sixteenth birthday. That’s when I discovered something different about myself. When I got up that morning and looked in my fancy antique vanity mirror; my eyes were different… But what I didn’t realize was the meaning behind it, and how it would change my life forever. I’m not human, this much I know. I have the ability to lift full-sized taxi cabs with the lift of a single finger, I can jump out of eighteen story buildings and land with minor scratches. My senses are intensified. I anticipate danger before it happens and my reflexes are flawless. I keep teleporting to a girl I’ve never met; and the worst part is, she looks exactly like me. With my vile step-brother as my Seeker, and assistant; together we will save her.",
