  "description": "What do you get when you mix Tequila with a house full of rowdy Fraternity brothers who have no boundaries? A cucumber, a pink thong, and a bottle of lube. Oh yeah, and super glue. There is always super glue…  Parties, drinking, and plenty of mornings where you can’t remember what you did the night before...that was my life.  Yet, there was one memory that lingered in my mind. Ten minutes in the woods with Palmer that got too intense to ignore.  But ten minutes with her wasn’t enough. It would never be enough.  She’s a force, one that swept in unexpectantly, knocked me on my ass and left me with an intense craving. Palmer tried to fight it with every fiber in her being, but I could see the desire in her eyes. That curiosity that lived inside of her, wondering what it would be like if she just gave in...again.  I had to convince her that our time together wasn’t a mistake. That she wants me as much as I want her. We share a connection, a bond, that has changed me in ways I never expected. She saved me. And to think…  It all started with Just One Kiss.",
