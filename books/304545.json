Guacamole is such an easy and delightful dish to make that serves a large group of people. In a fun gathering, if you place a bowl of guacamole with few chips on the side, the conversation would be as smooth as your guacamole. Traditionally guacamole is in a smooth texture, but in modern time for catering to different peopleâ€™s desires, chefs invented a chunky version of guacamole. Playing with different ingredients in the kitchen is what makes this dish very interesting. You can use any herbs, spices, fruits or vegetables like cucumber, bell pepper, jalapeno in your guacamole.
