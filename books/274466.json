  "description": "It takes a certain amount of darkness to be aware of the light.  The quiet, small town of Higbee is the perfect place to see the upcoming Northern Lights. People from all over the country are flocking in droves to see the brilliant cosmic show as the town celebrates this remarkable event.  Matthew Cole has a reputation as a respectable, hardworking business owner and he’d like to keep it that way. In a town where the pace of change is slow, and the people are close, he brushes off questions about his love life, and gossip about when he’s going to settle down and find a wife. Matthew however, can’t bring himself to tell the town that it’s not a wife he wants.  That all changes when aspiring artist, Skye, comes to town to see the Northern Lights. Arriving ahead of his friends to find a prime spot to view the display, an accident sees him staying on Matthew’s couch. Skye’s vibrant, liberal attitude sits poorly with the reserved and conservative Matthew until the two of them find their growing bond brings feelings that could ruin everything Matthew has worked hard for.  As the time for the Northern Lights approaches, both men will have to face not only their growing feelings for one another but the consequences of choosing love.",
