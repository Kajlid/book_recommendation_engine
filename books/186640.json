  "title": "Untangled: A story of resilience, courage, and triumph",
  "description": "A story of resilience, courage, and triumph  Recalling her life, the author takes us deep into the inter-generational ritualistic abuse and mind control programming that led to her being sent overseas on an impossible mission.  She repressed the memories of her past until a family tragedy forced her to face what her life had been. A history of abuse, torture, and threats to maintain her silence or be killed, could no longer be denied.  This is the story of facing the truth and risking the consequences of breaking the silence. The author learns to accept the effects of the trauma that echo through her daily life as PTSD.  Through years of self-exploration she learns to live her life fearlessly, with eyes wide open. Ultimately this book is about resilience; hope for victims who have suffered trauma and for the people who support them.",
