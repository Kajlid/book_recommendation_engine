  "description": "Emily Dickinson is one of the world's best known and most widely read poets, though at the time of her death in 1886, only seven of her more than 1000 poems had been published. But shortly thereafter, the genius of her work was recognized and it has since received wide and consistent acclaim. Her verse - noted for its style, wit and bold and startling imagery - has greatly influenced the direction of 20th-century poetry. The 112 poems in this collection are taken from the definitive Johnson edition of her work and are accompanied by 65 pencil drawings, created especially for the book by Ferris Cook.",
