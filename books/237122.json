  "description": "Healing My Life focuses not on the details of the author’s abuse, but on the steps, she took to build a life of meaning and beauty. It’s the kindness of this storytelling that is so striking. Jenson does not pretend to speak on behalf of all survivors, but she clearly speaks to all survivors. This book is not prescriptive, not a “how-to” guide to overcoming trauma, but a detailed account of what helped Jenson, how and why she came to learn new tools for introspection and growth, and where any person could find them, should they have an interest. This book firmly says, “If I can do it, so can you,” and reading her words, she compels you to believe them. It offers a guide for survivors of sexual abuse to see themselves as whole, and validated in their choices to build a life outside the structures of their abuse. The joy Jenson has for the life she has built is apparent on every page, and with every new page, that joy transforms into hope and gratitude. Healing My Life will speak to anyone who has tried to heal, who wants to heal, or who has begun to heal their own lives. Jenson not only offers readers the understanding of a friend but helps them to understand themselves.\"Healing My Life\" is a story that is unique and personal in its detail, yet also universal and human in its impact.” -Gloria Steinem“Everyone who has survived childhood sexual abuse is stronger knowing each other’s journey. By eloquently sharing hers, Donna reminds us of a simple truth: we can heal.” -Marilyn Vanderbur, Miss America 1958, who survived incest",
