The Council of Nine rebuilt civilization on the backs of Sparks, offering citizens a comfortable life in a relo-city in exchange for power, particularly over the children able to fuel the future. The strongest of the boys are taken as Wards and raised to become elite agents, the Council’s enforcers and spies. Strong girls—those who could advance the rapidly-evolving matrilineal power—don’t exist. Not according to the Council.Lena Gracey died as a child, mourned publicly by parents desperate to keep her from the Council. She was raised in hiding until she fled the relo-city for solitary freedom in the desert. Lena lives off the grid, selling her power on the black market.

He’s leading the next generation of agents in a secret revolution to destroy those in power from within.The life Lena built to escape her past ends the day Alex arrives looking for a renegade Spark.CONTENT WARNING: This book contains occasional violence and profanity, and includes depictions of a determined double agent doing his job and an empowered young woman making coming-of-age decisions.
