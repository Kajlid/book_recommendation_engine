  "title": "Earth Horizon",
  "description": "Mary Austin published her autobiography in 1932 near the end of her long and creative career. Earth Horizon is both an account of her personal life and of her development as a writer. As always true to her special individualism, she wrote this book sometimes in the first person voice and sometimes in the third person. Using this literary device enabled her to speak frankly about her life while also commenting on the events and decisions that formed and influenced her life and writing. Earth Horizon is not only unique in its approach but brings a special psychological interest to the subject of autobiography.",
