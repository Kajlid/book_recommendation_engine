  "title": "Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc by Mark Twain, Fiction, Classics",
  "description": "Twain, aware of his reputation as a comic, asked that each installment appear anonymously so that readers will treat the piece seriously. Originally, this novel was published as a serialization in Harper's Magazine beginning in April 1895. Regardless, his authorship soon became known and the book edition published by Harper and Brothers in May 1896 credited Mark Twain. The novel is presented as a translation (by \"Jean Francois Alden\") of memoirs by Louis de Conte, a fictionalized version of Joan of Arc's page, Louis de Contes. \"I like Joan of Arc best of all my books; and it is the best; I know it perfectly well. And besides, it furnished me seven times the pleasure afforded me by any of the others; twelve years of preparation, and two years of writing. The others need no preparation and got none.\" -- Mark Twain",
