But put on the brakes! Now it's time to start all over again at page one and start the revision process. Most writers dread this stage. Thankfully, Jim's book will give them techniques to use during the initial writing phase that will minimize the amount of revision that's required, as well as guidelines for editing what remains and positioning the work for the best possible odds of a sale. New sections devoted to selling the work once it's finished. Downloadable worksheets and checklists that make keeping track of and executing revision goals easy and productive.",
