  "description": "Long ago, God set Watchmen on Jerusalem's walls to keep vigil and sound the battle cry when evil approached. Time cannot touch these vigilant intercessors and thus they do not age. Raphael is one such Watchman who must intercede and save a young woman from her demons. Heaven and hell battle for her soul, for her destiny is to save her people from great destruction. The saga continues with this second episode of Hadassah's Watchman.",
