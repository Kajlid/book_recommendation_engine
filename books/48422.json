  "description": "This edition is no longer available Brent Kelly was a laid-back tradesman, whose only concerns were drinks with friends and which man to bed next. In need of a new accountant to sort out his shoebox of receipts, he's referred to Logan Willis, a quiet spoken, science-fiction loving geek. He didn't expect the geeky guy with an English accent and dark-rimmed glasses, wearing a TARDIS-blue shirt to be so intriguing.He didn't expect to be fascinated by him, let alone attracted to him. He most certainly didn't expect to fall in love.From jock to geek, both men know the differences between them are vast. But in this opposites-attract erotic drama, maybe it wasnâ€™t the differences between them that would drive them apart. Maybe it was the differences between them that made it worth the fight.",
