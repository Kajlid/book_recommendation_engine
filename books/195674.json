  "description": "It's the 1930s. A small house in Bengal houses a shadow. Chhaya is the youngest daughter in a family that doesn't want her. Shunned for her gender and dark skin, she has no choice but to conceal her feelings. Imprison herself. Shackle herself into a life that has no proper outlet for emotion, whether it be sadness, joy, or unrepentant rage.An unexpected marriage to a stranger turns Chhaya's life around. Suddenly, she is wanted, loved, and cherished. Arun is a man with the patience and the vision to understand that Chhaya is much more than the darkness for which she is named. Most importantly, however, Arun is able to coax Chhaya out of her prison. Slowly. Gently. But the world is an unruly place. War and famine bring heartache to Chhaya, Arun, and their family.The ancient goddess Kali is a symbol of destruction and creation. Chhaya has always been drawn to this symbol of power. And it is this power that calls to her. As the trials of an already difficult life become even more taxing, something awakens in Chhaya. Something terrible. Something unimaginable. Chhaya always believed she was cursed. Which begs the question: is she?Editorial Review:\"Awakening Kali is a sad tale, beautifully told with deep compassion and understanding. It is a tale that will make readers ponder the sometimes devastating effects of social injustice, gender bias, and cultural bondage. The author exposes the tragic impact of mental illness on sufferers and their loved ones in a tale that is deeply evocative â€• a novel you will struggle to put down.Lorraine Cobcroft, Reviewer for Readers' Favorite",
