When Jiro, a sexy Japanese man, walks into the community center where she teaches children to draw and paint, he takes her breath away. While Jiro promises if Kiara comes to him, he will never hurt her, he is also used to man-woman relationships from his culture, and Kiara doesn't understand the rules. On top of that, he is a cold-blooded assassin, and refuses to change. How can Kiara love a man as unyielding as Jiro coming from the experience she leaves behind?",
