  "description": "Siri Mitchell’s insightful, funny chick–lit style shines in this story of putting up walls and tearing them down—all for love. Jackie Harrison, a computer administrator at the Air Force Academy, is a self–proclaimed geek who must share her cubicle space with the new guy, instructor and former pilot Joe Gallagher. She turns to her online journal to vent and eventually to express growing feelings toward this office neighbor who is everything she is not—fun, happy, and social. But when her blog is featured as a top pick on primetime news, everyone reads it—including Joe. Will he figure out the words of adoration and confusion are written about him? And will Jackie ever risk expressing her heart offline?",
