  "description": "THE CURSE OF THE WINKLEVOSS TWINS is a young adult fantasy novel and book #2 in the (after)life lessons series.  Death is optional.  Communicating with spirits may be normal for some people, but forcing a spirit back into a body is downright creepy. Hair-raising abilities aside, bringing her boyfriend back to life doesn’t come close to crowning Jules Winklevoss the most dramatic in her family, which is prone to headline-grabbing feuds and life-or-death spectacles.  Jules’s mother and grandmother are always at odds. Her grandmother enforces law and discipline, while Jules's mother is touted as the Great Liberator of the Downtrodden for exposing the spirit-seeing community’s embarrassing secrets.  The downtrodden may not be grateful when these secrets strike a nerve with the elusive evil spirit, Machiavelli. If the High Spirit Advisory Council is unable to prepare proper defenses, Vita Post Mortem Academy students are not only helpless, but Machiavelli’s first target. Jules and an unusual crew will need to band together if they have a shot at saving the school.",
