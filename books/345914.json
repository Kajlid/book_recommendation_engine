  "description": "Inspired by true events, this story interweaves the lives of several families living traditional lives in the heart of Africa, and shows the disturbing impact of dogmatic tradition and superstition on individuals and communities. Children are forced to marry men older than their fathers; two, three or even more wives is considered normal, and have to vie for their husband's attention; women are burnt to death because of a rumor that they might be witches; albinos are targeted and killed, their body parts taken for black magic. Since the government has not been able to stop these crimes it is left in the hands of the affected individuals, particularly the women, to take matters into their own hands. But with little cooperation among themselves, can anyone truly make a difference?",
