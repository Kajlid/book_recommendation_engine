  "description": "Delving further into the O'Drake family as the curse and its eventual end plays through, the focus follows more of Marie and Marcella's history. A reunion of Marie with her wayward daughter BlowingWind draws closer, as does young Jewel's place in the complicated tapestry. Ryu really has his work cut out for him, but what is a lonely dragon kami to do... other than attempt to figure out how to restore the brightness that once was... Even after lifting the O'Drake curse, BlowingWind will still have much to do.",
