  "title": "Bringing Back the Magic: A Transformational Memoir",
  "description": "Transformational memoir about how Margaret Wright worked through a phobic childhood; and with the help of the many animal companions in her life, she transformed into a powerful advocate for their well-being and welfare. Her adult connection with her African Grey parrots opened her mind and heart to see nature from a new perspective. Maggie Wright walks the reader through a profound way of seeing nature's critters as the true individuals that they are. It is not just a memoir about Margaret T. Wright's relationship with her animals, but it also tackles difficult issues that all animal owners will be facing over the next few years: ANIMAL OWNERSHIP versus ANIMAL GUARDIANSHIP. Maggie explains WHY she believes animal OWNERS must be owners and NOT GUARDIANS. There are many fun stories in the book, such as when Maggie and Merlin Tewillager, her African Grey parrot, went to visit Dr. Pepperberg and Alex the Grey. Bringing Back the Magic is about love. It's about remembering the magic of childhood and bringing it back into our lives. It's about loving our animals and protecting their welfare. You'll want to hug this book because it comes so deeply from the heart!",
