  "title": "Do No Harm?: Munchhausen Syndrome by Proxy",
  "description": "Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy is the syndrome that causes parents and care workers to harm their children to get attention. Many families are separated after its diagnosis. But has the fertile imagination of social workers and the public turned MSBP into the “trendy” disorder of our time? McGill traces the 25-year history of the disorder and examines high profile cases from six countries. He produces compelling stories from parents and care workers and asks what can be done to protect parents from being wrongly accused.",
