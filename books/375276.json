  "description": "Gabriel Panlong has seen a lot over the centuries but nothing prepares him for the sight of two gorgeous men having sex up against an alley wall in broad daylight. Instantly turned on by the men and the scene before him, he feels guilty for watching such an intimate act. Gabriel walks away, only to hear the sounds of a struggle and smell the sweet scent of blood. Hurrying back, Gabriel hopes the two little hot men he saw are okay. Instead he walks into five large men beating the two men he longed to join. Dealing with his mounting desire is the least of Gabriel's problems. Learning that Neil and Ryan were part of an underground slavering and the abuse they suffered, it's no wonder they don't trust Gabriel. But can he help heal them as they heal him of centuries of loneliness?[Menage Amour Erotic Alternative Menage a Trois Romance, M/M/M, Dragon Shape-Shifter]",
