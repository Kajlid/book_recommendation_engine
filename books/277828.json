  "description": "He wanted immmortality - Marco Visconti longed to become a powerful sorcerer, able to command the elements and wield incredible power. At the tender age of 15, he ran away from home and started down a dark, dangerous path to a live of crime and infamy. But one fateful night, running for his life, he got much more than he had bargained for... She was waiting for Romeo - Kassie Antonescu thought her dream had come true when she met Marco, the sexy, charismatic lead singer of a new local rock band. She was ready to be swept off her feet by a man who was everything her mother had warned her about...except that her mother hadn't told her about vampires... A love worth dying for - When a girl is this madly in love, she tends to overlook the little things...like the fact that he only sees her at night...he never eats...he casts no reflection in a mirror...and those wolf howls he does sound awfully convincing... Everyone knows vampires aren't real - or are they?",
