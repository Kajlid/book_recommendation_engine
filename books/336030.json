  "description": "Some hurts change the course of your life forever, but with the devoted attention of an older Daddy, can a boy become comfortable enough in his own skin to hold on tight to the life he deserves? As the last boy left from the original crew of waiters at The Tap Tavern searching for his Daddy, Archie’s filled with nervous excitement. And a little dread. Okay, he’s scared to death. He’s never been able to get past the kissing portion of a date before he tenses up and ruins everything. What man is going to want to deal with that? Maybe it’s time to admit that what happened to him as a pre-teen has broken him forever. Detective Hutchinson, Hutch to his friends, has decided that he might as well just live for work. After years of searching for the perfect sub, his tastes have changed, leaving him clueless to what he wants or whom he’s searching for. When their paths collide, Hutch is intrigued by the brave young man who doesn’t realize how strong he is. Archie is infatuated with the older man, but knows he can’t possibly hold the attention of someone so capable and put together. Honestly, he wouldn’t even know where to begin. Can Hutch convince Archie that his innocence isn’t the deterrent he thinks it is, and that he would be honored to give him the tender loving care that he needs? Welcome to another heartwarming story from The Tap Tavern, where this new Daddy is willing to roll up his sleeves and put in the work to prove to his boy how very special he is. * This book contains references to past sexual abuse of a minor.
