  "description": "When passionate Professor Conner Devlin meets oversexed student Emma Fiore, the sparks ignite: he'll train her to be his classroom sex slave, carrying out his every desire, while she gets to experience the forbidden pleasure of submissive love before her marriage to a dull and unfeeling man. But Emma's sizzling and insatiable desires soon overwhelm Conner and he finds himself hopelessly in love with his young submissive. Emma accepts him as her sexual Master, but will she have him as her real-life lover? Through the means of BDSM and the demands of extreme sex, Conner tries to break down the barriers between them and make Emma acknowledge her feelings, until one night things become too real and the games are forgotten. Conner takes Emma prisoner for real and their passions erupt in a cataclysm of raw emotion that rocks them both and fuses them in a transcendent love.Told with intense honesty from the dominant's point of view, A Good Student gives a rare and searing look inside a man-s heart as he's caught in the throes of a compelling and overwhelming love and passion, all his thoughts and feelings exposed. Listening to Conner's confessions is like having your own personal Master tell you everything he feels, with a poet's skill and a therapist's insight. You-ll never look at the dynamics of D/s and a man's sexuality the same way again.",
