  "description": "The people of the land of Capriath once were free. There had always been a social order, a gentry, and a monarchy. For centuries, Capriath had remained peaceful. However, when the Sorceress Aubrielle Calett murdered her parents and seized the throne, everything changed. She enslaved her subjects, raised the dead into an army using black magic, and cast the land of Capriath in darkness. Kagan Greyrose was a normal Capriathan before she discovered that she is the keeper of the Garnestone, a stone rumored to give power, immortality, and ultimate authority to its rightful vessel. Unfortunately for Kagan, the tyrannical Empress Calett has been searching for the Garnestone for years and is determined to execute anyone who stands between her and eternal power. In order to end the Empressâ€™s tyranny, Kagan must align herself with the most unlikely of allies and learn to accept her destiny.",
