  "description": "For Jessa Carson, defeat is not an option. The beautiful and fiery forty-three-year-old CEO of Carson Properties, she'll do anything to win, especially when it comes to her career. Until she meets Hunter Jensen, heir of Jensen Enterprises, the rival company. When a battle of wills ensues over a property they both desire, one that can either destroy or fulfill their respective dreams, an unexpected romance ignites between them. With the help of Ronnie and Simi, her two best friends since their days at Harvard, Jessa is forced to choose between potential love or certain victory. Hunter is domineering, a trait she finds both thrilling and infuriating, but he's also kind and charitable. He's her match, in more ways than one, but he's also her competition. All is fair in love and war, and with Jessa's dreams on the line, this is most certainly a battle to the end.",
