  "title": "Bunny Suits of Death: Tales of a CSI",
  "description": "As the newest Crime Scene Investigator for the Wichita Police Department, East Coast transplant Laura Merz finds herself out of her comfort zone and completely unprepared for the human dramas and comedies she encounters with each shift she works. She quickly learns that real life CSI work is nothing like what they show on television or what she studied in graduate school.She dusts for fingerprints, photographs bloody Klingon weapons, and desperately tries not to fall off the chair in her first court appearance. Merz also grows to understand the dangers of empathy and why police officers often have a tough exterior. Along the way, she cobbles together a quirky group of friends to help her cope with the daily dose of human failings she witnesses each time she puts on her uniform.From her first crime scene where she is forced to confront the death of a young gang member to scenes where burglars are reported to leave sex toys behind as parting gifts, Merz discovers hilarity and heartbreak are often intertwined. Bunnysuits provides a much needed bridge between dramatic crime novels and purely scientific texts.Written by a Special Agent from NCIS",
