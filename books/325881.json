  "description": "Forced to leave her foster home, seventeen-year-old Kyra takes off in the middle of the night. Only one problem: she didn't realize she was going straight into werewolf territory until it was too late. As if trying to fit into the pack wasn't challenging enough, she also has to survive her family of hunters constantly chasing her, waiting to pounce. But what happens when she starts developing feelings for the unpredictable lone wolf, who despite being ridiculously attractive, isn't her mate? ~~~ He sighed, throwing his head in his hands. “You’re not like us, Ky. You’re… one of them.”His words did absolutely nothing to clear my confusion.“What the hell are you talking about?” my voice was getting louder and he immediately shushed me.“The other day, we got a call from the agency we adopted you from. They found something in your file,” he rambled.The agency? Why on earth would they be interested in checking my file after all these years?“Listen just, just go, okay? I can’t help you more than that. Here, take my wallet. I’ll say you stole it. Don’t ever show up here again, alright?” he said, reaching into his pockets and handing me a small leather wallet.",
