  "description": "“Welcome to the Ashbury Estate, where the air you breathe is pure madness.\"Ainsley Reynolds, only weeks away from her eighteenth birthday, is summoned by the organization known as Malus Navis to expel a cluster of demons mimicking the ghosts of children in a renovated Southern estate. With the help of Alec Graham, the handsome homicide detective from Locklyn, North Carolina, and Kyle Drekr, the celebrity host of an international paranormal television show, Ainsley and her group face a new kind of threat - visitors and paranormal investigators are going mad and offing themselves within the walls of the Ashbury. Still new to her gift, Ainsley must find a way to defeat the growing horde of Muladach while facing the trials of being a teenager falling in love, and learning that being a Christian is more than lip service. The Ashbury will either pull Ainsley and Alec closer together or drive a wedge between them - and leave Ainsley relying solely on her God. If you like stories about murder, mysteries, demons, and first loves, you won’t want to miss The Maddening, Book 2 of the Muladach Series! Keep an eye out for more in The Beacon, Book 3 of the Muladach Series, available Summer 2021. **BONUS for those in the Ainsley and Alec ship: The first chapter of The Beacon is included at the end of The Maddening!!**",
