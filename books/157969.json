  "description": "Jack Carter is in the fast lane\nA devilishly handsome man of many talents, Jack manages the Desert Sons clubhouse as its Vice-President and plays it fast and loose. With a different woman in his bed every week and none of them able to tie him down, Jack couldn’t be happier with his life. \nTina Harris likes to play dirty.\nA troubled youth since her days at foster care, Tina is a delinquent who’s seen her fair of trouble. Within days of violating her parole, she’s on the run from the police again. Wanted for armed robbery and multiple counts of grand theft auto, she needs a getaway ride--and fast. \nWhen a theft goes wrong, the two find themselves in an unexpected position.\nWhen she tries and fails to steal a vintage Harley Davidson from an unmarked warehouse, things seem to go from bad to worse. Instead of dealing out vigilante justice, Jack recruits the young crook for a high stakes heist where failure is not an option... The only thing is… he never expected Tina to steal something else from him—something he never thought she'd ever be able to steal.",
