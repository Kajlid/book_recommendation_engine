  "description": "Listen up, and listen good— I’ll only say this shit once!Two Tricks does not work with MC gangs, and that’s final. Period. The end.No. No, you don’t get to ask why. Tricks runs the West Coast smuggling ring, so if you want anything to come and go, you play by the rules. You don’t like it? Well, then you’re gonna get a visit from me.Who am I? I’m Dax, his enforcer, and don’t let my height or the pink hair fool you. I’ll take your ass down.Now, can someone explain to me why the hell the Phantom Saints MC gang sent someone to try and talk me into getting Tricks to work with them? Or maybe how those same assholes ended up kidnapping me?You can bet your ass, as soon as I get the chance, I will make them regret ever having me as a ‘house guest’, even if they are sexy as sin. No one uses me and gets away with it!",
