  "description": "Readers of all ages who enjoy Magic, Fantasy, Vampires (known as the Pre') and Werewolves (known as the Whre') along with Gargoyles and 'portals' to other dimensions and all of the adventure that goes with it, will enjoy 'The Warrior Chronicles' by J.P.Carol. Although 'The Warrior Chronicles' is the fourth book in the All Hallows' Eve series, the author has written the fourth book in such a way that readers not familiar with the series can still jump in and enjoy the storyline, but entice them to see how it all began. The Warrior Chronicles takes place in New York City where Ancient Magic and the creatures that wield such magic, or those that are bound by it, were about to collide once again with the modern world of today. Three years earlier, a similar attempt by an ancient, supernatural entity trying to subjugate our world was met with resistance and defeated. Humans along with creatures of Magic joined forces with Ancient Warriors from another time to turn back the Dark Dimension. Now, three years later, another threat to Humans and their world has made its presence known in New York City. And the magical community along with the few Humans that are aware of their existence, is once again called together to defend their world. But this time, Gargoyles from a time as far back as ancient Egypt and beyond have joined in the fight.",
