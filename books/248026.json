  "title": "The God Reality: A Critique of Richard Dawkins' The God Delusion",
  "description": "In recent decades, the Christian consensus which laid the foundations for the freedoms, stability and prosperity enjoyed by Western countries has been challenged by an increasingly militant Atheistic Humanism. As a consequence, Christianity has become scorned and held up as a thing to be ridiculed. The God Delusion, by Richard Dawkins, represents perhaps the most brazen attack yet on Christianity. In it he portrays Christianity as unscientific, irrational and even downright evil. The God Reality takes Professor Dawkins main arguments and shows the many flaws and falsehoods they contain. It aims to embolden Christians to stand up for their beliefs in the face of an increasingly skeptical and hostile world and to cause atheists to question whether the assumptions which underpin their faith are really as logical and as sound as they think.",
