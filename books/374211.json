  "title": "Food From Plenty: Good food made from the plentiful, the seasonal and the leftover. With over 300 recipes, none of them extravagant",
  "description": "So what if filet mignon and foie gras are no longer on the menu? Diana Henry revives the lost art of home economics-making the most of what you have-combining it with today's desire for a sustainable table to show modern cooks that there is \"plenty\" of food for us to eat and enjoy without depleting our bank accounts and the planet's resources. \n\nThis cook's tour of recipes from around the globe is all about the great food you can make without spending a ton of money. With what's left from a simple Roast Chicken, make a fabulous Greek Chicken, Pumpkin, Feta & Filo Pie. Turn a bumper crop of tomatoes and basil into a satisfying Tomato & Pesto Tart. Thanks to a special section on less expensive cuts of meat, you'll soon be creating new family favorites from lamb shoulder, pork belly, skirt steak and the like.",
