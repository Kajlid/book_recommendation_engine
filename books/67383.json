  "description": "HHhH: Himmlers Hirn heisst Heydrich, or Himmler’s brain is called Heydrich. The most lethal man in Hitler’s cabinet, Reinhard Heydrich seemed indestructible–until two exiled operatives, a Slovak and a Czech, killed him and changed the course of history.In Laurent Binet’s mesmerizing debut, we follow Jozef Gabcik and Jan Kubis from their dramatic escape from Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia to their fatal attack on Heydrich and their own brutal deaths in the basement of a Prague church. A seamless blend of memory, actuality, and Binet’s own remarkable imagination, HHhH is at once thrilling and intellectually engrossing–a fast-paced novel of the Second World War that is also a profound meditation on the debt we owe to history.",
