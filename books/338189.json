  "description": "Trouble is brewing in Nexus, and for some reason, they think I can stop it. Some people are born to greatness. My mother wanted to strangle me at birth. I’ve not had an easy life, not in a world that thrives on magic. Spells to reinforce buildings. Hexes to give you the face of a supermodel. Or so I’ve been told. No one can hide their true face from me, and people get ugly when they find out my presence is the reason magic shrivels and dies. It’s not as cool as it sounds, so when I’m offered a job with the Special Monsters Unit, I take a chance and join a misfit crew to find out why the town of Nexus is a magnet for cryptids. At least I’m part of a team. I’m making friends. I’m— Finding out secrets about my past that are hard to handle. But my emotional scars will have to wait until after we deal with the monsters. Especially those with human faces.",
