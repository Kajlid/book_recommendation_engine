  "description": "Paulie and his buddies have snuck off to play night-time pond hockey again. Akira says the ice is thick enough, safe. And he should know because his dad, the brilliant physicist, measures it all the time. Except tonight the ice isn't safe. It creaks, cracks and Paulie falls in. When George finally manages to pull him back out, over eight minutes have gone. Paulie should be dead. Except tonight Paulie isn't dead. He's lying on the ice breathing, looking up at the stars, feeling the throbbing toothache he didn't have before, and knowing that something ain't right. Because Paulie drowned without dying... and normal people, they don't tend to do that.",
