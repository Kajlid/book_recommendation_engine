  "description": "The crews of the USS Carl Vinson, a nuclear aircraft carrier, and her battle group, struggle with the loss of their families and the lives they knew. Coming back to 1942 from 1990 throws them into a war their parents fought and died for. Now, they must face a new future of challenge and danger after fighting the Japanese only days after their arrival in 1942. After reporting to Admiral Nimitz, they are ordered, with the help of the Enterprise battle group, and under the command of Admiral 'Bull' Halsey, to attack Tokyo. Their success gives the Japanese a black eye and changes the course of Word War II. They sail into Sydney Harbor in Australia for repairs and find they are in a world they only know through books and films. For some, that world is another shock they must face, especially LCDR Samantha 'Spike' Hunt and the women of 1990. Then, they are ordered to the Atlantic and the next phase of their war, to face Hitler and Goering's new jets. Are the Black Knights up to the task? Can Spike prove her mettle as a leader?",
