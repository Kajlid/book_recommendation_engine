  "description": "We’ve all heard them, the never-ending comparisons our parents make of us to our siblings and those around us. Why can’t you be more ambitious, Sahar? Why can’t you be more like your uncle, Sahar? Why can’t you flip into animal form like everyone else, Sahar? The small town of True North, Colorado is a serene and tranquil place if you happen to be a shapeshifter, which as it turns out, Sahar North is not. Though she’s the daughter of one of the most prominent families in town, she just doesn’t seem to fit in. Thanks to Dana, the Wicked Witch of the North, her junior year is sure to be one of utter misery and she’s counting the days to graduation when she can finally put this small town in her rearview mirror. When out of the blue, the alpha of the wolf pack, and her crush for like…ever, Cameron, starts to pay more attention to her and she manages to befriend the witch’s human cousin, Dean, Sahar doesn’t feel so alone and thinks she may just make it out of high school alive.",
