  "title": "Peepshow: The Cartoon Diary",
  "description": "For over ten years Joe Matt has been notorious in cult circles for the embarrassing frankness with which he reveals his distressing habits and predilections. Utterly shameless and completely self-absorbed, Joe Matt writes with an exhibitionist's enthusiasm for his favorite subject, himself. The first incarnation of Peepshow was these one-page strips in which Joe shows off virtuosity for shocking self-revelation. He is an immature, womanizing, cowardly, cheap, porn freak. He also has crack comic timing and a remarkable gift for (self) caricature. The books of Joe Matt provokes this confession from guys over beer:Oh my god, he's just like me. I think those things but I never say them because my girlfriend would leave me. This diary collection made Joe Matt the hero he is today.",
