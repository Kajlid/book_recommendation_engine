  "description": "*** GET YOUR COPY, AND MEET THE TALENTED TOP OF THE WARDROBE GANG *** >>> FUN, HAPPY POEMS FOR AGES 3 - 7 YEARS This third book in the \"Top of the Wardrobe Gang\" series is our first ebook of simple poems for younger kids. The poems cover topics that the gang know a little about, such as Birthday Parties, colours in their paint box, going to play in the park, and what a teddy bear should do if he gets thrown on the floor by his owner... >>> BRIGHT PICTURES ON EVERY PAGE As with the first two books in the series (which introduce this cuddly toy group, and their plans to write their own books), every page of this book is simply and brightly illustrated. (So we recommend viewing it in colour, if you are able to.) >>> SIMPLE, EASY-TO-READ FORMAT The book is suitable for new readers, or for reading to younger children (ie for an approximate age range of 3-6yrs, or maybe as old as 8yrs for kids who like cuddly toys and simple rhymes!)",
