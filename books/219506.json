  "description": "Super heroes - they're a privileged class. Doing what they want, when they want, and suffering no consequences. They have no regard for the ordinary people who are left behind to suffer in their wake. Who will stand up for the little guy? There is a man. If you can find him, and if he believes in your story, he and his friends will put things right. Some call him an outlaw, rebel, Robin Hood. To others, he is a hero. No powers to speak of - just skills, smarts and a burning drive to take back justice. The man's name is Hawkeye. He doesn't look for trouble, but trouble finds him - and he'll quickly drag Western hero Red Wolf into it as well! It's a shame that they're facing certain death; they would have made a great team. COLLECTING: Occupy Avengers 1-4 and Avengers (1963) 80-81",
