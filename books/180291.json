  "title": "Finding Home: A Creative Journey on a Trip Around the World",
  "description": "With captivating honesty and a delightful sense of humour and vulnerability, Vicki Alayne Bradley takes us on a deeply personal journey as she aspires toward the creative life she's been longing for. Desperately wanting a lifestyle change, Vicki and her husband Dean go on a trip of a lifetime and travel to 20 countries around the world including Australia, Cambodia, Jordan, France and Sweden. During this ten-month backpacking adventure Vicki re-discovers her love for the arts, and comes to terms with her own creative anxieties while visiting many galleries, theatres and local artists. This memoir not only guides you along their whirlwind journey, but provides insights on the joys and challenges of long-term travel, and that home can mean much more than simply a place to live.",
