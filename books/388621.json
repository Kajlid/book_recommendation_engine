  "description": "SOCO “New England’s Favorite Magazine” recently featured THE NIMROD to it’s readership for “sometimes sarcastic, sometimes outraged, always funny.” THE Sloane’s life is one gigantic, hilarious MESS! Now 31 years old and life-wrecked on Cape Cod, he’s forsaken his degree in Computer Engineering (Boooooooring!!!) to embark on life’s purposely less-traveled road; a road so pock-marked with poverty, nonsense and endless troubles that no sensible person has ever even dared to travel it.Gary operates the worst landscaping business in Cape Cod history - an enterprise so ridiculous it’s literally nameless. With positively zero business sense and virtually no income, he’s dropped 78 pounds, cheered when his ex-girlfriend Jade was abducted by a local character named Low Tide, hired an employee who never comes in and can’t speak English and purchased a disintegrating pickup truck who’s broken radio only tunes in Rush Limbaugh. His only recurring landscaping client hires him not to garden but rather to watch classic films like “Annie Hall” in exchange for his thoughts (Noah says I got “the eye” but I got news for Noah. The eye doesn’t pay anything). Worse, these dire financial straits have left him living with his colorful Aunt Muriel who believes - hopes actually - that Gary’s got at least enough ambition to take it to the next level and finally become NATIONALLY infamous.",
