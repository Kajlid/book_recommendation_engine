  "description": "The first two novels in Kylie Scott's Stage Dive series! Get ready to rock, all night long…\nLICK\nEvelyn Thomas’s plans for celebrating her twenty-first birthday in Las Vegas were big. But she sure never meant to wake up on the bathroom floor with a hangover to rival the black plague, a very attractive half-naked man, and a diamond on her finger large enough to scare King Kong. One thing is certain: being married to one of the hottest rock stars on the planet is sure to be a wild ride.\nPLAY\nMal Ericson, drummer for the world-famous rock band Stage Dive, needs to clean up his image fast. Having a good girl on his arm should do the job fine, but he didn’t count on finding the right girl. Anne Rollins never thought she’d meet the rock god who plastered her bedroom walls―especially not under these circumstances. Being paid to play the pretend girlfriend to a wild life-of-the-party drummer couldn’t end well. Or could it?",
