  "description": "ACE 0517347997 (ISBN13: 9780517347997)Welcome to the joys of reading Jane Austen, the timeless eighteen-century writer who remains the standard today for writers everywhere. This complete anthology is unique among single-volume editions of her works for two reasons: it adds the obscure but delightful Lady Susan to the six better-known novels, and it includes selections from the irresistible drawings of Hugh Thomson.All of Jane Austen’s novels are love stories, all are stories of country gentry, and all are comedies in the sense that they end happily, one way or another, her stories have the complexity of life, and her characters are described with inimitable style and wit—whether caustic of warmly affectionate.The volume includes: Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility, Mansfield Park, Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion, and Lady Susan. Last but not least are the charming, witty, and affectionate nineteenth-century illustrations of Hugh Thomson. He has captured the particular Austen flavor better than any other artist—worldly, comic, beautiful, and preposterous.",
