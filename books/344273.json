  "description": "They say you can’t run from your past. But damn, I am determined to try.I had finally escaped as I had always planned. Things were going great - I had new friends, a job, and a new life.When I’m called back home to deal with an emergency, I do my best to fly under the radar. But I should know by now it’s never easy when it comes to the three Taylor brothers. They’re charming, arrogant, and downright dangerous.It’s a catastrophic domino effect, and even though I try as hard as I can to move forward, there’s one rule I had forgotten:The games are never really over.Pretty Savages is a reverse harem taboo romance - meaning the main female character will have more than one love interest, and yes - it's downright dirty and taboo. The characters are morally grey, hot and questionable. It contains adult themes, course language and is solely intended for mature audiences over 18. Pretty Savages is book 2 in The Lies We Keep series.",
