  "description": "from Introduction by author: \"These poems are prayer flags starched in buttermilk, ghost tattoos, gravel in the wound, what I found after the city drained lake, arguments against common sense, arrows from the stinking bowman, angel hair on the world tree, chatter from the hanged man, christmas cards to Buddha, quarrels with the mountain named Time, slash marks on the willow tree, music to cauterize sour mouths, a small text of praise, a three wheeled truck, a graveyard full of trash, a case of wobble pop, a clothesline for the naked swarmis painted with blue mud, a broken paddle, a ripped sail, a thermos for hot tears...\" Collected Poems",
