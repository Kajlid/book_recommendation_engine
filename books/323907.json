  "description": "My name is Harlow, and I've just been attached to a ShiftARS unit on an army base far from where I was settled. I'm 23 and recently out of training, so although I rank higher than the three guys in my team, they treat me like the newbie. The three guys are gay and also lovers so the team dynamics are off. Luckily these guys look at me like a conquest and welcome me in. They are huge guys, solid muscle and tower 6 inches above me. Despite coming top of my class in fitness, martial arts and target shooting, to them my 5ft10 frame makes me seem like a delicate flower. They think I'm straight, I won't tell them I've been tempted before. Just like I won't tell them my shift beast. But all my secrets might come out anyway as these guys peel away my layers until they break my core. This is a full length 70k M/MMM harem novel suitable for over 18's due to the sexual content",
