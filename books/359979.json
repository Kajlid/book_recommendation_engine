  "description": "Wedding planning is torturous for most men, let alone when that man has knowingly trapped himself into assisting with the wedding of the woman he loves...to another man.\nJeremy Balfour, the new Baron Shefford, has known Lady Lily Stratford her entire life and loved her just as long. But several truths were evident to him from the very beginning:*As his best friend's younger sister, she was completely off-limits.*Revealing his feelings would do no good.*Lily was not meant for him. As the daughter of an earl, she was destined to marry a great lord and bring her family an advantageous connection.When the inevitable happens and Lily is betrothed to another man, Jeremy must make the decision to risk destroying both of their lives by revealing his feelings, or do the honorable thing and relinquish her forever. Either through blind stupidity or desperation, he offers to stand in for the absent bridegroom during the planning process; telling himself that he will take solace in Lily's temporary nearness, imprint her smile upon his memory, and hold those recollections close as he vows to step aside and never interfere again. When he discovers her fianc√©'s true nature, however, Jeremy's choice becomes clear: He must save Lily from the marriage...at any cost.Brimming with angst and longing, electric passion and an explosive conclusion, The Baron's Folly is a spectacular introduction to the world of \"The Stratford Family\" series; part of an interwoven, multilayered set of books with overlapping characters and plots.
