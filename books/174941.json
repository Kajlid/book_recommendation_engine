  "description": "It's 1995. Things are going great for new Washington, DC intern Trent Norris. He's out on his own, he's found a fabulous woman to date, and if he doesn't love his internship, he doesn't hate it either. Life is nice.  But things can change in a moment in DC, and Trent finds himself the prime suspect in two murders and a slew of other crimes. Overnight he becomes the most wanted man in America.  Trent has to find a way -- any way -- out. He finds a way to hole up at The Watergate on a senator's dime and enlists a comely call girl as his unwitting ally. But with the media eating him alive, he knows he doesn't have long before they catch up with him. Can The Intern find his way out of this mess?  From tony clubs in Georgetown to Capitol Hill murders, The Intern has all the twists and turns of a classic DC thriller, with an added comic flair.",
