  "description": "Treva Langston's life has suddenly been turned upside down. She lost her high-powered job, her family has returned to a town that brings only memories of heartache, and she's beset with uncertainty about what makes her worthy. To her husband, she's blind to the blessings of their young family; to her mother, her awkward homecoming is just another reason why she'll never be a success. Unable to shake her fears, Treva feels nothing can save her... Treva's sister understands that trials that come with self-doubt. So with the help of her women's prayer group, she invites Treva to ask God for what she can't do alone. Despite herself, Treva rediscovers the gifts and the people she never took time to value. She finds that the promised Heavenly Places she has always looked for have been in front of her all along.",
