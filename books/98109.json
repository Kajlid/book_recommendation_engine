  "description": "A laugh-out-loud, charming story for 7-10 year olds.      Ogden is a gnarly, man-eating ogre... with a dream of becoming a dancer. But no one will dance with him -- not when they think they'’re going to be his next meal. That is, until Ogden meets Willow, a gutsy girl who lives in a tree house in the woods. She makes a deal with him -- if he'’ll stop eating humans, she’'ll teach him to dance.",
