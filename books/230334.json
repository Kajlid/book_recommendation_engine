  "description": "Ben Scarrett’s first impressions of Scotland aren’t all that good. The bad weather is one thing, but talking to a trawlerman who’s been dead for six months and is possessed by a Norse god makes Ben want to get back to his partner Joanne Kramer as soon as he can.But England’s got its own share of oddities; like the undead roaming country houses, giant trolls eating horses and the bewitchingly beautiful Moira - a woman who can walk through walls.Oh, and Joanne has managed to get into a parallel universe and it looks like there’s no way back.",
