  "description": "Milo Abfantu was raised to be a cruel prince, and for many years, he was. But when he captures a kingdom rebel stirring up trouble, he feels the all-consuming pull of finding his mate—Chase Fury, the most beautiful, fiercest man Milo’s ever laid eyes on. But Chase hates both him and his family and has committed his life to seeing Milo burn alongside his father. How can Milo be mated to a man who can’t stand him? Did the fates screw up? Could he ever change to be the kind of man Chase could love?  Chase Fury hasn’t thought about love in a very long time. His one and only focus has been to see the Abfantu line fall. They’re a plague on the kingdom, and he’s determined to be the one to take them down. That is, until he’s captured by the handsome, young prince of Belaria, and in an instant, everything changes.",
