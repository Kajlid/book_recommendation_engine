  "title": "A Home at the End of the World",
  "description": "Michael Cunninghamâ€™s celebrated novel is the story of two boyhood friends: Jonathan, lonely, introspective, and unsure of himself; and Bobby, hip, dark, and inarticulate. In New York after college, Bobby moves in with Jonathan and his roommate, Clare, a veteran of the city's erotic wars. Bobby and Clare fall in love, scuttling the plans of Jonathan, who is gay, to father Clare's child. Then, when Clare and Bobby have a baby, the three move to a small house upstate to raise \"their\" child together and create a new kind of family. A Home at the End of the World masterfully depicts the charged, fragile relationships of urban life today.",
