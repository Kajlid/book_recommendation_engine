  "description": "Outmanned, outclassed, outgunned. Can this Anglo-Irish soldier reach beyond his training to save the allied effort? Crimean shores, 1854. Young Lieutenant Samuel Kingston is eager to prove himself in the Crimean War. But after a traitor cuts him and a handful of lancers adrift at sea, death seems inevitable when the raging waters sweep them behind enemy lines. And when he discovers the Russians have fortified their position, he must somehow warn the British cavalry before they charge to their doom. Crossing the forbidding landscape, Kingston and his men struggle to elude Cossacks and bandits alike. And just when they think they’re in the clear, they find an even greater threat blocking their path. Can Kingston and his ragtag company beat the odds to prevent a massacre? Freedom Pledge is a standalone prequel in the stirring Adventures of a Victorian Soldier military historical fiction series about revenge and redemption that immerses you in the turmoil of Ireland’s Great Famine, the horror of the Crimean War, and the forgotten Filibuster War in Nicaragua.  If you liked Bernard Cornwell’s Sharpe series, you love these tales of an Anglo-Irish hero who’s punished for his putting the wellbeing of his Irish countrymen before that of the Crown. If you like action, Nineteenth-Century warfare, and thoughtful meditations on social class, then you’ll love M.J. Twomey’s thrilling adventure.",
