  "description": "Nikki James is in San Francisco at the request of her partner and best friend, Jake. The wife of an old friend is missing, and Jake intends to find her—whatever the cost. The authorities believe the kidnappings to be the work of a sick mind, but Nikki knows that the truth is something much worse—especially since she seems to have an unexpected psychic link to the killer. But as always, she is more than willing to risk her own life to save another’s. For Michael Kelly, Nikki’s bravado is a source of endless terror. He wants nothing more than to make Nikki a permanent part of his life, but he knows that her quest is sure to get her killed. As they chase through the sewers and tunnels of San Francisco and the body count begins to rise, Michael badgers her to stay off the case, but Nikki has no intention of complying. She wants him to realize that she’s either a full partner in his life or she’s out. But nothing prepares her for the price she has to pay for her stubbornness—the life of someone she loves.",
