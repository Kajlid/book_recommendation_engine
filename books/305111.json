Not satisfied with his own power and wealth, he covets the rich southern lands of Amina and plans a brutal campaign of conquest, fuelled by a deadly new weapon – the power of gunpowder. In the same city and at the same time, a young orphan boy called Raimund is forced into picking pockets to keep himself fed. In a northern city another young man, Audun, learns about a mysterious and powerful red stone – and begins to uncover the secret of his royal birthright. Soon the lives of the Emperor, Audun and Raimund will become inextricably entangled. This story is Volume 1 of a trilogy, The Emperor, The Son and The Thief.",
