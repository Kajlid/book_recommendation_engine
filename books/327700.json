  "description": "Intuition, noun; a thing that one knows or considers likely from instinctive feeling rather than conscious reasoning.Instincts are fickle, the world will tell you to trust your gut and go with whatever it tells you. Jaxson Reid has been following his instincts in the stock market for a decade, he’s made millions off his keen intuition. When one of the companies he’s invested in goes belly up, instincts are no longer an issue. The Federal Government calls it insider trading, he calls it a hunch. We started as friends and after a week long fling in Mexico, I have to question my morals and the oath I’ve taken as a lawyer. I’ve defended some of the most heinous murders of the last decade, I’m the top defense attorney in the state. A green eyed man who makes my knees weak should not be the reason I’m questioning my morals. My own rules.Do I follow my instincts or my heart?",
