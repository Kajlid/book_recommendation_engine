  "description": "Erik & Isabelle Freshman Year at Foresthill High by Kim Wallace introduces two best friends who share their thoughts and feelings with one another as they experience romantic crushes, family drama, growing pains, and personal victories. Sounds like every other teenager, doesn’t it? The clincher is, they’re both gay. Erik is a studious, well-mannered young man who is forced to hide his homosexuality from his military father and the gay-baiting bullies at school. Every day Erik is alone, facing the pain of pretending to be someone who he is not, until he meets another boy just like himself on the Internet. Isabelle is a strong-willed, out lesbian—the only one at her conservative school—whose parents embrace her sexuality and self-expression. Isabelle’s offbeat sense of humor and unique style attracts the attention of a questioning head-cheerleader. In spite of opposition, they fall in love. Hard. When she experiences the tragedy of her first serious break up, Isabelle nearly self-destructs. Erik and Isabelle, however, triumph over the forces against them with resilience and relentless humor. In light of the present political debates around gay rights and equality, Erik & Isabelle is a timely and relevant series that will help guide GLBT youth onto a path of empowerment and hope. Most of all, Erik & Isabelle sends every reader the same No matter who or what we are, all human beings are seeking the same love, acceptance, and understanding.",
