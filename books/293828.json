  "description": "For those of you who grew up on Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark, you will understand how sometimes horror sticks with you. It follows you home and hides beneath your bed, or lurks in your closet with shining black eyes that you can never quite spot. But when you grow up, true horror becomes something else entirely. Dread is an illustrated series of short horror stories for those adults. It finds the tiny cracks in your psyche and worms its way in, chilling you to your core. Because when it comes down to it, what are you most afraid of as an adult? Is it still the idea that a monster is hiding under your bed? Or is it the reality that the monster is actually in your own head? Each story in the anthology will disturb, haunt, and unsettle you.",
