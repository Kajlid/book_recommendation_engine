  "description": "Amos Garr is in the trucking business, just another working stiff with a wife and a son, by all appearances successful and a fairly likeable guy, if a loner. If you met him on the street you’d likely forget him minutes later. He is unremarkable. But when sleep claims him, the story is different. He fights for the Light, venturing bravely into the Darkness to carry the battle and serve in Michael’s army. He is a noteworthy assassin when occasion demands, and is known and feared in the Otherworld where he does his best work. This is his journal, the journal of a Greywalker, one who did not volunteer, but one who serves and the price he pays for his service. Follow him into the frightening world that lies beyond the waking mind. Go with him into the Darkness.",
