  "description": "It’s been three years since Gemma Hunter walked away from Queen Bee and her infamous relationship with Tyler Chase. Now a twenty-two year old in the world’s fashion capital of Manhattan, Gemma is on the verge of a burgeoning career in haute couture. Old and new friends zip in and out of her busy life with her best friend Zoe as a loyal client and Leah as a vital employee of Gemma’s new fashion house. And for once, everything is truly within her own control.With the SoHo launch of her line’s flagship store just around the corner, boys are the last thing on Gemma’s mind – that is until she learns that Damian plans to sign with the New York Knicks and that Tyler has been spotted house-hunting on the east coast. There’s no question that it would be a matter of time before she’d run into one of them and if they can’t stay out of sight, they certainly won’t be out of mind.",
