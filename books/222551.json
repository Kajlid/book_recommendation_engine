  "description": "When Cynda gets hot and bothered, things start to sizzle. Gorgeous flame-haired Cynda Flynn knows fire-its heat, its power, its magic. A fully trained Sybil warrior priestess, Cynda's weapon is flame. But she's unprepared for the passion ignited by Nick Lowell, an undercover cop in the NYPD's Occult Crime Unit. He's half human, half demon, and hotter than hell, with fathomless black eyes that ignite something buried deep inside Cynda, making her melt in all the right places. Luckily, Nick has found a way to control his dark side, but he's done it old-school-through steel-willed self-control. And after five years working secretly within the deadly Legion cult, he's unbreakable. Or he was, until Cynda came along. Now it's personal-and even his big bad love may not be enough to halt a terrible new evil snuffing out fire Sybils like Cynda. It's nasty. And if it can't be stopped, they're all going to fry.",
