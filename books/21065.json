Universally touching.\" — San Francisco ChronicleTrina is eighteen and suffers from bi-polar disorder, making her paranoid, wild, and violent.

After these three days Trina is off on her own again. Fed up with the bureaucracy and determined to save her daughter by any means necessary, Keri signs on for an illegal intervention known as The Program, a group of radicals who eschew the psychiatric system and model themselves after the Underground Railroad. In the upheaval that follows, she is forced to confront a past that refuses to stay buried, even as she battles to secure a future for her child.",
