  "description": "Hot passionate sex! That was the last thing on Scott Maclaren's mind as he traveled across the Atlantic to visit family. The tough Scotsman had been a Special Forces soldier until he had been terribly injured on duty in Afghanistan. Shortly after that his wife had left him for another man while he was in the hospital. But things were starting to look up, after a freak online connection he'd met beautiful Ohio schoolteacher Katie Johnson and that's when the fireworks really started. Intense passion flared between them, a love and electricity that neither of them had ever experienced before. Scott would do anything for Katie and her children including returning to the Middle East to work a six month security contract. The money was too good to ignore, this could set them up financially for life. Their enforced separation is made harder by news that his job entails him being a personal bodyguard for the devious Britney Parnell, a young attractive businesswoman who's used to getting everything she wants. She wants Scott and wastes no time sharpening her claws on Katie. This emotional erotic romance is full of action, adventure, conflict, steamy sex scenes and ultimately betrayal.",
