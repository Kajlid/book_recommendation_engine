  "title": "The World on Blood",
  "description": "Terror is sweeping California as innocent babies are being kidnapped. the dazzlingly elegant James Whistler, a master seducer, finds it shamelessly easy to snatch newborns from their cribs. Nick Santos is the one man who knows the shadowy subculture, in which Whistler thrives on the easily corrupted, and where blood is offered as the ultimate aphrodisiac. But now he must put his life, and the lives of the woman he loves and the baby he has just fathered, on the edge of the abyss. And, in a desperate race against time and a darkly dangerous, seemingly omnipotent adversary, Nick Santos battles a mortal peril that has never been closer - or more terrifying. With a cast of vivid characters who move from the forests of northern California to the streets of San Francisco to a Nevada desert resort, this stylish, supercharged novel of eroticism and suspense gives voice to the hidden side of passion. Not since Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire has the vampire myth been so boldly reimagined.",
