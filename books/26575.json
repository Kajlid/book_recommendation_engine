Lord Julian St. John Audley, they both agree, is an insufferably arrogant dandy. But unfortunately for the orphans, he is also the Fifth Earl of Worth, a friend of the Regent, and, quite by chance, their legal guardian. Lord Worth doesn't want the office of guardian any more than they want him, and is determined to thwart all their interests and return them to the country.But when Judith and Peregrine begin to move in the highest social circles, Lord Worth cannot help but entangle himself with his adventuresome wards. Beautiful Judith Taverner had captivated all London society. A bevy of elegant bachelors swarmed about her, vying for her favors. But then her brother suddenly vanished, she was forced to seek the aid of her mysterious guardian, the powerful Earl of Worth.Once Judith had looked upon the Earl as a protector -- and then as something far more. But now she was gown up, worldly-wise... and prey to a chilling suspicion. For Judith was not only a bewitching young lady, but also heiress to a great fortune -- a bewildered creature trying to discover the difference between a man's love and a man's greed. Heiress Judith Taverner fights her loathing, and her desire, for the iron-willed but handsome man who is her suitor.",
