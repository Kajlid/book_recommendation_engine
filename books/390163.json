  "description": "Dying old ladies' hair blue at Sandy's House of Beauty has never been enough for hometown girl Bubbles Yablonsky. So she's taking her big hair and her big dreams back to school to study journalism, and taking advantage of some on-the-job training at the local newspaper. But when Bubbles trips over a crime scene on the way home from an assignment, she finds herself up to her roots in a nasty murder investigation. It could be the big break she's been waiting for-if she doesn't get sidetracked by her lowlife ex-husband, her teenage daughter, or her gun-toting mother, who has just escaped from the Polish Old Folks Apartments.",
