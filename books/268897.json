  "description": "Making a deal with a demon? That’s an epic mistake. But making a deal with three sexy demons? That’s just plain stupid.  But no one ever said Sharen made the best decisions. Being a demon-hunter, after all, requires a certain amount of recklessness. And maybe even a touch of insanity.  Sharen’s prepared to face the horrors of the demon realm, and the consequences of linking herself to three powerful demons. Because if sacrificing her body and soul means saving her best friend’s life, it’s worth it.  What she’s not prepared for—realizing that everything she thought she knew was wrong and that the lives of her best friend and herself might just depend on three stubborn demons who claim her as their bride.  ~Reckless Magic is a short reverse harem. It is SCORCHING hot and will make you wonder why all your dreams aren’t filled with sexy demons who know just how to possess a woman.~",
