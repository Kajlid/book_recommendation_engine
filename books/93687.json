Eventually he is given away to an animal shelter, and the implication that he may be put down is unspoken, yet evident. Meanwhile, Joseph is introduced with his parents, who are of course quite despondent over their child's condition. The story reaches its happy ending when Joseph is taken to the animal shelter in the hopes of finding an animal that he will respond to, and he and Elliot recognize each other as kindred spirits.",
