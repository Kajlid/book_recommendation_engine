  "description": "Fate stopped smiling on her a long time ago. So is a mate now a blessing or a curse?  Eleya has done more with her life than most Brions will. Not only a General, but a High Senator, she's achieved everything but the love that every Brion seeks. When a twist of fate brings her face to face with her second mate, can she move on from the pain the first one caused, or is he just another challenge to be dealt with?  Xaven as a more than capable Brion Captain wants many things, but being a General is not one of them. However a mate that is one... well, a man can have no objections to that, now can he? Only when it becomes clear that their paths are too divergent to come together must the warrior reconsider his faith in fate. Perhaps some things are not meant to be.  Or maybe they need to be fought for harder than he ever expected?  This is a standalone novella in the Brion Brides series which can and should be read as such. It is a science fiction romance story with plenty of steam, hot warriors, no cheating, a happy ending and tempers flaring the Brion way! Come join the ride!",
