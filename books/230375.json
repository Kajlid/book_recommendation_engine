She needed one thing only, and that was to free her sister from vampires. So she set off, into the Castle, into the hell she never anticipated she would set foot in. But it would be a breeze! That thought was the only mistake Robyn made. Her job of searching for her sister would place Robyn in the midst of blood-sucking creatures and passages with cryptic clues that never ended. Even if the search didn't finally destroy Robyn, succumbing to Dante Ivanov's - a mortal born to protect the vampires - deadly looks, just may. His brown wavy locks, captivating eyes, and rippled muscles are the only thing that keeps Robyn going. Too bad they don't get along! But Robyn needs her focus, because no matter how captivating and gorgeous Dante may seem, her motive is way beyond him. Each vampire is deadlier than the other, and Robyn soon realizes she would need her wits to find her sister. Or die trying...",
