  "description": "A birthright. It should be something no one can ever take away.But that’s not how it works in the world of vampires. Especially when that birthright involves a unique type of blood necessary for an elitist vampire society to remain young and beautiful. Welcome to the continued misadventure of nineteen-year-old Txema Ybarra (pronounced Chema). The earth’s most privileged undead believe they deserve a stake in Txema’s blood, and there is power and prestige for whoever controls her ancient bloodline. However, the vampire demon, Ralu, and his burgeoning Chupacabra army crave the same lofty status. Unlike his brother Gustav—ruler of the elite European vampires—Ralu desires the death of Txema, and with it the end of Gustav’s two thousand-year reign.As this teenage mother-to-be fights for survival for her and her unborn daughter, the journey to elude Ralu and traitor vampires among Gustav’s civilized allies takes Txema across the globe. The race is on to save or destroy two human lives…and determine the rightful holder of The Vampires’ Birthright.",
