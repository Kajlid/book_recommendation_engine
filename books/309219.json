  "description": "When Covid lifted, so did the veil on our world. We thought Covid was terrible because it crumbled economies, crippled businesses and left people feeling a sense of loss. That was until the veil lifted. It took two and a half years of on'and'off lockdowns for people to turn from merrily singing to each other from balconies, to being pissed about not being able to celebrate thanksgiving with their families, to finally being family or core unit. Gone were the days of togetherness, ubuntu and globalisation, and in its place was something much worse. You see it wasnt just the loss of connection that weighed heavily on you, it was also the blatant mistrust. So when the veil lifted and we looked at each other, I mean really looked at each other, we realised that we werent human at all. Reya discovers that she is half angel, half shifter, but it is the Angel bloodline in her that has the authorities sitting up and paying attention. As Reya muddles through her newfound abilities with the guy assigned to train her. And as the lines between their relationship soon becomes blurred, Reya starts to realise that there is a lot more to her powers than she was initially led to believe. With races fast dividing, is she alone enough to stop the impending global race war that is about to explode?",
