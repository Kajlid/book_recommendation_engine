Kate lost not only her detective’s badge but something much more valuable: she lost her confidence as a Mistress of men. She now scrapes by as a private investigator, feeding off the misery of others. When the mayor and his wife ask her to investigate the murder of their daughter, Kate faces a difficult choice. To follow the leads, she must reenter the world that destroyed her career and go undercover as a submissive to a noted Dom. Kate swore she would never endure the submissive role again, yet Jake Davenport is the one dominant fearless enough to not only challenge her rules, but break them. There's only one problem. Jake’s complicated past raises too many questions, and as her investigation progresses, Jake might just be her number one suspect.",
