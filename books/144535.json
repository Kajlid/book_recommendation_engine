There is no explanation, no sign of magical foul play or a biological toxin. The humans are convinced it s the work of a deviant supernatural faction, twisting the knife in the already tense relationship between their species. Brenna and Gray agree the deaths have a former comrade-turned-rogue stamped all over them.In a race against time, they enlist the help of both friend and foe to save the human race and stop the impending civil war. Along the way, they are forced to come to terms with their past and decide, once and for all, whether they will come together or fall apart.",
