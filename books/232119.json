  "description": "You can effectively relate, connect, understand, and lead... if you have the right set of tools. Each of us has two sets of tools. The first toolbox is filled with the technical skills, equipment, and devices needed to help us carry out our activities. The second toolbox is invisible. It contains the tools that we use in human interactions . According to Harvard University, Stanford Research Institute, and the Carnegie Foundation, 85% of your success comes from our interpersonal skills and how you relate to others. For the first time in American history, there are four generations coming together in the workplace. This brings a whole new set of challenges to modern business. Your Invisible Toolbox tackles the challenges many millennials face with a unique set of research-based tools, put together in an easy-to-apply road map to success. When used well, the effects of using these tools are anything but invisible. *Your Invisible Toolbox is a 2018 IBPA Benjamin Franklin Award Winner",
