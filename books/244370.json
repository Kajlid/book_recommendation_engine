  "description": "She doesn't trust him.There’s no reason he should need what he’s asking for. Besides, she has an estate full of patients to look after.It doesn’t matter that he’s helpful, or that he’s persuasive, or that he’s the most magnificent man she’s ever seen.He needs her.He could just storm the house and take exactly what he wants.Really, though, where’s the fun in that when there’s a pretty little mortal woman to seduce?.....Eight years ago, a fast-moving plague descended on Dragongrove Manor. In mere days, countless were dead or dying, leaving one young girl to pick up the pieces. Since that fateful day, The Lady of Dragongrove, Ingrid, has toiled day and night to care for the sick that come to estate. Yet now there is a new man at her door…Tall, fair and intimidating, Helias towers above the usual townsfolk, piercing Ingrid with emerald eyes that spark a flame in her stomach, even as fissures of unease crawl up her spine. He is seeking to access her vast library, intent on finding the source of a similar plague that has attacked his own hometown. His purpose seems genuine, yet there is something about him that draws her like a moth to a flame… and a dangerous air that warns her to stay far away.Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B077Z4KSHR here.",
