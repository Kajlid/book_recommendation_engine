  "description": "ALT Cover ISBN 1489570438 (ISBN13: 9781489570437) Jodie Clark was no beauty. She was a plain, timid girl who constantly felt inferior to the super-confident, snooty girls at school. Worse than the teasing in the playground, especially from the new girl Sapphire, though, was the unpredictable, hurtful criticism from her father. Her full-of-himself, sixteen-year-old brother was no compensation for Jodie - he always took Dad's side and he was obsessed with Sapphire, even though Jodie saw Sapphire as nothing more than a mouthed off bully. Jodie and her meek, sweet mother lived in uneasy fear of his fierce rages, along with her baby brother Jimi, and sparked whenever they break one of Dad's fussy house rules. Eventually, after an unbearable birthday party because of Sapphire and the very real threat of Dad's out-of-control temper, Jodie got a gang together to see if she could go against Sapphire. It worked - but an unstoppable relationship blossomed between Jodie and Sapphire, something that made them both inseperable ... However, this sudden change of heart angered Jodie's friends. An unexpected lifetime imprisonment of Jodie's father caused everything to fall apart, but was this the start of a new beginning for both Jodie and her family?",
