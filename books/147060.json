  "description": "A stand alone book based on the bestselling Growing Pains Series. You do not need to have read the series to embark on this read. Cassie thought she had it all—a great brother, a new soon to be sister-in-law, and a bunch of great friends. With her chosen family growing, and her life in L.A. going great, she never thought she’d ask for anything more. But when she sees the way her brother and his soon-to-be wife look at each other, Cassie realizes something’s missing. A love she didn’t think she needed suddenly becomes the one thing she can’t live without. Unfortunately, her problems will have to wait. When Cassie is asked by her good friend, Peter, to be his fake-girlfriend for a family reunion, she can’t say no. She is now responsible for helping him keep a secret that could tear his family away from him. And if she didn’t think it could get any worse, she meets Peter’s brother. Tall and brooding with a sleeve of tattoos and a Harley, he’s a bad boy with an irresistible smile. Jace has sworn away women. After he caught his fiancé in bed with his best friend, he can’t imagine ever trusting again. He sells his house and heads to his parent’s place in wine country, needing a retreat away from his life to get his head on straight. There he meets Cassie. Chaotic but so full of life, she has his head spinning. But his resolve to stay away from the opposite sex, not to mention his brother’s girlfriend, has him keeping his distance. With loyalty standing in her way, Cassie must do everything she can to protect Peter by keeping his secret. But staying away from Jace turns out to be the hardest challenge of her life.",
