  "title": "The Zulu War: A Pictorial History",
  "description": "It was meant to be a quick knockout the British firmly believed that their rifles and artillery would make short work of the Zulus and then they would be home to London for tea. In an atmosphere of breezy arrogance, three columns of British soldiers marched into Zulu territory. But before long, the Zulus caught one column by surprise and wiped it out. Though the epic resistance by one company at Rorke's Drift temporarily restored British pride, the war wasn't yet over. Much more fighting and many more deaths occurred before England's final victory at Ulundi. A superb collection of period photographs, supported by a vivid account of the campaign, reveals the truth behind the wars that inspired the popular film Zulu!",
