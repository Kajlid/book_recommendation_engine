But as he tries to find out more about the mysterious woman he has another more disturbing case to investigate. The naked bodies of two teenagers have been found with shotgun wounds at the foot of a cliff. As Wesley searches for the truth, both cases become stranger, especially when he finds a link to a sinister manhunt mirroring events from the time of the Napoleonic Wars. Why did the teenage victims take part in an online game called Blood Hunt which they were eventually persuaded to play for real? Then a skeleton is found near the place where the dead teenagers were last seen alive and Wesley finally has to face a terrible truth—and a hunt to the death.",
