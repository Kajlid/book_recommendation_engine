  "description": "I Am Another You is a narrative of the author's real life experiences with transformational breakthroughs - a narrative that has the power to resonate with every reader. Summary Of The Book I Am Another You is a narrative based on the author's experiences on the path to self-discovery. The author, drawing from her own experiences, seeks to encourage readers to find the true purpose of their lives, to courageously pursue their dreams, and above all, to be the best that they can be. The book follows the author's journey, beginning with her frustration at being trapped in a world that does not feel right. Her attempt to escape such a world takes her to the Netherlands. Her subsequent encounters with various healers and spiritual masters infuse her with the realization that positive change must emanate from within and the outer world is merely a reflection of the inner one. The book confronts a universal subject - every individual's search for a higher purpose in life - and therein lies its appeal. At some point of life or another, every individual is beset by a strong inclination to go beyond a superficial and materialistic life in search of a life with a deeper meaning and a higher purpose. This desire to grow spiritually seems to transcend any and all barriers, including origin, age, gender, and lifestyle. Hence, all the readers can find parallels to their own lives in the author's honest and moving narrative. They can find nuggets of priceless wisdom hidden in her story - subtle lessons that can help them face their own struggles and achieve personal success and fulfilment in perhaps the only way that really matters - spiritually. I Am Another You was published in 2009.",
