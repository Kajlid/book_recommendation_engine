Childhood friends Andy Stevens and Wade Hamilton share the same dream of becoming fighter pilots.

She relies on her faith and love to get her through her darkest days. When Andy finally calls Rebecca after his escape from the POW camp, she reveals an unexpected secret that makes his homecoming even more bittersweet and poignant.Sons in The Clouds weaves a raw emotional drama that reveals the tender fragility of human relationships, and leaves readers filled with hopeful messages long after the final page is read",
