  "description": "Eve Littlepage made her living as striptease dancer 'Lisa Doolittle' in the suburbs of Boston for ten years, from the mid-1970s through the mid-80s. Her memoir is about how she fell into this marginalized profession, some of the craziness that happened while she was in it, and how she struggled to find a way out and into a more wholesome life.Littlepage uses a unique vehicle for sharing her story: it is told interview-style to a fictional author named Stella Mars. This unusual method evokes a sense that one is eavesdropping on a very private conversation as Eve shares her secrets with Stella. The story weaves memories of her personal life together with reflections on her stripping career, and shows how the contrasting aspects of the two played off of each other as she evolved and grew through her varied experiences.Though metaphysics is not the main focus, Eve's story is laced with references to the I Ching, ghostly visitations, spiritual epiphanies, and other mystical themes. It may offer hope and inspiration to anyone who has ever felt stuck in a job or relationship that seemed impossible to escape.It is a tale of perseverance, resilience, and hope, sprinkled with humor and insight. One reader called it, \"... a coming-of-age story with more universal appeal than one might expect in a stripper's memoir.\" It’s about choices and the ripple effect they create. It’s Eve’s ‘secret past’ – for your entertainment!",
