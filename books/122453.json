  "description": "A DISTANT COLONY SHROUDED IN SILENCE. In the vast expanse of space, Bethesda – humanity's first extra-solar colony and home to a thriving population of adults and children – has ceased all communication with Earth. A DEADLY RESCUE MISSION.Nathalie Hart only joined the New Horizons interstellar rescue expedition to escape the pain and guilt after her sister’s senseless death. But when she’s wrenched out of cryo-sleep far too early, she realises something has gone very wrong on board… SABOTAGE. MURDER. BETRAYAL. As the ship's alarms blare and smoke fills the corridors, Nathalie finds herself thrust into command amidst a crew of strangers, each harbouring their own secrets. A scrawled threat in her cabin, written in a language only she knows, confirms her suspicions. Someone on board will do anything to stop them reaching the colony and revealing Bethesda’s secrets. Surrounded by deceit, and with Earth a distant memory, Nathalie must decide who she can trust as they desperately race towards the unknown horrors of Bethesda. A deadly secret threatens everyone back on Earth. And if their mission fails, five-thousand innocent lives hang in the balance… If you loved The Expanse and anything by Ann Leckie or Arkady Martine, you won’t be able to put down this gripping tale of betrayal and survival in the vastness of space.",
