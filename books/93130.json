  "description": "Once upon a time a young girl wanted revenge. But first, she wanted to be beautiful.Twelve-year-old Bettony has read enough stories that begin with once upon a time to know what happens to the ugly stepsisters at the end, and she’s determined to escape that fate by any means necessary—even by magic. Unfortunately, when it comes to magic, there is no place for regret, refunds, or exchanges. Even if you accidentally turn your older sister into a toad. If Bettony wants her happily ever after to end well, she’s going to have to find a way to turn her sister back into a person before their mother finds out she’s been dabbling with magic and grounds her for life. And if she wants to do that, she’s going to need more magic. Tracking down the family magic turns out to be surprisingly easy. Now, if only it came with instructions . . .",
