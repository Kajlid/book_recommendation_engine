When the opportunity arises to go on an ambassador’s trip, he jumps at the chance–especially when that trip includes exotic destinations and available women. What more could a rogue prince want? But he never thought he'd find a woman who could bring him to his knees with just one look. He will do anything to protect her and make her his...forever. Jasmine St. Claire appears to have it all, but looks can be deceiving. Escaping her gilded cage by joining a foreign transport, she didn’t plan on leaving one man’s rule for another. Yet it would seem the charming Var prince has decided he wants to claim her for his very own.",
