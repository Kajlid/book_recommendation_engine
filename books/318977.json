  "description": "“One of the best speculative writers of the last decade.”—John ScalziJanuary Fifteenth—the day all Americans receive their annual Universal Basic Income payment.For Hannah, a middle-aged mother, today is the anniversary of the day she took her two children and fled her abusive ex-wife.For Janelle, a young, broke journalist, today is another mind-numbing day interviewing passersby about the very policy she once opposed.For Olivia, a wealthy college freshman, today is “Waste Day”, when rich kids across the country compete to see who can most obscenely squander the government’s money.For Sarah, a pregnant teen, today is the day she’ll journey alongside her sister-wives to pick up the payment­­s that undergird their community—and perhaps embark on a new journey altogether.In this near-future science fiction novella by Nebula Award-winning author Rachel Swirsky, the fifteenth of January is another day of the status quo, and another chance at making lasting change.",
