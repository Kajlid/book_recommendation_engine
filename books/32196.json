  "description": "Trish Perry, author of the charming novel The Guy I’m Not Dating , follows up with a contemporary, humorous tale of how love and life unfold in surprising ways. Rennie Young, heroine of Too Good to Be True , meets the gallant Truman Sayers after she faints in the boys’ department of the local super store. Despite this unromantic introduction, Tru Sayers, a handsome young labor–and–delivery nurse, seems like a gift from God. But a recent divorce and other life disappointments cause Ren to question whether she can trust her heart and God. This clever novel encourages readers to lean on God’s leading and to be open to life after the hurt—even when it seems too good to be true.",
