  "description": "Rigid norms and rules in some cultures suffocate the lives of young people. The book highlights such regulations and their consequences and shows how one young couple subjected to such norms eventually breaks away from them and allows their children to grow unfettered by them.A century-old, nearly 500 letters were found in an attic. The book includes selected 216 of them. It tells the story of a young coupleâ€™s life, married when they were still teenagers, but lived apart intermittently for eight years. The letters describe their love for each other, the agony of separation, taboos of the times, and the hardships endured by women in a joint-family system. Crossing cultural, country, gender, and age boundaries, it takes you on a tumultuous 100-year journey from India to America, shedding the shackles of a joint family and allowing the next generation the freedom to chart their destinies.",
