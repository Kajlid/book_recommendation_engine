  "title": "Canadian Railroad Trilogy",
  "description": "This lavishly illustrated book brings Gordon Lightfoot’s heart-stirring song to readers young and old. Commissioned by the CBC in 1967 to mark Canada’s centennial year it eloquently describes the construction of the transcontinental railway — “an iron road runnin’ from the sea to the sea” — a great feat of nation building that changed Canada forever. Award-winning illustrator Ian Wallace brings the song to visual life with his sweeping landscapes and evocative portrayals of the people who lived the building of the railroad. The book includes Gordon Lightfoot’s music and lyrics, a brief history of the railroad and notes on the illustrations.",
