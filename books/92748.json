  "description": "Leigh Harmond had spent most of her life keeping who and what she was private. It was safer for everyone that way. That is, until one day some stupid vampire decided to stalk her, and what’s worse, he made her use her power. Now, there was no more hiding from Merrick who thought she belonged to him.Rebel knew from the moment he saw her that she was meant to be his mate. So what if he really didn’t know what species she was and if he went about it all wrong. But once he had her, he never planned to let go. Not even if it meant changing what he was, or fighting another to the death. And this time, it just may be to the death….",
