  "description": "In recent times things have become very confusing and we have begun to see in book stores and on websites speculation about future events, based on verses and hadeeths which refer to these future events concerning the signs of the Hour.Every time as a calamity befalls Islam and the Muslim, people begin to look for a way out from them. Sometimes you hear about the appearance of the Mahdi, sometimes you hear that the time for the final confrontation between good and evil is close at hand, other times you hear about land sides in the East or in the West, and so forth.",
