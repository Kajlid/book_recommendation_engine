  "description": "Sydnee Marcola's greatest desire was to join the command of Admiral Jenetta Carver in Region Two, and in pursuit of that goal, she achieved top grades while at the Academy, and then again in advanced studies at the Warship Command Institute. So why have the powers that be chosen to 'waste' a valuable asset by sending her to a 'backwater' command where terminal boredom would appear to be the greatest enemy? Perhaps things aren't destined to remain quiet for long.",
