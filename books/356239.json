  "title": "VIOLETTE SZABO: The Life That I Have",
  "description": "The story of Violette Szabo is one of the most extraordinary in the annals of World War II espionage and covert operations, but her story is little known in the United States. Violette Szabo was by all accounts extraordinarily beautiful, but also totally fearless and a dead shot. She became a member of the Special Operations Executive, Britain's premier sabotage and subversion organization of the time. On June 7, 1944 Violette Szabo left behind a two-year-old daughter to parachute into France on a special mission for SOE.Szabo and other British agents were assigned to organize French resistance fighters to hinder the advance of the SS Das Reich Division to the Normandy beaches. Unfortunately, Szabo's party was soon ambushed by the SS.Unable to walk due to a twisted ankle, Szabo covered the retreat of her comrades with machine-gun fire. Captured, she went through a series of interrogations and changes of confinement before ending up at Ravensbr√ºck, the German all-women's concentration camp. She was finally executed on January 26, 1945. She was 23 years old. This exceptional work has been written with the assistance of Violette Szabo's daughter Tanya, and unravels fact and fiction about one of the most fascinating characters of World War II.",
