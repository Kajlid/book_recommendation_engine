  "description": "The greatest love story ever told…in the Florida Everglades.   Rome When sinister things start happening on Montreux land, there’s only one potential suspect…the Capshaw pack. Those slobbering, mangy cougar shifters are nothing but backstabbers and trouble makers. And now, they’ve taken things too far by targeting my pack. I’m willing to do anything to protect my family, even if it means taking on the Capshaws. But when I see Jules Capshaw for the first time, all thoughts of revenge fly out the window. Who would have thought my greatest enemy would be my fated mate?  Jules Rome Montreux is up to something. When he trespasses onto Capshaw land in the middle of the night, I know it’s with wicked intent. There can’t possibly be another reason for a Montreux to be here. But when he reappears at my birthday party, it’s not hatred or mistrust brewing between us—it’s the lust of two mates. The fact that he’s a panther and my sworn enemy doesn’t matter to my body. And once we are mated, all bets are off.  But something evil is afoot in Verona Forest, and it has nothing to do with the twenty year Capshaw/Montreux feud. There’s a bigger threat.  Can we band together to face the real enemy, or will we let past hatred rule the present?   Read this incredible retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet with a twist you'll never see coming!",
