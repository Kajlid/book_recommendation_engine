  "description": "Not more than one year after the Hunter’s Guild tried to have her executed, Kile Veller has been promoted and conscripted into the military. Assigned to Perha squad, under the command of Sergeant Rodney Wargner, she is sent into the Denal province to recon the fallen town of Coopervill. With twenty unseasoned soldiers, they must defend themselves against the amassing valrik forces, but there is something more sinister that stalks them. An ancient madness that wraps itself in the shadows of the natural world, is using Kile’s own Edge against her. It threatens to strip her of the one thing she has left, her own sanity. When friends are among the fallen, she must turn to new allies, or be lost in the shadows forever. And if that’s not bad enough, somebody has become enamored with the Wild Hunter.",
