Be very afraid…For influential Domme, Anastasia Lucard, the world as she knows is about to change. Bad Things, a well-known kink club in Charleston, South Carolina, is embroiled in a nasty fight with the Healing Souls - a haughty group of Christian faith believers. But, the powerful men aren’t the sons of God. They are monsters fighting to regain control of not only the entire town, but also Anastasia and her Were-Tiger Pride. And they will stop at nothing to get what they want – including slaughtering innocent humans. Brutality and blood is what they crave. Can Anastasia stop them before an ancient curse annihilates mankind? And at what price?",
