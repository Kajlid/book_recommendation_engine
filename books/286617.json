  "title": "Edge Of Darkness",
  "description": "Road rash and Jack meets handcuffs and street smarts. I am a wandering disaster. A hedonist, a lover, a son, and a rebel. My name is Yuma. I’m sober enough to see the need for redemption, but too blind to realize I already found it. I am an independent seeker. An overachiever, a friend, a misfit, and a cop. My name is Lissie. I’m determined enough to find acceptance, but too stubborn to see all I need is my own. We shouldn’t get involved—all the odds are against us—but when bodies turn up on common ground and lines between duty and purpose get blurred, our future becomes clear.",
