  "description": "HATFIELDS AND MCCOYS -- THE NEXT GENERATIONWhen Kaley Jackson came across Slater Rutledge having his morning bath in a mountain stream, she was struck dumb. She was so moved by the sight, she slipped down the ravine and landed at his feet. And he was gentlemanly enough to stand and introduce himself. All of himself. For more than the obvious reasons, the return of Slater Rutledge to the Tennessee mountains was disastrous for Kaley. Even with Christmas coming, the feud that had divided their families thirty years ago was as fresh as the day it was born.

When her plan backfired and she ended up quarantined with Slater, it was anybody's guess who'd survive till Christmas.",
