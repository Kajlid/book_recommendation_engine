  "description": "Lucy has everything a girl could ever ask for. Most popular girl at Abrams High. Countless boys vying for her attention. More friends than she can ever hope for. A father and mother who love her. On the outside, she appears to be the happiest girl in the world. But inside, Lucy holds a dark secret. Her happiness is all a facade, a shell to hide the pain that haunts her. She was there two years ago, on the night, Grace, her sister, was taken under her watch. The guilt and pain have gnawed away at her core, leaving behind a wound that will never heal. The arrival of new student, Eric, however, begins to shake her world. A world that may still find a way to heal, if Lucy is willing to let go of the shackles she carries with her.",
