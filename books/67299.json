  "description": "For every action, there is a reaction—and sometimes we meet redemption in unlikely places…Anne Greene doesn’t know what Peter Van Doorne’s life was like back in Savannah. What she does know is only what he’s told her—that he’s the youngest of five children born to a Southern preacher of Dutch origin, and that coercion pushed him from his charmed life in the South. However, as much as Anne is attracted to him, she sees red flags…. What is Peter not telling her?While Peter struggles to grasp a future he can’t quite keep a hold of, and tries desperately to outrun a past he can’t change, Anne discovers his secret—and the truth that everyone, at some point in his or her life, is Worthy of Thorns.",
