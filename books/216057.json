  "description": "She has no idea what she’s doing. Loose cannons never hit their targets.And they take out plenty of collateral damage.Four years ago Lindsay experienced the unspeakable right before me, and I couldn’t stop them.But that’s all changed now.When her father, Senator Bosworth, contacted me to ask — demand — that I protect her, it was a second chance. A shot at redemption.An opportunity to right an unspeakable wrong.Controlling Lindsay as she seeks her revenge on the monsters who hurt her won’t be hard.Containing my own out-of-control feelings for Lindsay and keeping up this ruse of cold-blooded distance will be.Even harder than admitting to her what really happened that night four years ago.It turns out I don’t have to, though.Someone else did it for me.And I’ll make sure they regret it.* * *A Harmless Little Ruse is the second book in this political thriller/romantic suspense trilogy by USA Today bestselling author Meli Raine, and is entirely from Drew’s perspective.",
