  "description": "Stefan Dalca is infuriatingly handsome. And annoyingly persistent. We’re supposed to hate each other. But apparently he didn’t get the memo, because he’s been asking me out for years.And I always say no. Until today.Today he has something that I desperately need. Today he’s a savior, and I’m his prize.Our time together starts out as a simple transaction. Three dates. No touching. No telling anyone. And definitely no falling in love.But with every intimate conversation, and each stolen glance, the tension between us builds.The way he looks at me gives me butterflies. And when he finally touches m? We sizzle.Stefan makes me feel seen in a way no other person has before. He cherishes my words as passionately as my body.He makes me laugh. He makes me blush. He calls me kitten.He’s not the villain he’s been made out to be.And suddenly I find myself longing for him in a way the people closest to me wouldn’t approve of or understand.Giving in to Stefan Dalca is playing with fire.But with him I don’t even mind the heat.",
