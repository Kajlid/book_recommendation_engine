  "description": "Playland of the Kings is the story of a man’s quest for Truth, his true identity, and his connection to Life. It is a journey of a soul looking to know itself and the world. The reader is taken on a delightful and torturous ride that gives the rare opportunity to witness the unapologetic psychology of a man striving to be more than just a man.Part One of the Story, Rainbow Colored Eyes, is the beginning of the adventure. At eighteen, Eric quits university in Boston and head’s out on a road trip to Vancouver with his oldest brother. Life feels stale and incomplete. He wants to find out what life is all about. He wants to find something worth living for. He wants to know what his destiny is. The trip to Vancouver transforms into a solo journey to San Francisco, Central America, and South America in what becomes a self-constructed rite of passage in becoming a man. His travels into the poverty of the Third World, into war torn countries, into jungles, and to the summits of mountains, leads him to understand that breath-taking beauty and soul numbing ugliness can exist together in the world—as well as within a person.",
