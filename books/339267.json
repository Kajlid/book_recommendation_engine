Now, that wonderful message is available in a beautiful new package from Barbour. Commenting on the Song of Solomon, author Frances J. Roberts writes, \"It is the call of the Bride to the Bridegroom as she cries, 'Make haste, my Beloved.' It is indeed heartening to know that it is HE who makes the haste!\" That message of God reaching out to needy people pervades the five dozen readings of Make Haste My Beloved, and ensures a transforming reading experience for all.",
