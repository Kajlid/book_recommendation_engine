  "description": "The sizzling tale of Perseus & Medusa featuring female rage, enemies-to-lovers, and high-stakes action\nMedusa wants only one thing: revenge against the gods who abused and shunned her. Perseus would do anything to save his family from King Polydectes, the tyrant ruling his home – even slaying the infamous monster in exchange for his mother’s freedom. Yet, when the hero and the gorgon collide, it remains unclear whether they will tear each other apart or become unlikely allies – powerful enough to challenge even Olympus.When Perseus finds Medusa, she is not the mindless beast he expected. He cannot bring himself to kill her and takes her prisoner instead. However, Perseus has neither considered how infuriatingly stubborn his captive is, nor that he would incur Poseidon’s wrath by sparing Medusa. When a violent storm blows them off course, Perseus and Medusa must set their differences aside to survive the treacherous waters.As a bond forms between them, they are caught in the web of the powerful players that pitted them against each other. Can Perseus save his mother while sparing Medusa’s life? Can Medusa withstand the wrath of the Olympians she has provoked?",
