  "description": "Now a major motion picture! Ian-s best friend, Lance, has a knack for finding both. Unfortunately Ian-s too nice to get close to either. He-s never kissed a girl-or even had a chance-until he meets the perfect girl online. Now only a 935-mile road trip lies between Ian and something that he-s been thinking about roughly every eleven seconds since puberty hit. There-s also the small problem of the Creature, Ian-s ancient yellow Oldsmobile, and its impending collapse on the side of the road. As if that weren-t enough, Lance and gal pal Felicia crash the ride for what seems to be the sole purpose of taunting Ian. With all these obstacles in the way, will Ian-s drive bring him any closer to what he wants?",
