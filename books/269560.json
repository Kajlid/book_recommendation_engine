A second chance.Jake Taylor has made a few terrible decisions, but none worse than the one in Afghanistan that cost him his best friend and his leg.Or so he thinks, until he comes home from war to discover a seven-year-old son he never knew existed.Jake can’t regret the blissful nights he spent with Mira in his arms, or the boy with his eyes, but he can leave them alone so they don’t become yet another one of his mistakes.He’ll rehab his body, figure out how to find purpose again—and keep things simple with the woman he once craved desperately.Except the sizzling attraction that drew him to Mira is still fierce, and staying away from her is a lot harder than he ever expected…Mira Shipley has promised herself that if she ever sees Jake Taylor again, she’ll tell him he has a son.She isn’t expecting to run into him at the physical therapist’s office, where he’s learning to live with an above-the-knee amputation.She can’t blame him for being a grumpy jerk under the circumstances, but it would be a lot easier to ignore him if she didn’t desperately need child care for her son.And if Jake didn’t make her feel brand new and dazzlingly alive.She knows she needs to protect her son’s feelings—but no matter how hard she tries, she can’t forget the long, sweet nights she and Jake spent learning each other’s bodies and each other’s secrets…",
