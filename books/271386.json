  "description": "When I fell, I fell hard.  After refusing to choose between good and evil, high or low, Heaven or Hell, I was exiled and fell from my pedestal and landed in a cesspit that was Earth. Stripped of my wings, and left with only two of the five gifts that I was gifted with from Him, I've been forced to live my immortal life amongst the humans.  Make no mistake, as much as a punishment for choosing neither side this was supposed to be, it's become my sanctuary, my haven. Although a disaster when I landed, Earth has become my home, a place where I can blend with the humans, live my endless life moving from one place to another.  That is until my home is invaded by four angels, all hell bent on making me to choose a side. They're in for a sure surprise when they realise my choice will forever and always be the same: humanity. A foreign concept to any angel. Well, any angel but me, it seems.  Yes, humanity have their flaws, but so do I. I'll choose my perfectly imperfect life, and there's not a damn thing any angel can do to change that.  So, yeah, I fell hard. But I fell for the flaws of being human even harder.   *This is a Reverse Harem novel! #whychoose *Recommended 18+ due to mature language and situations.",
