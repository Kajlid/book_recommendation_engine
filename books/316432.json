  "description": "A steamy paranormal romance set in the Highlands of ScotlandThe realms of immortals are on the brink of collapse, and the human woman who is the key to its survival finds herself at the mercy of the king of the Fenrir, a dangerous and powerful man who seeks to use her for himself… and ignites a burning passion within her. Ulric McCallen will stop at nothing to undo the decades-long curse that threatens the very existence of his clan on Midgard. He finds the solution in a very unlikely source — a wee little human of ethereal beauty and fiery spirit. The curse that binds Yggdrasil has marked her for death, and the king of beasts must somehow protect the woman he hungers to possess from the dark forces that hunt her, and save the world itself from certain destruction. Evaline Headen is making a last ditch effort to save herself from a mysterious illness, which has baffled every doctor and specialist she’s seen. She’s in Scotland, trying to find a witch. But instead of a cure, she finds herself falling straight into danger, and into the arms of a tall, handsome stranger… with big teeth, and deadly claws. She has no choice but to seek refuge with him as she tries to unravel the secrets of her condition and her past. But the truth can bring their hearts together, or be the undoing of them both.",
