  "description": "He swore to end her.All Magnus had to do was pick up a package and get his brother’s child back. A simple task that any Caster worth his salt could have done in his sleep, except nothing had been that simple for him in years.For centuries, Magnus relished in the slaughter and annihilation of the demon race. Ridding the world — and hell — of every last one was an oath he was determined to keep. But Magnus had his own gnawing beasts devouring his soul with memories of a past he was powerless to change.Zara was something else. She was beautiful and powerful, and the very definition of evil. Yet everything about her called to him, beckoned him to forget his nightmares and vengeance. She could fix everything if he would just submit, but she was the very thing who had ruined him in the first place and Magnus submitted to no one.But Zara proves to be much more than just the source of his agony. She’s a key to ending the war, a power that can tilt the scales and save them all, or will she be the reason he loses everything?She may end him first.",
