  "description": "He's every woman's fantasy...After a string of disastrous relationships, Emily Albright has had it with modern men.She'd rather curl up with Pride and Prejudice and step into a time where men were honorable and strode across fields in breeches, their damp shirts clinging to their chests. The men she meets are more into pleated trousers, two-timing and internet porn.So when her best friend invites her to Mexico for a week of margaritas and manhunting, Emily books a guided tour of Jane Austen country instead.There are no dream men here. The coach is full of pensioners, apart from one Spike Hargreaves, a foul-tempered journalist writing a piece on why most women would love to date Mr Darcy.But then she walks into a room and finds herself face-to-face with Darcy himself. And every woman's fantasy suddenly becomes one woman's reality...Alexandra Potter makes dreams come true in this fun, feel-good fairy-tale about life, love and dating literature's most eligible bachelor.",
