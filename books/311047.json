  "description": "I’d been prepared to die on this planet… but now I have something to live for.\nZecriI’ve waited many cycles to carry out my rescue mission for a fellow warrior. But when I re-enter the misery I escaped to free him, I get more than I bargained for. Much more. A human female who’s as scarred as I am, and who’s willing to risk her life for the most precious thing on this desert planet.SybilThis place absolutely sucks, and I’ve been in some pretty terrible places. I would have run myself through with one of my captor’s blades long ago if it wasn’t for this innocent creature who’s dependent on me. I won’t let her down. I can’t. But I’m only a human on a planet full of monsters.Until I meet the most deadly monster of them all. He’s scarred and wears an emotionless mask, but I can see the simmering rage and revenge underneath it all. I also see a soul needs me as much as I need him. But first, we have to get free. Maybe together… we can be heroes.",
