But the next morning, when she finds herself a long way from home, alone in the wilds with a total stranger, the lucky break turns into a whole different game. Especially since Lindsay, having just broken up with her straitlaced boyfriend, has sworn she’s ready to have sex with the first man to come along.Cade McKenna’s life is finally looking up. A pickup truck, the open road, nothing but freedom ahead. And with any luck, he’ll find a woman to put an end to the past year of enforced celibacy. As soon as possible. He has no idea just how soon, until his first stop, when he discovers he has a stowaway, a woman who’s equally deprived and equally ready to make all that deprivation history.For three days and nights, the chance-met passionate strangers slake each other’s sexual thirst and stoke each other’s desires. Until they have to face the reality of their very separate worlds.",
