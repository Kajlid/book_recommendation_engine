  "title": "The Big Fellow: Michael Collins and the Irish Revolution",
  "description": "In 1916, a young man named Michael Collins returned to his native Ireland, after ten years in voluntary exile in London, to join one of the most impassioned and complicated revolutions in history. Playfully nicknamed \"The Big Fellow,\" Collins began to take a key role in the uprisings, eventually becoming a revered revolutionary leader.Acclaimed writer Frank O'Connor, a man who himself fought in the Irish Civil War, traces Collin's life from the day he returned to Dublin to the day a young Irish soldier shot him dead on a country road.The Big Fellow achieves a narrative both probing and poetic as it chronicles the life of a man so charismatic that he made people \"aware of his presence even when he was not visible, through that uncomfortable magnetism of the very air, a tingling of the nerves.\"",
