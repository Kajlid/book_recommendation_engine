  "title": "Twelve Ways to Please and Keep Your Woman or Wife: Do These Things, and No One Will Take Your Woman or Wife",
  "description": "Women are the strength and foundation of any relationship or marriage; however, quite often they are taken for granted or unappreciated. Most men agree that their women are special; still, they fail to do what is required of them to keep them happy or satisfied. Every relationship and marriage has more obstacles that make them unsuccessful, and mainly because people stop doing, what they did to win the heart of their mates. Nowadays, women work, take care of the children, and contribute with finances of their families, and all they ask for is a thank you or something that says, \"I appreciate you .\" Moreover, after conversing with over a hundred women on family, love, relationship and marriage, I enclosed here in this book the twelve important things they ask of their men. Today, it is easy for women to leave their men, and find success on their own or with another man. Therefore, it is important for men to understand the signs that are driving their women away, and do the simple things that are conducive to keeping their women happy. I understand that implementing these twelve things will not be easy, because it takes giving more of oneself, which sometimes make men appear vulnerable or 'unmanly'. However, we are talking about pleasing and bringing love and joy to the special women in their lives, besides, if they refuse, another man would relish the opportunity. Men know that their women love them (at least I hope they do), and making them feel secure, and needed in relationships and marriages is what make women stand by their man during trying times. If men apply these twelve essential things, I guarantee that their women would be more giving, understanding, sexual and pleasing to be around.",
