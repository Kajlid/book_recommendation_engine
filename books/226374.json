  "description": "I Don’t Want to Eat Bugs was written for my daughter, who was two when I wrote this story and didn’t like salad, but now she’s four and a half and loves it—if I give her plenty of salad dressing! (But don’t worry—this isn’t a book about eating salad.) Of course birds, cats, and dogs have a very different idea of what's good to eat, but through this fun adventure, Lisbon learns there is also food meant just for her—and it's good, especially compared with all the offerings from her animal friends.My daughter and I privately call this book the Ice Cream Story (she LOVES ice cream so there had to be ice cream involved), and now whenever something funny happens, she says, \"We should write a new ice cream story about that.\"And we have! I Don’t Want to Eat Bugs is the first book in a planned series called Lisbon’s Misadventures. I’ve written the next three books in the series, and Tim Petersen is hard at work creating the illustrations. Tim is obviously a fabulous artist, and I’m excited to be working with him.
