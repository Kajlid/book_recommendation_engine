  "description": "Dana Ryan is a nomad. Her address is the world and the world has been good to her, but a short-notice invitation to her kid sister’s wedding suddenly shifts this very world on its axis.  Chelsea Ryan is eighteen. Fresh out of high school and still living in the same tiny town Dana fled three years ago, she’s been nowhere and done little. She doesn’t know what the world has to offer, and she intends to marry her first and only boyfriend. Enter the voice of reason and experience.  But their reunion is fraught with secrets and surprises. Dana’s parents are welcoming but distant, the groom-to-be is no longer the boy Dana remembers, and the best man is the boy she almost gave up the world for but left behind.  It turns out life back home has gone on without her - infinitely more complex than she could have imagined - and as the wedding approaches, Dana realises her nomad ways have cost her a lot more than just foreign currency.",
