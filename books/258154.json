  "description": "Every prince needs his Princess.  Amelia dreams of celebrity. So much so that she’s made a career out of it as a celebrity wedding photographer. It’s her dream job, and one she’s worked very hard to achieve. And when two hugely famous celebrities end up tying the knot in the wedding of the decade, Amelia is there to document it all.  And the A-listers aren’t the only ones finding love. Because in attendance is Prince Erich -- dashing, handsome and something out of a fairy tale. Electricity. They are instantly drawn to each other, but they end up going their separate ways.  But the Prince is on a mission. Escaped from his home country of Kastav, and from his oppressive uncle the King, he has three months to make an important choice. Time is ticking and when Erich the prince pursues Amelia the photographer, there’s no telling what will develop.  Will distance and social class stop these two lovebirds from flying off into the sunset of their lives together? And will what starts as a summer fling turn into a love for the ages?",
