  "title": "Give Me Shelter: Stories About Children Who Seek Asylum",
  "description": "The phrase “asylum seeker” is one heard in the media all the time. It stimulates fierce and controversial debate in arguments about migration, race, and religion. The movement of people from poor or struggling countries to those where there may be opportunities for a better life has been a constant in human history, but it is something with particular relevance in this time of wide-scale political and social upheaval. Featuring stories from youth based in trouble spots around the world — including Kosovo, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Eritrea, Zaire, Sudan, Somalia, Iraq, Zimbabwe, and Kurdistan — this collection of stories spotlights people who have been forced to leave their homes or families to seek help and shelter elsewhere. This book has no political axe to grind, simply recording the truth of these children’s stories without assigning blame. Some are about young people traveling to other countries; others are concerned with young ones left behind when parents are forced to flee. These are stories about physical and emotional suffering but also about humanity — of both those who endure unimaginable hardship and those who help them.",
