But when an upstart little planet called Earth threatens her worlds with its fleet of spaceships, the fate of her people lies in her hands. She must bind herself to a barbarian from the rogue world—or face the destruction of her own.Fighter pilot Jared Jasper knows the trick Earth pulls on the alien invaders isn’t a permanent solution. What they need is a peace treaty. It just never occurs to him that he will wind up on the bargaining table. Playing the pushover groom to a bossy alien babe who likes throwing daggers is not exactly his idea of fun. But with billions of people depending on him, he doesn’t have much choice—sleep with the enemy…or bring on interstellar war.An arranged marriage with a twist, this galactic alliance may just turn into a love match.The Borderlands Series:Book #1 WARLEADERBook #2 HUNTING THE WARLORD'S DAUGHTERBook #3 RAIDER BORN<>Three Borderlands prequels: (The Otherworldly Men Series):Book #1 GUARDIAN ALIENBook #2 ROYAL RECRUITBook #3 CYBORG AND THE SINGLE MOM",
