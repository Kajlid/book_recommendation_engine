  "description": "Alexandra Drake is determined that her spoiled, Southern upbringing will have no effect on her new life as one of the few female Pinkerton agents. Tucker Waite is convinced that the wealthy heiress has no idea what she is in for and will get him killed. From the moment they say ‘I do’ and marry for the sake of their first assignment in Oregon, Alexandra will not let Tucker order her around, and Tucker refuses to let Alexandra have her own way.  When every battle between them creates sparks, and every step in their mission puts them in danger, will they be able to avoid igniting something that could jeopardize both themselves and the innocent lives they're trying to save?",
