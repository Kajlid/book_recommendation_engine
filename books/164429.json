  "description": "They put golden tinsel on his branchesAnd golden bellsAnd green iciclesAnd silver starsAnd red and green and blue and purple chains of shining Christmas balls.All alone in an empty field grew a little fir tree. It dreamed of being part of a forest-or part of anything at all. Then one winter day, a man takes the little fir tree away and it finds itself at the center of a little boy's very special celebration.This treasured story by the legendary Margaret Wise Brown has been newly illustrated by award-winning artist Jim LaMarche. Warm, glowing paintings complement the gentle text to capture the true heart of Christmas.",
