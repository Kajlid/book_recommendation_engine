Laney Monroe’s life looks nothing like she’d planned. She certainly hadn’t pictured herself as a twenty-five-year-old single mom with a boring job, a freeloading brother, and an exhibitionist son who worries more than Shaggy and Scooby Doo put together. When her brother finally steps up and applies for a job, Laney never imagines it might lead to an opportunity for her as well – an opportunity at love.  Nate Murphy has always been about family. When you come from an Irish family, it’s hard not to be. But when a family emergency brings him home to North Carolina, Nate is faced with some difficult choices. Can you choose what you want over what your family needs? Then Laney Monroe walks onto his construction site and Nate decides that she just might make those choices a hell of a lot easier – or maybe this girl will make life more complicated than ever.  \"The Fix\" is the first book in The Carolina Connections Series from Sylvie Stewart. Each book can be read as a standalone with a HEA.This book contains adult language and sexual content not suitable for those under 18.Cover Photography by Walt Stoneburner",
