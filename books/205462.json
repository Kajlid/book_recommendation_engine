  "description": "Billy Blue-Eyes She's my number one fan, my lady in red. For years I've seen her at my shows - a beacon of beauty in the sea of faces - so close, but so far. If I reach for her in the crowd, a thousand hands will rip us apart. I play my guitar for her so she'll hear me through the screams, my chords saying, \"This song is for you. Can you feel it?\" I don't know her name, I only know that when I set eyes on her at Rebel with no barriers between us, I'm not taking any chances for her to get away. Rose They say that fangirl crushes are supposed to go away when you get older. Whoever said that hasn't heard of Billy Blue-Eyes. That man has owned me, heart, body, and soul since the day I discovered his music when I was eighteen. I've watched every music video, listened to every song, been to every show I could afford, and read every interview. You could say I'm obsessed. I've tried for years to get him out of my head, but I keep coming back for more. Until I met him. Now he won't let me get away even if I try. It's just a fangirl crush. It can't be love. Can it?  Make My Heart Sing is an erotic romance with lots of steamy explicit scenes for the adult reader.",
