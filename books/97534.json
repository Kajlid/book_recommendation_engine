  "description": "“Who are you?” I said, voice shaking—near hysterics.His eyes found mine, but I could not read them. “I’m not entirely human.”In late nineteenth century London, seventeen-year-old Selena Bancroft has been blessed with beauty and fortune—and the expectation that she marry when she comes of age. Consumed with wanderlust, a beau is the last thing Selena wants. However, there is something inexplicable about Gabriel Easton that draws Selena’s attention. When she decides to spend the summer in Germany away from the hated social season, Selena brazenly flouts her debutante duties—despising the dresses, the suitors, and feeling like a pretty trinket at auction—and is unexpectedly drawn into Gabriel’s world. But Gabriel has a secret, one that will change Selena’s world forever. Will she willingly sacrifice everything for the one thing she never wanted?",
