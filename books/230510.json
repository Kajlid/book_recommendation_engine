  "title": "Dire Consequences: A Kelly Murdoch Adventure",
  "description": "Something in the woods harbors an old grudge, and it's not alone. A cryptic video from her uncle sends Kelly Murdoch on an investigation into his disappearance years earlier, and a quest to complete his mysterious project. But dormant resentments are stirred and all hell breaks loose, leaving her dog with a litter of weird puppies, and Kelly clinging to the bitter dregs of her courage.Between the naysayers, the collaborators and the way-too-hot, Kelly maneuvers around her friendships, fear and non-stop plumbing inquisitions to try to fulfill her uncleâ€™s request without meeting his same fate. This playful and fast-paced romp through the preternatural is woven with chilling encounters, bizarre twists and a few shots of top-shelf tequila.",
