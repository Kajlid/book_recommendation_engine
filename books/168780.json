  "description": "A slightly pampered girl allows her avoidance behavior to isolate her from the world... and it's only when she takes the final step that she realizes the wall she's built in the name of safety is also the one that will hold her prisoner forever... unless she discovers how to destroy it.  The only one who can break a neurosis... is the one who has it.   Combining elements from the Snow Maiden, Schneekind, Snegurochka tales with those of the Snow Queen; Winter Queen continues a new series: THAW.  \"... an utterly lovely sequel...\" U.S. reviewer Shantelle Mary  Praise for previous works:  \"...[E. Kaiser Writes] created a world that is easy to visualize, and people you'd like to spend time with. When you finish reading this novel you'll be left wanting more.\" Canadian reviewer Kathryn Svendson  \"...[E. Kaiser Writes] has created a heroine worthy to stand alongside such relatable and spirited female protagonists as Miri from \"Princess Academy\" and Alanna from \"The Song of the Lioness\" series.\" British author Melika Dannese Lux",
