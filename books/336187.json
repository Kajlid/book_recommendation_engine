  "title": "Ten Nights' Dreams",
  "description": "This collection of ten connected stories or dreams has a surrealistic atmosphere. Some are weird, others are grotesquely funny. Among the ten nights, the first, second, third, and fifth nights start with the same sentence \"This is the dream I dreamed.\" Whether Sosecki actually had these dreams or whether they were complete fictions is not known.",
