  "description": "In the year 1983, a cargo plane crashes onto a desert island, somewhere in the Caribbean. The four survivors know their priorities well: find shelter, find food and fresh water, get rescued, and, above all, find the mysterious missing cargo. But, as time passes by, these priorities wane, as all of them seem to be having too good of a time. As they get to know each other better, they start re-examining their whole lives and the paths that led them to this island.In the year 2028, a woman called Clarice Skaugen returns to her childhood home in Minneapolis for a family gathering. She is haunted and driven by nostalgia and memories of her childhood days, but she quickly puts it all aside when she realizes that her twin brother is missing, and that it seems like she is the only one in the family that notices or cares at all about his disappearance.These two narratives twist around each other only to converge in an exciting finale and provide the answers sought from the start, not just \"what\" and \"how\", but, more importantly, \"why\".",
