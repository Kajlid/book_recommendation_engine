  "description": "“An explosively sexy start to the Motor City Royals series” from the author of the Billion $ Bastards Trilogy (Heroes & Heartbreakers).\nBorn into a family whose wealth grew from the seedy world of big-time crime, Ezekiel “Zee” Chase ran away as a teenager and made a home for himself on the streets of Detroit. By day, the mechanic works at a local garage. But by night, he throws down with the best of them in Detroit’s gritty underground fighting scene. With all those muscles, he’s never had trouble with women—until he meets one who challenges him to the greatest fight of his life . . .Tamara Eliot is a hardworking corporate high-flyer who appreciates the finer things in life. More than anything, though, she likes to be in control—and when Zee explodes into her life, she feels anything but. He’s the definition of a bad boy: brash, fiery, and of course, irresistibly hot. And there’s a darkness about him that keeps her coming back for more. As Zee takes Tamara deeper into a world she never knew existed, she just might prove to be the one opponent he won’t be able to dominate—at least not without some pleasurable convincing . . .",
