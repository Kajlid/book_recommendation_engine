  "description": "Blind dates are the work of the devil… I’m a serial-one nighter, and my best friend is my inner slut. He’s temptation personified, and his best friend is definitely his cock. Carter Hughes gave me a taste of my own medicine. He wham, bam, thank you ma’amed me into oblivion, and I hell yes, oh God, right there’d him into paradise. I thought that would be the end—until my mother’s double booking for a consultation winds me right back up at the place I swore I’d never go again. Now I’m fighting for an interior design contract I don’t even want... Just to make a point. If I get it, the date won’t be the devil. Carter Hughes will be.   (Disclaimer: BLIND DATE was originally published as a short story in the ONE anthology. It has now been expanded into a longish novella, approx. 47k words.)​",
