  "description": "Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition of ASIN B00K0XNSG0.The company Cyberwarfare pioneer, Martin Spencer, founded wasn't supposed to fire him. Spencer knows too much and can do far too much damage to U.S. national security. Years ago Spencer led a failed attack against Iranian computer systems that stranded his Cyber weapon payload behind enemy lines. U.S. officials fear the Iranians reverse-engineered Spencerâ€™s creation and suspect Iranian operatives will now seek his help to turn his creation into a terrorist weapon. Learning that Spencer's firing and ongoing midlife crisis are driving him to leave his wealth and marriage to pursue his first love, an Iranian national by the name of Sasha Javan, the chase is on. U.S. government and foreign operatives are gunning for him, and so is his spurned wife, Cynthia, herself a retired intelligence operative.The pursuit intensifies when a major Cyber attack brings down the Los Angeles power grid and spreads throughout California. On the run and in hiding with Sasha, Spencer learns that a former colleague, Julian Rogers, is cooperating with Iranian sponsored terrorists. Martin Spencer must now decide whether to reject his former handlers and seek the quiet life he always wanted with Sasha or confront Julian to thwart attacks aiming to crash financial systems and commandeer a third of the U.S. nuclear weapon arsenal. Along the way, he must decide whether to reunite with Cynthia, who supports him in the midst of his struggle to resolve the impact of the weapons he has created and undo the personal regrets he has reaped to advance his career.",
