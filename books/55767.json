  "description": "Secrets and all will be revealed and nothing will ever be the same… Kit Hawthorn has been waiting for this moment all of her seventeen The moment when she can finally break free from her ordinary and neatly ordered life. The moment when she can defy her overprotective father and change the way everyone sees her. It was the message that started it. A jumbled, frantic text message sent in haste from her friend Jason. In the end it was clear, he was in trouble. Armed with only one small clue, Kit recklessly sets off for London in search of her missing friend and the jewels he is suspected of stealing. What she finds in London is not what she expects, and the plot she uncovers will haunt her long after it is over. In a desperate chase against time and a dangerous enemy, Kit will use every resource she can to follow the trail of clues that will lead to Jason’s salvation. With only the help of a mysterious old man and her own intuition, she will follow the path that is laid out in front of her, to whatever end. Countless secrets will be revealed, including the face of a long hidden enemy, and Kit will learn the stunning truth about those closest to her. In the end, she will discover her true self and realize that even ordinary people can accomplish extraordinary things. London Escape is the first installment in The Halcyon Legacy.
