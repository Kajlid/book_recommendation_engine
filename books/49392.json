  "description": "How often do you get to see a car tipped or stores looted? Seventeen-year-old Daniel gets caught up in a post-game riot, and then he and his best friend escape police by breaking into a store. They only intend to cut through to the alley, but rioters follow and trash the place. Daniel prevents an arsonist from torching the store; the next day he's a hero while his friend is outed as a rioter. Can Daniel save face, and will it cost him his friend?",
