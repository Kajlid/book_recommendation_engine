  "description": "The Devil DeVere Series- Library Journal Best E-Book Romance 2012 This short erotic installment in the award-winning Devil DeVere series can stand alone as a complete story, but also serves to bridge The Devil’s Match and Jewel of the East (Salime and Simon’s story).In her last month of pregnancy, Diana, Viscountess DeVere, has barely settled into her new life and role as “the devil” DeVere’s wife, when her increasingly restless husband receives an urgent summons to London. When Diana inadvertently discovers a message he received from a known courtesan with whom he was formerly linked, she fears her marriage is over before it has begun.***They were barely three months into a marriage that had begun on rather shaky ground. Was it possible that for him, the novelty of it had already worn off? This had always been Diana’s greatest fear, for Ludovic was a man with a voracious sensual appetite, one he had honed with years of endless variety and constant, unrestrained indulgence. Diana, on the contrary, had known only one true lover—this same perplexing man who was now her husband—the one who had made her heavy with his child…and now left her alone in a cold bed.THE DEVIL DEVERE SERIES:A Wild Night's Bride #1The Virgin Huntress#2The Devil You Know #3The Devil's Match #4A Devil's Touch #4.5Jewel Of the East #5PREQUEL VIGNETTES:Devil in the Making #1The Trouble With Sin #2Ned's Folly#3",
