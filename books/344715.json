  "description": "Val Rushford needs a break ... from boys!After dumping her cheating boyfriend, Val is looking forward to some time to herself. But instead of getting peace and solace, Val is bombarded by gifts, texts, e-mails, and wall posts from boys all over. Val is overwhelmed by the attention and decides to swear off guys completelyâ€”no flirting, going out, or making out (at least until the end of the year).Val's two best friends make a wager that her little hiatus from boys won't even last a month. Val takes the bet and tries to secure her win by burying herself in a class project. So what if she's paired with the emo hipster Adam? He's so not her type. But as Val spends more time with Adam, feelings begin surfacing. With her heart and pride at stake, Val's got to choose: Win the bet or win the boy?",
