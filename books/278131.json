Her best friends are volunteering at a community garden for the seventh grade service project, while she’s stuck teaching health to first graders with the class Queen of Mean, Fiona, and preppie know-it-all Preston. Now Fiona’s acting super-sweet, but Amy’s not willing to be fooled. Fiona doesn’t do favors unless she gets something in return—could it be that she just wants Amy’s friendship?",
