  "description": "A TEXAS CHRISTMASâ€¦ FAMILY STYLE! Callie McCabe-Grimes has one thing on her holiday wish list: to make this the best Christmas ever for her little boy. Without including Nash Echols, whose team of lumberjack cowboys is creating a Texas-size racket at the Christmas tree farm next door! But she has no defense against two determined males when her son decides Nash is the extra-special present he wants from Santa. Just the sight of the beautiful widow who bought the sprawling spread east of his puts Nash in the yuletide spirit. Callie and the toddler in the tyke-size cowboy hat fill his head with visions of the three of them together under one roof. That is, if Callie can let go of her past and picture a future with her one and only Lone Star cowboy!",
