  "description": "When you make an enemy of a man like Vitaly Karahalios, there is nowhere on earth you can go to escape his wrath. He'll find you. He found me, he found Roth. He found Layla. He found us, and now the unthinkable has happened. Someone I love has been kidnapped. Again. This isn't a fairy tale. Not everyone will get a happily ever after. Sometimes we can't just walk away from the past. Love doesn't always save the day. The beast won't always get his beauty. But maybe, just maybe we can get our happy ending.",
