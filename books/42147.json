  "title": "Blood Money: Why the Powerful Turn a Blind Eye While China Kills Americans",
  "description": "AN INSTANT #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLERIt’s often said that China is in a cold war with America. The reality is far the war is hot, and the body count is one-sided.China is killing Americans and working aggres­sively to maximize the carnage while our leaders remain passive and, in some cases, compliant. Why?If anyone could crack the code, it’s the renowned nonpartisan investigator Peter Schweizer. Schweizer’s previous three number one New York Times bestsellers sent shock waves through official Wash­ington, sparking FBI investigations and congres­sional probes that continue to this day.For Blood Money, Schweizer and his team of forensic investigators spent more than two years scouring a trove of restricted Chinese military documents, data-mining a mountain of American financial records, and tracking US political lead­ers’ investments and family businesses. Schweizer unloads bombshell after bombshell, exposing the Chinese Communist Party’s covert operations in the American drug trade, social justice movement, and medical establishment to sow chaos and deca­dence in the United States.A towering achievement of investigative jour­nalism, Blood Money is one of those rare books that makes you clearly see the world anew.",
