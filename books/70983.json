  "title": "Visitor in Lunacy",
  "description": "It is 1897, and confined to his room in Carfax Criminal Lunatic Asylum, Dr Richard Renfield is dying from injuries which could not be self-inflicted. His door has been barricaded from the inside and the Night Watcher swears nobody has been allowed in or out. With his last words he imparts a dire warning: “He is here.”Moving between London, Yorkshire and Ceylon across the 19th Century, Visitor in Lunacy re-imagines the downfall of the enigmatic inmate from Bram Stoker's Dracula: from a feared and respected member of the government's Lunacy Commission to a resident of one of the madhouses he once oversaw. It is a bizarre and disturbing tale of memory, regret and horror; of how the terrible secrets of a person's childhood can inescapably shape their life.",
