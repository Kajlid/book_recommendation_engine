  "description": "Tommy Reid is a haunted man. Haunted by rejection and being judged based on social status and money. After a particularly cruel rebuff, he sets out on a mission to show them what they're missing out on. He's a regular guy with a regular job but possesses a skill set that is far from \"regular\". Tommy knows what he has to offer. Knows that not only is he a great guy, but heâ€™s a master in the bedroom. He can make their bodies sing to a tune that only he can play. Can make them want things they never knew they wanted...and as they flip through the pages of his playbook, they'll wish they had never judged the book by its cover.",
