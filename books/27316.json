  "description": "Closing the door doesn't always keep you safe--Laura Elizabeth Clark saw herself as a peacemaker. Until the day she went against her parents' wishes and married Harry Kendall, a brilliant history professor who happens to be black. But happily-ever-after goes horribly wrong one night when an intruder forces his way into their bedroom and commits an unthinkable crime. The police say it was a random act of violence, but Harry will never forget those words whispered in the darkness: 'White should stay with white.' Seeking justice means confronting a group of white supremacists--the Ivory Nation--with its hush-hush ties to political power. Suddenly, opening the door on truth could threaten not just Harry and Laura's love, but their lives--.",
