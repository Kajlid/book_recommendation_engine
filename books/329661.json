  "description": "The Royal Bastards Liverpool chapter will return with Into the Dark.MarleighOne night was enough to change my life. I was taken, plucked out of my life and forced into hell. Gaining my freedom didn’t unshackle the chains around me. It made them tighten. I’m fuelled by my need to avenge the wrongs done to me and those I was forced to leave behind. I’ll stop at nothing to achieve that.I don’t need a brave knight riding a motorcycle and wearing leather to save me. He doesn’t agree. He thinks I’m a damsel in distress, but I’m focused on my task—destroying the man who ripped my world apart.MacheteMarleigh needs to realise I’m not walking away and leaving her to face these demons alone. This fight is mine as much as it’s hers. We’ve been tracking the men who are operating in our city without our permission and we’re ready to bring them down. We’ll stop at nothing to return safety to our streets, but Marleigh seems determined to get in my way at every turn. She needs to back off before she gets hurt. She’s under my skin and as much as I want to deny it, I want to claim her as mine. The problem is she’s walking into danger and I’m not sure if I can save her.*Warning : Contains dark emotional scenes that may trigger some readers.",
