  "title": "Emmanuel's Book: A Manual for Living Comfortably in the Cosmos",
  "description": "Here is the revealing underground classic, a work  that stands beside the \"Seth\" books as a  delightful and invaluable guide to our inner  spirit and our outer world. Emmanuel speaks to us  through Pat Rodegast and shares his wisdom and  insights on all aspects of life. Beautifully written and illustrated, Emmanuel's Book I  is to be treasured, enjoyed and passed on to a  friend. Emmanuel says: \"The gifts I wish to  give you are my deepest love, the safety of truth,  the wisdom of the universe and the reality of God .  . . . The issue of whether there is a Greater  Reality or not, for me at least, has been settled. I  know that there is. So I will speak to you from  the knowing that I possess.\" Ram Dass, in the  introduction, says: \"Being with Emmanuel one  comes to appreciate the vast evolutionary context  in which our lives are being lived . . . And at  each moment we are at just the right place in the  journey. As Emmanuel points out, 'Who you are is a  necessary step to being who you will be.'\"",
