  "description": "When Roxy Thompson decides to explore the wilderness on horseback, she only intends to be gone a few hours and figures it will be safe enough-- as long as she stays on the trails close to the resort. What she doesn't count on is a mountain lion spooking her horse and then turning its sights on her. A wolf saves her in the nick of time, but itâ€™s the handsome recluse Caleb that nurses her back to health, and then some. Saved by the Alpha is an erotic paranormal short of approx. 7,500 words and is intended for mature audiences only.",
