I agreed of course, mainly because it was his last dying wish to see me with someone who he knew would treat me well.Will I love him? Will I hate him? Maybe both with a little bit of crazyI know I'll fail, I'm selfish, self-centered and shallow. I just hope he's prepared for when I do.This is our story, it has: a Channing Tatum poster, a long lost brother, a bony blonde and a promiscuous female friend, plus a hot shot star and the one and only sinus blocker Sylvia. Now throw in a crazy lady and a man who would do anything for her (meaning myself and James) and you have our story. Or the first part of it.*Recommended for readers aged 17+ due to some sexual content and strong language*Approx: 64000 words.",
