  "description": "Full of vampires with spray tans and menopause trying to twelve step their way to salvation, Forever 51 takes vampire fiction into terrifying new middle age. A very funny, very bloody book about growing older and getting dead.  – Grady Hendrix, New York Times best-selling author of The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying VampiresVeronica is eternally fifty-one years old with a proclivity for problematic drinking. Like most hormonally challenged women negotiating the change of life, she is a hot mess. To retain her sanity, she attends weekly AA meetings and adheres to a strict diet of organic, locally-sourced, (mostly) cruelty-free human blood from the hospice facility where she works. Her life stopped being fun about a hundred years ago, right about the time her teenage daughter stole her soul and took off for California with a hot, older guy. These days, Veronica’s existence is just that – an existence, as flat and empty as her own non-reflection in the bathroom mirror.When her estranged daughter contacts her via Facebook, Veronica learns that she has one chance to escape her eternal personal she must find and apologize to every one of the people she’s turned into vampires in the last century. That is, if they’re still out there. With raging hormones and a ticking clock, Veronica embarks on a last-ditch road trip to regain her mortality, reclaim her humanity, and ultimately, die on her own terms.Fans of Alice Hoffman and Grady Hendrix will love the snarky and supernatural storytelling found in Forever 51.",
