After four assassination attempts, I'm thinking not so much. Haverty's pack needs a new leader, and I've just about run out of reasons why I'm not right for the job. Besides, having loyal followers would definitely help me fight off whoever's out for my blood. Especially sincemy boyfriend is always busy playing White Hat to every wanderer except me. I'm glad he thinks I'm tough enough to handle my own business, but a little extra backup would be nice. So now I just need to figure out how to mentor new shifters, run a pack, keep my \"real\" job, and have some sort of personal life. All in a day's work for this horror movie writer-turned-shapeshifting panther.",
