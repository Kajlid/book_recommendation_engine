  "description": "Fantasy suddenly becomes a reality when a good-looking, young college guy decides to go to a costume party dressed as a good-looking, young college girl, and he runs into a group of horny, rowdy football players who can’t wait to put their hands up his dress.In this highly erotic story of gay cross-dressing, one young man named Rush learns what it’s like to live out the fantasy of a lifetime with four masculine college football jocks during a wild costume party in a campus frat house. And though Rush is apprehensive at first, hoping that the drunken, stoned football players won’t discover that he’s really another guy, all of his fears are calmed when one of the guys quietly admits, with a huge smile, that he knows Rush is really a guy dressed as a girl.While the Halloween party is going on upstairs in the frat house, there’s another little party going on down the basement, where a nice-looking, young guy who can pass for a sexy young woman learns how to take care of four athletic guys at the same time without being discovered. Though the story becomes tense at times, and it’s classic gay erotica without apology, there is a very happy ending with strong promise of unexpected love and romance in the future.",
