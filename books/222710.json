He's hoping that by ignoring them, they'll all just go away.​Victoria Wood has returned to London to complete a work contract, after a leave of absence. It's only eight months' after all and then she'll be back in Thomas's arms. It all seems straight forward, until her ex wants back on the scene.​Distance, miscommunication and lies, muddy the waters of their fledgling relationship before it truly starts; and when it does... is it already too late?",
