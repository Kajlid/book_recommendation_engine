  "description": "Hidden secrets are discovered by a member of the second generation in her fifty year search for her sister, Eugenia, lost in the Holocaust. Jewish family members are caught in a hellish spider's web as the \"last 500.\" As pawns in the chess game between Hitler's assistants, they survive the Lodz Ghetto, Auschwitz, Stutthof, the burning city of Dresden, Germany, and are released from concentration camp Theresienstadt. Born in Germany after the Holocaust, Rosie remembers the Displaced Persons' camp on her journey to the United States, as a three-year-old refugee on the troop carrier, the USS General William C. Langfitt. The theme of the book is the importance of family, no matter the time or the place. The true story includes scenes from her family's four years in captivity, and events in the lives of her Christian relatives during the First and Second World War. Rosie's mother, Louise, pictured on the front of the book, was not in the Holocaust, but enabled her husband, a survivor, and post-war family to \"walk forward.\" The purpose of the narrative is to continue to uncover information about her lost sister, and all the children that remain missing, or perished in the Holocaust.",
