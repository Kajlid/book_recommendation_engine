  "description": "After years of running wild, Linc might’ve finally run out of road.  After a brutal capture at the hands of the Heathens Motorcycle Club, Linc is just trying to heal, mentally and physically. But he’s got men in his life who are complicating everything. There’s Mercy — a Havoc MC biker and the man he is falling fast for — plus an undercover ATF agent and a rogue Havoc member.  But Mercy's keeping him at arm’s length, and Linc is spinning. In an attempt to regain his equilibrium, he heads to the bar where he first met Mercy. Night after night, he escapes Havoc bonds and continues down his merry path of mayhem . . . mainly in the hopes that Mercy will give chase.  Since Linc’s capture by his old MC, Mercy's been dealing with the fallout of his guilt. He’s trying to give Linc space and still watch over him — all without Linc’s knowledge. But with Linc’s old job calling and a threat to Havoc MC heating up, can they make their way back together?  Word 59,000; page 204",
