  "description": "Some crimes can never be forgotten.Kate Evans doesn't take risks. She chose her apartment with care-a safe district with a good neighbor-a place where she can live a quiet, unassuming, under-the-radar existence. Then she makes one mistake and opens her door to accept a delivery of flowers from a secret admirer and her life will never be the same again. A guy she's never seen before bursts into her apartment and asks her to marry him. Jack Thompson won't take no for an answer and drags Kate on a cross country journey to hell.Invalided out of the police, Nathan Beranson works as a private investigator in San Antonio, Texas where he spends too much of his time following unfaithful spouses and delivering the bad news to their partners. When his fianc√©e cheats on him with Jack Thompson, the half-brother Nathan's only just met, he becomes obsessed with Jack in the same unhealthy way as his revenge-seeking clients. By the time Nathan finally realizes putting the ghosts of the past to rest is a wiser option than settling an old score, it's too late. He's already been drawn into his sibling's latest deadly game and Nathan and Kate find their nightmare is only just beginning.",
