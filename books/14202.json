But when someone is taken captive, the gang must put aside their enduring differences and work together, at the risk of losing their cash prize. Float Out, by comedian Patton Oswalt, examines Serenity's pilot, Wash - always ready with a brilliant aerial maneuver and a terrible one-liner - in a series of exciting smuggling raids! Then, Jim Krueger presents an action-packed story of loyalty and trust with The Other Half. And finally in Downtime, Zack Whedon, writer of the New York Times bestselling Serenity: The Shepherd's Tale, visits the crew as they wait out a brutal snowstorm.",
