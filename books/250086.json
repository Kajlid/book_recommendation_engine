  "title": "The Olive Farm: A Memoir of Life, Love, and Olive Oil in the South of France",
  "description": "When Carol Drinkwater and her fiancé, cute Michel, are given the opportunity to purchase ten acres of an abandoned olive farm in the South of France, they find the region's splendor impossible to resist. Using their entire savings as a down payment, the couple embark on an adventure that brings them in contact with the charming countryside of Provence, its querulous personalities, petty bureaucracies, and extraordinary wildlife. From the glamour of Cannes and the Isles of Lérins to the charm of her own small plot of land—which she transforms from overgrown weeds into a thriving farm—Drinkwater triumphantly relates how she realized her dream of a peaceful, meaningful life.  \"A fantasy come true, as it will be for many of the readers who yearn to experience the magic of southern France.\" (Austin Chronicle)  \"Good-humored and well written.\" (The Washington Post Book World)  \"Following [Drinkwater's] engaging story is like driving the hairpin turns that climb the hills above the French Riviera: the views are breathtaking, the blind curves frightening, and the safe arrival to the top a joyous relief.\" (Library Journal)",
