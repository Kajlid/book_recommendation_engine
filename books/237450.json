  "title": "Filthy",
  "description": "FIVE full-length stand alone novels (1,400 pages total), each telling the story of a different member of the MC. There is no cheating, no sex outside the relationship, no abuse of women, and always an HEA with no cliffhanger. These STEAMY contemporary romance novels are not the typical MC Romance. These are MC Romance novels written by an author who has ridden in an MC (yes, he's a romantic at heart). These novels are fast-paced, filled with humor, and smoking hot.",
