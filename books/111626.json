  "description": "Itâ€™s been three months since End of the Line, the survivors are in a new world with a zombie menace that is fading. With new freedom, the group looks to settle on Harbor Island a small island on the Long Island Sound and create a community where people can feel safe again but with the zombies vanishing, could a new danger be more of a threat than the living dead? Stuck in the Middle is narrated by six very different people: Annemarie who finally realized how dead the world really is, Jim still keeping his optimism in a strange new world, Tanya, a young leader questioning her abilities, Grace, who resists all attempts to get close to others and Mike who is unsure if he wants to protect more than just his own. Stuck in the Middle continues a story not only about zombies but survival.",
