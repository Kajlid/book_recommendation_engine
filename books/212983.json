  "title": "That's Revolting!: Queer Strategies for Resisting Assimilation",
  "description": "As the gay mainstream prioritizes the attainment of straight privilege over all else, it drains queer identity of any meaning, relevance, or cultural value, writes Matt Bernstein Sycamore, aka Mattilda, editor of That's Revolting! . This timely collection of essays by writers such as Patrick Califia, Kate Bornstein, Carol Queen, Charlie Anders, Benjamin Shepard, and others shows what the new queer resistance looks like. Intended as a fistful of rocks to throw at the glass house of Gaylandia, the book challenges the commercialized, commoditized, and hyper objectified view of gay/queer identity projected by the mainstream (straight and gay) media by exploring queer struggles to transform gender, revolutionize sexuality, and build community/family outside of traditional models. Essays include \"Dr. Laura, Sit on My Face,\" \"Gay Art Guerrillas,\" \"Legalized Sodomy Is Political Foreplay,\" and \"Queer An Oxymoron or Just Plain Moronic?\"",
