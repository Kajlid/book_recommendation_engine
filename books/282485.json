  "description": "In a demilitarized zone on the border of human space, long range spy satellites are mysteriously going quiet, and no one knows why. Captain Susan Kamala and her crew are dispatched to figure out what's going on and solve the problem. That problem, however, is a mysterious, bleeding edge alien ship that no human vessel could hope to match in open conflict. But, it's not spoiling for a fight. Now, the Captain and her crew must figure out how to navigate a complicated game of diplomacy, balancing the needs of their corporate overlords and the honest desire for a lasting peace between the two races, all without letting a longstanding cold war turn hot.\"",
