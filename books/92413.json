  "title": "Towards a New Socialism",
  "description": "This book is our attempt to answer the idea that socialism is dead and buried after the demise of the Soviet Union.The core of the book consists of a series of chapters spelling out what we believe would be efficient and democratic methods for planning a complex economy. We also examine issues of inequality and its elimination, systems of payment for labour, a democratic political constitution for a socialist commonwealth, the commune as a set of arrangements for living, and property relations under socialism.",
