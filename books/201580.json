But when she is given a mysterious object by a dying man, her world is turned upside down. Thrust into a dangerous game of lies and deception, Meagan finds herself caught between two sides as she plays the role of double agent. On one side is the cold and demanding Ultan, commander of the government's secret police, and on the other, a small network of rebels and a daring young man called Wild Card. When Wild Card uncovers an insidious government plot and Meagan finds evidence of her unknown past, she is forced to choose between power and friendship. As Meagan's past and present collide, how far will she go to get what she wants? This is the first book of the Ascend Trilogy.",
