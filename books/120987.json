  "title": "The Du Rose Prophecy",
  "description": "The sixth in the series of the 'Waikato Presbyterian School for Boys Mysteries'. In the mid 1970’s on a high mountain in the Central North Island of New Zealand, a rich landowner sat with her grandson and told him the old stories about the Maori people. She prophesied that he would be the one to ‘build a new house’ there on the whenua - the land. Thirty-five years later and Logan Du Rose is trying to do exactly that, finding that history will not make it easy for him. Each time he believes that he has fulfilled the prophecy, life gets in the way. As he struggles to keep his new family line together, he is distracted by disturbing events. Two perplexing deaths at the Waikato Presbyterian School for Boys cause upset and disbelief amongst the staff, whilst the return of some family treasures seem to create nothing but trouble and threaten the safety of his line forever.",
