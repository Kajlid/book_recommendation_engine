  "description": "A week in paradise, on the company dime, with your best friend - What could be better? How about a night with the ex-military SCUBA instructor? Or what if it turns into more than just a night?Jasper wanted nothing more than to escape the same old lonely holiday season he always faces. When he and Jaz decide to spend an extra week in paradise and get in a couple adventures after their work conference, he never would have guessed he would find himself tongue-tied and stupid, on his knees, at the feet of their drop-dead gorgeous and cranky as hell SCUBA instructor. Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, Sonny, and Cher… this wasn’t how this trip was supposed to go.Cole wasn’t even supposed to be the one leading this little diving excursion, but when his roommate turns up MIA and calls in a favor, he finds himself tripping over a silver-haired little shark in the waters of his perfectly controlled life. Quiet, stoic, all too serious, his life doesn’t have room for noise, for color, for distractions. Until Jasper turns up literally at his feet, forcing Cole’s cranky self into a full-on Technicolor world, at least for the weekend. But what if he wants to be more than just a vacation fling for this little shark?Hot for the Holidays is a series of sexy fun short stories that will take you on a tropical escape for the holidays.
