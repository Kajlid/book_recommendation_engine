  "description": "“Beware that, when fighting monsters, you yourself do not become a monster…” -NietzcheWhy The Fallen breed with humans to create immortals is still unknown. Why most immortals choose to use their power to control the world while only one chooses to fight for justice is the story of Lucy Jones…Modern day Atlanta, like every major city, calls to those who use magic. Ever since the witches learned to embed spells in the broadcast codes in the 1980’s, those humans who use magic and all of the nonhumans who had been in hiding are free to walk among the rest of the world. Book two of this series picks up with Lucy Jones, a young immortal, leaving the hospital after fighting for his life to kill the ancient immortal responsible for sacrificing his girlfriend and true love. Confused and uncertain about his own magical abilities, Lucy finds himself surrounded by the corruption that he never realized existed in his city.Unlike the other immortals and their quest for absolute power, Lucy’s curse compels him to confront the underworld of Atlanta, its drug and sex trade, and a monster who will stop at nothing to keep control of it all. In order to overcome these evils and balance the scales of power, Lucy must commit his own horrific atrocities and face The Daemons Within himself.",
