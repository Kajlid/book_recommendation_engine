  "description": "As a werewolf, Talon is no stranger to secrets, and he can sense that the psychic Kenna is keeping something from him. But Talon is powerfully drawn to the mysterious stranger, and the urge to claim her is just as strong as the instinct to keep himself guarded. With impossible secrets keeping them apart and the threat from the other world drawing near, their fate hangs in the balanceâ€” unless they can learn to trust each other.",
