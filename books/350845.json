  "title": "Alec: Three Piece Suit",
  "description": "Three of Eddie Campbell's \"Alec\" books collected into a single volume for the first time. \" Three Piece Suit\" \"Graffiti Kitchen,\" considered by many to be his finest work. A mad story about love and a three-way Alec loves Georgette, her mother and himself; \"Little Italy,\" a record of a year spent in tropical North Queensland in Australia; & \"The Dance of Lifey Death,\" in which Alec ruminates on \"wifey\" and kids -- all the important things in life.Eddie Campbell's \"Alec\" stories are a brilliant and insightful romp through his own life. In them, we witness Eddie's progression from \"beer to wine,\" or to put it more accurately, his inevitable maturation through time. Whether it's tales of his early pub-crawlin' days, or glimpses into his current private life with \"wifey\" and kids, there are \"truths\" here that transcend the factual and paint a picture of the way life should be.",
