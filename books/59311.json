  "description": "Marcella looked up at the cone-shaped summit of Vesuvius and felt the tremors for the second time that morning. Powerful ripples surged through her, reaching upwards like silken fingers to caress her breasts and neck. ‘The gods are angry,’ said the inn keeper. ‘Like the mountain, Marcella, you too are filled with pent-up energies. Who is going to erupt first?’Pompeii. AD79. As the gods of destruction spit fire and molten rock into the air, Marcella and her rampantly virile lover, Gaius, begin their tumultuous affair. Their escape from the volcano cements their passion for each other but there are other dangers in their path: jealousy, misunderstanding and war.In the ensuing chaos, Marcella is separated from her handsome centurion and is forced to continue her quest for sybaritic pleasures elsewhere. Thrown into the orgiastic decadence of Rome, she is soon taking part in some very bizarre sport, although nothing comes near to the pleasure she found with Gaius. But circumstances are due to take a dramatic turn and Marcella is embroiled in a plot of blackmail and sexual revenge. If only she can find Gaius, she knows everything will be all right.",
