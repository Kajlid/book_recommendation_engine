After going through hell and emerging relatively unscathed with the love of my life, I’m happy for the first time in as long as I can remember.But the euphoric bliss doesn’t last long. I should have known it wouldn’t. That’s just not how my life goes. This time is no different.My father decides to drop the most unorthodox bomb on me that makes me sick to my stomach. In order to save my hotel chain, I must merge with a rival company… By marrying the CEO’s daughter.Neither of them care that I’m already committed to the woman I love. All that matters to them is this stupid arrangement that they call “business.”I love my company. I love my girl. I’m not willing to give either of them up. Not when I fought so hard for them. But can I get out of my father’s stupid arrangement before it destroys my life?",
