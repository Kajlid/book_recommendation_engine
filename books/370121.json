So Santa decides to take his first vacation in one thousand years. The Elves, the reindeer, the Gnomes, and, most of all, the children around the world are upset when they find out. But then one six-year old boy comes to Santa’s rescue, and children everywhere band together to give Santa a Christmas he’ll never forget!",
