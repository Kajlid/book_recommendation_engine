  "description": "I’ve been selected. One of forty Omegas from academies across the globe.\n…a one in forty chance to be bonded into the royal pack.It has to be a mistake. The selection committee never would’ve chosen me. I don’t even pay my own tuition. I’m a scholarship student from the bad side of town.I should know better than to hope, but after I meet the royal alphas, I can’t help it.Kaz, Wolf, and Tai are everything I’ve ever wanted, and our bodies call to each other in ways we’re powerless to control.Not that it matters since the Queen herself has forbidden them from claiming me. I’m too clumsy. Too opinionated. Too poor.\nBut when the royal pack continues to send other Omegas home instead of me, it becomes harder to accept the inevitable truth…that I’m Knot Their Omega.\n\nSELECTION is a standalone Omegaverse romance told in multiple points of view. It includes MM and MMFMM and a happily ever after is guaranteed.",
