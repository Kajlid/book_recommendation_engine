  "description": "I’ve been a bad, bad, Fae...\n   Being a hero isn’t in my job description. All that fighting for the greater good is just exhausting. Morals and ethics and blah, blah, blah.  It isn’t a life I, Kelsie, want. Except I had to go and screw all that up by killing a Fae King, who had it coming, and inheriting his magic and the responsibility of thousands. It doesn’t matter he also happened to be my father.  No thanks, just hand me a glass of wine and snacks and I’ll be good to go.  What’s a girl to do when the powers that be won’t allow that to happen? Relocate and build herself a better life. So I ran, escaping my fate and the thousands that depend on me.  Only one problem, the Sidhe Elder who bound my magic, shadowing my every move. A pacifist with a sword and an ego. He says it’s to keep me safe from myself.  After all, I’m a ticking bomb with an expiration date and a fatal secret.  Not to mention the darkness that watches my every move from the shadows.",
