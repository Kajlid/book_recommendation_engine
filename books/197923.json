  "description": "Ambrosia is book two in the Nectar series, a dark paranormal romance. Reading these books in order is essential.  If you haven't read book one, it's available at http://bit.ly/tristanandkyla --- FREE to read with a Kindle Unlimited subscription.  This book is the highly anticipated continuation of Tristan & Kyla's journey.  Contains: VAMPIRES, BLOOD, SEX, MYSTERY, BAD GUYS, ANSWERS, and A FEW MORE QUESTIONS.  In Nectar, we met Tristan and Kyla, who found themselves inexplicably addicted to one another.  Kyla couldn't help feel magnetized, drawn to the handsome vampire prince, despite the fact that he held her in his home and in his bedroom against her will. He forced her to feel.  Tristan was clearly drawn to Kyla, too. Not only was she his preferred type but the fact that she wasn't mesmerized and the fact that her blood was better than any blood he'd ever tasted created a fierce protectiveness as well as other mysterious emotions in him. He transformed from arrogance to a lovesick romantic.  But love is rarely easy and this REALLY seems to be the case when the supernatural gets added into the mix!  Things weren't going well at the end of book one and Kyla had a tough snap decision to make.  In Ambrosia, Kyla has to deal with the fallout of that decision and process the truth, as it reveals itself.  The twists, the turns, the steam (phew), the blood? Wait until you see where this story goes!  Book three, Essence, will be released in Q1 2016.  This book contains explicit sex, blood and gore, violence, sexual aggression, potential triggers, and a connection that surpasses all the heroine and her alpha vampire prince ever thought possible.",
