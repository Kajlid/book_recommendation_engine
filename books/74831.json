With a brother back from the war, a drunken mother, and a father who hides constantly, it's no wonder Vivian is falling under pressure. As issues progressively worsen in the Hunter home, the Waldons are prepared to give Vivian motivation to stand strong. As Zachary's father learns more about Vivian, he is also reminded of his late wife. In such a short time, these families are bound by hope . . . and an inconvenient love. Vivian, Falling spans the course of senior year in high school for Vivian Hunter. She experiences rough family situations that grind down on any last shards of hope piercing her heart. With graduation fast approaching and no respect or attention from her parents, Vivian finds comfort in her best friend and his father Daniel. As the year moves forward, Vivian finds it impossible to ignore her sudden attraction to someone unexpected. It is her first realization of what love is and could be. But is it enough to pull her fragile life from a downwards spiral?",
