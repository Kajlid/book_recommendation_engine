  "description": "\"Egypt's Arab Spring: The long and winding road to democracy\" is a well thought-out analysis of the political and social upheaval caused by the Egyptian revolution. It investigates how Egyptians at all levels are coping with its aftermath; economically, socially and politically. The post-revolution events are analysed to reveal the causes and mistakes of the uprising. The roles of all major players are examined, with particular criticism for those who contributed to the near destruction of an age-old dream for all Egyptians.",
