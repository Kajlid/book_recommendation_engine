  "description": "In a world of seemingly unending social obligations, we could all use a night off. In 41 Reasons I'm Staying In, illustrator and self-proclaimed introvert Hallie Heald imaginatively portrays engaging and sometimes outlandish excuses to avoid leaving home.With each page comes a new room and character, pursuing their obsessions, hobbies, interests, and sudden whims with gusto: plotting world takeover, learning magic, mooning over a crush, evading taxes, and beyond. This dark and humorous celebration of introverts offers a unique look into their private worlds and reminds us of the deep fulfillment and joy we can find in spending time alone.",
