Under the iconic doctor's guidance, Mamitu went from mopping floors and comforting her fellow patients, to becoming one of the most acclaimed fistula surgeons in the world, despite never having had a day's schooling.This is the moving story of the friendship that saved the lives of over 60,000 of the poorest women on earth.",
