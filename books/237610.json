  "description": "Sequoyah Morgan Hummingbird is different, living on the edge of reality where sharing thoughts is as natural as breathing. But he hates everything about himself—his name, his lost childhood in a Cherokee residential school, his tongue-tied shyness. Even worse, the Moon People, an octogenarian pair orbiting high above the earth, force him to comply with their ruthless repopulation scheme—because they alone have seen WW III destroy humankind. By age twenty Sequoyah hits rock bottom. He pulls through, helped by friends and strangers drawn to the poetry and goodness within him. Stumbling as often as they succeed, Sequoyah and his new clan make love, babies, and history as they jump across continents and millennia.Serious questions about war and racism lie beneath the surface of this thought-provoking story, written with humor, satire, sensuality, and pathos.",
