  "description": "WINNER OF THE 2017 VICTORIAN PREMIER'S LITERARY AWARD FOR FICTION  WINNER OF THE 2016 UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND FICTION BOOK AWARD SHORTLISTED FOR THE 2017 STELLA PRIZE‘Whenever I need reminding of the preciousness of ordinary life I return to this stunning novel of forgiveness and family, which gives clear, beautiful voice to the fierce luck of being alive.’Charlotte WoodEster is a family therapist with an appointment book that catalogues the anxieties of the middle loneliness, relationships, death. She spends her days helping others find happiness, but her own family relationships are tense and frayed. Estranged from both her sister, April, and her ex-husband, Lawrence, Ester wants to fall in love again. Meanwhile, April is struggling through her own directionless life; Lawrence’s reckless past decisions are catching up with him; and Ester and April's mother, Hilary, is about to make a choice that will profoundly affect them all.Taking place largely over one rainy day in Sydney, and rendered with evocative and powerful prose, the multi-award-winning Between a Wolf and a Dog is a celebration of the best in all of us — our capacity to live in the face of ordinary sorrows, and to draw strength from the transformative power of art.PRAISE FOR GEORGIA BLAIN‘[An] elegant, intelligent and affecting novel from a writer at the height of her powers.’ The Saturday Paper‘Like all her novels, Between a Wolf and a Dog explores the often unarticulated complexities of the intersection of the personal and the political with exquisite grace and intelligence.’ Australian Book Review",
