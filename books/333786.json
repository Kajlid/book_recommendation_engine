Butler Award!A Bram Stoker and Splatterpunk Award Nominee!One of Esquire's Best Horror Books of the Year!An Indie Next Pick!\"This is gory and brutal and beautiful and painful and terrifying and a pure delight.\"—Stephen Graham JonesA provocative and unforgettable debut that is both a blood-soaked love letter to Los Angeles and a gleeful send-up to iconic horror villains, Maeve Fly will thrill fans of slashers and the macabre.By day, Maeve Fly works at the happiest place in the world as every child’s favorite ice princess.By the neon night glow of the Sunset Strip, Maeve haunts the dive bars with a drink in one hand and a book in the other, imitating her misanthropic literary heroes.But when Gideon Green - her best friend’s brother - moves to town, he awakens something dangerous within her, and the world she knows suddenly shifts beneath her feet.Untethered, Maeve ditches her discontented act and tries on a new persona. A bolder, bloodier one, inspired by the pages of American Psycho. Step aside Patrick Bateman, it’s Maeve’s turn with the knife.\"An apocalyptic Anaheim Psycho.\" —Grady Hendrix, New York Times bestselling author of How to Sell a Haunted House",
