Men are willing to pay good money to watch Tristan tease Jared, and the two of them seduce London’s elite with sex and power games.

But is Jared just in this for the pay?When Rolex, the john who started it all, returns to Market Garden, the boys jump on the opportunity to service him—and each other—for a fresh pile of cash. Rolex isn’t the only one itching for a rematch, though. Jared’s been waiting for a chance to get back at Tristan for teasing him so mercilessly the first time.And for a former stripper, revenge is a dish best served extra hot.",
