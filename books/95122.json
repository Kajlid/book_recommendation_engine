A couple of things came up that meant I couldn’t even get to my laptop until about an hour ago, and of course I had some re-reading and such to do. But here you go!I’d planned to post the first five pages or so, but because of the delay, I’m posting the first twelve and a half. I hope you guys like it!! Please help me spread the word that it’s here!NOTE: This is NOT the final draft. Some slight changes may be made between this version and the final printed version.+I’m trying to post at least every Wednesday, so I will see you next week if not sooner. I love you all, and we are getting through this together.\"There is still no book release date.",
