  "description": "How would the Sleepers rescue this beautiful woman, helpless against her foes, tied to a tree and facing certain death? After a successful ambush, the Seven Sleepers find that she is anything but helpless. She's Princess Merle,Â the fierce daughter of Fedor. God has sent the Seven Sleepers on another mission, this time deep into the jungle in search of the Tribe of Fedor. And are they in for a surprise! Enter this topsy-turvy world where the women are savage warriors and the men are little more than slaves. Meet a witch doctor who claims the dark god demands the Sleepers as a sacrifice, and a bushy-headed historian who holds the secrets of the past. Experience the thrill of battle as the Seven Sleepers join in the conflict, seeking to bring peace and lead these women warriors into the house of God.",
