Tau Ceti, better known as Tech World, is the central trading capital of Frontier 921.McGill figures he’s lucked out. The assignment looks dull but luxurious. Tau Ceti boasts a planet-wide city with a trillion inhabitants, all of whom are only interested in making a few credits. But all is not well on Tech World. The Empire is crumbling, an invasion is coming, and McGill’s easy ride through life and death has come to an end.Tech World is a military science fiction novel by bestselling author B. V. Larson.",
