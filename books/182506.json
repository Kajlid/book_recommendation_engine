  "description": "Goldie Starr is a locksmith by day and sexually frustrated by night.  Her fantasies involve handcuffs, punishment and a dark stranger who holds her pleasure in his cruel hands, but she's always been too shy to indulge them.  That is until she finds herself in the deep, dark wood, in a house with a secret behind an unlocked door.  Mr Brown is big, serious and intense with plenty of dark fantasies of his own.  If Goldie's brave enough to confess, things might turn out 'just right'.  This a BDSM modern fairy tale for 18+ readers.",
