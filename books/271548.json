  "title": "The Clansman an Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan",
  "description": "1905. The Clansman is the second book of a series of historical novels planned on the Race Conflict. The Leopard's Spots was the statement in historical outline of the conditions from the enfranchisement of the Negro to his disenfranchisement. The Clansman develops the true story of the Ku Klux Klan Conspiracy, which overturned the Reconstruction regime...I have sought to preserve in this romance both the letter and the spirit of this remarkable period. The men who enact the drama of fierce revenge into which I have woven a double love-story are historical figures. I have merely changed their names without taking a liberty with any essential historic fact. See other titles by this author available from Kessinger Publishing.",
