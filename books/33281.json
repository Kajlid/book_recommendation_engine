Although black churches today are doing their part, this book elucidates that all black men need to see god's love and pray before they let frustration and anger guide their paths. Black men must understand that God cares, and have solutions for their problems, only if they vigorously accept responsibility and atone for their wrongs in prayer.ABOUT THE AUTHORRAYMOND STURGIS is the author of many Great Selling ACT LIKE A LADY, DO NOT THINK LIKE A MAN , WHY DO BLACK MEN HURT THEIR WOMEN?, THE WORLD CHANGERS, CHANGING THE BLACK WOMAN IN THE MIRROR, and A BLACK CHILD SHALL NOT LEAD THEM.
