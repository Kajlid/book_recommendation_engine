Thalia is faced with a new test: she must use her Fate-influencing powers to bring about a happy ending for the goddess Athena and her beloved Artemis. But the Fates have decreed that Athena, the Goddess of Wisdom, will never be compromised by Love. When a huntress accuses Artemis of impregnating her, Thalia fears this turn of events is the Fatesâ€™ judgment. Meanwhile, Thalia has her own problems as the young demigod Adonis captures the affections of both Aphrodite and Apollo.",
