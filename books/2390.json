  "description": "A dynamic and comprehensive presentation of Buddha's teachings, including practical explanations on how to attain lasting happiness and freedom from problems for ourselves and others. With clear and accessible language, Geshe Kelsang Gyatso guides the reader from the fundamentals of Buddhist meditation and philosophy, through a powerful explanation of the true nature of reality, to reveal the preciousness of Tantra--offering the paths to liberation and enlightenment to modern, busy people. A brief history of Kadampa Buddhism shows how Buddha's timeless teachings have traveled from teacher to student over thousands of years, and how Buddhists in the West are now applying what was once available only to mystics and monks--practical advice to solve our daily problems and accomplish the real meaning of our human life. This inspiring handbook for daily practice is designed for those seeking solutions within Buddhism to the problems of everyday life, as well as to encourage people of all faiths to deepen their understanding and enjoyment of the spiritual paths.",
