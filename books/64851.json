They will stop at nothing to violate his very flesh in order to gain the secrets of his biology, as well as his corporate knowledge of a drug that could change medical history. Separated from his girlfriend, Holly, and his best friend, Ted, the only ones who can save Jack from a terrible fate are an offbeat group of Chinese vampires with a rich culture and history. Thrust into their unfamiliar culture and running from exploitative humans, Jack walks a fine line between his assimilation and loyalty to his human friends and his acceptance and growing knowledge of who he is, what he is, and his growing role in the future of his entire vampire species.",
