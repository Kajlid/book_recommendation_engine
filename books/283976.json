  "description": "Pastor Ben Langley is irresistible.His wife died giving birth to their daughter six years ago. His tragic past doesn’t keep me from wanting to unravel him, strip away his buttoned-up goodness, and discover what kind of man lies beneath. If that makes me evil, so be it. I’m far beyond redemption anyway.Ashleigh Kendrick is freedom personified, an unpredictable wind I want to grasp hold of.Every Sunday she watches me preach from the front row, wearing her halter tops and tiny skirts, a dangerous temptation. Her favorite words are the four-letter variety, and her smile lights up the darkness inside me. I vowed to love one woman forever. I never realized that vow would be impossible to keep when confronted with a chance to love again.Face the Music is an opposites attract romance with emotional ties to the past that run so thick they feel impossible to overcome.",
