  "description": "Demetrius “Danger” Gallo I’m too rough for her. I’m coarse. Untamed. Brutal. I’m a dangerous man. The things I want to do to her… Things like that should never be done to a girl like her. If it weren’t for the fact I need her hacker skills for this job, I wouldn’t allow her anywhere near me. Because fighting my urges, well, that’s not easy for a man like me. Kiera Quill I’m a virgin, but I’m not a prude. It’s only that I’ve got rules. My work comes first. I'm here to rescue a woman from the mob. He's here to kill a man. We're busy. Anyway, he doesn’t think of me that way. He treats me like a kid sister—one who can’t get anything right. He might be massive and masculine, with a deep, rumbling voice that gives me shivers. But that doesn’t mean that I’m attracted to him or anything. Because if I were, things could get rough.",
