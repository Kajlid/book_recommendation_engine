It just takes one yawn to start other yawns off.Dr. Seuss spins a sleep-tastic tale about a very small bug and a very big yawn that spreads and spreads. Meanwhile, the Audio-Telly-o-Tally-o Count adds up every sleeping creature from the country of Keck to the Castle of Krupp. First one, then seven, all the way to the billions and zillions, the Who's-Asleep-Count just keeps growing and growing! This book is a perfect bedtime story that will have the most reluctant readers laughing, and the most reluctant sleepers snoring! Ninety-nine zillion, nine trillion and two  Creatures are sleeping!  So...How about you?",
