  "description": "Life was finally looking good for Harm Queen when New Year's Day 1901 dawned over Minneapolis. His old crony \"Doc\" Ames had just been elected mayor. Queen’s promotion to chief of detectives—and a chance to line his pockets—was in the bag. Then, a gruesome crime at a Hell’s Half Acre brothel brings Queen’s ambitions to a screeching halt. The mayor’s brother and Queen’s new boss, Colonel Fred Ames, seems hell-bent on thwarting his investigation. To make matters even more difficult, Queen’s courtship of Karoline, an upright young Norwegian woman, is imperiled by the appearance of a seductive prostitute with her own game to play. As Queen digs deeper among the gangsters, gaslights and political machinations of turn-of-the-century Minneapolis, he finds himself on the trail of a sinister hobo with apocalyptic ambitions. In The Big Mitt, Erik Rivenes shines a colorful light on a treacherous and corrupt chapter from a great city's forgotten past.",
