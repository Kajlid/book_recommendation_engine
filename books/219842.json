  "description": "Jack’s growing up, his body is changing, and he’s living alone with the girl of his dreams. They have a whole island to themselves (more or less), and Jack knows all about Ms. Mopat, his grandmother, and Glastonbury Manor. Unfortunately, he learned those secrets during his final weeks there and now has new mysteries to unravel. Jack may be well-travelled for a boy his age, but little of what he’s learned in his sixteen years will help him… on Knight’s Haven.",
