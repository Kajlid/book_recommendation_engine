  "title": "The Spirituality of Awe: Challenges to the Robotic Revolution",
  "description": "About the Book The robotic revolution is here and there's no going back. From the way we raise our children, to our work settings, to our governments, and even our wars, the quick fix-instant result society is roiling our world. Yet what is lost in this delirium is depth, the awesomeness, not just of our machines, but of our flesh, our capacity to feel, and our capacity to dwell in the miracle of the unknown. This book dwells in the miracle of the unknown. It is an intimate trek into the evolving spirituality of awe--the humility and wonder; sense of adventure toward life. Can we preserve awe--the arguable \"heart\" of humanity--in spite of and even in light of our technologies? Or will we devolve into mechanically driven puppets, numb to our possibilities, blind to our servitude? There is no more critical problem for our age.\"",
