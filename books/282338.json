  "description": "I was once a saint, but Father Santo made me a sinner. As a baby, I was left on the doorstep of a convent. The only clue I have of my parents is my name - Luciana Conti. On the day before my birthday, I see a man for the first time in the convent. Father Santo is handsome, strict and respected by my fellow sisters. They all trust him. They shouldn't. That night, Father Santo kidnaps me from the stone bed I lie in every night. He says I have thirty days to kneel for him. I'd rather die than be his willing victim. But the truth about what I am might just bring me to my knees... Kneel is a full-length novel with dark themes. This is a captive dark mafia romance.",
