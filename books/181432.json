  "description": "There's no hiding off the grid. Joe Pickett's old friend Nate Romanowski is off the grid, lying low while the FBI search for him. But they're not the only ones looking. Nate finds himself confronted by agents who need his help assessing a potential terror threat in Wyoming's Red Desert – in return they'll make Nate's criminal record disappear. Nate knows they can't be trusted – but with his liberty at stake, he has to comply... for now. Meanwhile, Joe's heading south, under orders from State Governor Rulon to investigate a rash of crimes and an uptick in secretive federal activity along Interstate 80... As they pursue their quarries, both men will be drawn deep into the Red Desert, 9,000 square miles of bleak, punishing terrain, home to a secret that could take them both down.",
