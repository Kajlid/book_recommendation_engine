  "description": "President of Sri Lanka, conqueror of the Tamil Tigers, people's hero, Rajapaksa has it all... or does he? Rajapaksa has vanquished his enemies and acquired absolute power but there are cracks and fault lines in the nervous nirvana he has created. A sense of despair dogs his days as he manoeuvres an absurd landscape of deranged and demanding family members, enraged Tamils, and foreign interests. Satirical and absurd, The Rajapaksa Stories, larger than life and twice as sharp, pounce with an imagination and wit that belie their anger. They may differ from the official version told by the Government of Sri Lanka, but promise to be just as accurate and immensely more entertaining.",
