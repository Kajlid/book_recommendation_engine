  "title": "Jilted Jock",
  "description": "He was someone who belonged on the cover of Sports Illustrated instead of in my small beach town. A sexy, cocky Australian soccer star named Finn was the last person I expected to be living with for two weeks. He showed up at my brother’s house on his wedding night, hot, drunk, and very much not married. Next thing I knew, we were roommates, spending nights watching TV and getting to know one another. Those two weeks turned into more than either of us bargained for. He was fresh off a broken heart and I had a boyfriend. I wasn’t supposed to fall for the jilted jock, especially when I knew we’d be going our separate ways. All good things must come to an end, right? Except he’s not letting me go without a fight.",
