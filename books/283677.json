  "description": "I don’t play by the rules.Never have, never will.The second our eyes met from across the club,I could feel a shift in the air—an overwhelming pull drawing me in.One mind-blowing night is all it was, or so I thought.Repeating my senior year may not have been the plan,But finding out my one-night stand is my new teacher—That’s something I never saw coming.His gaze bores into me with the same intensity.That body, those hands, I remember every touch.I should stay away, but I don’t want to.This time, all bets are off.I’ll let him think he’s in control,Until I bring him to his knees.Passion and fire,Forbidden and wrong.Like I said, I don’t play by the rules.**This is Tessa Callahan's story!**",
