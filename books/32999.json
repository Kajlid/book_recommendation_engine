  "description": "Now that Jacey Chandliss is a bona fide Hollywood actress with two movies under her belt, it’s time for her to return full circle to the very show that launched her career—Generation Next. This time around she’s a judge, not a contestant—and she’s about to find out that being in the judge’s hot seat can be even more nerve-racking than being in the spotlight. Contestant Toby Adams manages to win the hearts of millions of viewers, but has he also managed to win his way into Jacey’s heart? What does that mean for her budding relationship with Hollywood bad boy Matt Canseco? The tabloids are already starting to raise questions—that is, when they’re not having a field day with the huge failure of Galaxy, Jacey’s first big studio flick. When everything starts to spin out of control for Hollywood’s newest It Girl, she'll need her hometown friends—Dash, Desi, and Ivy—more than ever.",
