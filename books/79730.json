  "description": "When Robin closes her eyes at night, there are some things her heart does not forget. The muffled thwong of her bowstring when she lets loose an arrow on the hunt. The even tempo of a horse at gallop as she rides the wide, green pastureland that surrounds her home. The smell of sunlight and hay, trapped in Silas’s clothes when he pulls her in for a kiss. The taste of her sister’s best berry tart, fresh from the oven.But when daylight comes, putting an end to the Lady Darkwood’s dreaming, the sound of her bowstring brings with it the memory of the man she killed to protect those she loves. The feel of the horse beneath her melts from the sheer joy of the ride, to her desperate flight from the city of Avienne, after her run in with the soldiers there. Her time in Silas’s arms, no matter how precious, only reminds her that he is the farm hand at Darkwood Manor, and she is second in line for the throne of Idyll. And as for berry tarts? There has not been enough food in the County Dell for years.Yet, there is one dream for Robin Darkwood that never dies with the light of day. To see the home she loves, and the people of her country protected from the whims of monsters. Men such as Swaine, who have risen to power in the absence of the king, and brought their own brand of justice to the land. When Robin decides to offer the safety and protection of Darkwood’s walls to those mistreated by Swaine in the name of the law, the war at home will test her, call for her to choose which dreams are worth fighting for in a land that has lost all hope.",
