  "description": "When you're as curious as Milton, Christmastime is truly the cat's meow. Up on the table (why yes, I believe those are Milton's paw prints) there's delicious shrimp. Up in the tree there's a boingy bird... Hey, a shiny ball! Oops. Broom anyone? Sigh. The holidays can be so tiring when you're a cat. Milton, the quintessential feline, makes the most of wrapping paper, fragile decorations, and an adventurous spirit in this charming tribute to the holidays and to everyone who's ever survived Christmas with a cat. It's also the purrrfect stocking stuffer (especially if the stocking's within swiping reach). Feline felicitations for the festive season!",
