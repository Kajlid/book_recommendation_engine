  "description": "(opens 10 years after the events in Kings & Queens)Still reeling from the repercussions of the church shooting plot she got jerked into ten years ago in high school, Majesty is shattered, having also lost her daughter, Mikayla, in a preschool gas explosion and, oh yeah, her marriage to a slut. So when she receives a bizarre glimmer of hope that her little girl might actually be alive, she fights heaven and hell to reclaim the happiness that’s been stripped from her. But her hunt sets four others on a collision course with disaster: her fifteen-year-old sister, Skye, who’s out to expose the supposed magical secret society at her high school; Crystal, an eleven-year-old who’s trying to escape a hellish facility filled with mindless kids; her former best friend, Vivien, an art therapist, who hopes to unlock her daughter’s turmoil as she suddenly stopped speaking and began slipping into catatonic states and drawing gruesome pictures; and Chance, a guy posing as a wealthy recluse while trying to recall his forgotten past and eliminate his enemies. In their dark world, nothing is what it seems and these seekers of truth may not like the answers they find. And little Mikayla could very well be trapped in this web of deception … or truly gone forever.",
