  "description": "Novella one of the Church of Ill Repute. A sci-fi action-adventure series centered on an ensemble cast. Everyone has a reason to fight, but some have reasons more noble than others.Only the First Chelice Militia stands in defense of their home. That’s the risk of being an independent city. Six months ago they learned the hard way that they weren’t up to the task. Rebuilding wasn’t enough, they needed to improve and adapt. Their finest squads were sent to nearby nations to train and bring back the critical skills to do just that.Four of the militia accepted a different option. Axel, Ntxhi, Trace, and Rob, against the better judgment of their captain, sign on with a local mercenary. Vox - alien, bounty hunter, and owner of the freighter Ill Repute - agreed to train them, but only as long as he could use them for his own work. Their first test of Vox’s training arrives when their new mentor takes them to retrieve a bounty in Arcady. Time for them to pack their formal wear, they’re crashing a wedding.",
