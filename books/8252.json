  "title": "Nutter Nero",
  "description": "Electronics expert Nero Credence suffers from germ phobia with a touch of ADD. Add a sprinkle of OCD, and then send him to a house full of wolf shifters and watch him go. Gunnar Sadena is the most laid-back wolf you could meet. He laughs a lot and hardly ever gets angry. But Gunnar is baffled when a five foot human shows up at the front door, telling him he's there to slay Ricky's dinosaurs. Who the hell is Ricky, and why would he have dinosaurs? Amused, Gunnar allows the nutter to enter his home. Nero turns the pack upside down as his neurosis kicks in. At six foot five, the wolf has a hard time bowing down to this pint-size terror. Gunnar thinks the quirky man is nuts, but he's also his mate. Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
