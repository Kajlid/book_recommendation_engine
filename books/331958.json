Having lost his boyhood family to brutal adoption policies, his carefully constructed adult life balances on an emotional razor's edge. Then his best friend disappears in the vast desert that is Australia's interior. The only clue is an Aboriginal artifact that leads Gabe back to the land of his birth.As he searches for the friend who was like a brother, memories arise unbidden. Memories of the uncle who swung him up into a tree and called him Little Breeze. Memories of the mother he lost. Memories of the candy that the social workers used to steal him away to an orphanage where he and his brother were separated first by walls and then by different adoptions.Armed only with his totem animal, Gabe must find real peace before the weight of his past crushes him completely.Eerily mysterious, vast, dangerous and beautiful, The Family Made of Dust is a remarkable story about the special relationships families can treasure even when they have been broken apart...and how a spare and beautiful landscape can resurrect that which we hold so dear.",
