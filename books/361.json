  "description": "She is a singer of sweet songs . . . and a sinner. A searcher for truth . . . and an outcast. Life is fraught with danger in the village of Sychar in the first-century A.D. But for Abigail, the Samaritan woman, the danger lies not as much from the ever-present Roman soldiers but from the rabbi and the people of Sychar. A woman of renowned beauty, whose reputation was tarnished at an early age, Abigail is pregnant . . . and the father is not her elderly husband, Zakane. While protecting her lover's name, believing he will spirit her away, Abigail is imprisoned, then nearly stoned by her neighbors. She's befriended by the beggar Leah. But even the beggars, the lowest of the low, don't want her around. Abigail longs for love, kindness, a home for her soon-to-arrive baby . . . and forgiveness for her anguished soul. The answers will come from the most unlikely of places.",
