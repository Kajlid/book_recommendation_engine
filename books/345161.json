  "description": "It begins with a deeply inspiring wish for the positive welfare of another person. Writer and social justice advocate Pierre Pradervand believes that making the conscious choice to bless every person or being around you can truly make the world a better place.In The Gentle Art of Blessing , Pradervand shows that the practice of blessing has the power to create more than just a momentary change. It unleashes tangible benefits throughout your entire life—through your daily interactions, your relationships, and how the laws of positive expectations and unconditional love can open the doors to a more peaceful world.Pradervand describes a blessing as genuinely wishing the best for another person through seeing their individual worth and honoring them for it. By looking at several different perspectives—providing spiritual inspiration from Hinduism, Taoism, the Koran, the Bible, and other important spiritual sources— The Gentle Art of Blessing provides the tools for people to shift their attitude from negativity to acceptance. These blessings can be practiced daily in everyday situations whether it be at the supermarket, driving in rush hour, or spending time in the workplace, the simple action of blessing the event can turn a challenging experience into an experience of grace and gratitude. Simple yet powerful, a blessing can change the way of perceiving and shaping our surroundings, reflecting the unconditional love and acceptance that is necessary for global—and inner—peace.",
