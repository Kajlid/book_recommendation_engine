  "title": "Defying Pack Law",
  "description": "Dana fled her pack and their laws to live on her terms, but the price of defiance was her happiness. Pack law states Lycan females must be shared by two or more males, but young and in love, Dana flees rather than be forced into a m√©nage. Her life on the run, constantly on guard, has no room for happiness. When her past catches up and brings her back to the home she fled, she finds herself reevaluating her beliefs. To her surprise, she discovers her body and inner wolf want to claim three males. Could it be that now older and wiser, she can accept the Lycan polyamorous way of life? Or will jealousy and fear send her running again? Note: All the focus is on her. There is no male on male action.",
