  "description": "Why do skeletons dance?Is there a Queen Kong?Are zombies ever happy? These are just a few of the many perplexing questions asked, and sometimes answered, in . . . Will and Abe's Guide to the Universe This is the very latest in the ever-expanding series of mini-jumbo cartoon compendia by that rabbit-drawing rabble-rouser Matt Groening, author of Love Is Hell ™ , Childhood Is Hell ™ , and many, many more hell-bound books. Unlike other collections gathered from Matt's provocative Life in Hell ® comic strip, Will and Abe's Guide to the Universe shows a different side of the politically charged TV-cartoon guy—that of dazed but proud dad. All the words in these comic strips are taken from Matt's feisty and funny sons Will and Abe: their actual conversations, stories, songs, arguments, theories, explanations, excuses, snappy retorts, and flights of fancy. If you have kids, know kids, have been a kid, or remain a kid at heart, you know that kids say the most hellish things! * * Any similarity between \"hellish\" and \"darndest,\" implied or otherwise, is impossible, because darndest isn't really a word, is it? Contains the following wildness:And much, much more! Collect all 73 comic strips! Better yet, we did it for you! So buy this book! Includes the classic comic strips\"Interview with a 3-Year-Old Vampire,\"\"I'm Going to Tell God to Kick You,\" and\"The Girls at School Drive Us Crazy!\"",
