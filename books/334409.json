In this world, foes look like friends, the heroes are deliciously wicked, and you’ll never see the end coming.Ten years ago, I ‘died’, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me.I should have known it wouldn't last.Once my family thought I was dead I was finally free to live.Until the day my brother walks into my tiny bookshop.No one leaves the Grayling pack and gets away with it.They drag me back, but not for the reason I believe.My mother has made an enemy of a powerful witchand I am to take the punishment meant for her.Death would have been kinder.This curse? What I am now?It's so much worse than I could have imagined.She didn't just cut me off from my wolf, or even simply kill me. She made me a golden retriever and sent me to a shelter.I'm ready to die in truth now, I'm hoping for it even.And then my mate walks in...but how am I supposed to convince him I'm the strong partner he needs to help him stop the end of the world when I can’t stop wagging my freaking tail?",
