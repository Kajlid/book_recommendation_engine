  "description": "Alan Hirsch is convinced that the inherited formulas for growing the Body of Christ do not work anymore. And rather than relying on slightly revised solutions from the past, he sees a vision of the future growth of the church coming about by harnessing the power of the early church--a movement which grew from as few as 25,000 adherents in AD 100 to up to 20 million 200 years later. Similar meteoric growth has also been recorded in history and is currently being in many apostolic movements throughout the world today. How do they do it?The Forgotten Ways proposes the concept of Apostolic Genius as a way to understand what caused the church to experience exponential growth and impact at various times in history, interpreting it for use in our own time and place. From the theological underpinnings to the practical application, Hirsch takes the reader through this dynamic mixture of passion, prayer, and incarnational practice to rediscover the dormant potential of the modern church in the West.",
