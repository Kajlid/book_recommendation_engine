  "description": "Gemma Correll's whimsical illustrations capture all Fido's moods from perky scamp to loyal, obedient protector. Although this book does present a vast array of canine shenanigans purple for our amusement, be forewarned-- you'll also get some startling insights into what your dog is really thinking about you (and, it may not always be complimentary-- not that you will really mind). You see, dogs have insinuated themselves into our lives as no other creatures could. What's more, they know they'll always have a place in our hearts. Why else do we lavish them with yummy treats and belly scratches? There's something about a wagging tail and a soulful stare that's just too hard to resist.",
