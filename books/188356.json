  "description": "I’m Stone, I’m a guardian, for the Brotherhood of Wizards, the brotherhood’s council sends me to deal with supernatural problems. I’m their trouble shooter. The primary job of the guardians is to protect humanity from demons and other supernatural threats. The Brotherhood, also does its best to keep the supernatural out of the public eye.  I’m a wizard, a real wizard. I’m not a PI, nor am I a monster hunter, although a few of those exist and work for the council. I don’t carry a wand, why would I? I almost always carry a gun or two, and a knife, occasionally an axe, sometimes a sword. If I could figure out a way to carry it, I would carry a rocket launcher. Some of the things I go up against are really tough.  I have power, real power. As a wizard I control the very forces of creation, but I always do my best to never show how much power I have. I like for my enemies to underestimate me so I never go for flashy, nor throw power around unless I have no choice.  I can be a great friend, a horrible enemy, a bit of an ass, but I’m the guy you want to show up when a demon or a vampire is coming after you.  I’m the guardian Stone, and this is one of my stories.  A demon is loose, and Stone must find it and find the person who summoned it.",
