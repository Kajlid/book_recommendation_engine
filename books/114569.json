After eight years of waiting, there are only two things that can stand in her wayâ€”an assassination attempt and a new game-changing drug.Talisen's invented a new elixir that creates superhumans, ones that can rival vampire strength, and everyone wants it. Including the vampires. With Willow's life on the line, he makes a deal with the devil, while she's forced to accept the always-strings-attached protection from the most notorious vampire organization in New Orleans.But when Talisen and his drug go missing, Willow will stop at nothing to find him, even if it means working with her vampire-ex, David. With souped-up humans, dangerous vampires, and more questions than answers, Willow has less than twenty-four hours to find him before everything changes forever.",
