  "description": "Tormented by a past relationship Chloe can’t seem to escape. She feels her only option is to write men off completely. Two years later the self imposed “man-ban” is still going strong. That’s until Skye walks back in to Chloe’s life. It’s been years since Chloe last saw Skye. When Tom her lifelong best friend told her that Skye’s band Escaped would be playing at BAR she didn’t expect the white hot fire of desire he evoked in her.  Skye left Bartow thirteen years ago an awkward, pimple faced boy who didn’t quite fit in. That is definitely not the person that showed up at BAR. Skye may have outgrown his awkwardness, but the feelings he hid from Chloe in school was now back tenfold.  As the music plays, tempers flare. Just when Skye thinks he has finally broken down the walls of stone around Chloe’s heart something happens that leave both of them devastated and broken. Are they strong enough to survive?",
