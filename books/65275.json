  "description": "A quiet, lakeside vacation is just what Brielle needs to decompress after her busy concert season. She expects the weeks to pass uneventfully. Until she meets the men next door.  Tyler and Zeke are as adventurous and sexy as the Harleys they ride. The passion they hear in Brielle’s music draws them to her.  Convinced the hunks are gay, Brielle lets down her inhibitions. That turns out to be the best decision she’s made in a long time.",
