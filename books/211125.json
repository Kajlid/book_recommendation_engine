  "title": "The Pandeia and Leukai",
  "description": "In Greek mythology, the small islands of Leukai were created after a musical contest between the Sirens and the Muses. Out of their anguish from losing the competition, the Muses plucked their rivalsâ€™ feathers from their wings; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at Aptera, where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Leukai.Souda, as it is known today, is an islet in Souda Bay on the northwest coast of Crete. In ancient times, this islet was one of two islets that were referred to as Leukai. The second islet is known today as Leon.Sirens were beautiful but dangerous creatures that lured sailors to their demise with their serene and enchanting songs, causing ships to crash on reefs near their islands.Based on this myth, The Pandeia and Leukai is a Shakespearean style sonnet written in fourteen parts. It tells an epic saga of the battle between the noble Captain Hector and the evil siren, Leukai. With the help of the Muses, Hyades, Hera, and other Greek deities, the good Captain avenges the lives of his loyal crew who Leukai lured to their deaths in the sea. Both Heaven and Earth join together to defeat the evil witch. She is cursed by her own arrogance, to live a fate worse than death, for all eternity.",
