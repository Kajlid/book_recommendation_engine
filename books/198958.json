  "description": "He had total control of his game--until she changed all the rules . . .As one of the best players in the NHL and the \"golden boy\" of the league, Avery Westwood knows he has to keep his cool--on and off the ice. His whole life is a carefully constructed image of perfection for the media and his brand sponsors. Of course, that means he can never let his true feelings show. But when it comes to the sexy sister of his former teammate, Avery might be willing to make an exception . . . even if it means breaking all his own rules.As far as Stephanie Deveau is concerned, having a thing for Avery is the equivalent of psychological napalm. Tr√®s bad idea. Then he moves in next door, all sexy smiles and a deliciously hot body that she can't resist. Something's happening between them--it's intense, a little (a lot) out of control, and real. Only Avery doesn't know everything about Stephanie's past. And the one exception to his rule might just be the one girl who could destroy his career.",
