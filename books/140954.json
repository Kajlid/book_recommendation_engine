Learn how to resolve conflict and build more viable relationships with family members, friends, coworkers, acquaintances, and other people with whom you interact. Conflict is an unexpected gift?an opportunity for change. A pearl starts as an irritation in an oyster. Similarly, a new openness in your relationships can be an outcome of conflict. In the course of working through your conflict, you learn to let go of unfounded assumptions and pave new chapters in your relationships. When reconciled, a conflict can be the gift of a second chance.",
