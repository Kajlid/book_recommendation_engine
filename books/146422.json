  "description": "In the five queendoms, the kotti is a sacred animal, believed to possess magical powers. To young Hynkkel, the kotti Mieu is his treasured companion, his friend, his kin…until she is cruelly taken from him in a drunken rage by his violent brother, leaving Hynkkel’s heart as barren as the deserts of his homeland.Commanded by his father to Solo—to travel into the unknown in a test of survival—Hynkkel sets out with little more than the red-gold sandcat pendant, bestowed upon him by a woman, worn around his neck as a reminder of his loss. He begins his journey with nothing…But his trek will bring him to a cave where he will enter the secret world of the cat…And to a trial that will mark his destiny.",
