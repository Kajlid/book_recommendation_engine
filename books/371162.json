But the B-17 bomber that crash-lands outside the village of Delahaut contains the man who will be both the last and the most significant of her temporary residents.Ted Brice is found semiconscious by ten-year-old Jean Benoit, who realises that Claire is the American's pilot's only hope of survival. The month that follows is one that will stay with them both for the rest of their lives. A few weeks only, a handful of days, it is a period in which the war recedes in the face of more powerful forces - before imposing itself once more with shocking sadness.",
