  "description": "Julie wants only one gift this holiday season, but it’s going to take a Christmas miracle to make her wish come true. Julie Hamilton loves Christmas. It’s her favorite time of year, from the cinnamon smell of freshly baked mince-pies to the excitement of buying gifts for family and friends, decorating the tree, and hanging stockings for Santa Claus on the mantelpiece. This Christmas promises to be extra special because she’s expecting the perfect gift--her first baby--on Christmas Eve. However, a chance encounter turns her world upside down, and soon, she’s praying for her very own Christmas miracle. Can the spirit of the Christmas season and the kindness of strangers find a way to make her wish come true?",
