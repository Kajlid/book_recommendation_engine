He doesn t know what sort of creature he would turn into if he ever let himself shift, but he knows it s something predatory and lethal.

He works for the SSU, the agency in charge of tracking shifters particularly the dangerous ones. When he and his young niece are kidnapped by her scum-bucket dad, he s grateful to be rescued by Montag, whose curmudgeonly defenses can t hide the kind man beneath.As they work together to protect Kevin s niece, attraction sizzles between them. But their relationship may not survive if Montag learns who writes Kevin s paycheck or if Montag dares to confront the inner monster he hates and fears. Contains a grouchy virgin shifter (and we mean virginal in \"all\" possible ways), a hero with a back pocket full of secrets, and a couple of jerks.\"",
