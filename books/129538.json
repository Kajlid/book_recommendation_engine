  "description": "Back from the New York Times bestselling Cold Hit, Detective Shane Scully goes up against the beautiful, blonde wife of powerful hip-hop mogul--who stands at the center of a ruthless conspiracyLeaving L.A.'s Parker Center, Shane Scully and his wife, Alexa, agree to meet at home in one hour. Shane gets there; Alexa doesn't.This tale turns deadly, when in the middle of the night, he's called to a crime scene on Mulholland Drive, where the victim, who appears to be a gang member has been handcuffed and executed, gangland style. What's worse is that the victim's body is in Alexa's car. Her service revolver, which Shane discovers nearby, is probably the murder weapon. But Alexa is missing.As Shane desperately tries to find his wife, his leads take him into the frightening world of gangsta rap music and into the center of a feud between two record companies, both heavily manned by Crips and Bloods. At the center of this war is one of the most lethal adversaries he's ever Stacy Maluga, a trashy, beautiful Lady Macbeth-like white woman raised in Compton, married to a multi-millionaire rap mogul and known in the gangsta hip-hop world as the White Sister.Shane is no stranger to big trouble, but he's never had to face being a cop in jail with a hit out on him, while being smeared by urban activists as a \"racist cop.\" Much, much worse than all that is the potential death of his beloved wife, Alexa. In the White Sister, he may have met his match in a powerful and media-savvy enemy who will stop at nothing to forge her own criminal empire.",
