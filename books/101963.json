  "description": "Flynn Monroe tore himself free from the clutches of an army fighting for a cause he no longer believed in. It was not without a heavy cost. He would give his left foot for the peace and solitude of life on his home planet. Some men were not made for a quiet life. Duty to a friend pulls him into a conflict riddled mining town. The dusty planet too close to its star isn’t worth fighting to save… but lives are. With his brother in tow, Flynn soon realizes the corporation behind the attacks is connected to their family in ways that could spell his demise along with everyone on – or in – the planet.",
