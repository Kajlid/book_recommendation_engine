  "description": "A killer virus has struck, and only one community has survived, in this gripping, dark and witty psychological thriller.When the newspapers start talking about a flu pandemic, Josh Pirbright is sure it's just media hype. As the son of the most eminent epidemiologist in the country he knows better than to get hysterical about a virus. Until his father phones from the laboratory with a dark warning, and the newsreels start to show dead bodies piled in the streets, before cutting out altogether. It's time to man the barricades in the picture-postcard village of Great Sheen, and Josh, his sister Martha and best friends Sam and Kitty are on the front line.Â Hav3n is the story of an epidemic and of its aftermath; of being a teenager when all the rules have changed. Life within the claustrophobic confines of the protected village (renamed Haven after the disease that nearly destroyed it) is full of increasingly bizarre rules and secrets, with Josh's father at the heart of the intrigue. What is behind the villagers' survival? And how is it linked to the increasingly despotic behaviour of the adults ruling the New World? There's only one way to find out.",
