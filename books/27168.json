  "description": "The New Kanzas Territory!! They called it Bleeding Kanzas, many thought of it as the beginning of the Civil War and others the beginning of the Wild West, but Auggie Barnes - The Wandering Bird - didn't call it anything, he lived it! Given the name 'The Wandering Bird' by the Shawnee, Auggie runs into trouble against a Missouri Ruffian named John Hendershot who plans on getting even with the pup by kidnapping Auggies future wife - Two Moons. Good friend Corporal Wilcox and a young Jeb Stuart of the 1st Cavalry convince the young frontiersman into scouting for them against the Cheyenne who have been causing havoc on the western Kanzas plains and The Wandering Bird is seriously wounded in the fight. After a full recovery and the birth of his son, The Wandering Bird heads to Texas. His mission is to help a young slave girl named Matilda escape and reunite her with her folks who wait for her in Canada. Auggies young life is spared yet again when the man 'with the crazy blood red eyes' runs his saber thru the bounty hunter with his sights set on Auggie. The meadowlarks sing as Auggie contemplates what the future might bring as he sits with his father and they discuss the troubles that lie ahead. Then he realizes it doesn't matter because he's got his family and he's got Kanzas!",
