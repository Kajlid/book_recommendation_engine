As the descent gets steeper, there is a way out: another friend's fishing boat off the coast of Alaska. There is life after Tacoma. But the choice has to be made, and some friendships feel more than inevitable. Something Pretty, Something Beautiful is the new novel from Eric Barnes, author of Shimmer.",
