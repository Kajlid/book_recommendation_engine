  "description": "Jax, Sergeant-At-Arms of the Insurgents Motorcycle Club, likes his women easy.  Raised in the outlaw biker world, Jax has bedded more women than he can count. The only things on his mind are big ass Harleys, scorching whiskey, and pretty women who can spread on command.  Then he meets Cherri—the stripper with ice blue eyes and white-blonde hair.  He wants her in his bed. She would rather not.  Cherri has complicated stamped all over her. Jax doesn’t need a woman like her messing up his life.  Too bad he can’t stop thinking about her.  Cherri ran away from a bad situation back home. She has secrets she hasn’t shared with anyone. Stripping is her means of making enough money to start a new life, and nothing’s going to screw up her plans.  Then she meets Jax.  He’s gorgeous, sexy, and a cocky bastard. His tattooed, ripped chest and biceps make her drool. She knows she should run far away from him, but her body wants him in the worst way.  Just as she begins to relax, her past collides with her new life. Cherri must navigate a deadly obstacle course littered with outlaw motorcycle clubs and a power-hungry politician.   Jax won’t stop until he claims Cherri. He vows to protect and love Cherri no matter what. When put to the test, will Jax betray his family—the Insurgents MC—or will he lose the woman he loves forever?  The Insurgents MC series are standalone romance novels. This is Jax and Cherri’s love story. This book contains violence, strong language, sensitive issues, and steamy sexual scenes. HEA. No cliffhangers! The book is intended for readers over the age of 18.   Previous Titles in this Series:  Hawk's Property (Book 1)",
