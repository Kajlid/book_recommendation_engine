  "description": "When offered his dream job, Jake Montclaire agrees to move across the country. And why not? His wife has left him, his teenage daughter Amy is taking rebellion to a whole new level and his twelve-year-old son Skeeter started wetting the bed, which he hasn’t done since he was three. Maybe a fresh start is just what the Montclaire family needs.It seems almost too perfect: a gorgeous house on the beach, readymade social life offered up by his enigmatic boss, Gil Vandercamp. Jake is finally getting his life under control. Or is he? Amy comes home with a pentagram carved into her arm and Jake is alarmed: isn’t that the sign of the Devil? “Just a fad,” Gil assures him. “All the kids are doing it.”Amy disappears, and Jake finds evidence to suggest that cult activity is involved. And now the cult is targeting him, intent on ruining every facet of his life. As his life systematically unravels, Jake enlists the help of a neo-pagan witch to search the shadowy underworld of Satanism. What they learn terrifies them: Devil worshippers can be anyone: your boss, your friend, your next door neighbor. Their search leads them to a shocking discovery of ritual abuse and sex slaves, a world where nothing is what it seems and the players will stop at nothing to feed their obsession with serving Satan.",
