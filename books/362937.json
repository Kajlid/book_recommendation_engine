  "title": "Terror Tracks: Music, Sound and Horror Cinema",
  "description": "Commissioned and edited to appeal to a crossover Film and Music Studies readership, Terror Tracks is an anthology that analyses the use of music and sound in the popular genre of Horror cinema. Focusing on the post-War period, contributors analyse the role of music and sound in establishing and enhancing the senses of unease, suspense and shock crucial to the genre. The anthology shows the various patterns of use an inflection in a range of scores - orchestral, popular, rock and electronic - and how these relate to non-musical sound. Lively and accessible, Terror Tracks is an important contribution to study of Horror cinema.",
