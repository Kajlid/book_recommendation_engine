  "description": "He’s the boss’s son. She’s his best friend’s little sister. Falling in love could lead to disaster.What do you do when your boss makes someone else the lead on a big renovation project that should rightfully be yours? You quit. On second thought, that might not be the best idea, but Charlee Jackson has never been one for second thoughts. Instead, she lands a big contract of her own. She’s jumping into her new life—work boots, tool belt and all. Now she just needs to form a company, hire a crew, and not fall in love with her former boss’s son. Yeah. Definitely not that last one.Peter Elliot couldn’t date a co-worker. But now that his dad let Charlee walk out the door, Peter is considering his options. She is his best friend’s sister and the only thing that made the drudgery of running a large construction business bearable. But how do you date a competitor, especially one your father is trying to drive out of business? It would be stupid to make his dad angry right before he hands over the company, right?When Charlee and Peter are scheduled to work on the same Indulgence Row house, their feelings and priorities are put to the test. They need to make a choice, and they better be quick about it, because the whole mixture is curing fast and threatening to crumble to pieces.Previously titled Love Under Construction.",
