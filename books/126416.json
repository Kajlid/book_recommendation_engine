  "description": "ANGELS OF THE REVOLUTION is commiepunk, dieselpunk literary fiction set in Gothland, a nation based on Germany's post First World War Weimar Republic. In the gritty, sexy capitol city of Weimarstadt, two former pilots who fought and flew for the now lynched Kaiser have become socialist revolutionaries. Katyusha and her lesbian lover, the Major, take advantage of a lull in the ongoing revolution to search the streets of Weimarstadt for Der Film, a mysterious and legendary piece of cinematography whose origins, significance, and whereabouts are not clear. But what of the reactionary, proto-fascist Freikorps? Do they have an interest in the film as well? This short novel of 62,000 words portrays a world of guns and cars and motorcycles, sex workers, bohemians, and transvestites. But this work aims at no shallow voyeurism. Katyusha, the main character, is a radical Christian, socialist, and dangerous \"gun girl\" haunted by the war, and is now struggling with depression, absinthe, and a profound ambivalence to the violence which threatens her sanity. Imagine Noam Chomsky crossed with Thomas Merton and Thomas Pynchon, and you might get an idea of what this book is like. The people who have been telling us good literature can not be political are in for a surprise.",
