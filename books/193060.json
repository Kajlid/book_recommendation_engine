  "description": "Her rules are the only ones I've never been tempted to break.  Rule #13 â€“ All the rules apply to both of us evenly. We're in this together, no matter what.  She's just so...  Ugh, I can't even explain it. Perfect? I feel like that word isn't good enough. What's better than perfect? I have no idea.  It's funny. I always used to think it'd be hard to tell a girl I loved her. I wasn't ever really planning on doing it, but I guess I figured it'd happen some day. It's not like I lost sleep over it, but I always wondered how it worked. When do you say it? How do you know when to say it, or how to say it, or what to say along with it, and everything else like that.  It's not that hard, though. It's not that confusing. I can't explain it, but with Ashley it's like I know everything I never knew before. I don't have to worry about it.  I love you, Princess. It's the easiest thing I've ever done.  We've spent every day this summer together. That's the easy part. Going back to school after our summer break is over? It seems impossible. This is going to be the hardest thing I've ever done.",
