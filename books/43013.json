  "description": "\"Charles, what do you bench?” Abby asked. “Three hundred,” Charles said quietly, shooting a glance at Mason, who reddened. “Abby, you look amazing tonight, by the way. That color is really fit on you.” Rowan practically tipped the table over she stood up so fast. He had almost forgotten she was there. He felt sorry for her, but it was for the best that she see the reality of the situation.“I’ve got to…” she said stupidly, then stalked away.“Oh, man, Charles. What’s with your girlfriend?” Mason snorted, little flecks of dressing flying from his mouth, like it was the funniest thing anyone had ever said.“That’s very clever, Mason,” Charles said calmly. What he really wanted was to grab him across the table and punch his front teeth down his throat. But then he would be as big a wanker as his cousin.ABIGAIL SHELTON IS DEAD Spring Valley's golden girl is found floating face-down in her boyfriend's pool, hands bound behind her back, head bleeding, drugs and alcohol in her system.
