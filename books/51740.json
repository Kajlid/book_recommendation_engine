  "title": "Pumpkin Jack",
  "description": "When his beloved jack-o'-lantern starts to decompose, Tim puts it outside and watches it transform from pumpkin―to seed―to pumpkin again. The first pumpkin Tim ever carved was fierce and funny, and he named it Jack. When Halloween was over and the pumpkin was beginning to rot, Tim set it out in the garden and throughout the weeks he watched it change. By spring, a plant began to grow! Will Hubbell's gentle story and beautifully detailed illustrations give an intimate look at the cycle of life.",
