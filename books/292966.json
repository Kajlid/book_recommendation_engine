  "description": "A Prequel to Mister Moneybags as part of the Cocky World. It's my last semester of Wharton Business School with my best friend Bianca George. She's been with me for the past year and a half and my rock when my world fell apart. She doesn't judge, instead she encourages me to be better. She's the one who encouraged me to go to New York City for the weekend. She had no idea what was going to happen.We met at a club. I never meant to do anything with him, but I lost control for one night. One night of losing myself with a man who was way out of my league. It was perfect, sensual and confusing all wrapped up into one magnificent night. When the morning came, I slipped away leaving Blake in a bed all of his own. He didn't like that very much. He wanted more and I did too, but I didn't want anything serious. I promised him one weekend. One weekend, with no strings attached. When the weekend was over, I walked away and didn't look back. He didn't look away. We weren't supposed to happen, but we did. It was supposed to be a fling, but he had a different idea. Blake was everything I wasn't. He was rich, well-known and gorgeous. I was just your average, every-day girl. There's no way we'll ever work, right?",
