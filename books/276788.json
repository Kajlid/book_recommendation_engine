  "description": "The stunning conclusion to Parallel.  Someone has torn them apart in the past, and she plans to do it again…  As Nick and Quinn piece together the truth about the life they once shared, they discover it was much deeper and darker than they ever imagined. In order to keep history from repeating, Quinn will need to master her unusual gifts—but that means admitting to herself and to Nick why she stopped using them in the first place.  He may never forgive her when he learns the truth, but Quinn is running out of options—because the clock is ticking, and it’s no longer just her life that hangs in the balance.",
