  "description": "Nature knows where you belong.For more than two decades, my entire world was made up of three square miles, buried deep in the woods. The same three people, the same daily routine. Life revolved around trying to keep my mother, brother, and myself safe from my father's \"corrections.\"When a sudden bout of violence reveals a way out, I find myself speeding towards a new life behind the wheel of a stolen pickup, the bed loaded down with a feral monster that used to be my brother.Now I'm hungry and lost in a new world filled with dynamics I know nothing about. When the sheriff of a nearby town offers to help, I'm hesitant. He swears his pack of friends, dominant and gorgeous, can help my brother adjust to what he's become. But the longer I spend around them the more I worry accepting their help means I won’t escape their care with my heart and soul intact.With my past hot on my heels and new threats bearing down, there’s only one question left to answer: am I willing to pay their price, even if it means changing everything I thought I knew about myself?I thought the woods were my prison.But what if I was wrong?Maybe I was hidden for a reason, and I just left behind the only place that was keeping me safe.",
