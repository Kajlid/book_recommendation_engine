  "description": "Centuries ago, The Cailleach entrusted the Hopewell Coven with the honor of guiding the Apacik Indians, a Native American tribe hailing from the Mississippi Flatwoods. Natural-born Healers, the Apacik’s innate ability, to either restore the sick or inflict pain upon the healthy, made them vulnerable and desperate for clear direction about how to use their gift. The Hopewells could advise them, instruct them, even befriend them, but under no circumstances could they fall in love. Pure bloodlines were essential to power, and as the Supreme Order of Witches, The Cailleach demanded all their members marry within covens. Birthed out of the forbidden marriage between an Apacik man and a Celtic witch, fifteen-year-old Starling Hopewell is the only one of her kind. A half-breed. The Cailleach never allow her or her parents to forget it. Because of her mother’s position as leader of the Hopewells, Starling is allowed to train for Elementals, testing that will confirm if she is worthy to enter their Order, but evil lingers. Within The Cailleach—dark magick infiltrates its leader and its Elders—and will stop at nothing to bring the half-breed down. Four trials. Four elements. Four weeks to master them all. Embrace Destiny. Face the Fire.",
