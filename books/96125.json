  "description": "Pandora Ann Phillips' life is just normal-crazyHer mom's a psychic, her dad's mom is a snob, her mom's parental units are \"too down to earth\" and her best friends are newlyweds. Okay, so her best friends being newlyweds isn't really abnormal, but living with them in a cramped two-bedroom apartment definitely is. Sex, sex, sex is totally on their minds. Actually it's not only on their minds, but it's on the kitchen table, couch, on top of the washer...well, you get the picture.Being a celibate (not by choice, mind you) full-time college student, and an almost full-time barista, Pandora can't afford to lose anymore sleep. So, she seeks out a new place to lay her head. Enter three \"drool worthy\" male models that are looking for a fourth roommate and they want her...and won't take no for an answer.Hilarity ensues as Pandora's life turns completely upside down, and she begins to wonder if it will ever be the same again!",
