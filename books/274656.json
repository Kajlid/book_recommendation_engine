  "description": "Marcus was likely dead, killed by the Inquisition, or so it was believed. Then the vampire was found, broken beyond words, in an isolated prison fortress. Marcus had never expected to see daylight again, let alone be rescued by his mate. Now he worries he’ll drag Caleb into his darkness.Caleb was the one who pulled Marcus out of his prison cell, and he’s determined to drag him from the nightmares of his mind as well. After all, that’s what mates are for, and Caleb had lost hope at finding his. And if he can help destroy the entire Inquisition? Well, all the better.Dealing with Marcus’s physical and mental healing from his trauma is difficult enough, but Inquisition holdouts are causing chaos everywhere, and sinister plots are rampant. Marcus and Caleb have no choice but to fight back. It’s a good thing they are not alone.Author's Note: This title is not stand-alone.Content Warnings:Graphic (explicit, detailed description): Blood, Death, Mental Illness (PTSD), Panic Attacks/Disorders, Violence (guns, magical)Moderate: Genocide, Gore, Medical Content, Racism (fantasy races)Minor (brief mention or description): Confinement, Kidnapping, Medical Trauma, Sexual Content (fade-to-black), Torture, War",
