  "description": "Secrets are hard to keep, especially when you’re in high school, and the students at Wildwood High have been hiding more than most. But, when thirteen friends discover their families are keeping more secrets than the entire student body combined, they find themselves drawn together in a dangerous search for the truth. Wildwood is not the average trendy neighborhood, and The Ravens Crossing, the corner at its heart, is not an average crossing. When the Thirteen begin to uncover strange events in the Grove, passing the next test suddenly involves more than reading from a textbook.

The Thirteen must learn to use their natural talents to navigate the treacherous secrets they have only just begun to uncover. Join Lucas, Riley, Morgan, Holly, Kaz, Quinn, Darci, Elliot, Sharon, Alex, Raiden, Hemp, and Tetsuya as they discover the importance of trust and what it truly means to have power.The Ravens Crossing is a serialized, young adult, science fiction/fantasy adventure.
