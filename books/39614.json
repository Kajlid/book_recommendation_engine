  "description": "When Claire finds her husband in the arms of a handsome Parisian, her life has reached a turning point. She believed that, along with her profession as an established travel writer, she would have a perfect marriage and a beautiful baby. With her biological clock ticking and her world newly shattered, she travels to Venice where she seeks the comfort of her quirky friend, Josie. Unprepared for love's unpredictable itinerary, Claire finds herself wooed by two men, only to discover that Josie has run a personal ad without her permission. Kismet evaporates and a comedy of errors ensues, magnified by advice from the unbidden spirits Byron, Tintoretto, and other artistic and literary shades that continue to linger in Venice. For Claire, love remains as precarious as life in this watery city.",
