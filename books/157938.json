Emma Taylor thought she left Cedar Lake behind and the boy who broke her heart along with it but…Fate had other ideas.Emma:Tragedy has brought me back to this small Texas town where everything and nothing has changed. The nothing being I still find myself attracted to the boy, now man, who ruined me all those years ago. I shouldn’t want him. I know what it’s like to be burned by him, but… I can’t deny the pull of Braz Huntswell, especially now that I’m his daughter’s teacher. —Brazos Huntswell’s life didn’t turn out how he planned in high school. He was supposed to leave Cedar Lake and chase his college baseball dreams before coming home to take over his family’s cattle ranch. Two pink lines on a piece of plastic was the fly ball out of nowhere.Braz:Being a single dad is tough. Being a single dad to a hormonal teenage daughter should qualify me for sainthood. Not only that, I’m trying to keep my family’s legacy alive. I gave up on love after my ex-wife left me to shoulder everything on my own. But that all changed when I hear her voice on the other end of the phone… The one who got away, well, the one I pushed away—Emma Taylor, my Red. —Cedar Lake isn’t the town they once knew, and people are turning up dead. Someone doesn’t want Braz and Emma together, and they’d do anything to keep them apart… permanently.",
