  "title": "Thoughts from Walden Pond",
  "description": "Henry David Thoreau (American, 1817 -- 1862) extracted himself from the routines of employment and civilized sociability to spend two years in the woods. Walden, Thoreau's book about his experience published in 1854, has become one of the most highly respected works in American literature.In Thoughts from Walden Pond, Charles Gurche's brilliant photographs from the diverse regions of America are paired with excerpts from Thoreau's masterpiece. The pictures with the text transport us to a state of heightened awareness and impart an almost cellular sense of the importance of wild places. Dona Budd's introductory essay offers an engrossing biography of Thoreau along with her insightful reflections on Walden.",
