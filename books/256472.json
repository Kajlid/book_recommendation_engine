  "description": "He’s sworn to find his son.  Dallas Mason did whatever was necessary to survive his stint in black ops. While in the Collective, there was no line he wouldn’t cross, and no mission he wouldn’t take. He bedded the enemy to secure his freedom and return to his brothers and build a new life, where the lines between right and wrong are sometimes blurred, but never erased. Now he and everyone at The Arsenal has one mission: find his son. His family and team will stop at nothing to achieve the goal—including sidelining Dallas from the hunt.  She’s sworn to find her father’s killer.  Kamren Garrett learned to rely on no one long ago. Surrounded by enemies, and surviving in hostile territory is nothing new for her. She can outshoot, outhunt, and out track anyone. She doesn’t need a Mason dictating what she can and can’t do to uncover the secrets of her father’s death. Dallas thinks she’s the problem. She doesn’t have time to handle him. She’s close to identifying her quarry. Unfortunately, she discovers she’s over her head and in need of help and she turns to the last person she ever wanted to ask—Dallas Mason.  Forced to take a step back from his true objective, Dallas sets his sights on fixing the problems threatening his son’s future home. Teamed with Kamren, he’ll uncover more than they expected. Failure isn’t an option when it comes to blood vows.",
