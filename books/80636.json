Desperate to overcome the paralysis of grief that has gripped her life since the loss of her husband in a tragic hunting accident, Kimberley Piper takes the challenge. But can a closer walk with God truly fill the void? Kim is determined to find out. What begins as a straightforward rescue mission rapidly becomes complicated. Who would have thought that seeking His calling for her life could result in a night spent at the local lockup? And since when did searching to do His will require that she apprehend criminals? Beverly Fox was born in Ontario and educated in England. She currently resides in British Columbia, Canada, with her husband, their three children, and a menagerie of dogs and horses. To date only published as a poet, she is excited to now debut her first Christian novel.",
