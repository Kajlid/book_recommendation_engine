  "description": "When Professor Harold Grenning borrowed the text called \"Ladalo\" from the local magic shop, he understood that it would be an interesting read. However, he never imagined that it would suck him into another reality that included vampyres, daemons and a beautiful hybrid named Adriana. Destiny steps in, making both aware that not only are they meant to be together, but they are also meant to fight in an impossible war against two powerful enemies, both of which have a vendetta against Adriana. Plot twists and original ideas litter this novel, and as a first installment of a trilogy, the ending leaves you wanting more.",
