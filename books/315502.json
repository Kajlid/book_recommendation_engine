  "description": "The Blood Pressure Program has been designed for anyone in constant fear of the symptoms associated with high blood pressure.Based on the description provided, it is a 100% natural program that neither promotes medications or tiresome diets and exercises. Instead, author Christian Goodman trusts that certain moves help to target the main organ deemed responsible for fluctuations in blood pressure. To better understand the benefits of the Blood Pressure Program, it is crucial for one to assess how it works.The Blood Pressure Program aims to boost the brain, which according to Christian Goodman, is the main organ that either makes or breaks blood pressure levels. The brain controls everything found within the body, however, the biggest difficulty that it faces is being able to manage blood pressure. As voiced by Christian:“When you sit down, your brain tells your heart, arteries, and kidneys to lower your blood pressure. When you stand up an immediate signal is sent to raise your blood pressure and pump more.”The Blood Pressure Program is as self-explanatory as it gets; it aims to manage blood pressure levels. That said, the target is obviously not that intuitive. Most often, when consumers think blood pressure, their minds immediately link it to the heart, but Christian Goodman insists that the root cause is the brain and the extent to which it is exposure to stress.By introducing exercises that have been studied through research, individuals are anticipated to look and feel better upon waking up. Not to forget one’s ability to do things that they once feared would put them at risk.",
