  "description": "Cautious after a lifetime of disappointments, Eva is mistrustful of Bhathian's professed feelings of love. She accepts him as a lover and a confidant but not as a life partner. Jackson suspects that Tessa is his true love mate, but unless she can overcome her traumatic past, he might never find out. Carol gets an offer she can't refuseâ€”a chance to prove that there is more to her than meets the eye. Robert believes she's about to commit a deadly mistake, but when he tries to dissuade her, she asks him to leave. This time for good.",
