  "description": "The spotlight is my enemy.The cameras are my cure. Jordan Wells says he can help me. Heal my soul and fix my fear so I can perform on stage again to a sold-out crowd. His game gives me a reason to go on, but his price is total exposure. The stranger watching my every move is anonymous.Or is he?The daily notes he leaves seem familiar. His unreasonable requests bring out all my hidden fears. And then one night in the dark… his touch is everything I ever wanted. It was supposed to be a guaranteed win.A way to move past the performance anxiety.One less thing to worry about in a sea of dreadful things to worry about. But what we do in the secret anonymity of night might be more frightening than anything else. Because I like it. And I want more of it. And I’m willing to give up everything just so I can play this game forever…",
