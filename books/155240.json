  "title": "The Salzburg Connection",
  "description": "In 1945, with their thousand-year empire falling around them and the Allies on their heels, the Nazis hide a sealed chest in the dark, forbidding waters of the Finstersee—a lake surrounded by the brooding peaks of the Austrian Alps. There it lies for 21 years, almost forgotten, until a British agent decides to raise it from the depths . . . The secrets he uncovers are far-reaching and lethal, and in Salzburg, Bill Mathison—a New York attorney on the trail of a missing colleague—finds himself drawn into the shadowy underworld of international espionage. Not knowing who to trust amidst the chaos, he is drawn to two beautiful women, one of whom will betray him.",
