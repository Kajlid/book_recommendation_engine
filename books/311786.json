I want to keep her.Lucky for Celia she fails to see that there is no goodness in me and when she attempts to draw me in with her innocence, and sweet naive heart I thrive to show her the cruel monster I am.This is a dark mafia romance, that contains non-con/dub con, graphic violence, and sexual themes.
