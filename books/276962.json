  "description": "Leigh Lou Mars finished college, but is now a starving artist, unable to afford rent. With no choice left, she submits an application to go to the Legion Academy, where she’ll be trained to use her powers to help keep the world safe from knaves.  She’d never wanted to use her fire powers this way, preferring to use them to make her glass sculptures, but as talented as she is, no one buys enough to keep her shop open. With no other real skills, she’s stuck. The Legion pays well, so she can put in her time and once she’s saved enough, she can go back to what she loves most.  What she didn’t realize was going to the Academy was like a mix of high school and boot camp and it was utter hell.   ***This is a reverse harem series",
