  "description": "Margit Anderson, a Seattle-based free-lance translator of Scandinavian languages, discovers the body of an elderly Danish man, apparently murdered by a robber. She receives a letter from the victim, however, containing sketches of and runic hints to a long-lost (and supposedly destroyed) Danish treasure. Symbolic dreams, office and home break-ins, and dangerous pursuit punctuate her subsequent quest for information.",
