  "description": "The Knights TemplarThey had all joined taking three vows: poverty, chastity, and obedience…for they were monks: warrior monks, dedicated to the protection of pilgrims in the Holy Land—until stories spread by an avaricious king who wanted their wealth for his own destroyed the order.There was one knight however, who escaped the stake, vowing justice as he watched his innocent brother die.In the Service of the LordSimon Puttock has not been a bailiff of Lydford Castle long in this year of 1316 when he is called to a nearby village to examine a burned-out cottage and the dead body within. But it is the newly arrived knight, Sir Baldwin Furnshill, who discerns the deceased was no victim of a tragic mishap; he was, in fact, murdered prior to the blaze. Simon would be well-served by accepting further assistance from this astute, though haunted and secretive stranger. For a second fatal burning indicates that some harsh evil has invaded this once-peaceful place, and its hunger has yet to be sated.",
