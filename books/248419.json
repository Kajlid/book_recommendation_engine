  "description": "Vacationing with a splash of blood… Rennie Laval was about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime. A virgin cruiser, what better way to pop her cherry than onboard the luxurious Norwegian. Set to sail to the sunny Caribbean on a week long vacation, her only expectation was to soak up the warm sun, and spectacular sights, all while consuming frothy umbrella drinks. Travelling solo didn’t faze her, not when she would be a part of a group of cruisers, known fondly as “Book Splashers.” A unique author signing event at sea, getting the chance to attend was a dream come true for an avid reader like Rennie. The large group of more than three hundred authors, readers, photographers, models had welcomed her with open arms. The hosts, Harper Sloan and Felicia Lynn, reassuring her she’d never be left on her own. Duke Kincaid was fed up with life. After catching his fiancee in bed with his best friend, he spontaneously booked himself on a cruise, needing to get away from their betrayal. A Caribbean vacation was just the escape he needed. Colliding with another solo traveller, a raven-haired beauty, seemed like fate. A little fling on the open waters would definitely go a long way to wiping out unwanted memories. While he and Rennie grow closer on and off board the ship, they’re both flung headfirst into a nightmare when members of the Book Splash start showing up dead. The first tragic death seemed like an accident, but when the body count rises higher than imaginable, and the deaths become more gruesome, it’s clear that a sinister force is stalking the ship, focused on the members of their group. Trapped in the middle of the ocean. Ensnared in a deadly game of kill or be killed. What would you do in order to ensure your own survival? For Rennie, Duke and the Book Splashers, their dream vacation may be their last.",
