All he's ever wanted was to love her, to protect her, and to be hers, but it's not so easy.  She pushes, he pulls. She hurts, he loves.  Both are holding onto ghosts of their pasts and in order for them to peruse a relationship they'll have to let them go.WARNING: This is a darkish New Adult friends-to-lovers romance kind of book.
