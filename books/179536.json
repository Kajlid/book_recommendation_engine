Her job as a reporter at a small Boston news station and her love life are going nowhere, but the thing that worries her most is the fact that Erin has started seeing things.

It's then that she realizes it's not simply a shadow but her guardian angel, a beautiful female angel named Gabrielle, with turquoise eyes and a teasing smile that makes Erin's heart race.
