Unable to bear human contact, she lives as a hermit, immersing herself in the water that gives her peace and amplifies her power.Her new FBI handler, though, only believes what he can see. The problem? Her gift-the ability to psychically locate stolen jewels-only works in the nude. Special Agent Nathan Smith can't believe he's expected to babysit some psychic finder. Psychic...right. An undercover op gone wrong may have left him a desk jockey-and Ciara's charms are more distracting than he cares to admit-but he's a field agent at heart. She's working some kind of angle. It's just a matter of time before he unravels it.Sent to Atlantic City to recover a ruby necklace for Monaco's royal family, both finder and Fed are pushed outside their comfort zones, and discover more than they ever believed possible. And when a trap is sprung, they realize they stand to lose much more than a sparkly stone...Warning: This book contains gambling, go-go dancers, public indecency, and every brand of trouble a troubled psychic can get into in America's Playground.",
