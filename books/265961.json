  "description": "Jenna West has no idea what she might have done to her new tenant Mike Hightower. He's surly and hateful every single time they meet, and he looks at her as though he despises her. He does despise her. She's from the Middle East, and people like her killed his friend Ramirez when the army sent them to Iraq. Will the power of love work its magic to soften Mike's bitter hatred, or will he ignore his growing attraction for his pretty landlady?",
