  "description": "Rett Gordon, the lead singer and primary songwriter for breakout country stars Rett Gordon and the Last Train Home, has a problem: despite the city of Nashville re-opening after the global pandemic, allowing the band to play sold-out concerts once again, he suffers from writer’s block. Knowing that a new album is necessary as part of their contractual obligations with Giant Records, he needs to get the songs written.When the record label hires renowned poet Nico St. John to assist with the writing of the band’s fast-tracked sophomore album, Rett is incensed, trusting his own skills and talents as a songwriter. St. John, initially unimpressed with Rett, is a reluctant partner, seeing the job as a temporary stop-over in her career in academia.Despite their initial averseness, Rett and Nico begin working together – and the sparks of attraction become harder and harder to hide. As they write the album, Rett’s stardom becoming more and more apparent, the band lands a surprise tour with industry superstar Mackenzie Taylor – who may have ulterior motives of her own with Rett.Fun, flirty and full of heart, All The Right Notes is “the perfect summer romance read.” (Readers' Favorite 5-star review)",
