Which makes her attraction to the werewolf Alpha s heir more than a tad inconvenient.Bastian Lykaios is just the kind of dominant male who drives her crazy, and not in a good way. And yet, she can t help wanting him in the \"worst\" way.The moment he arrives at the Refuge Resort, Bastian is in lust. The were-leopards administrative assistant is a study in a cheerleader-perky blonde with a body built for sin, the mouth of a sailor, and a lead foot for her classic car.Unfortunately, there s no time to indulge in an affair, not while a werekind traitor is leaking information to the human press. But when Tori is kidnapped by a pair of scientists to use as a live specimen, Bastian s plan for damage control turns into a rescue mission. One where all means of rescue are on the table including betraying his own kind. Two strong personalities clashing in and out of bed, in every possible position in classic convertibles, in the desert, in the woods, up against the wall, bent over a desk, and even occasionally on a mattress. \"",
