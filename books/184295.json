  "title": "No Fears, No Excuses: What You Need to Do to Have a Great Career",
  "description": "A provocative new approach to discovering your true calling in life and achieving not just a good career, but a great oneOver the past three decades, professor Larry Smith has become something of a “career whisperer” for his students at the University of Waterloo. Each year, millions of talented college students graduate with little or no real sense of what their next step will be, yet they are determined not to settle for a so-so career; they are looking for a great career. Smith points out that only a few fortunate souls are born knowing exactly what they want to pursue in life. The rest of us have to stop making excuses and start asking ourselves tough questions about achieving our goals.  In his straightforward, no-nonsense approach, Smith itemizes and dismisses all the usual excuses, fears, and worries that people hide behind when trying to find their true direction. His unusual take on this challenging conundrum is both universal and timely, and his stunning TEDx talk on this subject has been viewed by more than six million people so far.  This is the perfect book for any college graduate who is wondering where he or she fits into the world. It won't necessarily be easy, but if you follow Smith’s guidance, your career dreams can indeed come true.",
