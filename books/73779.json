  "description": "The Living. The Dead. Someone In-between. It began as a fever, leaving its victims psychotic and delusional. It only became out of control when some of those victims died and unexpectedly came back from the dead as zombies, throwing the world into a panic. Victor Lyonie, the Lion, watched his wife and daughter die, then had to kill them himself just to make sure they stayed that way. All he wanted to do was go home, but instead, he found himself infected like no other human being had ever been before. He wasn't a zombie, but he wasn't himself anymore either. The voice of his dead wife revealed to him a new purpose and responsibility. Clad in chainmail, he sets out to rebuild as much as he could with the few survivors he could find. The Jackal, an ex-con, abiding by his sudden seemingly divine visions, uses the breakdown of society to slowly build a roving army, wiping out everything in its path on the way to his new kingdom, where his new world will begin. Nothing, not even hordes of flesh eating zombies will stand in his way. Good and Evil have been renamed as the beasts circle each other with the walking dead in-between looking to end it all. From the celebrated author of MORNINGSTARS!",
