  "description": "A Dark & Twisted Sci-Fi RomanceTrapped like an animal. Shared like a piece of meat.This alien wilderness is no place for an innocent little human like me. I should have been more careful. Should have watched my step.Now I’m caught in the hunters’ snare.Three primitive alien beasts are coming to claim their prize. Three battle-hardened predators with brutal muscles and gleaming tusks.And I’m their prey.They’re going to make a meal out of me, and there’s nothing I can do about it. But is that real hunger in their eyes, or is it something else?I belong to the carnivores now. I’m theirs to toy with as they please. Theirs to use. Theirs to share.Theirs to devour.If I should try to escape, they will punish me thoroughly. But if I stick around, I’ll be eaten alive.And the most shameful part of all?That’s exactly what I want.Meat is a dark reverse harem romance with rough, explicit scenes, spankings, and a whole lot of other dirty, dirty stuff. There are also action scenes containing graphic violence. If you find such material offensive, you’ll want to give this book a pass. There is no cheating and a deliciously dark HEA.",
