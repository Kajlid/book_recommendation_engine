  "description": "Don’t you know I’d defy death to bring you back?\nEvery year the fae king organizes deathly trials with human tributes to please the gods.This year, I am taking part in them.My goal? To enter the palace in the aftermath and take the king out.My advantage? I am no ordinary human. Not anymore.My mistake? I hadn’t counted on my magic failing me, or on Jai, the fae king’s arrogant dragon-summoner, volunteering to fight beside me in the trials.I hadn’t counted on resurfacing feelings and memories, and on the people surrounding me not being who they seem.I am a thorn, a blade honed to fight, but I am foiled by prophecies and signs, illusions and lies.What does my heart truly want? What is the truth? And what price will I have to pay to find out?The legend of Theseus meets the Little Mermaid, with a dash of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, in this epic romance story set against a sky full of dragons.*Look inside the book for warnings*",
