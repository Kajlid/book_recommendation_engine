Self-proclaimed Superflirt Dee Barton can’t wait to spend it practicing her Nine Rules of Flirting on all the cute guys who come to stay at her family’s campground. Why not?

Sabrina Owens’s summer plans include keeping her over-the-top karaoke DJ mother in check, maintaining her status as the queen of the popular crowd—and being the perfect girlfriend to Blaine. Both girls see each other as the enemy. But when a secret blog embroils them in a frivolous lawsuit, they must team up and embark on a risky, flirt-filled plot to set things right again…and maybe prove they’re not so different after all.Laura Bowers’s new novel is a heartfelt and hilarious story of friendship, family…and flirting!",
