Almost anything.When she begs me to come on a weekend getaway so I can bond with her new boyfriend, I can’t say no—no matter how badly I want to.

He has the nerve to bring his single best friend Davis on the trip, too. Davis is too handsome, so funny and smart he can’t possibly be human. Grandma’s, babies and kittens fall for his smile.In fact, everyone adores but me **narrows eyes** What’s he hiding?I refuse to fall for his act; at some point he’ll will drop the Good Guy act and show his true colors: he’s a player, too. He must be.You know the saying: if he seems too good to be true, he probably is.",
