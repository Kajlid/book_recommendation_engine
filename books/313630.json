  "title": "Why We Shouldn't Drink Alcohol",
  "description": "What if everything you thought you knew about alcohol turned out to be false?Alcohol underpins our celebrations, our social events and our mealtimes to such an extent that we canâ€™t imagine these occasions without a drink in our hand. When we started drinking, we were told that alcohol is a necessary part of the social experience and that we needed to learn to accept the unpleasant taste and the effects.The NHS and the Government tell us that we should drink in moderation, sticking to 14 units a week or less. This advice has failed to check our alcohol intake, which has risen over the past three decades to record levels.We recognise that alcohol has the potential to cause harm but we each believe there are benefits to drinking in moderation and see alcohol as relaxing, pleasurable and part of the social experience.In this groundbreaking book the author explains exactly how alcohol works on us, tricking each of us into consuming more than we should, more often. He argues that we are 100% perfect social beings in our natural state. The book challenges the beliefs that we hold about alcohol and makes the compelling argument that we should give it up completely, resulting in a happier, healthier life without feeling shortchanged or deprived.",
