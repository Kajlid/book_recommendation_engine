But circumstances beyond their control separated them, and twelve years later they’re still searching. Apart, they’re broken and they won’t give up until they find each other.But what if they never do?\nThe Memory of Us is a complete standalone angsty soulmate romance with all the feels. You can expect heartbreak, miscommunication, searching, crying, loving and a sigh-worthy ending. No cliffhanger!",
