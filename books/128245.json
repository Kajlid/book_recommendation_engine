  "description": "Finding refuge from Cyraria's lethal heat in an underground network of caverns, it doesn't take Dirck Brightstar long to discover these are no ordinary caves. Something has not only intensified his awareness but brought visions of events to come that have dire consequences if allowed to proceed without intervention. With his father's imprisonment motivated entirely by hostile political forces the revelation that the man's life is in danger demands action. Plunged into a level of responsibility and intrigue far beyond what Mira III prepared him for, Dirck has no choice but to tackle the evil forces which have scattered the family across the galaxy if he ever wants to see everyone reunited again. This is the third volume of the Star Trails Tetralogy following both \"Beyond the Hidden Sky\" and \"A Dark of Endless Days.\" While intended to be read in order each can be enjoyed independently. Visit www.kallioperisingpress.com for additional information about the series and Star Trails universe including a glossary of terms and definitions. Also included is a section for parents and educators who may wish to use the books as a springboard for discussion.",
