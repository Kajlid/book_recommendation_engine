  "description": "Paying off the tooth fairy was supposed to make Sadie's life easier. Uh huh.  There's Ingrid, her psychic roommate pregnant with a magic baby. There's also Abe, the former sheriff and dude of Sadie's dreams, now a scarred werewolf with mood swings that come with claws and teeth. And while navigating those two, Sadie's also got Benji... bisexual, enigmatic, and dangerously appealing.  But Sadie's about to realize her relationship woes pale in comparison to the big bad that's in town. Everyone's on the lookout for hunters, and the tension has Sadie jonesing for a teeth fix. She's managed to stay sober of the bone magic, but when cats turn up dead and vampire queens are calling in favors, the appeal of using magic becomes too hard to resist. With too much to lose, Sadie's going to have to decide whether her power can help save her friends and Grimloch, or if using it will make her bite it in a big way.",
