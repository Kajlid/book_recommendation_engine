From their 1st encounter at a local farm, he reveals how he slowly grows to love this energetic, intelligent & loyal animal. Taking daily walks in nearby parkland, he begins to understand & appreciate Bashan as a living being, witnessing his delight in chasing rabbits, deer & squirrels along with his careful investigations of stones, fallen branches & clumps of wet leaves. As the bond deepens, he's led to contemplate Bashan's inner life & marvels at the ease with which the dog trusts him completely. Over time, the two develop deep mutual understanding, but there's always a sense of loss at never being able to enter the private world of his dear friend. He slowly becomes conscious of the eternal divide between humans & the rest of nature. Nonetheless, the relationship quietly moves to the forefront of his life. When they're briefly separated, he's taken aback by the depth of his loneliness. This deep affection for another living creature helps him attain newfound understanding of love in all its complexity. 1st published in 1916, translated into English in 1923, Bashan & I was heralded for its simple telling of how a dog became a priceless companion, an animal who brought meaning to the author's life.",
