I never saw that darned light that should have taken me to join my dead husband, Sam. We shared a lifetime as celebrated gardeners. I vow to find a way to spend eternity with him, too.

Along the way, I protect some living relatives, as well as learn from the spirits inhabiting my new world. I even have a run-in with The Forgotten, still bitter because we didn’t move their bodies from the park where they’d been buried long ago.My spirit friends and I play tricks to pass the time. But the afterlife could be dangerous. My friends save me from a terrifying spirit before I was maimed as badly as young Jodi. Yet, as I continue searching for Sam, I become so desperate to learn other souls’ secrets, I commit a vicious act.",
