  "title": "Investigating Veronica Mars: Essays on the Teen Detective Series",
  "description": "During the course of its three seasons, Veronica Mars captured the attention of fans and academics alike. The 12 scholarly essays in this collection examine the show's most compelling elements. Topics covered include vintage television, the search for the mother, fatherhood, the show's connection to classical Greek paradigms, the anti-hero's journey, rape narrative and meaning, and television fandom. Collectively, these essays reveal how a teen television show—equal parts noir, romance, social realism and father-daughter drama—became a worthy subject for scholarly study.",
