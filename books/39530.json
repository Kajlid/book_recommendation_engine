Now she’s on the fast track as an engineer, an executive, a driver — in a winning car! She even has a man she can love.When ambitious tycoon Fred Minster steals the winning Cartwright-Armitage design, Mallory spearheads the investigation which uncovers a traitor inside Armitage.Threatened by her investigation, Minster orders Mallory abducted by a Detroit criminal to keep her out of the race. Mallory knows that if she doesn’t race at Le Mans, her career is over.With heart-stopping, realistic race sequences both in the American Le Mans Series (ALMS) and at Le Mans, set against an insider’s portrait of the high-tech jet set milieu of amoral predators whose only justification is winning, Le Mans is the key thriller for the new millenium. Here violence is never as much as skin deep, and ambiguous sexuality is merely another facet of power. Le Mans is the first novel launched in Dakota’s great new seriesRUTHLESS TO WIN",
