  "title": "Tyndale's New Testament",
  "description": "A modern-spelling edition of the 1534 Translation. The translation of the New Testament into English from its original Greek was printed in Germany in 1534 and smuggled back into England. It therefore escaped the fate of Tyndale's previous version, which had been seized and publicly burnt by the authorities. The 1534 edition outraged the clerical establishment by giving the laity access to the word of GOD, in print in English for the first time. Tyndale, who was already in exile for political reasons, was hunted down and subsequently burned at the stake for blasphemy. 429 Pages, 6\" X 8\" X 1\".",
