  "title": "Gone: A Photographic Plea For Preservation",
  "description": "77 color illustrations, 11.75\" x 9.75\"  Photographer and architect Nell Dickerson began her exploration of antebellum homesteads with encouragement from her cousin-in-law, renowned Civil War historian and novelist Shelby Foote. Her passion for forgotten and neglected buildings became a plea for preservation.  Gone is a unique pairing of modern photographs and historical novella. Foote offers a heartbreaking look at one man's loss as Union troops burn his home in the last days of the Civil War. Dickerson shares fascinating and haunting photographs, shining a poignant light on the buildings which survived Sherman's burning rampage across the Confederacy, only to fall victim to neglect, apathy and poverty.  GONE is a powerfully moving volume that will change how you see the forgotten buildings that hide in obscurity across the Southern landscape.",
