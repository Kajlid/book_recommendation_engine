  "description": "An average day in the life of a psychologist is a frenetic one. A lighthearted, 9 a.m. appointment to help a woman manage a husband who won't take out the garbage (even when pants are optional) quickly shifts to an emotionally intense session with a convicted rapist to cope with criminal urges at 10 a.m. After talking with a child about his fears of school an hour later, the psychologist then meets with a therapist to deal with his own fears, followed by lunch with his socially-phobic colleague who's already had four martinis by 1 p.m. All this, and it's only Monday. What most don't realize is that while the professionals are trying to help people resolve their problems, the therapists themselves are often depressed, anxious, and prone to panic attacks. They take antipsychotics, self-medicate with booze, and struggle in their own relationships. The ones who are providing the perspective are often the ones with the most on their plate. In short, they are just as \"crazy\" as the patients. Crazy is the story of how one mental health professional deals with his own personal problems and those of the people he treats. Part expos√© and part memoir, it reveals what therapists really think about their profession, their colleagues, their patients, and their own lives.",
