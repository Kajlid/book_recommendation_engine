  "description": "A bubbly bookshop owner with her head in the clouds. A moody century-old vampire with an aversion to clothes. What could go wrong?When I take over my dad’s bookshop, it’s the dream job I’ve been longing for. Quiet mornings sipping coffee. Lazy afternoons riffling through books. What’s not to love?That is, ’til he shows up. From one of the books in the occult section, Gabriel Favreau appears in a haze of smoke, naked as the day he was born—or would it be made? Either way, he doesn’t have a stitch of modesty, but he does have a bloodthirsty taste for revenge.Between running my bookshop and babysitting a bloodsucking vampire, I’m in over my head, especially when said bloodsucking vampire seems to think my neck’s on the dinner menu.But that’s not even the worst part. Strange things begin happening around town: midnight death parties at graveyards; freaky black cats popping up everywhere; my ex-boyfriend, Daryl, choosing now to rehash our breakup’s greatest hits. And then there’s Gabriel’s archnemesis, the evil Vampire King, who apparently wants to turn the town into his personal blood bank. It’s up to me and Gabriel to put our differences aside (and for Gabriel to put on a pair of pants) so we can set everything right again . . . or I just might become vampire food for real.",
