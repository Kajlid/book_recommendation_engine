  "description": "Jade Stanton sees dead people.She's a twenty-one year old witch, specializing in necromancy, or the art of communicating with the dead. She works for the Necromancing and Communicating Agency, finding money that unfaithful spouses have squirreled away, bringing back dead relatives so the living can get the last word, and other for-profit summonings.Being a necromancer is far from glamorous (try getting ectoplasm out of your favorite pair of jeans) but it has its perks, like making her blood lethal to her delicious vampire boyfriend and gaining access to a supernatural world that is both beautiful and terrifying.When a summoning goes awry, Jade sets off a chain of events that leaves two people dead...and her accused of the capital crime of using the supernatural to kill.With the help of a friend who just happens to be a fairy, a vampire boyfriend, and a neurotic witchy mother, Jade will fight to prove her innocence--and save her neck.",
