To honor his memory, she plans to embark on an epic road trip with her friends to the places he talked about, including Zion National Park, Valley of Fire, and more. But during the funeral, a girl bursts in claiming to be his real girlfriend, and on top of that- she is pregnant with his child. Natalie doesn’t know what else to do except hightail it out of town, but her car breaks down and her only ticket to escape is with Rhys, Luke's abrasive little brother who drinks whiskey out of a coffee mug.Rhys, a seasoned outdoorsman, has issues of his own — his father blames him for the death of his favored son and admits he’s not even sure if he’s Rhys’s real dad. Through their devastation, an undeniable chemistry grows as they find solace in one another, and even though Natalie knows she must confront the other woman, now she must also decide if Rhys is just a temporary fix, or if they have something real together.",
