  "description": "The gentle title and cover of this book belie its fierce heart and ten years of struggling to find a voice after generations of fear and silence. Speaking through the voices of her ancestors and the Chinese who labored to build this country, wresting through issues of womanhood, aging, ailing parents, difficult relationships, seeking and questioning God, discovering the blessings of adversity, celebrating the joys of grandchildren and creative gifts, Carolyn explores identity, life, and voice, not just for the Chinese, but for all who pioneer new lands, sacrificing to make a better place for those who are yet to come.",
