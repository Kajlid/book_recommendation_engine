Salmon Beach becomes Nick and Maddy's haven and meeting place; the two hundred stairs down, their first steps to transformation. A Sea Change - a contemporary love story with crisp, provocative prose, and complex, unforgettable characters - moves through four seasons of healing in a vivid metaphorical journey with Nick and Maddy. On Salmon Beach secrets become hopes, and those hopes become a passionate, life-altering sea change.",
