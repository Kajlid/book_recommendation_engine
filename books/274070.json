In a strange city, searching for answers to her past, Kalina must conquer her own fear, deal with dangers she never anticipated from a crown she never knew existed, and forge friendships with unlikely people to help her find her place in the world.  \n\nBorn of Air is the first book in the Valdir Chronicles.  If you loved Eragon you will love this coming of age adventure.",
