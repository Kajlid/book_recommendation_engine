  "description": "A self-professed lab geek, Claire doesn’t date much. In fact, she has more contact with the rats at the lab than with human males, not counting her toadlike boss, Gordon. When her coworkers drag her out to a club, Claire ends up fending off her drunk and handsy boss—until she’s rescued by Ed, the most beautiful bouncer she’s ever seen.Her tentative, exhilarating relationship with Ed is interrupted when she learns her boss intends to falsify research data to win a grant. When Claire threatens to reveal the truth, she endangers her life, as well as Ed’s. Framed and forced to run, it’s not long before Claire discovers Ed is hiding a shocking secret of his own.Through arson, police chases and attempted murder, the two grow closer, the intensity of their lovemaking rivaling that of their harrowing journey. Claire would be worried about the ever-present danger and a grim future as a fugitive…if she weren’t so engrossed in her erotic experiments with Ed.",
