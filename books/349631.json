Six months earlier a hail of bullets left Gabriel blind, helpless - and suicidal.

But now Antonio is missing, and no one can -- or will -- tell Gabriel what's happened to him. Never one to wait patiently on the sidelines, Gabriel sets out on a dangerous path to find his missing friend and lover. But there are old enemies waiting in the darkness for Gabriel, and before long the hunter becomes the hunted.",
