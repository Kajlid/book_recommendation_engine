  "description": "The Kingdom of Akeldama has long been blessed—or cursed, if you prefer—by the gods. The indomitable and awe-inspiring kingdom lives and breathes through the blood of the ones bound to its essence. Never before has an outsider successfully taken the Akeldama throne from the rightful heirs...until now.  Everyone, even her two husbands, assumed that Princess Sienna had perished alongside her parents the night of the siege. They were all wrong...  Bound by chains, locked in a dungeon and unable to escape, Sienna has been forced to endure years as a captive in the very castle that she grew up in. For years, the only breaks from the torture of her own thoughts were when the false king that had murdered her beloved parents visited her for one of two reasons: either to drain the essence of Akeldama from her very veins or in a vexing attempt to persuade her to be his queen.  However, now another captive has been thrown into her cell with her and she is no longer alone in the dark. Her new cellmate might be just what she needed to restore that defiance that had been missing for so long.  AUTHOR NOTE: This story is a historical fantasy (heavy on the fantasy), reverse harem, SERIAL. There are twelve parts to it and I will release another part each month (barring catastrophe). Also, there may be triggers so if that sort of thing gets under your skin...maybe this isn’t the book for you?",
