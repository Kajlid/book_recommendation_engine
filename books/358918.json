  "description": "Thrust into a strange land, Lisane possessed extraordinary magic. But could she carve out a place for herself in the beautiful barbaric realm that was her new home--a place where dark secrets held the promise of life--and death . . . ?In her homeland, mages conversed with the magical forces of ller, reverently seeking permission for the spells they cast. Then came a terrible scourge, draining the world of ller, killing the mages, and enslaving the survivors. But this clever young girl fled the onslaught.Raised to be Queen of her people, to wield the magic born from ller, Lisane found precarious refuge in a distant land where only men wielded power. Still able to call up the mystic currents of ller, she was saved from summary execution by the maddeningly handsome Kaihan, King and Wizard. Thus Lisane was placed with the other young adepts--the only female among them--and the only true mage that could save them.If they didn't kill her first . . .",
