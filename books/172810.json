  "description": "When Hilary Knight discovered mice in his studio, he set about designing them a special outdoor home. The mice had unique talents of their own. Maude, an expert needle-mouse, complemented Max's way with a hammer. Both shared a keen eye for found objects. Mr. Knight's watercolor journal of this charming couple's enterprise, accompanied by Maude's daily notations, has become a joyous celebration of the Twelve Days of Christmas.",
