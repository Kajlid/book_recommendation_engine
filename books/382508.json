  "description": "From the writer/director of the acclaimed film Pi, the screen-adaptation of Hubert Selby Jr.'s classic cult novel. Requiem for a Dream is a modern-day fable set on the rusted mean streets of Brooklyn's Coney Island that follows the stories of four people desperately in pursuit of a better life. Oscar-winning actress Ellen Burstyn stars as Sara, a widowed mother obsessed with her waistline and addicted to diet pills and the thought of appearing on television. Her son Harry (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), and his best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans in a surprising dramatic debut), are junkies in search of the American dream - only in their world fortunes are won through a successful score and sell operation and the three long to lay their hands on the pound of heroin that, once unloaded, will finance a legitimate business of their own. Soon enough, though, their earnest pursuits begin to take on horrifying dimensions; and, even as their world crumbles around them, Sara, Harry, Marion and Tyrone refuse to let go, plummeting with their dreams in a nightmarish freefall not soon to be forgotten.",
