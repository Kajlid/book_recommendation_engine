  "description": "Some people say revenge is a dish best served cold. I say it’s better hot.  My name is Elle Payne, and I never thought I’d be back at River High, but I am—and there are three boys calling my name. Christian Moore, Alec Perry, and Xander Hill. The Dick Squad. The three boys who made my life a living hell growing up.  They won’t see me coming. They might’ve forgotten about me, but I didn’t forget about them. My memories burn, and I want nothing more than to destroy them the same way they destroyed me.  Six years ago I did something I’m not proud of. Surrounded by bullying and my parents’ failing marriage, I tried to end it all, but I failed.  I am stronger now than I ever was before, and even if it’s the last thing I do, the Dick Squad will pay for what they did to me. This revenge will be the sweetest of all, because it’s one they’ll never see coming.  Breaking their hearts should be easy. Protecting mine might not be.  This is a bully reverse harem novel, containing some dark themes, including self-harm and suicide.",
