  "description": "Maybe you’ve heard a tale about twelve princesses who danced their shoes to pieces. That was only part of our story.Talya would tell you how dark and frightening the cursed forest and enchanted lake were. Vira would be too busy looking after us all to tell you many details, while Mina would try to give you every fact and figure (even though magic is rarely so logical). Each of my sisters would tell the story differently.And Dastan—he’d write a ballad. Or maybe a love song.As for me, I’m the storyteller, so I’m giving you my version. It’s about my sisters and me, our father, twelve princes and a cursed country—about a series of misguided champions, one even more misguided Fairy Godmother, and a great deal of dancing. It’s about twelve trapped princesses who decided to take control of their story.I’m Lyra, the ninth princess, and this is how I tell the tale.**Read the companion novel, The Wanderers, available in ebook and paperback**",
