  "description": "Not your everyday coming-of-age novel. This story was supposed to be about Evie -- how she hasn't made a friend in years, how she tends to stretch the truth (especially about her so-called relationship with college drop-out Jonah Luks), and how she finally comes into her own once she learns to just be herself -- but it isn't. Because when her classmate Elizabeth \"Zabet\" McCabe's murdered body is found in the woods, everything changes, and Evie's life is never the same again.",
