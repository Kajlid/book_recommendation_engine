  "title": "The Train Baby's Mother",
  "description": "A time of great evil. Unfathomable betrayal. A desperate act. Hadassah Jensen, a Holocaust survivor of Ravensbr√ºck, has spent twenty years trying to forget her haunting memories. Worst of all is the dark day the train hurtled through the snow-covered countryside of Nazi Germany, throwing her life into a tumult from which she has not recovered. But when a piece of the puzzle from her past returns, she's confronted with her deepest shame. Professor Fritz Miller will always remember the fierce protectiveness he felt the day he, as a twelve-year-old German farm boy, found the Jewish baby lying in the snow, next to the train tracks...and then had to give her up. When a shocking revelation emerges, he wonders, Is it possible to change destiny? And, if so, will there even be time to do so? One past. One destiny. And the story of a lifetime. Don't miss Sharon Bernash Smith's other stellar The MacLeod Family Saga (Book One, Like a Bird Wanders, and Book Two, Old Sins, Old Shadows) and two Christmas classic short stories, coauthored by Sharon Bernash Smith, Rosanne Croft, and Linda Once Upon a Christmas and Always Home for Christmas.",
