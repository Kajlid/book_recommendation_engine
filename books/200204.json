  "description": "The drilling of the peepholes we debated from day one. It turns out that this isn't even a crime in most states. However, this isn't to say that spying on these females is not without its consequences.Three lifelong friends move to a major college campus in an even larger metropolis. Acclimation proves just about impossible. Can they figure out this hostile scene before the city eats them alive?In this riotous though insightful coming of age memoir, author Jason McGathey recounts his experience relocating to ground zero at Ohio State University, in the heart of Columbus, Ohio. With unflinching honesty, he relates the off-kilter adventures he and his roommates endure, in their attempts to establish themselves in such unfamiliar terrain, and the growing suspicions that they must have the word OUTSIDER stamped upon their foreheads. Yet as their warped minds push against the city beyond, the barrier gives in ways neither they nor the fantastic cast of characters they encounter could foretell in a thousand years. A thousand years, or a thousand madcap experiments, but when three bachelors meet one hundred virgins the results combust in a witty, introspective look at the modern twentysomething experience.",
