  "description": "The story starts here and now, but really began an eternity ago in a forgotten place and time when a young man and a young woman made a promise to each other. Now, an Old One desperately wants the two young people to remember their promise. He is master of the Travelers, a unique group of animals with whom he communicates mind to mind. While he has groomed the Travelers for a special destiny, he knows he will not see the task to its end. That responsibility must fall to the Shepherds--the promised couple who are to take on this mission and make the extraordinary sacrifice it requires. Would that time were a friend, and these two could discover their promise in the leisure of the normal pace of life, but that is not to be. Both the Shepherds and the Travelers are fair game to a demon, commissioned by the Master of Hell, to destroy the Old One and everything he loves. Beyond this, a disaster of epic proportions looms and threatens to reel the entire world into chaos.The Storm is coming.",
