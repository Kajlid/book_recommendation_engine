  "description": "There’s a world right below Micah Davis’s feet.  She’s never seen it, never felt it, but knows it’s there. She lives in a time far in the future when overpopulation and devastating skin cancer rates have split everything in two. Those who can withstand the sun are allowed to continue their lives above ground, while those with lighter complexions are forced to move into a ghetto created below. The two groups are never allowed to interact.  This is the story of when Micah starts asking why.  A novel that takes the concepts we are constantly surrounded by and flips them on their heads, Nightcrawlers is the story of a girl’s quest to understand that which she cannot see.",
