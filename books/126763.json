  "description": "Cybernetic implants, interfaces, and prosthetics. Genetic modification. Nanotech. These are the tools of transhumanism, a movement which seeks to greatly enhance human potential through technology. And human innovation always finds a way to use new technology to enhance sex. The stories in Jacked In take place in the science-fictional future, the gritty reality depicted in cyberpunk, and even in a very near future that looks a lot like present-day, celebrating technology and sexuality by exploring human modifications that are repurposed — or purpose-built — for pleasure.  Transhumanism is a movement focused on the radical extension of human life and capabilities—mental, physical, and psychological. But what good is living longer, stronger, and harder if we’re not playing longer, stronger, and harder, too? With heightened senses comes a hunger for sensory stimulation. In Jacked In, readers can get a taste of what the future of sex might hold.",
