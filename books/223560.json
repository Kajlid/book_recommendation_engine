  "title": "Love Me Do! The Beatles' Progress",
  "description": "The #1 best book about the Beatles, according to Rolling Stone magazine, which went on to say \"This is as close to a Beatles ride-along as you'll get.\" John Lennon said, \"A true book. He wrote how we were, which was bastards.\" The year is 1963 and \"Love Me Do\" is the Beatles' first number one hit, closely followed by \"Please Please Me\". John, Paul, George and Ringo celebrate their new found success with a hectic six-week tour, briefly interrupted by an historic live appearance at the \"Royal Variety Performance\" at the London Palladium. This is the beginning of \"Beatlemania\" and American writer, Mike Braun, is there to chronicle events and watch as the drama unfolds. A year later, The Beatles are the world's biggest pop group. This book details what really happened in those first magic weeks.",
