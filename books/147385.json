He has just one hellish week to shoot \"Crimson Orgy,\" seventy-six minutes of mayhem destined to become the world's most notorious cult movie... and just maybe the first true \"snuff film\" ever made. Struggling to cope with a reluctant starlet, a booze-ravaged leading man, a backwoods cop bent on revenge, a mutinous crew, a devastating hurricane, and his own inner demons, Meyer relentlessly pursues a vision of unrivaled box office horror. He gets what he's after, but at a price no one could imagine!",
