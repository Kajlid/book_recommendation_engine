  "description": "Welcome to Sultry Springs, Texas: where first loves find second chances… Nine years after June Augustine hightailed it out of Sultry Springs with her heart in pieces, one thing stands between her and her dream of opening an upscale martini bar: a bogus warrant from her tiny Texas hometown. Now she’s stuck in the sticks for a month of community service under the supervision of the devilishly sexy Luke Gallagher, her first love and ex-best friend. If Texas in July wasn’t already hot enough, working side-by-side with June would make any man melt. Luke wants nothing more than to strip her down and throw her in the lake—the same lake where they were found buck naked and guilty as sin all those years ago. In their heads, they’re older and wiser. But their hearts tell a different story…Praise for SULTRY WITH A TWIST:\"Witty and fun, warm and endearing, Macy Beckett will stir your heartstrings!\" Carly Phillips, New York Times Bestselling Author\"Hilarious, heartwarming, sexy and real--you'll fall in love, guaranteed!\" Lori Foster, New York Times Bestselling Author",
