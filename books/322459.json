  "description": "Darius:\"This is why I never contacted you. I still have no control around you. You want me to tell you I haven’t thought of you? That would be a damned lie. Wherever I’ve been, whatever I’ve done, I haven’t stopped thinking of you. You are always there.”Nell:Once, I was convinced that my feelings for Darius, my love for him, were pure and real. I fought against all his perceptions of wrongness. But that was four years ago. If I still can’t find pleasure in even the thought of kissing another man, maybe my feelings for Darius have gotten twisted and warped. Maybe they’re obsessive. Maybe they’re wrong. New York Times bestselling author Nina Lane returns with the Birdsong Trilogy, a provocative romance between two people whose forbidden love will set their lives—and the world—on fire.",
