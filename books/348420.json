  "description": "Hard times aren’t just coming, they are here already. The recent economic collapse has seen millions of North Americans move from the middle class to being poor, and from poor to hungry. At the same time, the idea of eating locally is shifting from being a fringe activity for those who can afford it to an essential element of getting by. But aside from the locavores and slow foodies, who really knows how to eat outside of the supermarket and out of season? And who knows how to eat a diet based on easily stored and home preserved foods? Independence Days tackles both the nuts and bolts of food preservation, as well as the host of broader issues tied to the creation of local diets. It In addition, it focuses on how to live on a pantry diet year-round, how to preserve food on a community scale, and how to reduce reliance on industrial agriculture by creating vibrant local economies. Better food, plentiful food, at a lower cost and with less energy Independence Days is for all who want to build a sustainable food system and keep eating—even in hard times. Sharon Astyk is a former academic who farms in upstate New York with her family. She is the author of Depletion and Abundance , the co-author of A Nation of Farmers , and she blogs at www.sharonastyk.com.",
