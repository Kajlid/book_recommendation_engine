Joseph watches.Liz's money-hungry son and daughter-in-law circle like vultures, counting every penny of the inheritance that will not make it to their pockets.Lindy, living with her menagerie, and working two part-time jobs, much prefers the company of animals over people. And, yet, unexpected associations seem to pop up all around her.All the while, a predator lurks, using and discarding whomever and whatever crosses his path.",
