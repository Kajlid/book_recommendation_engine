Are you kidding me? So much fun.Until I fill in for an extra with a drowning scene–and the lead actor gives me the kiss of life.Over and over and over again.Take fifty? Are they serious? My heart will never recover. And neither will my pride, because the star gets more stone-faced and silent with every take. I know I’m curvier than the usual actresses, but come on.Finally, I tell him: there’s no need to be a jerk. And you know what he says?That’s definitely not hate he’s feeling.\nKiss of Life is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a famous heartthrob and the curvy girl who’s now living rent-free in his brain.",
