  "description": "Kay has been drawn into a vortex of intrigue in the ancient world, of magic-wielding Wanderers, mesmerizing sylphs, powerful Nordic shamans, crafty mages. And now she cannot deny that her children are involved. Her son is channeling stories of abductions by threatening pirates. Her daughterâ€™s mysterious lover sounds uncannily like a tenth-century Welsh musician. She tries to pull away from the medieval world but finds herself increasingly enamored with her spirit-travel. Is she the only one who can rescue her friends, who can tread in ancient caverns undetected to mind-meld with marauding ancient Jutlanders? If she takes the next journey to the past, will she ever see her children again?",
