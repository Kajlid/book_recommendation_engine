  "description": "If the road to Hell was paved with good intentions, then maybe the righteous path was forged in sin. Regardless of its composition, Max Lenett always felt a strong desire to walk its road reverently and with devotion. Armed with musical ability, poetic talent, and a powerful voice, Max followed it across the country to smoky bars and underground clubs where he masked his morals in cryptic lyrics and harsh, heavy vocals. When he's presented with the worry that an artist's striking features are more important to the masses than the profound message of the art itself, a debate between the physical and spiritual opens up inside Max's mind. In time with this duality, he meets two new friends-- one with strangely golden eyes and heated skin and the other with the ability to understand even his most enigmatic lyrics. Max begins to question not only his position on the stage, but also his place in the universe as he struggles to reconcile his strict moral code with the appeal of sin. However, much more than Max's soul hangs in the balance, as things are rarely what they seem, and people, especially his new friends, are almost never who they appear to be.",
