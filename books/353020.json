  "title": "Shadow Play: The Murder of Robert F. Kennedy, the Trial of Sirhan Sirhan & the Failure of American Justice",
  "description": "On 6/4/68, just after he'd declared victory in the California presidential primary over Eugene McCarthy, Robert F. Kennedy was gunned down in the kitchen of the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. Captured a few feet away, gun in hand, was a young Palestinian-American named Sirhan Sirhan. The case against Sirhan was declared by the police to be \"open & shut.\" The court proceedings against him nine months later were billed as \"the trial of the century\"--American justice at its fairest, swiftest & most sure. But was it? Investigative journalist William Klaber & political science professor Philip H. Melanson have spent six years examining the crime. After poring over previously secret LAPD & FBI files, interviewing scores of witnesses & investigators, & talking with Sirhan in prison, the authors conclude: Sirhan may not have acted alone, his gun may not have killed Robert Kennedy, & the police investigation & courtroom defense were deeply flawed.",
