By the end of the day a man lies dead in the King's Forest, and Robin is an outlaw with a price on his head.From then on, Robin is on the run, hiding deep in Sherwood Forest--but he is not alone. First joined by his friends Much and Marian, then by more and more people who despise the Norman lords who tax them blind, Robin builds a community of outlaws in the forest who risk the gallows and the sword for the sake of justice. And as he does, he gains a new name: Robin Hood.",
