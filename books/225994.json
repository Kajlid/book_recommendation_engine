  "description": "The stunning conclusion to the New York Times Bestseller. \nThese are the unbreakable rules in the game.Stay collected. Compartmentalize. Think your next move through. Never let your heart dictate your tactics. The heart is impulsive. The heart makes bad decisions. The heart doesn’t see the long game. Because the heart may have decided to get Adam back, but when the endgame comes, the heart’s going to be the first thing to break.",
