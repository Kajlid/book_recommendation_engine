  "description": "I’ve never been so humiliated in my life.  My twin brother is the definition of a lost soul. And it bothers me, sure… but I didn’t even know he was out of jail until a steamy older bounty hunter showed up at my workplace, looking for him. And tackled me to the ground in his place. Now I’m out of a job and gunning for my brother, and there’s only one person I know who can help me find him - the bounty hunter who got me in this situation to start with. They say that the enemy of your enemy is your friend, but I’m not sure that teaming up with Neo feels all that friendly. He’s my opposite in every way - I’m younger, he’s older; I’m loud, and he’s the strong, silent type. I’m omega… and he’s all alpha. The more I get to know Neo, the less I want to be his enemy. But we’re only together for one purpose: to catch my brother. Right?",
