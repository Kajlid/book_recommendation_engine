  "description": "Jackie’s turn! Book four in this exciting new series! April has finally arrived. How lucky of Jackie to have such a lovely month to tell her story. It starts off with fun and laughter on April Fool’s Day, and then all the beautiful flowers start to bloom and then . . . Wait a minute. April fifteenth. That’s not a fun day. That’s the day every adult dreads—Tax Day! The Eights have never had to worry about taxes. Their parents always took care of everything. But as we all know, their parents are gone (or dead). Who will take care of the taxes now? Luckily, the girls have Pete the Mechanic on their side. He’ll help them. But what’s really interesting is what the girls will discover while taking care of their parents’ taxes—somewhere there are other Eights. Other Eights??",
