  "description": "WINNER! 2021 AUTHORS ON THE AIR ROMANCE NOVEL OF THE YEAR  Shy, introverted Lucy Dennings lives a quiet little life in New York City, working for a nonprofit and keeping to herself. Every afternoon, she goes home to her empty apartment and Edgar, her houseplant, and every night, she loses herself in the pages of her beloved romance novels. Her lonely heart seeks solace in tales of passionate, enduring, all-consuming love, but more and more, Lucy feels she's not just reading for pleasure but searching for a lost piece of herself in the pages. As if she once touched something beautiful but it's been ripped away. Until one day Lucy discovers a dead body in the alley behind her apartment. Even if it's too late, her first instinct is to help. Her second is to run. Because the dead body isn't so very dead, and suddenly, her little world isn't so little but one in which dreams feel like memories, \"inner demons\" actually lurk in dark alleys, and a beautiful creature of darkness with amber eyes and wings like night might hold the key to what her heart has been aching for...if she doesn't fall down the path of eternal damnation first. \nFrom USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestselling author, Emma Scott, comes an emotional paranormal love story of passion, sacrifice, and the soul-deep love of a lifetime...more than one.",
