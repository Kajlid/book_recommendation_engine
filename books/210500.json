  "description": "Professor Rhod Evans encounters deadly conflict when he finds that the supposed suicide of his best friend was actually murder. Pres Davies, his murdered friend, had refused to reveal to Lucius Valentine, a billionaire art pirate, where he had hidden King Arthur's treasures, which he had found in America. Evans is forced to do battle with the same forces that overthrew Arthur in the sixth century. He finds allies in a priest, who is an expert with automatic weapons, a beautiful and enigmatic British lady, and his Great Pyrenees dog, Koloth. A man of peace must become a warrior, and more than that - he must find Arthur's treasures before his enemy uses them to become the most dangerous man in the world.",
