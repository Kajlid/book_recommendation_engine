  "title": "Miss Brooks Loves Books!",
  "description": "With the help of Miss Brooks, Missy's classmates all find books they love in the library--books about fairies and dogs and trains and cowboys. But Missy dismisses them all--\"Too flowery, too furry, too clickety, too yippity.\"Still, Miss Brooks remains undaunted. Book Week is here and Missy will find a book to love if they have to empty the entire library. What story will finally win over this beastly, er, discriminating child? William Steig's Shrek!--the tale of a repulsive green ogre in search of a revolting bride--of course!Barbara Bottner and Michael Emberley pay playful homage to the diverse tastes of child readers and the valiant librarians who are determined to put just the right book in each child's hands.",
