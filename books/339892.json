  "description": "A fun-loving free spirit.Her buttoned-up best friend.And a cross-country wedding that could drive their platonic relationship toward something else entirely.Simon Collier is my friend.Heck, he’s been my friend for most of my adult life—and we couldn’t be more different.I love late-night karaoke. He’s a homebody with a piano I’ve never heard him play.I relish being the center of attention while Simon prefers to fade into the background.My dresser is a disaster. He alphabetizes his fridge.I suppose we’re a little like sunshine and rain. It’s why our friendship works.Even though we’re total opposites, we get along like peas and carrots. He’s constantly saving me after failed romances, and I push him to live a little. . .even if that means dragging him out of his comfort zone.If I can make him laugh, it’s a win.He’s my safe person. Secure, reliable, fun to poke fun at.Simon Collier is my friend.But now, all that might change.After another predictable break-up, I find myself in need of a plus-one for my best friend Lauren’s cross-country wedding. A wedding that reenacts the road trip where she and her fiancé, Will, first fell in love. And despite his fussiness, Simon is the safest person to bring along because I’m not in the market for any more messy feelings.Our friendship has been intact for over ten years, surely we can handle a week crammed in a car, sharing meals and playlists and nighttime secrets and single beds.Right?",
