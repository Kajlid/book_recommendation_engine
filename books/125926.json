  "description": "Silo 49 has endured. In Going Dark they freed themselves from the control of Silo 1. In Deep Dark they discovered their forgotten past. In the final installment of the Silo 49 Trilogy, all they have worked for, over generations of time, comes to fruition. Lillian and Leo, cousins and best friends, enter the lists for the 89th Race in Silo 49. The singular honor of running outside, with no walls and no boundaries, is the prize they seek. But the run is much more than a simple, but risky, trip outside to map their surroundings. The silo is falling apart, age and wear showing in every crack and seam. If the Others will not die out and let the world be reborn, then they must seek a way around the Others and find the blue skies for themselves.",
