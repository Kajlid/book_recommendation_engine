  "description": "Leda's quest to gain the magic she needs to save her brother leads her to the castle of the Dragons, home of four soldiers in the Legion of Angels with extraordinary powers over the elements. If she makes it through their training, she might just survive her next sip of the gods' Nectar and level up her magic. But the gods' gifts of magic come at a price. Leda can already feel the Nectar changing her, making her less human--and so is her budding romance with the angel Nero. Sip by sip, kiss by kiss, the change is taking hold of her. As if that's not enough, Leda finds herself once again caught between the armies of heaven and hell--and tempted by a darkness that threatens to consume the Earth.",
