  "title": "Dominant Trait: A Story of Social and Genetic Inequality",
  "description": "★ No longer can we think or discuss politics without strong emotion of anxiety, frustration, and even hate .  TV, newspapers, and books often tell you what you should think. The difference in opinion on ethics and inequality are very real, yet we have become numb to the idea of having an open debate.  How do we fix this?   By changing how we think.  We expand our mental borders and look at situations from a unique vantage point.  We consider a place only slightly different from our own.  Not utopian and not dystopian, just different.  Why does this work?   Many of our preconceived notions will no longer apply in this place and you will also leave behind the anxiety, frustration and hate opening your mind to new considerations. For 25 years I worked in marketing and data analysis and the importance of unemotional, hard data has always been at the core of my work. But my actual strength has always been in understanding what the data is also not showing me.  By allowing my thoughts to expand beyond the normal boundaries, the data can now be viewed very differently.  I have used this same approach in my novel, Dominant Trait. By creating it as a work of fiction, I am providing a fun and safe place for the reader to let down their guard and consider many of the most important topics of today with an open mind.",
