  "description": "You Can Become a Pilot! Learning to Fly is Easier than You Think! Have you always dreamed of becoming a pilot?Are you wondering if now is a good time to become a pilot?Do you want to get started with flight training, but need help choosing a school?All your questions will be answered in this book! This book may be the most important book you will ever read if you want to become a professional pilot…But first a warning, this is not a book about “learning to fly” in a literal sense. You won't learn how aerodynamics work or how to control an aircraft in flight – that's something you will learn once you start your flight training. Instead, this book contains information that flight schools won’t teach you. The information you NEED to know before you should commit to flight training!The knowledge you gain from this book is essential for you to have a successful and enjoyable career as a commercial or airline pilot! The main focus of the book is on FAA and EASA flight training in the U.S., but most of the principles apply regardless of your nationality.Whether you want to earn your private pilot certificate, become a corporate pilot, or become a captain in a major airline – this book is for you. And one note to the ladies – it is now the golden age for female pilots!Did you know you could become a commercial pilot, or even a flight instructor, at the age of 18 with less than 12 months of training? Right now is an excellent time to become a pilot because there is a global pilot shortage that is expected to last for the next two decades or longer. Boeing estimates that there will be a worldwide demand for 790,000 pilots between 2018 and 2037. That’s a lot of pilots! How do I know the pilot shortage is not just a myth?Currently, most airlines in China are hiring airline captains from foreign countries because there are not enough Chinese pilots. And what’s the pay like? Boeing 737 or Airbus 320 captains can earn an annual salary up to $380,000! That’s over 30k per month! …and, wait for it—it’s all tax-free (in China)! Yes, it will be a long road to become an airline captain earning a good salary. But guess what? Reading this book will help you decide if you want to pursue the career.Who is this Author?With Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Vesa knows a thing or two about aviation. With several years as a flight instructor, assistant chief flight instructor, and ultimately as the Chief Flight Instructor of a major flight academy, he is an expert in pilot training. Having trained hundreds of pilots who currently work for many airlines (including many Chinese airlines), he has the first-hand knowledge of the demand for new pilots. Because of his experience as a corporate airline captain, he understands the benefits and downsides of pilot life and can help you decide whether it’s a good career path for you!Flight training is fast-paced, fun, and exciting. Why not get started now?Here are some of the questions this book will answer:How much does flight training cost?How can I finance flight training without any savings or income?What are the benefits and downsides of a pilot career?What kind of certificates and ratings do I need to start working as a professional pilot?How to choose the best flight school (and flight instructor) based on my individual needs?",
