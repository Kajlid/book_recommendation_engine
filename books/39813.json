Tina refused to listen to her gran or her granâ€™s three annoying friends any more. Hey, what do they know about teenagers? They grew up way back, in the Second World War. Tina's life in Germany had been so happy, it never occurred to her that one day her parents might split up and send her back to Greece to live with her grandmother! But Tina has found a way to cope with life in her new high school where she doesn't fit in at all. She doesn't mind anything any more. She's found away to chill with a really amazing little blue pill. Sometimes it's as if she's in heaven, sometimes she's crashing back down to earth, and now there's no return. Or is there?
