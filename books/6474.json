I will be introducing you to the town of Serendipity, its landmark Harrington Mansion, and a vibrant cast of characters from both sides of the tracks. Like any other town, Serendipity has its secrets, scandals, pain, heartache and love, but there is also an implied promise of fortune and good luck, along with people at changes and crossroads in their lives.First up, Ethan Barron, the bad boy who has come home to make good and Faith Harrington, the girl who got away.  Next is Nash  Barron in Destiny (1/12) and Dare Barron in Karma (5/12).I hope you'll take this new journey with me!Happy Reading,Carly Phillips",
