  "description": "All the power of Cupid at her fingertips.   Locke might be laying low, moonlighting as a love physic, whilst hiding from the pantheon of avatars and men in dark suits. But she can't hide from them, or deny her godly powers, forever. Not when the avatars are being hunted by a mysterious group seeking to steal the power of the gods. Together the pantheon are stronger. Divided they are weak. Locke must join her three divine gods if they stand any chance of defeating their enemies. But opening her heart to love, and tapping into the power of Cupid welling inside her-the good, bad and downright ugly-terrifies her.  Quicksilver Love is the second novel in the Operation Cupid series, a slow burn reverse harem romance with sexy, godly avatars and steamy scenes.",
