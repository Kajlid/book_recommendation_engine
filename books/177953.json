  "description": "The disappearance of a British intelligence agent at the height of World War II sparks a desperate manhunt through the treacherous shadows of a battle-scarred Middle East Oliver Enwin was a valuable member of the British intelligence community in the Middle East in those dark days at the onset of the Second World War. Talented enough and devious enough to make his mark, he rose to the rank of assistant defense security officer at Nazareth by 1941, entrusted with the choosing, running, and support of local assets. Then he vanished without a trace, leaving fear and turmoil in his wake and scores of unanswered questions. In a tightly closed desert world on the brink of chaos—an essential playing piece in the complex wartime strategies of Allies, Arabs, and Nazis—determining the motives and whereabouts of a British agent gone rogue and potentially traitorous might be the most impossible assignment of the entire Middle Eastern conflict . . . and quite possibly the most important. In the vein of works by John le Carré and Len Deighton, Doom’s Caravan is a masterful, ever-twisting tale of wartime espionage unfolding on a vivid and blood-stained canvas. Gripping, electrifying, evocative, and surprising at every turn, this is the work of a true twentieth-century master.",
