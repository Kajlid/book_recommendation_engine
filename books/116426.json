  "description": "This is a crime Sukey Reynolds shouldn't be investigating . . . if she wants to stay aliveWhen Arthur Soames is found with a broken neck at the foot of the iron staircase in his back garden there seems little doubt that his death was accidental. But his estranged daughter Sabrina insists he was murdered, and when the police refuse to take her seriously she turns to Sukey Reynolds for help. Reluctant to become involved, Sukey says the police might listen if she found evidence to support her claim.Shortly afterwards, Sabrina announces she is following a line of inquiry but gives no details. And then she disappears. At about the same time, a headless torso is found in a ditch. The police believe the victim to be a woman whose teenage daughter reported her missing after her stepfather left the country, but Sukey fears it may be Sabrina. She sets out to make some enquiries of her own, almost losing her life in the process.",
