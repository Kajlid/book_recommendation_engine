  "description": "Attempting to Define: Mourning is the second in a small collection of poetry books that tackle some of life's toughest issues. Mourning is a painful experience that is hard to feel, let alone define. These snapshots of anger, grief, loss, and the deepest sorrow are meant to create a portrait of mourning. The author hopes, above all, that this book will comfort those who suffer with the knowledge that their pain is shared.",
