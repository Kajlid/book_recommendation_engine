  "title": "If You Could See What I See: The Tenets of Novus Spiritus",
  "description": "This enlightening work by renowned psychic Sylvia Browne contains the Gnostic tenets of her church, the Society of Novus Spiritus, and is a map of our charts regardless of what spiritual path we follow .It has taken many years of research to put together what at first seems simple tenets to follow, but in going deeper, this book carries within it the very heart of humankindâ€™s search for our own spirituality. Sylvia has also included many details from her own personal journey, which she feels is comparable to the quest that each of us follows to find our own God-center. As we travel this road, we can realize that long-forgotten, yet simple and truthful goal of viewing our life on Earth as our path to God.",
