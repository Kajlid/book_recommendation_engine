  "description": "My name is Liam Wyatt, and my brother, Oliver, and I are the founders and owners of Wyatt Enterprises. He had found love and I was still trying. After dating a countless number of women throughout the years, I was ready to have a real relationship with the possibility of settling down. I could have any woman I wanted. So what’s the problem, you ask? I didn’t want just any woman; I wanted The One. Unfortunately, I still hadn’t found her—but then, Avery Lewis walked into my life and turned my world upside down. She was everything I wanted in a woman, all wrapped up in a beautiful and breathtaking package. The problem was, she didn’t want a relationship. She had built a wall around her and I was going to do everything I could to break through that wall and make her a permanent part of my life.My name is Avery Lewis and I moved to New York when I landed a job at Finley, Muir, & Abernathy, one of the most influential law firms in the country. I moved from Danbury, Connecticut when an office romance went bad and I wanted to start my life over, focusing on my career and my career only. Men were off limits. A girl could only take so much heartbreak in a lifetime. Then Liam Wyatt walked into my life and turned my world upside down. He was a man who could have any woman in the world, yet he wanted me. Sexy, smart, and a genuinely a nice guy wasn’t enough for me to let my half glass/half stone wall I built around me down. The problem was that I was falling for him on such a deep level that it scared me. Between my past and my daddy issues, the poor guy didn’t stand a chance. He was determined to make me a part of his life and I was determined to run.",
