  "description": "Harrison Ford (no, not that one) likes his ordinary life. With the notoriety of his name and the responsibility of his family after his father’s death, he plays everything safe. From a boring career as an insurance actuary to a cookie-cutter Chicago suburb home, he’s as vanilla as generic ice cream. A failed marriage is his only deviation from normal.Then Georgia, an opinionated fairy godmother with unreliable powers, installs herself in his house, claiming to grant him one wish – which she decides is a new wife. When his mother takes exception to his guest and his runaway teenage daughter lands on his doorstep, normal turns to chaos.Georgia Rhodes has always fought for her place in her family, including following her sisters to Fairy Godmother University. She has one simple assignment to fulfill before graduating, but instead of watching over a newborn, she’s given someone more complex – a full-grown mortal man. Make his wish come true or don’t graduate, her instructor warns. It’s not easy. Deliberately left without her wand, and as a woman used to fun more than studying, Georgia must use her brains and her discovery of the internet to find Harry a wife. But her magic is on the fritz, especially when she thinks about him with another woman. In the meantime, she fights her attraction, knowing a cross-species relationship rarely works.",
