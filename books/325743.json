  "description": "XAVIERI was swimming laps in my infinity pool. I was supposed to be alone; instead my personal assistant was giving a tour to a candidate for the housekeeper position. All that was required of me was an introduction and a handshake. I never should have touched her. One touch, and the Phayed in me turned possessive and feral. I need another hit of her, another taste. On impulse, I hired her, and now we’re going to be living under the same roof. I don’t regret it, but my fiancée might feel differently.  TRINITYI’m not qualified to work for a wealthy art dealer. Even his beachfront condo is intimidating, but nothing compares to the man himself. He looks at me as if I’ve wronged him in a past life, but he touches me like he owns me. His touch has left a permanent imprint on my skin, connecting us with an electrified thread. I need this job, so I have no choice but to accept his bizarre obsession with my lipstick and try to ignore the lovers he and his fiancée bring home for the night. But I’m discovering he has a side to him no one sees and secrets so deep that no one really knows the man within.",
