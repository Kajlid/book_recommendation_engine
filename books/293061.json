  "description": "For as long as I can remember, I’ve had to hide who I am. What I am. They had me play the sheep. They had me blend in. They marked me and sealed my power. Now I have my freedom, because everyone who’s ever wanted me confined is dead. I could have changed it. I could have altered the course of fate. I could have saved the unseelie queen. I didn’t.   Vlari has always known her place: as far away from court as the unseelie queen can send her. The youngest royal, born in an impoverished household, she endeavoured to earn her keep as an assistant. Her one aspiration? Avoiding the popular crowd of gentry fae who prey on the weak, and their dark, enticing leader, the mysterious Drusk. Until the world implodes around her. She has two options. Fade with rest of the unseelie kingdom, or protect a court that has never cared for her.  Disclaimer: Unlike many of May Sage’s novels, Wicked Court is written in first person. Wicked Court is the first volume in a duet.",
