  "description": "In September of 2007 Chris Zacharius and three other divers recovered a single engine plane from the restricted dive waters of the Silver Banks between the Dominican Republic and the Turks and Caicos Islands. It was loaded wth valuables that had belonged to the dictator Rafael Trujillo. Soon they were to find that a three billion fortune was still out there and most likely somewhere in the Dominican Republic. The search takes them to the mountains of the DR which is infested with bandits and over to Haiti where they find them selves in the middle of a war. The story is an epic adventure that is fun, sexy, explosive, and blends historical facts with legendary fiction.",
