A young woman finds out in this sweeping will-they-or-won't-they love story that begins with a chance wrong number dial. . . .When Hannah picks up a call from an unknown number, she thinks nothing of it--it's just an easygoing American named Davey who misdialed her while calling into a job interview.

Will fate intervene once more to bring the two together, or will Davey always be the man that Hannah never met?",
