  "description": "“I got you to look after me, and you got me to look after you, and that'swhy.”\nWhile the powerlessness of the laboring class is a recurring theme in Steinbeck's work of the late 1930s, he narrowed his focus when composing 'Of Mice and Men' (1937), creating an intimate portrait of two men facing a world marked by petty tyranny, misunderstanding, jealousy, and callousness. But though the scope is narrow, the theme is universal: a friendship and a shared dream that makes an individual's existence meaningful.Of Mice and Men also represents an experiment in form, as Steinbeck described his work, \"a kind of a playable novel, written in novel form but so scened and set that it can be played as it stands.\" A rarity in American letters, it achieved remarkable success as a novel, a Broadway play, and three acclaimed films.",
