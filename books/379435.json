  "description": "Like the rest of humanity, Dawn Vincent had goals and a plan for her life. She delivered babies for a living and dreamed of one day having some of her own with her soon-to-be husband. That changed the day that fire rained down from the skies above. Over a year later, with the remnants of humanity scrambling to survive, Dawn established herself as a doctor who spent more time fixing bullet wounds than runny noses. Buried in her work to avoid the painful memories of her lost fianc√©, Dawn's only reprieve from madness comes from time spent with a reckless woman who serves as a soldier. Angie tries to help Dawn out of her shell until she herself is lost on a mission.Unable to cope with another loss, Dawn finds strength from within. Refusing to take no for an answer, she wrestles control of the band of survivors and reminds them all of what it means to be human and how very valuable even a single life can be.Athena, The Romance Studio, 4/5 Hearts!\"Human Nature is a truly magnificent book. I am amazed at how much depth and complexity all the characters and the plot have. This isn't just a book about aliens invading the Earth. This is a story about how to be human in a world where humans aren't relevant anymore...Angie and Dawn are incredible characters...\"",
