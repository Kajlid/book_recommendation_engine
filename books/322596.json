She hopes to reinvent herself in this new land, leaving behind her sense of culpability in the death of her husband and the loss of her unborn child.While visiting the Tuol Sleng Museum of Genocide, Emily discovers that she shares an eerie resemblance to a portrait of a former prison inmate, Milijana Petrova, a Yugoslavian communist revolutionary who, in the 1970s, became fatally enmeshed with the brutal Khmer Rouge regime. Emily is not the only one who notices the astonishing similarity—her Cambodian driver insists she is the ghost of Milijana, come back to complete a mysterious task.This unexpected discovery consumes Emily, who starts desperately searching for answers about Milijana in historical documents from Cambodia’s devastating civil war.

What happens when life is turned upside down and the boundaries between past and present, life and death, are blurred? Can Emily’s discoveries help her to finally emerge from the pain of her own past, or will Milijana’s tragic end foretell her own?",
