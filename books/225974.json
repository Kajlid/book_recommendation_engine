  "description": "Bad movies. They're funny. Dark. Cheesy. Gory. Weird. Horrifying.But some would say they're pretty tame compared to Gilman's life in Beaver Quilt, Missouri, where misfits make friends through their love of B movies. Bullied to no end by the town yokels, The Turkey Gang, Gilman and his companions try to find purpose by reopening Beaver Quilt's burned theater. With constant earthquakes and strange, green smoke rising from the ground, will they even survive?The Rasping of Gilman takes the \"so-bad-it's-good\" aesthetic and turns it on its head, especially since the actions Gilman and company take are driven by the awful films they watch, including Kelpie, The Throat Singer, and Bounty Hunter: Zigzugzalzugzib.Chock full of B movie references--from Robot Monster, to the Creature from the Black Lagoon's actual \"Gill-man\", to Troll 2--The Rasping of Gilman is the perfect dark humor novel for movie lovers.",
