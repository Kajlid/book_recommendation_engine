  "description": "\"I'm not so sure that I'm strong enough to take yet another blow to the heart.\"  Growing up, I've always lived on the wrong side of the tracks. I'm used to the stares, name calling, and disrespect. A tragic accident that leaves me short three of the only people I've ever loved, has me devastated enough to try to end my own life. Just when I think there's no hope, I find a reason to live again, or four of them as a matter of fact. Lucas, Maverick, Teagan, and Goose. But what happens when those bonds are tested? I'm not so sure that I'm strong enough to take yet another blow to the heart. My name is Kendall Davis and what if my story doesn't have a happy ending? \n*This is the first book in a Contemporary Reverse Harem Trilogy.\n \n*Recommended 17+ due to mature language and situations.\n  From the Author  \nExcerpt:\n The rain steadily falls around us as we stand under the little canopy area. His hand is still at my elbow and I want nothing more than to lean into him. My eyes fall to my bus as it pulls away from the curb. Tears pool in my eyes and streak down my face at the thought of my now miserable walk home. Lucas uses his other hand to pull my chin up to face him. His eyes roam over my face like he’s trying to figure out how to fix the white trash ruin that I am, but he has no idea just how impossible that would be. People are staring, and I couldn’t give two shits as Lucas locks eyes with me. His flicks down to my lips and back up again.",
