The coins are rumored to be in the possession of a Pyrenean mountain Shepherd, whose beautiful, but disturbed daughter, Rachel, is purported to be something even more rare than a Judas blood coin: a genuine stigmatic.  It turns out to be a deadly combination for Emmanuel. With blood on his hands and a failed mission to retrieve what is rightfully his, finding his second coin becomes a race against time.  Traveling thousands of miles across the world's grand open waters with fellow immortal, Juan Garcia de Moguer, the captivating Rachel, and a ruthless Dutch pirate slave trader named Captain Dirk Chivers teaches Emmanuel an important lesson about himself.
