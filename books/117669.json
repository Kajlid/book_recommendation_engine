  "description": "In a time before written records were kept, on a world similar to ours, there were four kingdoms in a land with two suns. Eons of feuding and warfare had made some disciplined and others bitter. One kingdom, the Gierrer, were centered amid three others and natural selection made them strong and large to be able to defend their lands and people from the Esbiorn to the north. Princess Runa of the Esbiorn had heard horror stories of the Gierrer and when her father gave her hand in unity to another warring kingdom the only way to her intended was through the Gierrer lands, her father's brutal enemy. They were captured and and she caught the interest of the largest fiercest man she'd ever seen. To save her sister and her mother she pledged loyalty. Her life started to unravel and she discovered that not everything was as it seemed. note; sexual content and some graphic scenes",
