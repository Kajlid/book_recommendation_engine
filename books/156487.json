  "title": "Beast, Part Three",
  "description": "Return to La Rosa Prison as Annabelle tries to save Beast from his grizzly fate. Her tongue and hands are doing most of the saving. Okay, not really. There's suspense and a healthy dose of smut, too. You know that's how you like it...  In all seriousness, this is an adult book that deals with a variety of intense and mature topics. It's also a novella. If you dislike reading stories in installments, or are a prude, a whiner, or other unsavory sort of character, this may not be a good read for you. *Part 3 is on sale for 99 cents for the first 12 hours only. Tell your friends! *Part Four is coming September 22. I expect it to be the final installment in the Beast serials. *Part one is FREE, so go grab it if you haven't started this series.",
