  "description": "In Soul Corrupted, the sequel to Soul Crossed, life in Heaven isn’t all \"happily ever after\" for Josh and Grace. Now Guardian Angels, they are entrusted with finding and saving the next potential Antichrist. But Grace is consumed with worry about her family, which is dealing with the aftershocks of her death. She's particularly concerned about her brother Noah, who has turned down a dangerous path of drugs and violence—and she's frustrated by the rules of Heaven, which forbid her from contacting them.   Josh has troubles of his own. A former Demon, he questions his ability to guide troubled souls to the light. When he discovers that Noah made a deal with Lucifer and has even been hanging around with Josh’s old Demon pal, Keira, he makes a forbidden counter-deal with the Devil to save Noah's soul. Josh's side of the bargain? He has to sever his relationship with Grace.   Josh and Grace's world is about to spin out of control, testing the limits of true love and blurring the border between Heaven and Hell.  Soul Corrupted is the second installment in Lisa Gail Green’s Of Demon and Angels series, which started with Soul Crossed.Praise for Soul Crossed, Of Demons and Angels series, Book 1: “Who knew evil could be so dreamy?
