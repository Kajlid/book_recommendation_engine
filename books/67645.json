  "description": "If you really want to kill yourself, don't get drunk before that. However badly you decide, you can't fight your own destiny (sure you can deal with it, especially when girls around are fighting for liquor). If you want to kill your sweet girlfriend's insane best friend, don't wait up for the break up; chances are that you could get stuck with both. You might be obsessed with finding out a reason to why you broke up with someone, especially when they come in front of you in minimal clothing. Sometimes life doesn't give you what you deserve, but not in the case of Rahul. In his case it happens only all the time, be it his bright future in the field or a romantic linkup with an angel!! And in those desperate times he is left with no choice but to lend his soul to the Satan, Teesha aka Tish (of course, in human form). Will they be able to overcome an overprotective Dad and a hot-shot businessman? Find out what all Rahul has to go through to get his true love via the cynicism of Tish. About The Mohit Naryani, born and brought up in Jaipur, is an IT engineer by profession, but the flair for writing brought him to the field. Apart from a knack for the written word, he is also a sports enthusiast and loves playing tennis and basketball. He has worked on various writing projects but this is his first attempt at fiction. He reveals an insane sense of humour in his first book and promises the same in the future as well.",
