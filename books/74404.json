  "description": "Seventeen yr old Ella McMillan's life has been all about ballet and working hard to survive high school, so that she can chase her dream of dancing on the world's greatest stages.However, that all quickly changes after surviving a terrifying attack that should have ended her life... But she was spared and now 'they' know a secret that she has no idea of.Ella's life soon begins to spiral out of control, with everything she'd read about in books and watched in movies as a child suddenly becoming frighteningly real.Hunted for her 'rare' blood, she finds herself stuck under the protection of an unbearable, ill-tempered boy and an irritating classmate, who claim they're a fallen angel and a shape-shifting warrior. How completely absurd.As stranger events occur, Ella soon realises that in order to stay alive (which is becoming a never ending struggle) and if she wants to uncover her mysterious past, she has to decide whether to entrust herself with her unlikely companions or to flee.But who is there to trust when everybody is harboring their own dark secrets? And where is there to run to, when your enemy can easily find you? Could there be another reason why the demons are after her? Or is the real danger coming from somebody close to her?The Moonlight Guardian is the first installment in the Moonlight Series.",
