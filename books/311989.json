  "description": "GIULIAHe’s dark. Dirty. Dangerous. A brother in my dad's MC. Everything Mom told me to avoid. Everything I shouldn’t want.But his dark, his dirty, and his dangerous are like catnip to me. He stirs fear into the hearts of men, but I hear his rage. I feel it like it’s my own.He’s a killer. Shameless. Some might even call him a psycho. I just call him soul mate. We were born to raise hell together, born to make sick b*stards pay for their sins, born to be the king and queen of darkness…Now, the king just needs to get that memo. NYX is the first book in the eleven-book ‘A Dark & Dirty Sinners’ MC’ series. It is not a standalone.",
