She seems innocent and sweet, but she comes from a family that left me scarred and broken. Taking her will be the pinnacle of my vengeance. So I do. But once I have her -- I can’t seem to continue with my plan.This has never happened... I’ve killed without remorse, taken revenge again and again on any who wronged me. But when it comes to Helen, I can’t bear to see her so much as break a nail, which happens with a frightening frequency given her adorable clumsiness. So I keep her. And I protect her. And before I know it -- I love her.But her family isn’t the sort to let anything or anyone go. I’ll have to fight to keep her, but will my beauty decide to stay with her beast -- or leave and break my heart?*-*MINK's Note: Who doesn't love a tale as old as time, made so much better with a kitty and a coffee, and a beast who would do anything for the beauty he loves?",
