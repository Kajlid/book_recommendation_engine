Imagine that. Cisco Suarez living the Miami high life.In a perfect world, all I’d worry about were mounting HOA violations and a girlfriend playing hard to get. Not my world.One innocent investigation turns into a meet and greet with human-trafficking vampires and, surprise, surprise, the cops frown on my brand of outlaw justice. The FBI’s next, asking questions about a set of murders I didn’t commit. Oh, and said serial killer might just want a word with yours truly.Yup, trouble’s what you make of it alright, and I just can’t help myself.",
