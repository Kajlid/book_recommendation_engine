  "description": "Eve Babitz is a writer like no other—she “is to prose what Chet Baker is to jazz” (Vanity Fair)—and has influenced a generation of writers and readers with her sophisticated, witty, and delightful work. L.A. Woman is quintessential Babitz, the story of Sophie, a twenty-something blonde Jim Morrison groupie gliding through a golden existence in L.A., and Lola, a German immigrant who settles in Hollywood in the twenties to drive Pierce-Arrows recklessly down Sunset Boulevard and who knows that Maybelline mascara cakes and Rudolph Valentino are the essence of life.Sophie and Lola, like the many other women who move in and out of this electric saga, know that while L.A. is constantly changing, it is essentially eternal. Through their eyes we see the mixture of high and low culture, the promises of youth, and the fulfillment of nostalgia, as Babitz shares what it is to be a woman in what she convinces us is the capital of civilization.",
