  "description": "A perfect mix between Chinese versions of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and Silence of the Lambs.Three young women are found dead one after another in Jiangbin City, each horribly murdered and disemboweled in her home. Police investigations reveal that the killer is a monster who likes to mix milk together with human blood—and then drink it. Is he some kind of immortal vampire, straight out of legend? A series of four rape and murder cases surface in Changhong City. All of the victims are white-collar workers between the ages of twenty-five and thirty. A graduate student at the top of his class suddenly goes mad and begins attacking his friends and fellow classmates. After a succession of seemingly unrelated homicides occurring not far from the city, the police are still completely at a loss. A television viewer sends in a letter with a sketch of what he claims is the murderer's face. Intrigued, the chief of the Public Security Bureau seeks out the author of the letter, and to his surprise it is a reticent, anti-social university student—Fang Mu. After the killer is executed, however, another spate of homicides begins to crop up. Was Fang Mu mistaken? Following deductive reasoning, he realizes that the ultimate victim will be Fang Mu himself. Can he \"profile\" this monster and discover his true identity before it's too late?",
