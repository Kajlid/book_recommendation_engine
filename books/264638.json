  "description": "Twenty-eight-year-old Riley Carrington has always been a daredevil, and though her girlfriend and boss, Joanna Armstrong, has done the best she can to tame her with the help of a paddle applied to her bare bottom as often as necessary, Riley's reckless behavior has persisted.Though she spends far more of her time than she would like with her nose in the corner and her backside on fire, being made to surrender her naked, quivering body completely to Joanna's intimate, practiced dominance never fails to leave Riley blushing and sore yet deeply satisfied.But when a stalker sets his sites on Riley and she takes it upon herself to bring him to justice, no matter the risk, will her disregard for her safety end up tearing her romance with Joanna apart?Publisher's Note: Riley's Reckoning is a stand-alone sequel to Reining in Riley. It includes spankings and sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.73,200 words",
