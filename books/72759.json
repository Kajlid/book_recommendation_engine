  "description": "When six-year-old Hannah’s brutal honesty is mistaken for lying, she stops speaking. Her family, her community, and eventually the entire nation, struggle to find meaning in her silence. All she wants is to find her momma, a little peace and quiet, and maybe some pancakes. Pinnacle Book Achievement Award – Best Fiction~Hidden in protective foster care for twelve years, Hannah loses all contact with her mother and remains mute by choice. When she leaves foster care at age eighteen to search for her momma, a national debate rages over her silence. One word would put an end to the chaos... if only Hannah can find her voice.“This book is so well written and Hannah is so compelling, her voice lingers in my mind long after I have finished reading. If Hannah’s Voice doesn’t end up on the bestseller’s list, on every notable list... I will be shocked. I will definitely keep my eyes open for more from Robb Grindstaff!” ~ Michelle L. Johnson“Hannah’s Voice is a beautiful story, and I’m going to tell you about it, but before I seriously, you guys, read it. I’m not kidding. You’ll be changed forever, inside... it’s not a book with such strong thematic material that it will make anyone cringe, but it will be burned into your brain for eternity in such a delightful way. Touching, moving, funny, awesome. I can’t say it this book is revolutionary, and the best thing I’ve read in years.” ~ Naomi SarahEVOLVED PUBLISHING PRESENTS a novel that captures the heartwarming and unique voice first of six-year-old Hannah, and later of the teenage Hannah, in a story sure to bring a smile to your face, and occasionally a tear.
