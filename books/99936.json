  "description": "Shadow Demon Lady Shade Loganazzi, lamenting the loss of her most recent lover, ends up in Monaco to enter a black jack tourney and forget her troubles with men and her life in general. She knows she’s to be summoned back home to marry a man she doesn’t even like, let alone love, and is determined to go out with a bang. She didn’t count on gambling away her freedom in another manner.Caleb Marshapoltes, Djinn and cousin to the crown, knows what he wants when he sees it, and he very much wants Shade. An enigma on the supernatural betting circuit, she’s harder to place a bet on then a winner in the 4th. But Caleb is smart, and knows that the woman that haunts his every thought is exactly the kind of woman he could end up with as a consort, something he didn’t even consider until laying eyes on Shade. When they come face to face in the qualifiers, egos rear and lust flames as the two set to one upping each other… and in the process find out that what burns white hot between them could be meant for always, if they can figure out how to get her out of a loveless marriage.",
