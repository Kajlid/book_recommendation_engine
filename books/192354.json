  "title": "Burlesque, Yoga, Sex and Love: A Memoir of Life Under the Albuquerque Sun",
  "description": "In Burlesque, Yoga, Sex and Love, Anne invites us to walk along the glittery, rhinestone-encrusted path of self-discovery as she confronts, and transcends, the established norms for middle-aged women. Set in picturesque Albuquerque, New Mexico, this memoir explores what it means to connect the body, mind and spirit through the practices of yoga and burlesque. By the end of the book, you will find yourself traveling outside the shadowy corners of fear and toward a brighter light where there is freedom to be found in accepting yourself and in learning to love what you find. This memoir shows that there's much to discover about femininity, power and sexuality through burlesque as an art form. - Miss Indigo Blue, Headmistress of The Academy of Burlesque In this thoroughly readable memoir, Anne explores her growth as a burlesque performer and sexual being, challenging the preconceived ideas of what an aging woman can do and be, thereby reinventing the \"New Woman\" for a modern era. - Dr. Lynn Sally, Director of Urban Studies at Metropolitan College What a fascinating glimpse into a world, unknown to most of us, where sexuality and spirituality intersect! Anne Key's honest, open portrayal of her journey, with all its ups and downs, is a gift to every woman. - Jalaja Bonheim, Aphrodite's Daughters and The Sacred Ego: Making Peace with Ourselves and Our World",
