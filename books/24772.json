  "title": "Killing for Sport: Inside the Minds of Serial Killers",
  "description": "A renegade criminal profiler and forensic psychologist--the only female profiling team in the nation--have teamed up to write the most useful guide to serial killers ever created. While other serial killer books tend to conceal the clear facts behind complex technical language and psychobabble, this one actually tells it like it is. Killing for Sport will intrigue you with its honest portrayal of the predator-next-door: how he hunts for his victims, why he likes to torture them, where he tends to stash their bodies, and more. Movies such as Silence of the Lambs, Seven, American Psycho, and many others, have created myths about serial killers that need to be dispelled: If you think that most serial killers are eccentric, white, male intellectuals like Hannibal Lecter, then you had better read Killing for Sport to learn the truth. The more our society is informed about these predators and what really goes on in their minds, the more equipped we are to protect ourselves from them. With the same dark wit that gets people who work with the criminally insane through their workday, Sinclair and Brown speak trankly about the monsters among us who kill for sport.",
