  "description": "Ashleigh Carter is no stranger to crime, but she’s no criminal; or at least, not technically. By association she’s as guilty as sin. Her father is President of the Priests MC, a motorcycle club that rides on the wrong side of the law.Paul ‘Shark’ Reardon is caught in the middle. What starts out as a simple, yet dangerous, mission for his club, the Rabid Dogs MC is soon complicated by acceptance, friendship and a blue-eyed blonde who is very definitely off-limits.Everyone’s hiding something and trust is in short supply. Hazardous lives, already fraught with tension, are twisted into cross and double-cross. Somewhere in the middle of the plots and lies is a chance for love, if everyone can just make it out the other side alive.",
