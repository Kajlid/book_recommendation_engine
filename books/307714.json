  "title": "Evangeline: A Tale of Acadie",
  "description": "Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's classic poem Evangeline follows the odyssey of a people―the Acadians, forceably deported from Nova Scotia in 1755―and immortalizes Acadia as the Land of Evangeline. This is the haunting love story of Evangeline and Gabriel, devoted from childhood, who are separated during the expulsion of the Acadians from Grand-Pré and their lifelong search for one another. First published in 1847, this epic poem has touched the hearts of all who have read it with its serene and melancholy beauty and is as popular today as it was then. With both colour and black and white illustrations, drawn from previous editions, and an informative introduction by Bruce Fergusson, this collector's edition of Evangeline will charm and delight both those familiar with the poem and those who have discovered it for the first time.",
