Her goals were to graduate from the University with exceptional grades and get into the best law school Canada has to offer.Then one day, Justice tried to kill herself. Well, not her technically. It may have been her body, but those actions weren't intentional and the suicidal thoughts were not hers. Or, so she keeps telling her therapist and family.Justice is afraid sheâ€™s losing her mind and just wants to forget everything. But when her best friend is murdered, another one is being mind-screwed by a Vampyre, and her ex is back in town, looking as scrumptious as ever and very suspicious, maybe she isn't all that crazy!",
