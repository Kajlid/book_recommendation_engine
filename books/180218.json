  "description": "Feisty, funny, poignant, and random.In Self Help to Self Harm, Tosha Michelle takes a humorous, tongue-in-cheek look at life, love, and relationships, tempered by moments of serious introspection.From the author:This is not a self-help book. Sadly, this book won’t get you laid, help you lose weight or cure your One Direction addiction. Okay, maybe, that’s my addiction. SHH. I’m not an expert at anything unless you count tripping up the stairs, getting lost in my own head and devouring a box of Godiva chocolates in one sitting. Now that I have told you what this book is not. Let me tell you what I hope the book is. It supposed to be a humorous, tongue-in-cheek look at life, love, and relationships, tempered by moments of serious introspection. It’s kind of random and chaotic like its author. Oh, and you should know, I kind of have a list fetish. Don’t say I didn't warn ya.",
