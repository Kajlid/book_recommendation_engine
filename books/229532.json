  "description": "“I Have Squirrels in my Belly” is a picture book intended to be used as an educational tool by teachers, parents and mental health workers to help children recognize feelings of chronic anxiety. By understanding that the uneasy feelings and misbehaviors of the main character are not always in his control, it is hoped that children will begin to develop understanding and empathy towards those that are suffering. The book also aims to demonstrate that a few simple strategies can sometimes make a difference, even if it’s just in the short-term.",
