  "description": "Five years ago, Dylan Silver was forced to bid goodbye to the only boy she ever truly loved. Since then, she's done her best to forget the past, put her dreams on hold, and play the role of the perfect, dutiful daughter. When her best friend coaxes her into a winter getaway to a mountain resort, she sees it as a chance to forget about her suffocating responsibilities and the future she doesn’t want—med-school and a fake fiancé.But then the past catches up to her. Sexy Olympic snowboarder Sawyer Carter is the last person she expected to encounter on the slopes after all these years. Being around him again is intoxicating, and as bittersweet memories mix with dark desires, she starts to wonder if maybe they really are meant to be.But Dylan doesn't believe in fate, and a future with Sawyer no longer factors into her risk-free plans. As he dares her to be the person she has always wanted to be, can she find it within herself to abandon her fears and seize this opportunity for a second chance? One thing is certain: after a week in Whistler, Dylan’s life will never be the same.",
