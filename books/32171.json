ATNO! was also made into an intense audio-book (music, sound effects) and narrated huge youtube comedian Brock Baker.  Readers should note that this is not a deep story, but something fun/ridiculous and spoofing on conspiracy thrillers. ATNO! is fast pace, short and on crack. Perfect for something to read on a long trip, boring day at work or for the short attention span.  Phil, a psych student and street musician, is offered a chance to have his college loan's paid off. In-return, he must become disguised as a security guard at Disneyland, to help an F.B.I agent who doesn't have a warrant find a bomb. Phil stumbles across something deadlier than the bomb and it might just get him assassinated. Join in on an intense dark comedy, heart-pounding thriller, which will have you asking the question : \"Who do you trust?\"    For t-shirts, book trailer, and other kick butt merch visit geoffreybrokos.com/store.htm",
