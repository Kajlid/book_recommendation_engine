Could Andi change his fortune?Things heat up fast between them, until an ill-informed encounter with a penis pump leaves Ryder's sexy ass couch-ridden and jobless for more than a week.

But her languishing grades back in Philly and her mother's rapidly improving health tell her it's time to go.When life takes the scariest turn imaginable, can these two turn it into a happy ending - for both of them?",
