Now he's a manâ€”gorgeous, powerful . . . and seeking vengeance.Brogan Ramsay can't let go of the memory of Lydia tricking him cruelly, leaving his heart shattered and his family penniless. And now he's back to destroy her family the way his was destroyed. There's only one problem . . . the girl who wounded him so badly years ago is now a woman who still has the power to render him breathless.Ramsay is the story of betrayal and wrath, of the strength of regret and the power of forgiveness.
