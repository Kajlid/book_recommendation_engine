  "description": "Rebecca Fish Ewan's illustrated coming-of-age memoir By the Forces of Gravity is told through drawings and free verse. Set in 1970s Berkeley, California, Rebecca's story reflects on a childhood friendship cut short by tragedy. In an era of laissez-faire parenting, Rebecca drops out of elementary school and takes up residence in a kids commune -- no parents allowed! -- and we follow her, bestie Luna, and their hippie cohorts as they search for love, acceptance, and cosmic truths. Full of adventure and heartache, By the Forces of Gravity promises to pull you in.",
