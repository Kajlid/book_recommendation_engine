  "description": "Should she choose love past, present or possibly, future?Carole Singer hates her name, especially around Christmas when everyone seems to think it’s okay to make a joke about it. She can’t wait to marry her boyfriend Dominic and change her surname to ‘Smith,’ and she’s sure he’ll pop the question any day now.When her gran has a nasty fall, Carole has to return to the Sussex village of Jutsdown, to care for her – and that’s sixty miles from London ... and Dominic. It also means coming face to face with Sebastian, the man who broke her heart ten years earlier.As Carole juggles her career as an illustrator, caring for her meddlesome gran, and missing Dominic, she struggles with her rekindled feelings for Sebastian. Getting roped in to help with the Christmas musical, A Christmas Carol at the village hall and discovering her gran has invested in a garden centre owned by the moody but gorgeous, Nick, doesn’t help. Carole’s Christmas now looks as if it’ll be anything but peaceful.With the Christmas holidays looming and Dominic coming to stay, Carole is facing a dilemma. Should she choose her past boyfriend, Sebastian, her present boyfriend, Dominic or could there be any sort of a future with the dark and secretive Nick?",
