  "description": "My darkest secret? I let a stranger dominate me in the most intimate way possible. He gave me three things that night: His first name, the sweet taste of submission, and his baby. Now my Dom is back and this time he won’t stop until I’m his.  Kylie  One wild and reckless night changed my life three years ago. I got a taste of what it meant to be with a real man--how just a whisper could ignite my desire, and his commanding voice could have me kneeling at his feet in submission.  He was my everything and I only knew him for a few hours.  But like everything good in my life, it went up in flames. When I learned the truth about him, I ran as fast as I could. I’d like to think I would’ve stayed if I knew about the baby… but I doubt even that would’ve stopped me, not after what I learned.  Damian  It has been three years since she got away. Three f*cking years. I knew she was mine from the moment I saw her. I had to have her. To touch her. For one night, I owned her submission and she loved every second.  I finally found her again. There’s not a chance in hell she’s going to slip away this time. Not again. Not ever.  I’m going to bring her into my world. I’ll give her everything she wants and all the things she didn’t even know she needs. She’ll be crying out my name. She’ll be dreaming of spankings, handcuffs, and blindfolds.  I’m going to dominate her in every way imaginable. Mind, body, and soul. Especially her body.  But it’s not going to be as simple as I thought because she has a son now… my son.  **As always, this is a totally SAFE, full length book with a happily ever after, no cheating, and plenty of steam. Bonus content included.**",
