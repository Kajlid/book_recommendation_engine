  "description": "He's a survivor. No matter the cost.Until he met Ciere and her crew of superpowered thieves, Alan Fiacre's life had been singularly focused on safeguarding the vaccine that changed the world. As an eidos, and reluctant heir to his father's legacy, it was his duty to ensure the formula never fell into the wrong hands. So it came as something of a shock to learn the right hands might belong to criminals.Now Alan and Ciere are conscripted into service with the Gyr Syndicate, notorious mobsters set on taking down all of the other crime families in the United States. Their latest a train heist meant to derail a covert arms deal. It will put Alan--and the formula--in more danger than he's ever faced before. But if he's learned nothing else from Ciere, it's that there's more to life than survival.",
