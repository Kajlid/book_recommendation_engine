  "description": "Synopsis:An American businessman who liked to linger in Pachinko parlor every night in his lonely life as a foreigner in the city of Tokyo met Misa, a young Japanese hostess that worked at a Pachinko parlor by chance. Knowing her personal woes, he gave her his winning as an exchange for Japanese lessons. That large sum of money incriminated them to false accuse of sex trade. Meanwhile, an ex-adult film producer investigated the death of a French movie producer of cult status who happened to have filmed Misa in his last legendary work in Japan, in which she was seemingly strangled to death. Motivation: Japan has always fascinates me, yet the more I learnt about it, the more I have come to realize that this amazing country with its unique cultures and rich history often times offered so much distraction through its dazzling, energetic, relentless representations in anime, movies, pop music and world-class innovations that they masked the diverse voices of the people behind. On the surface, The White Man and the Pachinko Girl is a murder mystery. In fact, I tried to use this work to explores many human rights issues such as gender inequality, hyper sexualization of teens, homosexual discrimination, racial discrimination and workplace bullying among others in Japan through the eyes of a foreigner with his friends from different walks of lives and professions. Through the protagonists' adventures, we can experience first hand the alienation, the suppression, the abuse, the emotional struggle that they, and a lot of Japanese, are going through.",
