  "description": "Werewolves and Vampires...Even though considered mythical creatures, many believe that they are real, hence the spiraling outpour of stories about them. For Evie Patterson, she's feared them, hated them and even loved them, but only from the safety of her couch as she reads from her beloved fictional books.But what if Vampires and Werewolves were real?Upon nosing around a decaying crime scene, Evie unfortunately finds out that they are. Narrowly escaping the attack of a werewolf, she has only a vampire to thank for that, but the question to follow, one amongst several, is did he really rescue her?A long, deep scratch now resides down the middle of Evieâ€™s back, a souvenir from her attacker, one who soon makes it clear he has no intention of letting things lay. With her life still at risk, Evie now not only has to deal with what comes with knowing such a reality, she now must also decide which side she is on before she becomes one of them.It only takes a scratch to create a Werewolf, but it also only takes a bite to become a Vampire.",
