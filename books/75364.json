  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Isadora was born with a silver hair. Though she dyes it an average brown and has perfected blending into the background, she battles with always feeling like a secret freak. Things worsen when her mother remarries. Isadora and her new stepbrother, Cheyenne, have little interest in each other or their new home--- until they discover an unsettling story about a sixteen-year-old girl who went missing from their home, never to be heard from again. Obsessed with the details of the girl's disappearance, Isadora's best friend, Heather, consults with an old Ouija board, ripping the veil between our worlds wide open. Heather vanishes, as does Isadora's mother. Bit by bit, Isadora and Cheyenne, along with their wise cat Serena get sucked into an ancient realm long forgotten by humans- an enchanted land where nothing is what it seems, where nothing can be taken for granted. Before Isadora can save anyone, she will have to dive deep into an unfamiliar world--- one that holds the darkest truths to her fears and family secrets, leaving her to face an intimate threat that will change her life forever . . .",
