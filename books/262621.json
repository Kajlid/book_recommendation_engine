  "description": "Le Livre blanc is one of the most personal works by Jean Cocteau. In a text that is elegant, daring and as relevant as ever, this novel – a singular account of a homosexual experience – sheds a unique light on a source of inspiration central to the poet’s entire oeuvre. This edition reproduces in color the eighteen magnificent drawings by Cocteau that accompanied the text in its first illustrated edition in 1930.",
