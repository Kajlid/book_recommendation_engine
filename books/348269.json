Here a seductive magic mirror lies hidden deep in a demon’s lair, with a simple warning: don’t stare at the glass… Ice is a light-fingered fairy who can’t resist a look at the powerful mirror. She and her fairy friends run confidence games, pretending to be fortune tellers and bedazzling customers with their glamour. But Ice longs for more—she wants a real life, a respectable job and something to strive for. The mirror offers her a chance to achieve everything she’s ever dreamed of. But when she pilfers it, she discovers that its power comes with a price: the mirror is a gateway to obsession and madness. . . and it will take every trick in her arsenal just to survive.",
