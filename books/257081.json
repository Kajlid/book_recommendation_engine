  "description": "There are three important things you should know about me.  First, I’m a shapeshifter. Second, I’ve got claws, and I know how to use them. And third, I’d do anything to save the ones I love.  Which is how I’ve ended up as a slave for the Dark Fae, forced to train at their academy and become a deadly assassin that will fight for their cause. But all I want to do is fight my captors instead.  And the worst part of it all? The four infuriating, dangerous, and incredibly seductive fae who have taken it upon themselves to make my life a living hell.  They want to rile me up. They want to see me fail.  But I’m no damsel in distress.  Let the games begin.  A Cage of Moonlight is a full-length novel and the first in a new reverse harem fantasy series. This is a spin-off of the bestselling Otherworld Academy trilogy.",
