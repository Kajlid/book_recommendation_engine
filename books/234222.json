  "description": "This short story is the first in of the long degrading road of humiliation for John Sawyer. Sawyer, a successful, billionaire businessman, has just started his first vacation in 5 years. A 12-week solo trip around the world. With no one expecting him and an opportunity to finally spend some of the money he has earned, he heads to Miami for a night of world-class clubbing. He wishes for a world where he doesn't have to make any decisions. He gets exactly what he wishes for. This story focuses on the seduction and emotional connection of the two characters. While there is a passionate moment on the dance floor, and the story does use vulgar language; edging and denial are a strong element of the story. This is an Erom that walks the line between erotica and romance thrillingly. As an author and a person, C.C. Flowers has always been interested in the innocence and loss of it that comes with becoming and adult. She is excited to bring the same tense moments of fear confused by lust to a kinkier genre. A male POV with a strong female FemDom about how she begins to seduce him in a night club.",
