  "description": "\"What’s set Marc apart forever is also what’s brought him and Lacie together.He's spent his entire life searching for and studying love, but Heaven on Earth with hazel eyes and a teenage heart has taught him more than any book, mission, or seminary ever could. While she struggles with accepting what she's always had, he guards her path and guides her soul toward the most enduring kind of love.Faith isn't always believing in something you can't see. Sometimes faith is embracing what's been right before your eyes all along.Between stolen candy and soft surrender, centuries-old sacraments and a brand new day, this is a story about two people accepting God’s greatest gift, even if no one else will.\"",
