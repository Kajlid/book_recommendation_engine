  "description": "I learned a long time ago that people can’t be trusted. I have my brothers. I don’t need anyone else. Argenta was an anomaly. A moment of weakness. In the space of one night, she slipped past every one of my defenses. For one brief, terrifying moment, she had me believing she was different. That we could be different. But in the cold light of day, I saw the truth. She was just like the rest. Cold. Calculating. I sent her away and tried to move on. But five years later, here she is. Only her name’s not Argenta, it’s Silver. Her father is my newest business partner and she is not the person I thought she was. She pretends not to know me, but I can see it her eyes. She knows exactly who I am. And she hates my guts. That’s too bad because I’ve decided to keep her. She’s mine. This time, she’s not going anywhere.  ***Tobias is a full-length stand-alone contemporary romance (and a low-key secret-baby romance. shhh...) with plenty of heat, no cliffhanger and a heart-melting HEA***",
