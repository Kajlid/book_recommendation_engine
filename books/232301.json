  "description": "Meet Indiana, a girl who is a year older than the boy Seary. It was hard to impress her but he did. As they met for a reason. They had very sweet moments together. Seary gave the best gift possible for her birthday. The return gift which she gave was something hard to expect. This is to inspire the teenagers. As it includes three teenage love stories. It is sure that at least one resembles or resembled yours. I still walk on those paths where we use to walk. Not in the hope that you will walk with me again. But just to feel those steps when you walked beside me. The only difference now is my footsteps are deafening as they lost the rhythm of yours.",
