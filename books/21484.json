Would Nazi Germany conquer the world?This is the intriguing premise of Robert Craven's 'Get LENIN' which pits the academic British spymaster Henry Chainbridge and the seductive Polish infiltrator Eva Molenaar against the elite of the German Third Reich and the wealth and ambition of American movie mogul Donald T. Kincaid who will amass yet another fortune for himself recording the Nazis' triumphal seizure of Lenin himself.The race is on, and if the Nazi plot succeeds the war and humanity itself may be lost.",
