  "title": "Ferocious Dennis",
  "description": "Ferocious Dennis is a rhyming tale about an unlikely friendship between a little boy named Ben and a 'ferocious' sock-eating monster who lives under his bed. The book is not only beautifully illustrated and riddled with humour, but also has an anti-bullying message and aims to teach children not to be afraid of the unknown or those different to them.  \"For I do not eat children, but in fact eat odd socks! The dirtier and sweatier the more the taste rocks!\"",
