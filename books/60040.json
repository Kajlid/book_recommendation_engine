  "description": "A graveyard in the dead of night.While most would avoid such an eerie setting, for three friends looking for a safe place to toke up, it is the perfect place to get high without getting caught. Unfortunately, for these stoners, fate has given them more to worry about than nosy cops.In the blink of a bloodshot eye, all hell breaks loose... literally.As forces beyond the friends' perception and control turn a calm night in a marijuana-haze into a terror-filled bloodbath all hope seems lost. But there's far deadlier beings roaming through the headstones, and a Crimson Shadow soon eclipses the carnage.Talk about the ultimate buzz-kill!Comedic disclaimer:Remember, kids, don't smoke weed, or a zombie will smash your friends' faces into tombstones and eat them right before a gun-toting vampire puts an enchanted hollow-point in your skull.",
