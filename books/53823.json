  "title": "Where the Boys Are",
  "description": "'Where the Boys are' is a fun novel that deals with some darker issues. Boys are being trained for rent boy activity and it is a hard-edged world that somehow contains many laughs along the way. Characters like Councillor Reece with his corset and Trevelyan Harris Spunner with his frequenting of park toilets are all in there somewhere. Adonises like Ariel and Hayden enjoy their position in trade but little girl Snowdrop is a matter of some concern, most notably to Midge, the young recruit sent from Doris Spangle's bent adoption agency. Soon things go wrong and someone is murdered near The Lodge where these activities take place. Then Overleaf, a young rent boy is found dead and finally Mrs. Dubbins the housekeeper is shot. A garrulous nun careers through the novel like only her kind can and it becomes a rollercoaster ride to find the killer.",
