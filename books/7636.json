  "title": "Cowboys for Christ",
  "description": "The movie premiered in the UK this year, starring Christopher Lee. This is a novel of religious sexuality and pagan murder. If I am a Rabbi, Jehova is my God. If I am a Mullah, Allah the merciful is He. If a Christian, Jesus is my Lord. Millions of people worldwide worship the sun. Here in Tressock, I believe the old religion of the Celts fits our needs at this time. Isn't that all you can ask of a religion? Gospel singer Beth and her cowboy boyfriend Steve, two virgins promised to each other through 'the Silver Ring Thing', set off from Texas to enlighten the Scottish heathens in the ways of Christ. When, after initial hostility, they are welcomed with joy and elation to the village of Tressock, they assume their hosts simply want to hear more about Jesus. How innocent and wrong they are. Ripping through the themes of religion, paganism, power, sex and sacrifice, \"Cowboys for Christ\" builds up to its gruesome, excruciating climax under the terrifying imagination of Robin Hardy.",
