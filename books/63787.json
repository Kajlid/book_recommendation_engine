  "title": "Hubert Keller's Souvenirs: Stories and Recipes from My Life",
  "description": "An intimate look at the life of celebrated chef Hubert Keller, through 120 inspiring recipes, personal stories, myriad photographs, and other memorabilia.Souvenirs is a memoir cookbook written by the multitalented Hubert chef, restaurateur, and Frenchman. Through personal stories and 120 recipes, the book explores his classical training and traces his development as a creative superstar chef. Keller apprentices in a Michelin three star–rated restaurant at the age of 16. He moves from his native Alsace, to southern France, and is inspired by the cuisine of the sun while working with the great French chefs of his time, Roger Vergé, Paul Bocuse, and Gaston Lenôtre. He learns to adapt to challenging new environments in South America, and the United States, and charts his own path into the newest frontiers of the restaurant business. The book is organized by seminal themes in his life; it starts with his family in France, and ends back there in the “Holiday” chapter. The myriad recipes, which have been adapted for the home cook, are intertwined with 125 of Eric Wolfinger's luscious images of family and friends, food and cuisine, and the places and landscapes of France, Las Vegas, and San Francisco, which all make up chef Keller’s life.",
