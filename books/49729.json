  "description": "an alternate cover edition can be found hereForeign Affairs, Book One Annie Prince has impetuously flown halfway 'round the world to visit a sexy cowboy she met online-only to find herself stranded in Sydney. Seems she and Dylan crossed wires, and he's on his way to New York. His twin, Hunter, saves the day and whisks her back to the family cattle station. Hunter's as easy on the eyes as Dylan, and even easier to talk to. Annie might have flown to Oz to meet one brother, but soon sparks are flying with the other. Hunter considered Dylan a dumb arse for jetting off to America for some stranger-until he met Annie. Turns out the New Yorker is a smart, funny, hard-working jillaroo...and hotter than the Aussie desert. Hunter's not normally one to poach his brother's women, but he can't keep his hands, lips, tongue and other body parts off this sexy city girl. When raging lust leads to emotional attachment, where does that leave Annie and Hunter when her vacation comes to an end-or when Dylan finds out?",
