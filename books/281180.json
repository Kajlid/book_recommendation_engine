  "description": "A village trapped in winter, a tyrannical god, and a girl who will do anything to keep her family alive...  Ever since Cora's father disappeared through the ice, whispers about her family's \"curse\" have grown increasingly louder. Desperate to help her mother and siblings survive another bleak season in the Winter King's frozen grasp, Cora begins to bend (and even break) the rules she has kept since she was a little girl. But when she discovers a secret that's much bigger than herself, she realizes too late that she has put herself--and those she loves--in even greater peril.  Wintry and dangerous but hauntingly lovely, The Winter King is the debut novel from author Christine Cohen.",
