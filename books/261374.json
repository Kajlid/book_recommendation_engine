  "description": "Tiffany’s lived off the grid in the desert all her life. Miranda’s a world famous pop star who peaked in the early 2000s. Naomi’s a goth working at a corporate movie nostalgia theme park. What do these three women have in common? They were all created as super weapons by a clandestine government conspiracy called MK ULTRA.  Together with a college student who can project his consciousness through space and a professional vampire hunter, they take a road trip for the truth, for freedom, and to fight back.  It's like Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance meets The Men Who Stare At Goats. It's X-Files meets From Justin to Kelly. (Actually that's a bad comparison. Ignore that.)",
