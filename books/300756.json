  "description": "Every killer has a weakness. She's the one woman I can't have. She's forbidden to the Bellandi men. Yet after one look in her honey eyes, I need to carve myself into her soul so deeply, Sadie will never forget she's mine. Nobody else sees through her fa√ßade. She's a mess of contradictions. Full of jagged edges that threaten to pull me apart at the seams and unleash the beast who lurks beneath my skin. I'll be her shelter through the storm. I can't resist her fire and rebellion. But when she's threatened by my enemies, I'll risk everything to keep her safe from the man who seeks to use her as a weapon against me. Even if it costs me my humanity. Shielded Wrongs is a full-length standalone novel, but the series presents a better listening experience when following the suggested listening order. This series contains dark elements, including an over-the-top antihero who does as he pleases. Please read at your own discretion.",
