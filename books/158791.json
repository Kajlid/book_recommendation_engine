  "description": "The currency is pleasure and the cost a surrender of power.Everything is built on fantasies here. There’s a surreal feeling in my bones like I’m a second away from waking up from the most vivid dream I’ve ever had. I’m not sure if I want to wake up and escape, or sleep forever and live here. And that is why everyone needs to know about him.Darko Aralica…one of the most dangerous tools in The Underground’s arsenal. He gets inside your head and switches off your inhibitions, cuts off all common sense. With him, I found myself doing things I’d never dreamed of doing—of even wanting to try. Darko found his way inside my fantasies and exploited them one by one. He appears cultured. Refined. A gentleman even. But that’s how he gets close enough to strike. And when you’re in his arms, it’s too late. Because you no longer care if damage is done. You’ll beg him not to stop taking you apart. My exposé will show everyone the truth.But the truth doesn’t always set you free.",
