  "description": "I’m not a hero. I’m a bad dude who’s done bad things. And the sooner she understands that, the better off we’ll be.  I’ve just got out of prison and I’m running from my MC, so my step-sister’s best friend has agreed to drive me across the country.  Summer’s my ride. That’s all. But she captivates me, and I don’t have a damn clue why. She’s a distraction I can’t afford.  Is it because I’ve been told she’s forbidden?  Is it because she’s preppy and freakin’ beautiful, so not a part of my world?  With every mile of our trip, every spark of connection, she seems to inch closer to me. The temptation is too much to resist.  But she has no idea just how dangerous life would be with me. I broke club rules. I betrayed my brothers to save a woman’s life. If the Red Dragons find us we’ll be in trouble. And if I give into my desires, she’ll be in deeper than she realises…  This is the first in the Red Dragon MC series featuring an addictive alpha biker. Guaranteed HEA, no cliffhangers and no cheating. Fans of Kristen Ashley, Joanna Wylde and Madeline Sheehan will fall in love.",
