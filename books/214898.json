  "description": "Savannah needs more protection than her police officer husband can provide when a portal to the unknown opens in their home and a negative force stalks her. While water sprays inexplicably inside the house, apparitions and ghostly figures become the norm. Just knowing that an evil presence could be not only in her house, but inside of her, scares the hell right out of her. Almost. It takes a lady with divine light to do that.",
