  "title": "The Identity Thief",
  "description": "X is an identity thief extraordinaire who steals the identity of the worst possible person! He soon becomes a fugitive, hunted by every intelligence agency in the world. The international adventures of this sardonic and amoral anti-hero combine the irony of The Third Man with the fast-paced thrills of The Bourne Identity. To survive, X must use his talent for deceit and his chameleon-like ability to adopt one persona after another, as his predicament becomes steadily more harrowing and the stakes mount. A former writer for the satirical tabloid The Weekly World News, C. Michael Forsyth peppers The Identity Thief with sly humor and delicious twists. His acclaimed novel Hour of the Beast was hailed by Horror Fiction Review as a \"fast-paced, rip-snorting, action-packed, sexy college romp.\" Critics called his epic romantic adventure The Blood of Titans \"an engrossing and well-crafted tale.\"",
