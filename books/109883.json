  "description": "“Psychiatrists and I; we do not get on well. They have failed to cure me; I am still damaged and it is for this reason that I am cheeky and certainly not pleasant. I am hurting. I just want them to fix me. Fix Me.”The Third Sunrise takes the reader into a world that is as terrifying as it is exhilarating: it depicts the life of a young woman who, at the age of twelve, was diagnosed with early-onset Bipolar Disorder and spent many years in a psychiatric hospital where she was prescribed cocktails of medications promising recovery. Recovery never found her, and frightened, she found something else: drugs and alcohol. They quickly become exactly what she needed− a brilliant, black, detour from reality.At the age of twenty she had devoted her life to addiction and it nearly killed her in the process. Escape wasn’t possible: she bathed in the darkness of cocaine, shook hands with heroin, and relished in the comfort of alcohol. She ceased to exist. The seizures she suffered at the hands of drugs, the abuse caused by those she invited into her life, and the pain she inflicted on herself and her family were lost to the underworld of drugs.The Third Sunrise is a confessional, darkly humored, account of life through the eyes of a woman fighting to find it.
