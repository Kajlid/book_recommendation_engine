  "description": "He intended to screw the enemy, not fall for her…  Jesse Jenkins is not the kind of man to settle down or follow rules. He does what he likes, and who he likes, whenever he likes. When the President of the Demons MC asks him for a favor, he figures it shouldn’t be too hard at all. Just seduce the rival president’s daughter, get the information they need, and get out.  Piper Rix doesn’t trust men easily and being the Hell’s Charter MC President’s daughter doesn’t help with her trust issues, either. She’s remained a virgin because no man wants a fat woman, and that’s how she sees herself. So when Jesse starts spending time with her, she’s suspicious of his intentions.  When Piper finds out the truth about being used, she’s heartbroken. But Jessie’s never been one to give up. He’s discovered his pretend feelings have become very real and he’s determined to claim the woman he loves for his own.",
