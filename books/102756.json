  "description": "They say that living is easy, but for Sydney London, each breath she takes feels like agony. Weighed down by a grief that all but shattered her young heart, her father sends her to live with his sister, hoping a different environment will re-ignite her enthusiasm for life.Knowing she needs to, Sydney struggles with letting go of the past, the painful scars slow to fade. When Adam Stone approaches with his confident smile and easy going personality, she takes one look at him and shrinks away. Everything about him screams danger--from his messy hair, ripped jeans, and lip ring. He wants friendship, but his eyes tell Sydney he wants something more, something she can't ... won't ever give another person again.The heart does interesting things when we least expect it, softening when all we want is to keep ourselves protected. Can Sydney keep Adam at arm's length? Or will he get close enough to see all her jagged edges?",
