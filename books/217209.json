  "description": "Being born to two vampire parents is rare. Rare and powerful. Special enough to attract the attention of the king.  Joy has been promised to the king of the vampires for as long as she can remember, and she wants nothing to do with him. She wants to find love, not be paired with someone because of her parentage. King Frederick has ignored her existence, until now. As her fiftieth birthday approaches, he sends the darkly delicious Sam to escort her to the bonding ceremony, which attracts unwanted attention.  Will Joy be able to fight her growing affections for Sam and keep her freedom?",
