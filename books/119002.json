Its controversial new reconstruction of events at Béal na mBláth may be shocking to some: yet demonstrably fits the known facts and eyewitness accounts.This is the first book dedicated to this famous \"cold case\" since John Feehan's landmark study of 1981. It presents the most complete overview of the evidence ever published; as well as an itemized catalogue of the various witnesses' mutual contradictions and corroborations.",
