  "description": "“We all live in particular places and at particular times, but when we act with family and friends to preserve a local slice of nature, we are, together, saving the planet.” — Natural History MagazineCan each of us, as stewards of our land, make an environmental difference that can be seen, felt, and measured? Scott Freeman emphatically says yes, and in Saving Tarboo Creek he explores how we can all do it by making small changes over time. Saving Tarboo Creek masterfully blends two stories of the Freeman family’s effort to reclaim a small patch of the one, a tale of the realities of rehabilitating a degraded fish run in what was once an old-growth watershed; the other, an account of human resource use over time and what that history means for the future. Based on the land ethics found in Aldo Leopold’s  A Sand County Almanac ,  Saving Tarboo Creek  is both a timely tribute to our land and a bold challenge to protect it.",
