  "title": "Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession",
  "description": "A look at one of the toughest jobs on earth, from the woman who perfectly captures life's humor and heartAnyone who thinks motherhood is easy has never had children. To care for children, a husband, and oneself is a superhuman task, and any woman who appears to be expert at doing all three simultaneously is not Supermom--she's a good actress. For three decades, Erma Bombeck chronicled motherhood's daily frustrations and victories. In this classic anthology, she presents all sorts of mothers, and even a stay-at-home dad, on good days and bad. With hilarious anecdotes and deep compassion, she shows that there is no other profession that demands so much, and rewards so highly. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Erma Bombeck including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author's estate.",
