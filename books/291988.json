  "description": "It started with a lie. A night of blurred lines between a teacher and a student.I wasn’t her student, yet it was the single most defining night of my life.I’ve never been the man she thinks I am.Most people have no idea about the life I’ve lived or the words that ring true when it comes to me—still waters run deep.But you’d be hard-pressed to find a coed on the TGU campus who knows otherwise…because I’ve never corrected them.The clock is ticking down, it’s Fourth and Inches with the ball inside the one-yard line and the focus is on me, The Guy on the Left. I’ve never felt like a football god, inside I’m…just Troy.It’s time to set the record straight.For my son, I‘ll find the strength.In her eyes, I’m determined to gain redemption.I will have them both, even if I have to take my eye off the ball.",
