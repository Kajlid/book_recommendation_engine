  "description": "Heavenridge is a small town nestled in the hills, removed from the maddening crowds of the bustling cities. A widow has been murdered in cold blood and the killer is careful enough to erase all clues. There are allusions towards blackmail, though some claim that the woman was insane.There are many questions, but the answers are hard to come by.A series of murders occur in a city, the brutality and the ingenuity of which stumps the investigators and the public alike. With Christmas round the corner, can one afford to let a killer run loose?The stories that constitute this book make the reader travel from the genres of suspense and thriller to wit and humour, social and moral to little snippets from slices of the journey we call life.Join Anita Singh as she tries to fathom what her teacher wants to say in \"Who's the Captain?\", attend Elizabeth Sanders' dinner party in \"French Wine\" or try to understand the protagonist's pain in \"The Bliss of Oblivion\" and \"The Next Best Thing\".Prepare yourself for a touch of the supernatural in \"Hot Chocolate\", \"The Package\" and \"The Diary\" or sink into old-fashioned teenage crush in \"To What We Once Were\" and \"Remember Forever\".More such stories await you amidst the pages--you just need to open the book.",
