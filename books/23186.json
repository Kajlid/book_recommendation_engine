  "title": "Ivanhoe",
  "description": "For Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832) the age of chivalry was 'a beautiful and fantastic piece of frost work, which has dissolved in the beams of the sun'. In Ivanhoe he recreates that age.The noble young Ivanhoe returns home from the Crusades to claim his inheritance and the love of Rowena, a princess of an ancient Saxon line, and becomes involved in the struggle between Richard Coeur de Lion and his brother John. Ivanhoe takes part in the splendid tournament at Ashby-de-la-Zouch, befriends Robin Hood, Friar Tuck and Robin's merry men, is loved and saved by the beautiful Jewess Rebecca and is forced to a dramatic trial combat with the fierce Templar Sir Brian de Bois-Guilbert.Crowded with incident and throbbing with vitality as it is, the triumphant success of this, Scott's most popular novel, is the author's own unflinching moral realism. In ensuring that all his characters remain true to themselves--despite the many glaring historical inaccuracies--he unfailingly spellbinds the modern reader.",
