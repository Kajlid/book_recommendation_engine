  "description": "Peter Koom isn't touring India; it's his calling to an oil-free environment where teleportation has brought nature and life closer, through a deeper understanding of the universe, the transition being effortless as God and science re-link in a non–science spectrum. Humans who’ve run up from wood, coal, hydro power and oil to nuclear fission, discover alternate resources to cope with eagle winged technologies. To avoid overheating and reduce emissions, they design semi-conductor chips that transfer information via photons; the sun being their free energy-source. East and West, North and South, science and religion, past and future, ions and bytes; cumulatively enliven the universe, while birth and death remain mysteries. Through god-men, who’re attuned to the universe via thought, time and timelessness, Peter discovers simple truths and ceases to speculate beyond the opaque wall that separates life and non-life, both being incarnate; a micro-macro-cosmic amalgamation of all subjects, objects and phenomena.",
