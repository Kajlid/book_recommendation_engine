  "description": "Tarot-reading artifact hunter Sara Wilde has had her share of tough assignments, but this one just might take the cake.  When her newest client hires her to steal a fertility idol from an Amazonian sex-and-death cult, she finds herself south of the equator and shoulder deep in true believers, while Rio de Janeiro gears up for the closing celebrations of Carnival.  Stealing the idol is one thing, however. Keeping it is another.  The arcane black market has drawn a host of cutthroat operatives and Sara’s now in their sights. In a race across one of the most colorful cities in South America on its most famed night of the year, Sara must navigate cunning enemies, backstabbing allies, a fifty-foot wedding cake float and a new, sensually mysterious contact who may be friend or foe… and whose name she’ll never learn if she doesn’t make it to dawn alive.  No matter what the cards predict, it’s going to be One Wilde Night.>",
