But secretly she was afraid. Her vampire rebirth was just around the corner. Any moment she would start dying. Yes, dying. There was no other word to describe it. And when she woke up, she would either be a psycho blood thirsty killer, a relatively normal vampire like Virgil, or she wouldn’t wake up at all. It could mean the end of everything for her. No pressure.Not to make a difficult situation worse, but Elizabeth is being followed. Someone else is interested to see how Elizabeth’s rebirth is going to go, and they aren’t willing to wait. Elizabeth and Virgil will have to face their toughest challenge yet. This will be a battle that will push everyone to their limits both mentally and physically.Will Elizabeth and Virgil finally get their Happy-Ever-After or has fate got another plan in store for them?",
