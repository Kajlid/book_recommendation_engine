  "description": "After the apocalypse, three Star Trek fans and their morbidly obese cat embark on a quest to save their beloved idol, the one and only William Shatner, from the hostile world America has become. But their journey will not be easy, for the wasteland is filled with cannibal cults, Klingon biker gangs, Zombie Borg, and all manner of mutant creatures. And once they arrive at their destination, they discover that William Shatner has been transformed into Shatzilla - a giant 100-story radioactive monster hell-bent on destroying all of Los Angeles. Now instead of saving Shatner from this new apocalyptic world, these three fans must save the world from this new apocalyptic Shatner. If only there was another giant monster who could take him down...  From the author who brought you the cult hit \"Shatnerquake,\" comes another Shat-tastic sci-fi comedy that proves once and for all that there actually is something even bigger than William Shatner's ego. And it is... William Shatner.",
