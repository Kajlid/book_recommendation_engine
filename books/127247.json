  "title": "Carbide Tipped Pens: Seventeen Tales of Hard Science Fiction",
  "description": "Carbide Tipped Pens is an anthology of new hard SF stories that follow the classic definition of the genre, in which some element of science or technology is so central to the plot that there would be no story if that element were removed. The aim of the editors was to collect stories which emphasize plot, character, science, originality and believability in equal measure, not only to entertain readers but also to educate and to return the sense of wonder of the Golden Age to a new generation of 21st Century readers.Contents:Blue afternoon that lasted forever / Daniel H.
