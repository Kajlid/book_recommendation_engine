  "description": "Two declarations of love. And a past that won’t set them free.\n\n\nAlexander \nI had rules. Krystina broke them. That’s just the way things were. But that didn’t mean I didn’t want to make her my wife. She exemplified the triskelion, representing my past, my present, and my future. Without her, I am nothing. But then the past returns to rear its ugly head. As it turned out, I wasn’t the only one with a secret. Everything I believed is nothing but a lie. The strangling grip of chaos squeezes until I can’t breathe. I don’t know who I am anymore.The only thing I can do is go back to being the man I once was—to the only place where I once knew control.\n\n\nKrystina \nAlexander was the glue holding my shattered soul together. This should’ve been one of the happiest times in my life, but the darkness still looms. I thought I knew the man I committed myself to but more questions continue to arise.I don’t know if Alexander is who he says he is.  It all happened so fast. Everything we fought so hard to overcome is threatened in the blink of an eye. Now I’m faced with a terrible decision: go against Alexander in order to save him or sit idly by and watch as his world shatters around him. No matter my choice, it could destroy the very thing our relationship was built on. Trust. \nThe heart-wrenching and seductive story of Alexander and Krystina concludes with Set In Stone, the powerfully moving finale to The Stone Series.",
