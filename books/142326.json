  "description": "Sera couldn’t stop thinking of what Jeff said the day she was attacked. But did he remember? And every day at work, and when they were together, she had a very hard time controlling the urge to pound that gorgeous head of his until he remembered...Book 2 of 3 ~Sera clearly remembered Jeff saying, “I’m here Sera. I’m not going anywhere.” His lips even quivered as he made an effort to finish, “We’re together baby, and you’ll never be alone again.”Well that was three months ago. And although she remembered those words being whispered in her ear as if it were yesterday, by his actions, it seemed like he had absolutely no recollection of any of it.Life went on as usual, except for the fact that Sera couldn’t stop thinking of what he said and wanted to pound his gorgeous head in until he remembered.Granted, it’s not like she was some great prize, and of course there was that small detail about her still being married and having four kids, but really? He had actually promised and was a man of his word, and she intended to hold him to it.The road is bumpy and tentative, but Sera and Jeff’s relationship gets more heated at every turn.Stand out themes in this series Family, Love, lots of humor, and making things... much better.",
