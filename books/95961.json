  "title": "Ploughing On",
  "description": "The third volume of poems by a well-travelled Scottish farmer. His roaming sensitivities catch a dying sparrow in the farmyard, a flight of pelicans in West Africa, speculate on the consequences of adultery, capture the eeriness of a Scottish night, implore America to keep strong during the banking collapse. And much more.",
