Arrogant playboy Kingsley Clayborne built a billion-dollar business at the expense of her father’s career and she wants justice…but a part of her also wants more… As a girl, Rayne loved King from a distance. Now, as a full-grown, hot-blooded woman, she finds being up close and personal, working for the subject of her fantasies, is torment!
