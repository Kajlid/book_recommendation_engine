  "description": "Hadrian's Memoirs is described by its author as a psychological novel and a meditation on history. In the form the narrative is a fictional autobiography written by the Roman Emperor Hadrian (76-138 A.D.) to his seventeen-year-old grandson, Marcus Aurelius, who eventually becomes emperor. In a tour de force of scholarship, which uses Hadrian's extant writings and the writings of his historians, friends, and enemies, the memoirs reconstruct Hadrian's complex, incandescent character, his cultivated mind, the news events that studded his dramatic career, and his thirty years of travel over the Roman Empire, then at its vastest extent, Missions of both war and peace took him to the furthest outposts; he reorganized Roman Britain and the frontier of the Rhine; he restored order on the Danube and achieved diplomatic triumphs in the Near East. Hadrian the man was uninhibited even according to the freer standards of his time, a lover of life whose enjoyments ranged from hunts in barbaric lands to the most sophisticated experiments in love, religion, art and literature in the great urban centers of Syria and Egypt, and in his cherished Athens.",
