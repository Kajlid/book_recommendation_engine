  "description": "Confronted with the most horrific murder scene she’s ever witnessed, superstar Atlanta homicide detective Suzanne Delacroix decides she’s had enough and, shockingly, quits. But that doesn’t keep her from investigating the murders that are eerily like cold cases of female twins spanning a century – and discovers she, too, is a player in the killers’ diabolical Game of Twins.Dean Koontz's mystery thriller, The Silent Corner, begins his edgy Jane Hawk detective series; in M.J Arlidge’s Eeeny Meeny thriller, Helen Grace chases a serial killer. Toss in some of Stephen King’s Salem’s Lot, and you get a flavor of the Game of Twins Books in the series are chronological, but each reads great as a standalone. Game of Twins, Game of Twins – Kidnapped, and Golden Frog Poison – Game of Twins are set in the present day. Game of Twins – The Special Agent is the prequel set in the era of J Edgar Hoover.",
