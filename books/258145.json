  "description": "Universal and timeless, Delia Ephron's How to Eat Like a Child is a delightful revisiting of the joys -- and tricky ploys -- of childhood. Made into a children's television special and a musical theater revue performed across the country each year, How to Eat Like a Child offers advice beyond the artful etiquette of food consumption. Ephron also teaches us \"How to Laugh Hysterically,\" \"How to Have a Birthday Party,\" \"How to Torture Your Sister,\" and much, much more. As the Washington Post Book World noted, `After the giggles of recognition have subsided, one thing will be very all adults are kids in grown-ups' clothing.\"",
