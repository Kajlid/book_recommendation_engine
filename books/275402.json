  "description": "A note from Audrey: Some series can be read out of order - this isn’t one of them. Start with Alpha and welcome to Ghost Mountain!  A baby alpha who absolutely doesn’t want to upend her pack—and is going to do it anyhow.  Kennedy is a badass and she knows it.  She’s also scared. That she’s too strong. Too fierce. Too much. That her pack won’t be able to hold her, no matter how much she wants to stay.  We’ll just see what her pack has to say about that.",
