  "title": "Tom Gates is Absolutely Fantastic [at Some Things]",
  "description": "This takes the form of Tom's battered homework diary - crammed with his doodles and stories. Exciting News! Mr Fullerman announces that class 5F are going on an 'Activity Break'! Which should be fun. As long as I don't ge stuck in a group with anyone who snores or worse still with ...Marcus Meldrew. Delia is already threatening to paint my room funny colours while I'm away. Which is annoying. I just hope the only surprise I hae when I get home is the new pet that I hear Mum and Dad talking about. Because I've always wanted a pet!",
