  "description": "THERE IS NO CREATURE SO MONSTROUS AS A HUMAN....On a morning like any other, Adam Walker must confront the end of everything. The people around him have turned into bloodthirsty monsters, and the world has become unrecognizable.  As everything falls apart around him, there’s only one person he knows he has to save at any  Sidonie Evans, the girl whose heart he broke.    Adam sets out into a nightmare landscape of death and devastation, cruelty and despair, desperate to find the one person in the world he cares about most--but navigating the landscape of his own damaged soul may be the most terrifying thing of all.  Sidonie never expected to see Adam Walker again, though she's never been able to stop thinking about him--or the night she lost him forever.  As she struggles for survival in a world gone dark, Sidonie has battles of her own to fight--both the kind that require a weapon and the kind that are fought in the heart.Adam and Sidonie are about to discover that there is no creature so monstrous as a human.  They’re about to discover what it means to have something to live for, and just how far they are willing to go for each other.        If this was the end, what would you do with it?",
