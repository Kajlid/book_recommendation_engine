He's in my bed one night and in the arms of someone else the next. And it's tearing me apart.I've done everything I can think of to make him mine, but the more I cling to him, the harder he pushes me away.

True to form, though, he's running.But I intend to go with him this time. I'm willing to leave my money, my family, my friends behind for this one last chance to see if he could ever really love me the way I deserve to be loved. I'm willing to sacrifice forever if it means one real moment with him.Each book in the Fairhope series can stand-alone, but you'll see updates on your favorite characters throughout each book, so read them in order to get the most out of the series!",
