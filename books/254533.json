  "description": "This book changed my life.- Someone who the author definitely didn’t pay to say that.This book is so good, it might be better than me.- Jesus.A love-sick Masai warrior, a princess turned scientist, and two cousins who have to save their families from illness, collide in a zany adventure with zebras, zombies, and Zambonis.(Okay, okay, there might not be Zambonis in East Africa, but you get the idea).Read the three interwoven stories that started the Snog Team Six adventure (and find out where Esmeralda the blind, East African, ninja assassin learned her fly moves).The Snog Team Six series is science fiction, fantasy, and humor mashed up in shameless—perfect—proportions. It’s a story of scrappy misfits caught up in a fight they didn’t pick but they will finish. Beyond the numerous comparisons to Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy and Harry Potter, it's adored by fans of Rick Riordan’s Percy Jackson and the Olympians; Jonathan Stroud’s Bartimaeus series; Hank Green’s Carl Saga; TJ Klune’s The House in the Cerulean Sea; Garth Nix’s Lefthanded Book Sellers; and Terry Pratchett’s Discworld. It’s irreverent, clever; full of humor and heart. You won’t be able to put it down.",
