  "description": "The Traveler of the South, as he has become known to some, is a modern day travelling musician. A bluesman who plays small bars to concert halls. Always sought after and hard to come by, not many know much about the mysterious drifter other than his signature sound and enigmatic personality. Perhaps it’s best they don’t, because bluesmen know trouble, and evil is never too far from their trail. For this bluesman, evil has shadowed him since he began to play the blues, drawn by siren song. It’s a life of enjoyment on stage, and a nightmare off of it.",
