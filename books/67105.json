  "description": "From award-winning author Megan Chance, Bone River is a haunting, lyrical tale of passion and identity. In the mid-19th Century, on Shoalwater Bay, Washington Territory, Leonie Monroe Russell works alongside her oysterman husband, Junius. At night she continues her father’s lifelong obsession—collecting artifacts and studying the native culture that once thrived in the area.On her thirty-seventh birthday, Leonie discovers a mummy protruding from the riverbank bordering her property—a mummy that by all evidence shouldn’t exist. As Leonie searches for answers to the mummy’s origins, she begins to feel a mystical connection to it that defies all logic. Leonie’s sense that otherworldly forces are at work only grows when news of the incredible discovery brings Junius’s long lost son, Daniel, to her doorstep. Upon his unexpected arrival, a native elder insists that Leonie wears a special shell bracelet for protection. But protection from whom? The mummy, or, perhaps, Daniel?Leonie has always been a good daughter and good wife, but, for the first time, these roles do not seem to be enough. Finding the mummy has changed everything, and now Leonie must decide if she has the courage to put aside the expectations of others to be the woman she was meant to be.",
