  "description": "He’s the one man I can never have, but the only one I crave…  Saxon Gray has reason to hate me. He spent five years in prison after saving me from a brutal violation at the hands of a rival motorcycle club – and he paid for that rescue with his freedom. I’ve never been able to settle the debt I owe him…until now.  The menace of that old rivalry is flaring up again, and as president of the Hellfire Riders, Saxon is the one man who can keep me safe. But I want more than his protection.  I want his heart.  WANTING IT ALL is a complete novella. No cliffhangers—only hot and sexy romance. The Motorcycle Clubs series is romance for readers who want all of the heat and emotion, but who don't have all of the time. Ella Goode, Ruby Dixon, and Kati Wilde are bringing you sweet and sexy romance with a new MC novella every month.",
