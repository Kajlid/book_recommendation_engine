  "description": "Abigail's dark and complex past brings to the surface a lot of mental and emotional barriers. This discourages her from trusting men and enjoying life, which includes going out with friends, meeting new people, and dating—and she hasn’t had sex in more than three years. That is until she meets Zach, an affluent businessman, who gives Abi a real taste of the darkness. Abi finds herself in a dark paradise with Zach, lusting and devouring every erotic moment, with some bumps and bruises along the way.",
