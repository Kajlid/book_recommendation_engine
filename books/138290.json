  "title": "Box Of Mustaches: The darkly funny, true story of how twin brothers survived their mother's madness",
  "description": "Box of Mustaches is the powerful, true story of identical twin brothers and how they coped with their mother's descent into madness.At first, Stanley and Jimmy Evans thought their mother was normal, but they soon discovered that her twisted views and mood swings were a result of her schizophrenia. And the mental illness was making her more dangerous by the moment. Their journey took them from orphanages to the television studio of a televangelist to a front-yard shooting that would liberate them from their nightmare. The fabled Box of Mustaches they pined for was really a fake facial hair kit advertised in comic books, but also their metaphor for the absurdity of adult life thrust upon them at a young age. Interlaced with shocking drama and dark humor, Box of Mustaches is an absorbing tale of survival. It is also a satirical look at the cynical, sex-charged, American culture of the '70s.",
