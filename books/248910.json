  "description": "A woman on fire...\n\nLucie survived four hellish years in prison, being sucked through a wormhole and crashing onto an alien planet. All she wants is to go home. Passion and rage burn in her. She wants her life back and nothing will stop her: not prison, not an alien planet and not three powerful aliens determined to claim her. They won't distract her with their smoldering embrace or fiery kisses...\n\nAlien men forged from fire...\n\nSarsen, Ertale and Asche spent the last thousand years waiting for release from their bonds. When the intriguing female bursts into their lives, she frees them from their unending servitude and ignites the fire in their heartstones. Now she thinks she can just leave them behind?\n\nNot acceptable!\n\n\n\nAll three will do whatever it takes to make Lucie understand that her body and her heart belongs to them!\n\n\n\n\nThe Valos of Sonhadra series is the shared vision of nine sci-fi and fantasy romance authors. Each book is a standalone, containing its own Happy Ever After, and can be read in any order.\n\nBlazing is a Reverse Harem story with three heroes and one lucky heroine, complete and no cliffhangers.",
