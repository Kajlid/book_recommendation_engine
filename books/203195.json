Living in the section of land occupied by her own species, Ness Kimler tries to be a normal teenager, worrying about her career and finding a mate—questions to be answered at her upcoming graduation. But before that happens, Ness accidentally crosses the Great Fence separating humans and Telumiras. For 200 years, the barrier has been in place, preserving the peace on a planet divided between two species. What she finds is that the Fence isn't just about keeping the aliens in—it's about keeping the humans out.And Ness Kimler just broke the rules.",
