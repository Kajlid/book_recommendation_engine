  "description": "They think they know me, but they have no idea. As a professional Domme, I see men and women come and go. But no one ever sticks around, and I like it that way. I have a secret to protect—at all costs. So when the cocky, handsome, and submissive Clay Bradley weasels his way into my heart, I do the one thing I’ve always excelled at. I push him away—forever. And like a good boy, he listens. But a few months later, during a chance encounter, he shows up again, but this time he isn’t alone. He has the stunning Jade on his arm. And she has a request of her own. She wants me to teach her. I should say no. Training a woman who makes my knees weak is bad enough. But this particular woman is dating the man who still has my heart. It’s a recipe for disaster. Made worse by one simple fact—they know my secret. And they won’t let go. But how can I protect what’s mine if I’m holding onto them too? Jade and Clay are the only ones who truly see me and the only ones who know… I’m so much more than Madame.",
