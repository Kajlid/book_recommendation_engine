So even when he commands her to bend over his desk for a spanking, Goldie doesn't resist. However, there's one thing she's refusing to do, and that's telling him how she truly feels about him. Bear shifter Larry can't get enough of his fated mate. Even at work, he can't seem to keep his paws off of her curvy body. His love for Goldie grows stronger by the day, and he wants nothing more than for her to feel the same way. Yet Goldie remains guarded with her heart. Then when she finds out about a secret he's been hiding, she pushes him even further away. Larry's on a mission to win Goldie back. He races to her apartment to try to make things right. But she's already gone by the time he gets there. Where did she go? Is she in some sort of trouble? Can Larry find Goldie in time to give her the fairy tale ending she craves? Although part of a serial, Goldie's Billionaire Bear comes with its own HFN ending.",
