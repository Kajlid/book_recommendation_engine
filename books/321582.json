  "description": "Children will really have to keep their eyes open and their wits about them if they want to see all the weird and wacky goings-on at the Hotel Splendide. That’s because the full moon seems to be having a strange effect on the hotel’s guests and the cook’s preparing slimy green sludge, a painted portrait is being very rude, the maid’s getting sucked up by a vacuum cleaner, and the sausages have grown feet! Every spread provides a deliciously open and comic view of all the hotel’s hijinks, while the rhyming text directs kids’ attention to some of the crazier antics. Young readers will have hours of enjoyment searching the incredibly detailed illustrations.",
