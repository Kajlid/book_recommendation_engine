  "description": "My Alpha mate and I are running out of timeIn a world where magic is power, I should consider myself blessed. I'm loaded with the stuff. Except I have no control over my new magic, and no idea what I really am. All I know is that I’m running out of time before my magic tears me apart.When a series of thefts reveals clues about my past, I must follow them. Unfortunately, the only way to save myself is to work side by side with Lachlan, the Alpha werewolf who is also my mate.The chemistry between us is insane, but if we fall for each other, the Dark Moon curse will steal his sanity. The only problem is—we can’t seem to resist each other. It seems we're damned if we do and damned if we don't.",
