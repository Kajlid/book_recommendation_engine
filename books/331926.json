  "description": "FordI’ve never thought much about Orson Naples.He’s a cute guy who I’d seen around town a few times, but then one day he up and left and didn’t reappear until a few years later. No one knows where he went or what he was doing, all this gossipy town knows is that he’s a widower, owns the florist, and is friends with that divorced group that hang out at the Killer Brew all the time.But then one day I step into his flower shop and go from rarely thinking about him, to him constantly being on my mind.There’s a restlessness to him that I’m dying to unlock answers to.And his eyes linger on me a little too long for a straight man …OrsonFord Thomas is a pest. A delightful one. A tempting one. But I’m too old for games.The ones I’ve played in the past have always led me to trouble which is why I vowed to settle down and live a quiet life.So when Ford walks into my shop all uncontained energy and flirty quips in a pair of heavy work boots, I know I should show him the door.I don’t need fun. I don’t need experiences.Especially when those experiences have me questioning things I thought I knew about myself.",
