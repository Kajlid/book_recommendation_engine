  "description": "Toby Garland understands contracts. As the best contract negotiator in the city, he’s built his life and his livelihood around his ability to push through any contract and seal any deal. All that amounts to nothing when Hudson Scott, the man he’s been fantasizing about for the last three months, offers him a BDSM slave contract in the middle of an office party. Faced with the most important negotiation he will ever undertake, all Toby has to do is think clearly and treat it like any other contract he’s worked on. But it’s not that simple. This isn’t just any contract. Hudson isn’t just any dominant. And thinking clearly through a sea of arousal and submission has never been Toby’s strongest point.",
