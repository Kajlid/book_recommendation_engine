  "description": "An adventure in Africa is just what Ace Stone desperately needs to finally pursue independent wealth and avoid questions from British and American Government Agencies relating to the illegal antics of his much needed, but shady client base. West Africa and the Sahara Desert bring sanctuary but a fierce heat of their own in more ways than one. Ace is taken aback by his spiritual connection to Africaâ€™s ancient warrior ancestors, which force him to examine and question his own existence. Ace later comes face to face with the extremely brutal side of greed and the darkest side of human nature in the conflict diamond trade of Sierra Leone, bringing to question the business of war and the consequences of his choices. The balancing act of freewill comes to a head as Ace must risk a path of self-destruction in order to stay at the top of his game.",
