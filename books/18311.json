  "title": "The Same Sex Controversy: Defending and Clarifying the Bible's Message About Homosexuality",
  "description": "In the guise of tolerance, Hollywood and modern culture have granted \"alternative lifestyle\" status to a behavior condemned by Scripture. In the Same Sex Controversy, the authors clarify and defend the Bible's stand on homosexuality as they expand on key passages. Subjects include the basis of biblical morality, biblical teaching on marriage and sexuality, the new \"homosexual apologist,\" and both Old and New Testament witnesses against homosexuality. They also provide information on how to lovingly and biblically reach out to those caught up in its grip.",
