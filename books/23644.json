  "description": "One nation indivisible...until now.Off the coast of Indonesia, an American cargo ship has been seized by terrorists, its captain kidnapped and its crew mercilessly slaughtered. In Washington, a peace-loving President's refusal to punish the transgressors has enraged the sitting Congress, led by a determined Speaker of the House.An ambitious young congressional assistant, Jim Dillon has discovered a time bomb hidden away in America's Constitution- a provision that could be used to wrest power from the Chief Executive; a long-forgotten clause that could incite a devastating constitutional crisis...and plunge the country into chaos.Now, as a battle group steams toward a fateful confrontation in the Java Sea-commissioned by Congress and opposed by the President- Dillon finds himself in the center of a firestorm that rages from the highest court in the land to the killing fields half a world away. And, suddenly, there is much more at stake than the life of a single surviving hostage and a superpower's military credibility -- as a great nation prepares for war...against itself.",
