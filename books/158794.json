With tousled brown hair, eyes the color of a cloudless blue sky, and a maintained scruff covering his chiseled jawline, he has that look about him that’s bad boy and good guy mixed together. Oh, and he’s a porn star. While Kayden is dealing with a debt owed to a drug dealer, her job, and her kids, Steele is relentless in his pursuit of her. She can’t compete with his lifestyle, but she’s not sure if she can protect her heart enough to withstand his charm. Will their lives play out with a happily ever after like in the movies? Or will they have to face the challenges of love in the real world?",
