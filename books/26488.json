  "description": "Armed with the love of a good man, Jess Hamilton, Tamra Banks has made the difficult decision to reconcile with her estranged mother. Over the years, Tamra has had to fight through the ugly memories of her abusive childhood, the complete absence of her father, and her mother's angry reaction to Tamra's conversion to the Church. When the encounter with her mother goes badly. Memories and doubts threaten to suffocate Tamra with long-buried emotions. In a swirling tide of confusion and distrust, the confidence Tamra feels about her relationship with Jess quickly dwindles in the face of her growing doubts. With my background and upbringing, am I worth of Jess's love, after all? Volume II in Anita Stansfields's stunning series, Gables of Legacy, explores the powerful grasp of a horrible childhood, the guiding light of the gospel, and the healing that comes when you learn to forgive others, and yourself.
