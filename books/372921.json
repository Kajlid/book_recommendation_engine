  "description": "When Roger Duvoisin first introduced children to his proud and silly goose, Petunia, in 1950, it was love at first sight. Those children have grown up, but Petunia is every bit as fresh and funny and muddled as the day she was born.In this, the first of the series of classic books featuring the silly goose, Petunia finds a bookâ€”and, deciding that if she owns a book she must be wise, dispenses hilariously mistaken advice to the other animals inthe farmyard.With its gentle lesson and the kind of humor that kids love best, this new edition of a beloved classic will delight and inspire a whole new generation of readers.",
