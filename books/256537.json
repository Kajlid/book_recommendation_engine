  "title": "Chronicles of Nartesis Shazarack: Father of Necromancy",
  "description": "High Lord Nartesis Shazarack has long been remembered as New Cronoa's heinous Father of Necromancy. Some have heard rumors that he was so powerful that he defied death itself. But only a handful are aware that without his vision, both villainous and heroic, the valiant Dragonbonded--even dragons themselves--would never have existed. It is time to set this story straight.â€‹Set in the same world as \"The Dragonbonded Return\" series, this dark fantasy novella chronicles the life of the man who, for better or worse, directed the course of New Cronoa's history.While not required, this book is best when read after completing the first two books in the Dragonbonded Return series: Call of the Dragonbonded and Order of the Dragonbonded.",
