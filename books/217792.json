  "description": "Photocopying and coffee making isn't exactly every girls dream…. Sylvie Embers is really starting to resent her job. After appealing to her boss for something a little more challenging than “how many sugars would you like in that?” She gets an offer she can't, but should refuse. After struggling to find a suitable candidate for a big project and even bigger money spinner, her boss enlists an unprepared Sylvie.  What she never expected was to be asked to go on the road for twelve months to write a book on the infamous rock band, Twisted Temper. Notorious for their police records, off stage antics, less than clean living, and well…Twisted tempers, Sylvie begrudgingly agrees to join the band on tour and is catapulted into a world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll.  Struggling to find her feet in her new surroundings isn't helped by the obnoxious and bad-mannered lead guitarist Jamison Rivera, who seems to relish in making her life harder than it already is. Unpleasant, intimidating, dark, and so, so beautifully male, Jamison takes an instant dislike to the curly haired writer……Or so she thinks.  She should run because everybody knows, oil and water never did mix….",
