  "description": "When a divorce attorney attempts to break off a torrid affair with his client, he finds himself in cleverly woven web of deceit. This is an erotic, suspense, short story of approximately 4500 words. She sauntered into my law office with an unlit cigarette and a venomous grin that would make a black widow blush. Her silky darkened hair fell across her sweet softened shoulders, moving effortlessly, back and forth with a flow that mimicked her hips.",
