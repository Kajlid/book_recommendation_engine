  "description": "Welcome to Darmid, where magic is a sin and fairy tales are contraband. Taking an interest in magic is dangerous for any Darmish citizen, but doubly so for the daughter of a magistrate responsible for sending magic-users to the gallows. Rowan Greenwood knows her curiosity can only get her into trouble, but it’s an itch she can’t stop scratching—even when a potentially life-changing proposal arrives from a wealthy and powerful magic hunter. Rowan believes she has no choice but to follow the path laid out for her, until the day she accidentally saves the life of one of her people’s most feared enemies—a Sorcerer prince from the magical land of Tyrea who’s convinced Rowan is far more than she seems. Her act of compassion rips her from the sheltered life she’s known and draws her into a world of magic that’s more seductive and more dangerous than she ever could have imagined… and that leads her to question everything she thought she knew about her home, her family, and herself.
