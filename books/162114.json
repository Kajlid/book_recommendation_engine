  "title": "Leila, A Mother in Zarahemla",
  "description": "\"Based on the Book of Helaman in the Book of Mormon, this fictional tale is about the wife of the Prophet Nephi. We know very little about her, except she was frequently left at home, and raised two extraordinary men who also became prophets.    Leila faces her time alone raising her children with courage and faith. Her knowledge of the gospel and relationship with God help her fulfill her mission as a prophet’s wife, mother, and caretaker of the property and records she and Nephi inherited through Alma.    As she raises her children and faces the challenges of being forced to leave Zarahemla because of war, she saves a newborn colt from death. The relationship she develops with the horse becomes vital to her family’s mission.    Later, she finds a young, starving, Lamanite slave named Samuel. She frees him, raises him as her own and teaches him the gospel. His appetite for knowledge of Jesus Christ is unquenchable.    In spite of numerous challenges from the wickedness of her people, she creatively finds ways to serve others. She knows the importance of seeking and obeying the promptings of the Holy Spirit to guide them through hard times.\"",
