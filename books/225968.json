  "description": "A year ago, baseball player Blair Saxon was enjoying his Major League Debut. Today, he’s wasting away on a west coast beach, the victim of a 95-mile per hour fastball to the head. He’s direct, abrasive, and speaks without filters, so it’s understandable that the police don’t want his help. When the killer gets too close, Saxon turns to his one remaining friend, Megan, the only one who will tolerate his strange ideas and strange desires. Together as amateur detectives, they do what the police detectives can't, they find suspects. But are they resourceful enough to keep themselves alive?",
