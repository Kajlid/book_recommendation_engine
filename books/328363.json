  "description": "(excerpt)FOREWORDI remember it well as if it were yesterday. I was ten years old when my father took me to a performance of the dancing dervishes in Konya. I was fascinated by the elegance of their movements as if they were floating. But, to be honest, I did not know how to classify my impressions at that moment. It was just too much. On the one hand, I was deeply impressed and touched; on the other hand, I was afraid (today, I would call it awe). In any case, my visit at that time left lasting impressions. So much so that they keep coming back to my mind.Rumi's poems and quotations are omnipresent. They appear everywhere and one cannot escape their depth, beauty and meaning. They are a part of great human creativity and remind us repeatedly how powerful (in a positive sense) words can be.This little booklet is addressed to all who believe in beauty, love, mindfulness and the power of words. May Rumi's words touch you as they have always touched me and be a companion for a fulfilling and inspiring life.Murat Durmus",
