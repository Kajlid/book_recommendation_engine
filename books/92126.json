  "title": "Giovanni's Light: The Story of a Town Where Time Stopped for Christmas",
  "description": "Ryland Falls wasn't paradise, but there was a certain storybook quality about the town that made visitors catch their breath. As in a book, the order of the stories never changed. On December first, the Chamber of Commerce always hung out the \"Yuletide Greetings\" banners, the plastic Santa Claus went back on the top of the firehouse roof, and grumpy Diane at Elwood's Market started wearing her set of imitation reindeer antlers. Yet on this particular Christmas, there were signs that the order of things would change. And when it did, the people in Ryland Falls never celebrated Christmas the same way again. The Christmas spirit is alive and well in this inspiring story about the redeeming power of the imagination and the true nature of compassion.",
