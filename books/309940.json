  "description": "Life’s too short for regrets. I learned that day after day working with patients living and dying with cancer. They all told me the same thing. Stop being afraid of living my life and grab it by the balls.So, I listened. I stopped wondering when my boss was going to notice me. I stopped wishing he would see me as more than just his nurse. I stopped declining dates with other men in hopes Nico would one day ask me out.I am not so evolved that I actually stopped hoping something would happen, but I had to move on. People were dying with regrets, and I couldn’t live with mine.I never thought dating other men would make Nico notice me. I never expected him to be pissed off. And I sure as hell never thought he’d be jealous.But I definitely liked that side of him. The side that said he wanted me. It wasn’t going to be that easy, though. He needed to work for it. One kiss, one touch, one panty-melting word at a time.",
