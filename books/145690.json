  "description": "The novel of adventure on the high seas has more fans today than at any time since the days of C. S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels. And the Grand Admiral of the genre is, without question, Philip McCutchan, author of nearly one hundred novels. One of his most popular and enduring characters is Commodore John Mason Kemp, the leader of a convoy of ships traveling the rocky and dangerous seas of World War II. In Convoy South Commodore Kemp faces danger at sea and in the murky waters of international politics as he leads a group of threatened ships from Australia to the United States.With high suspense, heart-pounding battle scenes, and a true storyteller's command of character, McCutchan has rendered in the Convoy series one of the high points of modern adventure writing.",
