  "description": "Overcome by the weight of his own failure to live up to the world's standard of success, to the point where he no longer cares about his own life, Ballard Davies decides that there is only one solution. He gets in his car and drives. He drives away from everything and everyone that he knows, in an effort to just start over. He doesn't care where he's headed; he just wants another chance to get it right. What he finds is beyond his imagination, as he befriends an exciting and eccentric cast of characters. From the divinely inspired to the rationalistic blowhards, everything is suddenly new for him. But there is one problem. He still cannot escape himself. What will it take for Ballard to overcome his own self-imposed limitations and live the adventure he feels he deserves? This is the journey he now travels, down a path where truth, love, desperation, honor, the forgiving and the righteous, the mystics and the scientists all battle for the chance to be given the foremost spot in the realm of his mind. Will the pain of loneliness and separation prevail, or will Ballard find something to live for. Of Mind or Matter can be purchased here: http://www.amazon.com/Of-Mind-Matter-...",
