  "description": "Phoebe Sherwood is in love with the perfect man. Well, except for the fact that he's in love with someone else. But Phoebe isn't the type to let a little detail like that keep her from getting what she wants.And as she's plotting how to get him back, she meets the perfect solution--Joe Spencer. The city boy is in town to retrieve his sort-of fianc√©--the woman who stole Phoebe's man-- and when he hears Phoebe's plan to reclaim their respective soul mates, he's in.Bright and sparkly. That's Joe's first impression of Phoebe. He's always been attracted to sparkly things--like neon casino signs, sequined evening gowns and Porsches. In fact, his affinity for those things, and the trouble they can cause, are exactly why he's determined to change his habits and settle down.But if he's going to win his girl back, he's going to need to learn a new way of life. Country line dancing, guzzling homemade moonshine and getting rid of his custom-made suits are what it takes to fit into Sapphire Falls... and he's got some work to do.Thank goodness Phoebe is the perfect coach.And everything will be just fine... as long as they can keep their hands off of each other and remember which hearts they are trying to win over.You should read this book if you like quirky small towns, over-the-top romantic gestures, hot descriptive love scenes, naughty words and country music. You should *not* read this if you don't like, well, any of the things above.SAPPHIRE FALLS SERIESGetting Out of Hand, book oneGetting Worked Up, book twoGetting Dirty, book three",
