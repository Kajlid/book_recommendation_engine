  "title": "Big Curmudgeon: 2,500 Outrageously Irreverent Quotations from World-Class Grumps and Cantankerous Commentators",
  "description": "The author of the wildly successful Portable Curmudgeon and Portable Curmudgeon Redux outdoes himself in the biggest collection yet of acid wit and wisdom cunningly collected from sardonic savants of every stripe.A curmudgeon is defined as 1. A crusty, ill-tempered, churlish old man; 2. Anyone who hates hypocrisy and pretense and has the temerity to say so; or 3. anyone who points out unpleasant facts in an engaging and humorous manner. The Big Curmudgeon is the richest collection yet of curmudgeonly commentary, combining all of the material from the bestselling Portable Curmudgeon and Portable Curmudgeon Redux , plus selections from A Curmudgeon’s Garden of Love —and lots of brand-new quips, quotations, and wisdom freshly collected by compiler extraordinaire, Jon Winokur.Arranged alphabetically by subject and featuring special sections on such world-class grumps as H.L. Mencken, John Simon, W.C. Fields, and Dorothy Parker, the book is the last witty word on all things cynical, snide, and hilariously grouchy.Equally suited to the \"humor\" and \"reference\" sections, The Big Curmudgeon is filled with the pithiest, smartest things ever said by the wittiest people who ever lived.",
