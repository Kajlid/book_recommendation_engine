  "description": "(This is a Xianxia tale. If you like stories of this genre then you will definitely like God Slayer Vol.1. Kindly read beyond chapter two before giving up on my book. The first two chapters have a lot of info and less action which makes them a little boring. Things get interesting from chapter three onwards.) A contract killer reincarnates into a foreign world. In his new life, he learns the meaning of family and love. He had already decided to become invincible in his new life to make sure that he didnâ€™t face the same predicament as in his former life and to keep his loved ones safe from all sorts of harm. He wished to become the master of his own destiny.",
