  "description": "On the Texas-Mexico border massive amounts of drugs pass the border and flood the United States to try to satisfy the insatiable appetite for drugs. The Texas Equalizers are a highly trained anti-drug force created to break up the gangs running drugs in the Texas area. Led by John Wittier, his small team wrangles up the drug dealers and takes down crime but John Wittier wants a part of the profits. Justin Lee, a Texan, and a small time drug dealer knows the risk involved in dealing but he doesn't want to be left out of the modern day gold rush. He wants to stay small time because that's where it's safe, no unwanted attention. He tried to stay small but due to a botched robbery he no longer has that luxury. John Wittier now has him in his sights and will use Justin to get his plan rolling. Unfortunately that botched robbery brings out an enforcer for the Cartel turning the state into a warzone. This leaves no one safe, not Justin, not even the cops. As the city burns John Wittier and his team have to get the enforcer before the enforcer catches up with them.",
