  "description": "As much as Rykal thought she was sheer perfection in that outfit, he wanted to flick out a claw and gently slice the garment from top to bottom so he could pay homage to her naked form. Later. She wouldn’t escape his tender clutches. But he would behave himself for now, because this particular outing was apparently an important event in Human culture. He was about to meet the mother of his mate.  * * *   The Earth Files are short stories (novella-length) set in the world of the Dark Planet Warriors. You can expect sweet, steamy, and offbeat stories about the colorful characters from the main series. They are intended as accompaniments to Dark Planet Warriors, and may contain the occasional spoiler. Book 1 features Arin and Rykal, our protagonists from Forged in Shadow. It's set after Brilliant Starlight (Book 8), when the Kordolians have returned to Earth.  Although it’s a spinoff, it isn’t the spinoff. That’s coming soon.",
