  "description": "On the back of a bad break-up, the beat-up tourist suddenly finds himself all alone in Argentina with only an abundance of beer for company.With no plans, no time limit and sometimes no sense, the nameless British beatnik travels through a blur of smoky bars, sexy se√±oritas, lonesome backpackers, small town locals, city dwellers, magnificent mountains and awe-inspiring waterfalls, whilst being guided by the mysterious 11:11 Phenomenon.Not only does the tourist roam around Argentina, he also finds himself unexpectedly crossing the borders to Paraguay, Chile and Brazil, where drunken adventures and spiritual insights await him.Set in 2011, this true story reads almost like fiction. Written in a unique and distinctive style and told in a tangle of cut-up twisted timelines, Route Number 11 is a beat-driven, beer-drinking, drug-taking, chica-chasing, soul-searching, backpacking bonanza of a book which, if nothing else, will make you never want to experience the awfulness of reggaeton music.",
