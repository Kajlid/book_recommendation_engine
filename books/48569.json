  "description": "The House of the Worm is a collection of stories by Gary Myers. The book is a stylistic pastiche of H. P. Lovecraft and Lord Dunsany, and may be seen as an expansion of Lovecraft's Dream Cycle. While presented as a novel of the Cthulhu Mythos, it is, in fact, a collection of linked stories.Contents:IntroductionThe House of the WormYohk the NecromancerXiurhnPassing of a DreamerThe Return of ZhosphThe Three EnchantmentsHazuth-KlegThe Loot of GolthothThe Four Sealed JarsThe Maker of Gods",
