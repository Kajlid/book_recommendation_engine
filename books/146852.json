  "title": "The Bone Treaty",
  "description": "A power as old as King Solomon awakens when a seventeen-year-old girl marks the brooding hot abductor ordered to seize her. Addie Heaton's not your average high school student. Orphaned at two, she's spent most of her life reading the emotions of others. It's a little trick she likes to call color-vision. But lately, a stranger has been trailing her, putting off shades of black and red-colors Addie hasn't seen since the night her parents were killed-colors Addie never wanted to see again. But when Addie comes face to face with Conal Reed, owner of the terrifying shades, she learns her stranger's a little different too. He's brooding hot, mysterious, and all too elusive. Conal loves to materialize, and then vanish at all the wrong times. Nice. Not. After years of keeping her ability a secret, Addie's found another person with gifts, someone who may know what she really is. But Conal's not talking. He's having more fun showing up uninvited, teasing her senses, and disappearing at all the wrong times. Instead of finding answers, Addie finds herself reconsidering ever being alone and naked again.",
