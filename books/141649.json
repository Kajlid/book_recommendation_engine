But, for what? Drugs? Snuff films? Dirty money? Contract killings?Inspector Zinc Chandler of Special X thinks he knows.Is there a connection between London's orgy of killings and Vancouver's underworld sleaze?The answer could lie in the dark obsessions and twisted Cthulhu Mythos fantasies of an old Rhode Island family whose tainted past will not lie quiet in its grave.",
