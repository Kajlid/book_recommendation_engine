  "description": "Katherine Lillian Fitz has survived her first year in the the magical world. But a New Enemy has picked up the fight that Wesley Solomon lost. Raven Ebony seeks to destroy Katy just as her brother did, and she just might have her chance. As Katy lets her family know what really happened in the dungeon for death, Katy may have just lost the will to fight. But when it seems all hope is lost, and Darkness has spread, a small shimmer of light can be all she needs to do things she must do, to save those she loves with her heart, her life, her soul. Which may end up being the cost of this war.",
