  "description": "Can two remarkable people overcome supernatural forces beyond their control?When Errol Fleming moves in across the hall from Andie McNaughton, little does she know that her life is about to take another unforeseen and perilous turn. Sweet, shy, and a bit reclusive, Andie has enough phobias to confirm that she's \"crazy.\" A popular high-school teacher, Errol bears his own \"imperfection,\" which makes him more sympathetic to Andie's disability. Despite the challenges their relationship faces, they decide to take a chance on each other...and the possibility of a future together. Then Andie starts hearing a voice and dreaming about \"Noah,\" whom she encounters on a mystical tropical island. The handsome stranger--who claims to know Andie--dismays her at first, and then fascinates her. She begins having visions of Noah and traveling in her mind to the island, where she discovers unexpected connections and a sense of inner peace. Errol's haunting dreams about the island and Noah's obsession with Andie only add to the mystery of what's happening...Is Noah a figment of Andie's imagination? Or does he exist in an alternate reality? More important, can Errol save Andie from Noah and the idyllic world she's escaped to? Or will he lose her to her phantom lover, forever?",
