  "title": "Whatever It Takes",
  "description": "Although the London of the early 1950's holds its attractions, and love is blossoming between Lisa and her fellow trainee schoolteacher, Liam, Lisa stills nurtures resentment towards her Dad, who exiled her there from Sydney, leaving her in the care of her grandmother six years before. But when the widowed father who abandoned her announces that he will be marrying again -- this time to his flighty secretary, Eleanor -- he asks Lisa to return to Sydney to be a bridesmaid. How will Lisa deal with this, given the likelihood of her once again meeting up with her first love, the newly-separated, handsome Josh? What other complications will life dish out to her?",
