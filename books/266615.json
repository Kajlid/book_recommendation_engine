  "title": "The [Alien] Nanny for Christmas",
  "description": "Hi. I’m Gwen. I’m a single mom to two growing boys—and now I’m the brand new owner of an alien whose greatest wish in life is to become a live-in nanny. It’s been kind of a weird day. I wholeheartedly recommend adding an alien to your household though. He cooks, he cleans—and the kids love him. But three things you should know if you’re going to keep a seven-foot-tall alien in your basement? You might want to invest in flameproof cookware. He will think of you as his planet’s equivalent of a princess. And my alien is totally stealing my underwear.  **This is a sweet Standalone Novella. Note: Explicit language and adult scenes are contained in this book.  ***Heads up for readers of the Stolen series: this is an interconnected standalone, so hop in and have some fun “Ha!” moments with me!",
