  "description": "NOFX: The Hepatitis Bathtub and Other Stories is the first tell-all autobiography from one of the world’s most influential and controversial punk bands. Alongside hilarious anecdotes about pranks and drunkenness and teenage failures—featuring the trademark NOFX sense of humor—the book also shares the ugliness and horror the band members experienced on the road to becoming DIY millionaires. Fans and non-fans alike will be shocked by the stories of murder, suicide, addiction, counterfeiting, riots, bondage, terminal illness, the Yakuza, and pee…lots and lots of pee. Told by each of the band members (and two former members), NOFX looks back at more than thirty years of comedy, tragedy, and completely inexplicable success.  Available as an audiobook for the first time, read by band members \"Fat Mike\" Burkett, Eric Melvin, Erik \"Smelly\" Sandin, and Aaron \"El Hefe\" Abeyta along with special guest narrator musician and comedian Tommy Chong. In addition, the audiobook features exclusive, previously unreleased tracks, \"Bouncy\" (a NOFX instrumental), \"La Pieta\" (Fat Mike piano & vocal song about his mother), and \"Young Drunk & Stupid\" (live NOFX song from an Idaho basement gig in 1986)Narrated by: NOFX, Jello Biafra, Tommy ChongLength: 12 hrs and 32 mins",
