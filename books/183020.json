  "description": "New York City Jazz explores many of the haunts and hideaways that have played host to iconic jazz musicians and singers like Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Bill Evans, Billie Holiday, Dizzy Gillespie, and Lester Young. Considered the jazz capital of the world, New York City is known for its flashy venues. The stages of the Latin Quarter, Apollo Theater, Minton's Playhouse, Onyx, Stork Club, Downbeat Club, Birdland, Roseland, and Copacabana came to life with the sounds of pianos, drums, horns, and gypsy guitars. This collection of images presents why Fifty-second Street was nicknamed \"Swing Street\" and how musicians made timeless names for themselves in the Empire City.",
