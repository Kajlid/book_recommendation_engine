  "description": "The small ant who created a BIG sales sensation is on the march again! Anthony Ant first became a children’s phenomenon in the early 1990s, when The Amazing Anthony Ant sold 120,000 copies in the U.S. alone. Now, Anthony’s back in a new, simple book full of fun clues, deceptive details, elaborate mazes, and entertaining rhymes. Children will find it irresistible.   Lorna and Graham Philpot have been a successful creative team for some 20 years. Graham's work is respected around the world, not just for his children’s book illustrations but also for his cartoons.",
