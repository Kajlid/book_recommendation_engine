  "description": "Sensible women do not believe in love at first sight. And Jane Nash is one sensible woman (well, most of the time). But when her eyes--and lips--land on a complete stranger at a baseball game, Jane feels like she's hit a grand slam as the crowd roars its approval. However, in the chaos of the stadium, she loses Mr. Perfect in a throng of fans and foam fingers. Determined to find him again, Jane sets off on a mission for that baseball fan of her dreams. Suddenly, she gets a crash course in Karma, learning quickly that Karma's one tricky wench. But Karma has plans of her own--and Jane is about to get everything she's ever wanted--and nothing she ever expected.",
