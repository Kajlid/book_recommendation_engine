  "description": "A stunning novel about celebrity and the price of fame from a Pulitzer-shortlisted playwright and the creator of hit series SMASH. So you want to know how to become famous? STEP 1: Get your photo taken for the New Yorker, along with your incredibly beautiful red-haired sisters. STEP 2: Watch as your face is plastered all over Times Square and New York goes crazy over you. (Why? Don't ask me.) STEP 3: Learn to fight off the paparazzi who are camped outside your school. Older brothers, especially seemingly invisible ones, are useful here. STEP 4: Pretend to be interested in letchy old filmstars at glitzy parties and don't let them realise you would rather be doing your homework. But, take a tip from me, Amelia, so-called IT Girl, fame is NOT all it's cracked up to be. All those glamorous parties are really just full of neurotic women studiously avoiding the canap√©s. Being followed by hoards of men with cameras can seriously threaten your social life. And no-one listens when you tell them that you never wanted all this in the first place. One bit of advice I would give you, and it's an important one so please whatever you do don't do what I did and BITE the most famous filmstar in the world. It won't look good, believe me, and it'll get you into all kinds of trouble.",
