  "description": "IGNITED is a new adult, contemporary romance intended for adult readers.  James “Hawk” Hawkins always knew he’d be a firefighter. At twenty-four years of age, he’s dedicated his entire adulthood to the perilous job of saving lives and extinguishing flames. After a chance encounter, he carries a young woman to safety, but it’s unlike any rescue he’s ever performed. She touches something deep inside of him, not because he finds her attractive, which he does, but because she doesn’t want to be saved. For the first time in his life, he doesn’t need to put out a fire…he needs to start one.  Twenty-year-old Amber Lawson escaped to the small town of Creekview, Tennessee. She was running…fleeing from a tragedy that left her heartbroken and shrouded in despair. Struggling with the desolation that has engulfed her, she tries to start anew, hoping that if she evades the reminders of her past, she can slowly begin to heal.  Hawk is determined to rekindle her passion for life. Along the way, he realizes that’s not the only passion he wants to ignite. With his heart on the line, it could be his most hazardous rescue yet.  Plus, a bonus scene from Mason and Lexi of WASTED.  IGNITED is the second book in the WHISKEY NIGHTS series. Since each book focuses on a different couple, they can be read as stand-alones, but many readers may prefer to read them in order for maximum enjoyment.
