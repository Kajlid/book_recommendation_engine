  "description": "“Delicate paper-cut illustrations provide a lovely, solemn backdrop to the King James Bible’s account of the Nativity story” in this delightful book (Publishers Weekly).Deeply reverent and richly detailed, Pamela Dalton’s exquisite scissor-cut illustrations follow The Story of Christmas from the appearance of the Angel to the shepherds who came from the fields, and to the three wise men who followed the star to pay respect for their new king. Working in a Pennsylvania-German folk-art tradition, with lovingly rendered animals and figures, Pamela Dalton has created a book that takes a deserved place among the finest celebrations of Christmas.A New York Times Book Review 10 Best Illustrated Children’s Books of 2011",
