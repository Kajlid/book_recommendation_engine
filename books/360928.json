  "description": "'I was very clear about my future from here - first, nail my floor routine; next, qualify for the state squad, and finally, compete at the Australian Championships. It was all so sharp - my path lit with a spotlight that put everything else in dreary shadows.'Jade is a girl who knows what she wants. She knows how to get it too. But when a knee injury interrupts her plans, she feels lost and unsure. It's a bad time to get her annoyed. When a sexist remark gets her blood boiling, Jade thinks she's found something to fight for. If she sets up a race to prove that girls aren't soft, then maybe she'll also prove to herself that she can still find The Zone. But will her single-minded approach to proving her point win her the race, and the boy? Or will she learn that maybe - just maybe - winning isn't everything?",
