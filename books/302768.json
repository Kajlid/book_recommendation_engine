  "title": "Agent in Place",
  "description": "This sophisticated narrative of spy/counterspy is set in Washington, where the Russians have planted an \"agent in place.\" For nine years he has worked himself quietly into the fabric of government and society. Dedicated and patient, he has everyone's respect. It is a plot where amateurs are the villains and professionals are the heroes -- particularly a team of British and French agents whose job is to foil further Russian intervention. The story moves from Washington to New York to Menton on the French Riviera, where it concludes in a series of stunning revelations, dismaying setbacks and breathless discoveries.",
