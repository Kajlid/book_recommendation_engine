  "description": "Alice in Wonderland is the most famous and one of the most enchanting children's books of all time. Less well-known is the story of how Lewis Carroll came to write it; and almost completely unknown is the original version, Alice's Adventures Under Ground , which Carroll wrote and illustrated as a gift for young Alice Liddell. The manuscript, beautifully handwritten and illustrated in a charming naive style, was sold from one collector to another, until 1948, when it was given as a gift to the British Museum. In its 130-year history, several facsimiles have been made, but until now, none has done justice to Carroll's original. For this edition, the entire manuscript was photographed in color and reproduced with precise fidelity to the original. An enchanting evocation of the world of Lewis Carroll, offering a rare insight into this most enduring of children's stories.",
