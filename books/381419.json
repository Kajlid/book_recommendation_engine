Now she's stuck at the beach entertaining kids while everyone else is having a glamorous summer. Will she ever get a life?Then she meets Starla, a mind-bogglingly beautiful lifeguard whose diva attitude, dangerous obsessions, male admirers and cringe-worthy blog supply Irene with enough real-life drama and romance to fill a book.
