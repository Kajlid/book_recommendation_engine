  "description": "Snowfed Waters is a moving and uplifting story set amidst the Himalayas. It is a tale of two cultures, of false assumptions and of the gradual dawning of self awareness.Sonia Swayne’s life is in bits. With her self esteem at rock bottom she decides to flee England - and go to work for a charity in Nepal. The more Sonia learns about her hosts’ customs, spirituality and spontaneity, the more she re-examines her own values. Then, when disaster strikes, she musters resources and courage she’d forgotten she’d ever had.This is a fictional sequel to \"A Glimpse of Eternal Snows\" by the author of \"Lemurs of the Lost World\".\"... in her observation of Nepali culture -- she is careful to avoid a patronising 'them and us' perspective. Couple her sensitive approach with a dramatically unfolding plot and breezy, easy style, and readers clamouring for more since the release of her first Nepal book, are bound to be satisfied.\" Saumya Balsari author of \"The Cambridge Curry Club\" & \"Summer of Blue\"\"In a confrontation with another culture that becomes more life-enhancing and a land more life-threatening than anything she has ever experienced before, Sonia's overwhelming problems back in England gradually become trifling. Nepal's unfamiliar culture and Nature itself carry the tale like the river that becomes so important in Sonia's alteration from victim into healer. Five voices weave together strands of cultural confusion to create a rich tapestry of greater humanity, and deftly draws one into minds with very different perspectives.\"Amy Corzine author of \"The Secret Life of the Universe\" etc",
