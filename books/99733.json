  "description": "Fenimore rode into Hope Springs wearing a dead man's poncho on a drunken horse. He carried two guns and seven coins: six grimy ones for the six men who'd taken from him, and the seventh for the woman he'd loved, who'd sold him out for a future full of dollars. He was looking for work. What he found was a feud. He made himself useful.",
