I can’t run from the truth or from myself, because the dreams are driving me to find answers. Where is the island, who is the voice in my mind, what does the woman want, and how do I hide the truth and still appear normal on the outside?Truth always comes with trauma.Sydney and Herathina, two women whose seemingly unrelated lives come together over a millennium to change the fate of the universe.
