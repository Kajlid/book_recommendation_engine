  "description": "The cocktail hour is once again one of America’s most popular pastimes and one of our favorite ways to entertain. And what better place to find the secrets of great drink-making than The Times? Steve Reddicliffe, the “Quiet Drink” columnist for The Times, brings his signature voice and expertise to this collection of delicious recipes from bartenders from everywhere, especially New York City.  Readers will find treasured recipes they have enjoyed for years—the classics like the Martini, the Old-Fashioned, the Manhattan, the French 75, the Negroni —as well as favorites from the new generation of elixirs borne of the craft distilling boom. Reddicliffe has carefully curated this essential collection, with memorable writing from famed New York Times journalists like Mark Bittman, Craig Claiborne, Toby Cecchini, Eric Asimov, Rosie Schaap, Robert Simonson, Melissa Clark, William L. Hamilton, Jonathan Miles, Amanda Hesser, William Grimes and many more.  This compendium is arranged by cocktail type, with engaging essays throughout. Included are notes on how to set up your bar, stock, and run it—and of course hundreds of recipes, from Bloody Marys to Irish Coffees. The Essential New York Times Book of Cocktails is the only volume you will ever need to entertain at home, whether it’s just for two, or for pleasing a crowd.",
