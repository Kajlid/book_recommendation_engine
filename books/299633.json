  "description": "Steel's a prick. He stole my heart when I was a kid, and ever since, he's refused to let go. He's clung to me, even as he pushed me away, and I'm tired of it.I'm over it, and over him. Of the games we play together, the endless waltz of him hurting me to shove distance between us. So I'm out of there. My future is medicine. If I turn into a crazy cat lady, then so be it. I'm good with that. At least Mrs. Biggins can't hurt my heart when she poops in my shoes... Of course, Mrs. Biggins doesn't kiss like Steel either. One kiss. That's all we've had together, and it haunts me. My nights, my days, my waking moments, my sleeping ones. A single kiss. Where everything, the stars included, aligned and just felt right. But Steel isn't mine to have... by his choice. And I've dealt with that. For years. So when he suddenly changes his mind? What am I supposed to do? Just fall at his feet? I don't think so. Find out if Steel and Stone can ever be together in STEEL, book four of A Dark & Dirty Sinners' MC series.",
