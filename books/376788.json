  "title": "Blue Box Boy: A Memoir of Doctor Who in Four Episodes",
  "description": "As a boy Matthew Waterhouse loved Doctor Who. He watched all the episodes, and read all the novels and comic strips...and so Blue Box Boy starts as a heart-warming story, of a boy growing up with Doctor Who as his trusted friend, then takes a sudden twist when he is thrust into an alien and adult world, cast as Doctor Who's youngest ever traveling companion for two of the show's most inventive seasons. Matthew's sense of wonder at his dream job and his love for the show are palpable, as is his shock at genuine hostilities between cast and crew members and the tensions on set, which are counterpointed by poignant reminders that he is just a boy - and still a fan - who finds himself in the absurd, comic world of minor celebrity. Written with honesty, warmth, wit and a dose of self-deprecation, this audiobook is essential listening for any Doctor Who fan. Finally, we get to hear Matthew's side of a story which has been told, embellished and imagined by fans and fellow actors for years. This affectionate and darkly humorous memoir is a record of what it was like to make Doctor Who, and to work for the BBC, in the early 80s...",
