  "description": "Breast Cancer doesnâ€™t always strike because there is a family history. A family history has to start with someone. In February, 2013 I found a lump in my right breast. I was 42 years old. By the end of February I had been diagnosed with breast cancer and had surgery to remove the lump (partial mastectomy) and lymph nodes. My cancer was removed. When you are diagnosed with breast cancer you don't get time to think or to feel sorry for yourself. You just have to make quick decisions and do what your doctors advise you. I think back now - two years later, and I can see now that I was in a kind of trance, I tuned out and that was because I had no time to adjust or to allow my diagnosis to sink in. In many ways that was a good thing, especially for me at the time. The more time I had to think about what was happening, the more time I had to dwell.  Fighting the storm is my journey through breast cancer. From finding my lump, diagnosis, surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, tamoxifen and all the not so wonderful side effects.",
