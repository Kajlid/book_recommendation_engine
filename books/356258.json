He's the same (naked) guy she saw after hours at the zoo. But now he's in her apartment, and just happens to have turned into a black-as-night jaguar. The average person would be in a blind panic;Callie certainly intends to be--once she finishes processing what this incredibly hot lunatic is telling her. . .It seems Callie's visitor, the one who prefers skins to shirts, is Prince Rogar--from a place far, far away. Oh, and Callie is from the same place, has the same nifty shapeshifting powers, and is destined to be Rogar's lifemate! It figures the first hot guy ever to show a bit of interest turns out to be certifiable. Then again, Callie's seen Rogar's powers (plus some other choice things) firsthand--and testing her new roomie's powers of persuasion would be the ultimate walk on the wild side. . .",
