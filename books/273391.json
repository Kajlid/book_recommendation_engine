Itâ€™s her salvation from the banality of the suburbs. She dreams of one day becoming a rock star and taking music back for the girls, but first, she has to struggle through high school, her own budding sexual awareness, her possible homosexuality, and her dangerous flirtation with an older indie rocker. Set in the suburbs of Toronto, Grrrl is a tender and beautiful novel about the pains of getting older.",
