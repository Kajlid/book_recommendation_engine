  "title": "Political Thinking: The Perennial Questions, 6th Edition",
  "description": "Among the new class of inductees into the “Longman Classics in Political Science” Series, this reissue of Glenn Tinder's highly regarded, unique text introduces political philosophy by posing questions that help students engage in the process of political thinking. Political Thinking stirs critical thought in students by concentrating on the questions of the political world rather than the answers. In addition, the great philosophers' responses to these questions are traced, helping students understand the historical and contemporary importance of these questions in politics and political life. The book has been reissued with a new Foreword by Steven M. Delue of Miami University of Ohio.",
