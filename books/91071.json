He lives in northern New Jersey with his mom and dad, and he's never had to worry about anything other than his wardrobe, his latest new car, and the secret love affair he's been having for years. However, Anton has more than just the love affair to hide: he belongs to a Sicilian vampire mobster clan that migrated to New Jersey in the late 1800s. When Anton's dad, the head of their clan, decides it's time for Anton and his vampire cousin Digger to get into the “family business,” Anton is not enthusiastic, at least until he meets a sweet young human named Leo on his first night at work. They wind up spending the rest of the night together, but things get even more complicated when they bring Anton's secret vampire lover into the picture. After a bloody battle with werewolves, and the beginning of all-out war between two vampire mob clans the characters wind up on the precipice of their last resort.",
