  "description": "When Grace is gripped tightly from behind in her own home, fearing for her life as an intruder presses hard against her, the last thing she expects to hear is the voice of her husband in a cool, demanding tone, right in her ear, “I’m going to rip your clothes off and take you right now…” Grace and Steve have been together since school. They’re each other’s first love, and they are blissfully happy. Or, at least, that’s what Grace thought. But when Steve suddenly turns the dial up on their sex life, shifting from rare moments of intimacy to an erotic re-enactment of one of Grace’s most sexy fantasies, she is excited but even more confused. What’s the reason for Steve’s sudden erotic dominance? Is he masking his guilt? And is her perfect relationship on the verge of shattering? Or is he unleashing a deep fire within that is about to awaken their sexuality?.",
