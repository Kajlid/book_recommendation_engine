  "description": "From the incredibly intricate storyteller John Leatherman comes a tale with more twists and turns than any episode of Sherlock. For television news intern Chance Trifle, the third time really is the charm. He experiences every day three times, and only what happens on the third version is permanent. The rest of the world seems unaware that each day has two unofficial versions.  Chance’s foreknowledge allows him to get what he thinks is his ticket to journalistic stardom – video of the murder of pop star Prima by record producer Sam Mason. But each unofficial attempt to release the sensational video goes horribly wrong, so on the official days, Chance keeps it secret. Meanwhile, he juggles relationships with two female interns, Danielle Arbusto and Trish Villanova—both captivated by his apparent cleverness.  With every moment Chance sits on the video, he feels more and more in league with a criminal. Obsessed with finding the right way to protect himself, profit from the video, and keep his girlfriends from finding out about each other, Chance misses hearing about the abduction of five-year-old Wendy Starnes until after his last chance to prevent it. Then as he struggles to help find Starnes, the video goes missing and turns up anonymously on the Web. It’s only a matter of time before someone links it to him—and realizes he could have saved Prima and brought a murderer to justice if he hadn’t been so focused on himself. On the run from conniving coworkers, spurned lovers, determined detectives, bloodthirsty thugs, and fierce mercenaries, can Chance take his mind off personal gain long enough to realize the right way to use his gift?",
