When she becomes their lover, she’s tossed into a world of passion she’s always searched for but thought she’d never find.Dominant and strong, they take her in ways she’d never imagined and earn a submission from her she never thought she’d give. When passion comes at a price, she has to depend on them to keep her safe from an enemy from Steve’s past. An enemy who’s waited for years for a chance to get revenge. An enemy they believe she works for.She learns that trust will come at a steeper price. But can offer the biggest rewards.",
