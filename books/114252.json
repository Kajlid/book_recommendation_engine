  "title": "My Beautiful Suicide",
  "description": "This book is a dark, twisted, unsettling tale. Though the main character is sixteen, it is definitely NOT for young teens. You've been warned. \"Suicide is selfish. It tells the world that you are weak. It tells the world your family and friends have failed. It leaves them with guilt that they could have done more but didn't. It tells them they are clueless and helpless. I am weak, but I am not selfish. My suicide will not leave my family and friends with guilt and shame; it will leave them thankful that they knew me for the short time I was here.\" - Cosette Hugo Her brother died. Her parents divorced. Her high school bully is relentless. Cosette doesn't have a lot to live for, but it isn't until she accidentally kills someone that Cosette makes the decision to take her own life. Unwilling to bring shame to her mom, best friend Mattie, or her boyfriend Chris, Cosette decides the best method of suicide is to become a victim of the local serial killer, The Poser. But every time she goes out to find him she gets attacked; her instincts take over, and she ends up killing her attackers. This quickly leads to unbearable guilt. Desperate to finish this before she gets caught or racks up more victims, Cosette does the unthinkable. \"And when I reach my final goal, to meet my brother in heaven, and we're looking down at my victims in Hell, he will say to me 'Well done, Cosette. What a Beautiful Suicide.'\"",
