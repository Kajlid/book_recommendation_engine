  "description": "Beauty and the beast trade places. For Better Or Worse...Young and insecure, Alexandra Huntington had married the man she'd adored since childhood—and said goodbye to her war-bound groom on the steps of the church. Of course, Bryceson Wakefield, Duke of Hawksworth, was always too aristocratically elegant for his own good—apparently far too much so to survive Waterloo. As his widow, Alex is penniless because the charming roue neglected to provide for her in his will. Now she is on her way to the altar once more, hang the fact that her groom is Bryceson's enemy, the Viscount Chesterfield. But the ceremony is halted by none other than Bryceson himself—limping, bearded, and all the more dear to Alex for it. Though she secretly rejoices at his return, she will not fall into his arms so easily. She intends to show him that she is a grown woman with real passions who will demand that her husband prove his loyalty...and his love.",
