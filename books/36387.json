  "description": "One of the most fascinating and strategic topics in ancient texts is the record of fallen angels, giants, and UFOs.Fallen angels and giants are shrouded in mystery and belong to the age of pyramids and other great wonders of the world. It is an epoch that was destroyed by God's judgment-a flood-which left the world everlastingly changed, the evidence of which is found in the tales, folklore, and traditions of many cultures around the world.\"There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown\" (Genesis 6:4).This vivid language defines the conspiracy of evil which has beset our world. The ancient books, Enoch and Jubilees, tell us of a race of nephilim, which are hybrids, alive in history and today, fathered by fallen angels.Strange as this may seem, the Lord declares that this conspiracy of evil is to be repeated before His return. Consequently, it is important from the standpoint of both understanding history and understanding the future that we understand these events.The world is in a slumber, asleep with the dream of a better tomorrow. While dark forces of fallen angels are arrayed against us, many today write about the approaching juggernaut of the apocalypse, but few, however, know or understand that fallen angels have brought us to this apocalypse, this apex of human history.The end of the world as we know it is about to take place. A storm is gathering, so terrible as to cause men's hearts to fail them for fear; read Fallen Angels so you don't approach this coming apocalypse unaware and unarmed.",
