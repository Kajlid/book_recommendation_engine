  "description": "Elric of Melniboné is the haunted, treacherous and doomed albino sorcerer-prince. An introspective weakling in thrall to his black-bladed, soul-eating sword, Stormbringer, he is yet a hero whose bloody adventures and wanderings through brooding, desolate lands leads inexorably to his decisive intervention in the war between the forces of Law and Chaos. This volume brings together The Stealer of Souls and Stormbringer, the first two published books of Elric's adventures, and confirms Michael Moorcock's place as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time.Omnibus of Stealer of Souls (collection, 1963) and Stormbringer (novel, 1977 revised version)Contents:•1 • The Dreaming City • [The Elric Saga] • (1961) • novelette by Michael Moorcock •35 • While the Gods Laugh • [The Elric Saga] • (1961) • novelette by Michael Moorcock •73 • The Stealer of Souls • [The Elric Saga] • (1962) • novelette by Michael Moorcock •119 • Kings in Darkness • [The Elric Saga] • (1962) • novelette by Michael Moorcock and James Cawthorn [as by Michael Moorcock ] •155 • The Caravan of Forgotten Dreams • [The Elric Saga] • (1962) • novelette by Michael Moorcock (aka The Flame Bringers) •191 • Stormbringer • [The Elric Saga • 6] • (1965) • novel by Michael Moorcock",
