  "description": "Greenwich Village has always attracted the innovative and independent spirit. What began as the site of an important Lenape Indian settlement has since transformed into a tourist attraction and home to celebrities, fine universities, publishers, art schools, choice restaurants, and famed night spots. The seemingly wayward streets in the West Village follow original Native American footpaths and colonial roads. Historic residences lining the quirky and charming streets reflect the area's strong ties to the past. Greenwich Village shows how the many layers of this community's history have created the sense of place that present-day Greenwich Village is famous for.",
