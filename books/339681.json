  "description": "He wasn’t just a rock star to her, and she wasn’t just any woman to him.JACK HOWARD is a gorgeous rock star with a tragic past. He's a nice guy. Since that terrible day, he has strived to do the right thing. Only with his disastrous marriage finally ending, he’s decided it’s time to take a walk on the wilder side of nice while on this tour. LORELEI LANE is a working girl with no future. She's a beauty in disguise, a woman broken by circumstances trying her best to turn her life around. She's hungry, homeless, and needs someone to believe in her. Her furry traveling companion Prince loves her, but his faith can only take her so far. JACK is the handsome drummer and backup vocalist in Rush's group. He has impressive rhythm and sexy moves, but the world seems to have forgotten that he was once a teen idol in New Horizon, the most popular boy band in music history. LORELEI is a woman who hides her heart, denies her talent, and does what she must to survive. She never allows herself to think about the boy who betrayed her, or the time she got so close, only to fall short of making her dream come true. When chance brings Jack and Lorelei together backstage, will one night lead to a new beginning for both of them or will dangerous secrets and past mistakes capsize any hope they have for happiness? The Right Song is a modern-day retelling of The Little Mermaid. It is a steamy romance packed with emotion and just the right amount of page turning angst. It will bring tears to your eyes, but it will also make you smile. It is an uplifting story. Do not read it if you want a book with a sad ending. Do you believe in fairy tales? In happily ever after? In love?",
