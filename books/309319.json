  "description": "A Sucky Vampire Romantic ComedyI don’t usually fang and tell, but she earned an exception.The hapless woman who accidentally released me.The one who nearly got herself killed mere hours later.So I saved her, but my help came with a price.The only way to save her life was to bond her–to link us so powerfully we’d have to spend every waking hour together for the next few weeks.I was ready for the bond, but I wasn’t ready for her.Her impossible to crush perky outlook. Her big eyes that never seem to dim, no matter how far into my blackened soul they saw.I thought I’d lost the ability to care centuries ago, but it appears I was wrong.The insufferable woman won’t rest until she’s forced me to do the unthinkable. To… enjoy her company.It’s ridiculous, but all I need to do is outlast the bond.To outlast my growing fear that I’m not as numb as I thought.I’m in danger of feeling something for this human that I can’t afford to feel. Because the only thing more dangerous for her than my enemies is if I can’t let her go.Author’s Note: Get sucked into this high stakes, fang-fest of paranormal, romantic comedy fun with an out-of-his-element vampire grump and the upbeat woman who refuses to let things go according to plan.",
