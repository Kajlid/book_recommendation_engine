  "description": "***Note: This is the first book in a Reverse Harem series. If you expect her to end up with just one guy, then this is not for you.*** **Also, there is violence, and just a little bit of foul language.** *Oh, and it's a slow burn, so no sexy times till the second or third book*  Blue Faust and her mother have just moved to a new city, and Blue has a Plan and a List. This will be The Year of New Things. Little does she know just how right she is. When she and her new friends are out hiking one day and suddenly find themselves in a new world, Blue thinks she may have gotten all the New she can handle. She has to handle kidnappers, killer crystals and stubborn beast mounts. Throw in some very appealing men, all with their own agendas, and it's all Blue can do to keep her head from exploding.",
