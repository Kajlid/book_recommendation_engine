  "description": "From age ten, Harry has had just one ambition—to find the one girl for him. Forty-three women and twenty-odd years later, he is still looking. He doesn’t ask for much: just a beautiful intellectual who doesn’t mind his constant infidelity. Harry’s roommate Gerrard did once find True Love—but he didn’t realize it until the day she left him. Only two women have met his exacting criteria, and he’s not hopeful that he’ll find another. Even if he does, he’s not sure he can trust her not to grow old eventually. And then Harry and Gerrard meet Alice. Alice is the perfect woman. She’s the only woman in the world Harry and Gerrard can agree on. Unfortunately, she seems to like both of them, and neither will stop at anything to win her for good.",
