  "description": "Angie (Evangelina) Evans - prominent attorney specializing in lesbian legal issues, partner in a committed relationship, mother to an adopted daughter - seems to many to have the best of all worlds. To herself, however, she is caught amid the contradictions that make up her life. Devoted to her own daughter, passionately involved in her legal work, and committed to her lover, Angie, nevertheless, has a difficult relationship with her own mother, must constantly struggle for support within her law group to continue her work, and is involved in a seemingly pointless affair with a legal intern. As she fights to make sense of the labels that have been applied to her - mother, daughter, lover, lesbian - Angie finds her crisis of identity boiling over.",
