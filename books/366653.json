  "title": "To Live on the Wind",
  "description": "The new memoir by Nanette Rayman Rivera is a memoir about deepest loss - of a mother's love; of desire that can be swindled and circumvented in such Machiavellian style, one can only wonder if the Fates are behind it. A gripping first hand observation of homelessness and poverty, this story of thwarted promise and grim determination will pull your heart right out of your chest.",
