Shane’s attention to the security of the US President’s adult son, Airman Darren Wilson, keeps them busy, however. While David and Shane think they have President Victoria Wilson's son under wraps, Darren carries on as carefree as any young man in the arms of a man he’s sure he Prince Michael.  Discreet outings in the English countryside and days spent visiting castles fill Darren and Michael’s time, under the ever-present eyes of security, the US ambassador, and Shane. But an incident at a gay nightclub leaves their guards scrambling. What will Darren’s mother think? How will the King react? Darren and Prince Michael’s love affair might be over before it even begins.",
