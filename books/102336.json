  "description": "In this first book of The Snow Kingdom series, we find Sasha, a beautiful white Siberian Husky puppy, and her brothers being auctioned off to new masters at the family farm. Unfortunately, Sasha is sold to “Grubby,” an abusive and neglectful owner. While she loves Grubby's daughter, Penny, Sasha is determined to escape Grubby's house to the fabled Siberian Husky “Snow Kingdom” in the mountains. For anyone who loves \"Charlotte's Web\" or \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz,\" you'll love \"The Snow Escape From Grubby's House\" with more than 20 beautiful interior illustrations by Cait Maloney. Compelling characters, witty dialogue, and a well-crafted story make the book a page-turner. Before you know it, you'll be wanting to join Sasha on the next leg of her journey -- \"The Snow Sasha Goes To College\" (Book 2). Early \"What a great tale (pardon the pun) this is!\" -- J. Scott Wilson, Internet Broadcasting, National Managing Editor \"Reminded me a lot of 'Charlotte's Web' (the book, not the 1973 movie). I felt like I was being read a classic story by a kindly adult.\" -- Michael Ciccolini, author of \"The Pasta Family\" book series.",
