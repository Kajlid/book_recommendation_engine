  "description": "When smokers coughed and coughed and couldn't stop coughing, Alison Beard made the same snide remarks as anyone who has never smoked: smoke another one! She asked the same question: why don't they just quit? Even as a smoker, Alison was certain that she would never be like those smokers. She was certain that if ever she ailed from the pernicious habit, she would quit. But then her lungs begin to collapse, and she has to quit smoking. In her heartfelt memoir Quit or Die Trying, Alison shares the crazy cocktails of medicine and diversion tactics she employs in her attempt to rid herself of her addiction. Having tried to quit more times than she kept count, she identifies the false assumptions and unhelpful social attitudes to reveal changes that would have a powerful impact on the success rate of quitting. Fifty years after the monumental 1964 Surgeon General's Report on Smoking and Health, more than 50 million Americans still smoke. What follows is a candid, irreverent, eye-opening story about one woman's struggle to overcome her nicotine addiction. \"A relentless, cautionary chronicle of smoking dependency...Smart and strikingly veracious.\" â€”Kirkus Reviews",
