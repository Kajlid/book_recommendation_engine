  "description": "Charles Rogers, a young computer geek, thought he was going to prison, but an unexpected bus accident changes his life forever. He wakes up more than five-hundred years later in a dark metal tomb, where a computer generated hologram informs him that he's now the property of the Synaptech corporation, and that technically, he's no longer a human being.This begins Charles' quest to discover what happened to him during his long sleep, as he learns to cope with life in a new world. The ancient cities lie in ruins, destroyed by a cataclysmic war while he slept. Civilization is in the process of rebuilding, but life in general has reverted to a more primitive state, similar to life on the frontier in the old west. Charles will need to learn to survive in a world where mutations are common among people and animals, and pieces of fantastic ancient technology lie buried in the ruins, waiting to be reclaimed.Can Charles adapt to his new life in the future, disconnected from everything and everyone he ever knew? And what about the hologram's warning, that he won't be able to survive for very long away from his sleep pod? Should he believe it, or trust his gut feeling that he's still the same person he always was?",
