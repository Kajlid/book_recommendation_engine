  "description": "The unexplained event which changed the world at the end of Lost and Not Found is just days away, and Paul thinks he's found the perfect place to hide; the high-tech flying city of Skythia. Meanwhile, Lorraine, Mary, Lance, and Brady are attending the Sergeant's zombie-readiness training camp when word comes in that there's been a major zombie outbreak in Denver - and the Sergeant is taking all his half-trained campers along with him to attempt containment.Not long after the world is remade by the unseen event into something a little more fantastic than it was before, Skythia hurries to the aid of Denver's survivors, taking the uninfected aboard and offering them all the benefits of its utopian society. As Skythia's newest residents try to come to terms with the apparent paradise all around them, the traumas of fighting zombies and the unanswered mystery of what the event really did to them continues to torment each survivor in their own way. Finding love and holding on to it, finding their place in a future of limitless possibility, and learning to let go of a past they can't easily recall prove to be more difficult than anyone expected.Some will be driven to madness, others to dangerous obsession, and when a superhero who shouldn't really exist shows up, everything they've been working for in life and in love comes to a violent and destructive intersection which threatens the existence of the entire solar system. Not everyone will survive, but they'll all be forced to face their own missteps and to deal with the irreversible consequences.",
