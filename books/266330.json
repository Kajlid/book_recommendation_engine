  "description": "A forbidden love that neither can ignore  Kicked out by his mother, Harris—college freshman and impala shifter—goes to live with his aunt in Morningwood, a town unlike any other.  Morningwood is home to a menagerie of shifters from the wolves and lions of Predator Point, to the fun-loving cows and horses in Barnyard Court, and everything else Harris could possibly imagine.  In the normie world, Harris had to hide who he was, but in Morningwood, they celebrate their animal differences. He’s excited to start his new life, and first on the list is continuing his education at the only university in town.  Morningwood is also home to Andrew Boothe, alpha puma shifter, teacher and dean of Morningwood University. From first sight, sparks fly between Harris and Andrew. They know they must deny their attraction but their inner beasts will not be ignored. No matter how forbidden, love finds a way.  Gingerbred Lessons is the first book in the Welcome to Morningwood Omegaverse series. It features a first time, age gap romance that may not jingle everyone’s bells.",
