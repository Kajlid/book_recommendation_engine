  "description": "Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., chronicles the short life of the Kennedy family's second presidential hopeful in \"a story that leaves the reader aching for what cannot be recaptured\" (Miami Herald). Schlesinger's account vividly recalls the forces that shaped Robert Kennedy, from his position as the third son of a powerful Irish Catholic political clan to his concern for issues of social justice in the turbulent 1960s. ROBERT KENNEDY AND HIS TIMES is \"a picture of a deeply compassionate man hiding his vulnerability, drawn to the underdogs and the unfortunates in society by his life experiences and sufferings\" (Los Angeles Times).",
