  "description": "In a near future Pacific Northwest, the mysterious Tygre Tygre shows up unannounced at the hidden city of Cascadiapolis, and sets events in motion that lead to the destruction of that city-and the ultimate surfacing of an end-game millennium in the making. Who are the shadowy Bull Dancers? What part does the high-powered J. Appleseed Foundation play in their secret work? And how will a legendary security specialist, a dying billionaire, a disgraced cop, a minister who's lost his faith, and a keen-eyed nonprofit accountant work together to prevent what looks suspiciously like ... the end of the world?
