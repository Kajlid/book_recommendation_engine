  "description": "Having it all has never been so hard.For eighteen-year-old serial womanizer Fletch Colson, life is a game and if he plays by the rules, he’ll win it all: his dream college, his parents’ money, and a hot (if a little vapid) girl on his arm. Really, it couldn’t be easier. All he has to do is get good grades, live a privileged life, and try not to mess up too much. However, when he accepts the seemingly impossible bet to change his ways and be “just friends” with smart, beautiful, tempting Ellie Jacobs – a girl who turns his world inside out - Fletch discovers his perfect life isn’t so wonderful. As family secrets begin tumbling out, what once seemed simple and clear, no longer feels right, and Fletch must decide if winning it all is worth losing a piece of himself.CRUSHED is a New Adult book. It has profanity and sexual situations, and is intended for ages 16+.",
