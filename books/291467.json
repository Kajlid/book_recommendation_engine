  "description": "An evil presence has been allowed to set up operations on a small island in the South China Sea. Funded by heroin shipments coming out of northern China and relying on corrupt officials within China’s government, this presence (known as the Net) plans vicious attacks on Americans worldwide. Jason Yi is a Chinese American attorney from Washington, DC sent to China as an undercover spy in the US-Sino World Trade Organization Judicial Training Program held in Beijing. China’s judges must be trained in the rule of law as part of its WTO permanent normal trade status. Yi’s task is to expose corruption in China’s judicial system that prevents fair trade relations. With the aid of fellow judges, Yi compiles a list of corrupt officials and their activities. However, at least one individual who does not want the Net to be exposed will do anything, including murder, to prevent Yi from succeeding. The Net Conspiracy is the first book in The Net thriller series. Coffman specializes in clean fiction, tackling adult themes within a plot of international suspense, corruption, and terrorism without the use of offensive language or graphic sex or violence.",
