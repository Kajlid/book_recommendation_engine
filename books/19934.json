  "description": "Executive assistant Nicole Kerrigan has been in love with her boss, idealistic genius Austin Summers, since she first saw him. She has no idea he's fallen for her just as hard. Or that when Austin needs to be two places at once, his identical twin brother Tony steps into help. Tony's a hardboiled private eye who doesn't have qualms about sleeping with his secretary -- or his brother's -- and makes the move on Nicole that Austin didn't dare make. But when a hit man tries to take out Austin, she rushes to his side, and deception gets piled on top of deception.Now Nicole is torn between two very different men who happen to look exactly the same. Can the three of them unravel the half-truths they've told, and can a woman serve two masters? Nicole is about to find out. Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: BDSM theme and content, menage (m/f/m).",
