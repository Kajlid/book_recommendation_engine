  "description": "Three teenagers discover the truth about their identitywhile struggling to control their new gifts.Ennis Taylor lives a normal small-town life with his father for nearly sixteen years, until the nightmares begin. When they do, he’s faced with calling them what they must be – freaky dreams – or self-diagnosing himself as a teenage schizophrenic. What else do you call a boy who swears to flying around his room at night when no one else is there to witness?To make matters worse, at school Ennis hears the voice of not one, but two of his classmates – Edward, the superstar athlete, and Elias, the local menace. This would be tolerable if they were, in the slightest, friends, and if the voices weren’t seemingly inside his head.",
