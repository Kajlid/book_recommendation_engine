  "description": "The absolute fear and dread that clawed at him sharpened everything, making everything clearer. He wasn’t going to die like this. Not in Pecos’s body. Not here. Not now.Broken bodies and carnage are all that remain in the wake of Septimis, the father of all snakes. Awakened by a dark force, this ancient being won’t relent until he has drunk his fill of blood, and the only man powerful enough to stop him is Pecos Bill. As Pecos races to battle Septimis, time-shifting magic rips snarky youth Andrew Rufus through time, trapping him inside Pecos’s body and imprisoning Pecos within his own mind. Andrew has never cared about anything, never mattered, and never made a difference. But with Pecos unable to regain control of his body, Andrew must accept the responsibility of wielding Pecos’s unfathomable strength or watch as more innocents die.In this mind-bending twist on hero and apprentice fiction, Andrew Rufus must learn to become a legend or die trying!",
