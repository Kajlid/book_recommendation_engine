  "description": "A chance for a sweet future, or a recipe for disaster?KaitlynnMy dream was to cook my way to fame and fortune, not run myself ragged keeping my late parents’ quaint restaurant afloat. My sister is useless, I’m chronically short-staffed, and even Gertie, my antiquated oven, hates me.Then in charges Oliver, like a Golden Knight. He’s hunky, charming, and makes others feel at ease. He’s earnest and kind, optimistic and extroverted. He's my best friend...and my sister’s ex. Picking up the slack like he never left all those years ago is difficult. He makes my body shiver with the lightest touch, the slightest smile. It would be so easy to let him be my knight in shining armor. But I can’t let him, even though he makes Gertie purr like a kitten.OliverI practically grew up waiting tables alongside KitKat. She’s a brilliant chef, but it’s clear she’s no manager. I’ve noticed other changes in her since her letters stopped coming to me in Iraq. There’s fire burning in her green eyes—and pain.One kiss was meant to comfort. But it explodes into searing passion so white-hot, not even the tallest, iciest sweet tea can quench it. I shouldn’t try. She doesn’t want help, especially not mine. But a kiss like that is the beginning of a promise. A promise that won’t stop until I help her find her dream.",
