  "description": "From the moment she’d been turned into Mortis, Natalie Pierce had been fated to come face to face with the first vampire ever created. Hideously transformed over thousands of years by the diseased blood that runs through his veins, the First had created an army of grey skinned imps. His plan is to enslave humanity and to turn them into a vast herd of cattle to feed his offspring.Nat and her friends are all that stands between the humans and the bat faced, orange eyed imps. Aside from the overwhelming odds against them, Natalie foresaw an even bigger danger. As vampires, they were all highly susceptible to becoming possessed by their shadows. Once that happened, they could then be turned into imps by the First. Luc, Geordie, Igor and Gregor would be doomed from the instant they set foot inside the First’s lair.A recent prophecy had foretold that an army would come to Natalie’s aid. With many of her new kin already possessed by their shadows, Nat was uncertain where this mystery army would come from. She could only hope that the prophecy would come true. If it didn’t, she would be facing the First and his growing army of ravenous offspring alone.",
