  "description": "I'm a wolf shifter... who can't shift.Twelve years ago, I was hobbled by my alpha, cast out of my pack, and forced into an unfriendly world without any protection. But Iâ€™m not exactly helpless.Despite being unable to shift, I have talents the others don't have. I can see the spirits of dead people, for one. And I have a knack for fighting rogue supernaturals.My ex-alpha will never let me back in, but there's another alpha in the city. Something has been killing his wolves, and he wants me to destroy it before it takes another one. He'll triple my going rate--but that's not the thing that makes me agree to help him.He says he can free my wolf.It's not possible, but...What if it is?I'll help him, either way. Monster hunting is what I do, and if there's a monster killing wolves, I will stop it. Because those two warring alphas might believe the city is theirs, but this is my territory.The city embraced me when the packs wouldn't have me, and I will protect it--with or without my wolf.",
