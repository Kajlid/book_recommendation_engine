  "description": "It’s taken twelve years to earn the official title of Shepherd but Alex is now mostly trained, fairly effective, and the first female in over two centuries to hold the position as protector of animals. All animals...The Territorial Council isn't thrilled with her new title of Shepherd, but they don’t have any more control over the appointment than they have over her. All they can really do is wait for her to screw something up – which Alex is determined not to do.Everything changes when a chance encounter with a genetically modified Shifter leaves Alex shaken and initiates a quest to locate its maker. In a desperate bid to save her pack, Alex must infiltrate the Parallax Corporation before they succeed in breeding the perfect weapon.Despite years of training, Alex finds herself woefully unprepared to tackle the new threat. To make matters worse, she must work with a mysterious man who’s been trying to kill her since the day they met. Together with her pack, Alex must learn how to stop the biological cloning and find those responsible for the plan before it really does become a global threat.",
