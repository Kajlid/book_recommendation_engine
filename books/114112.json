Coleman is about Jake Conley, a private investigator who shot a gunman as he opened fire in a cinema. He is offered a high paying job in a private security firm, with the benefits of a condo, car and another perks, in the form of a beautiful woman named Medalia. Jake’s job is to watch and build psychological profiles on potential terrorists, which are then used by all law enforcement agencies. Unfortunately, the more he watches the suspects, the more Jake feels that he is being watched, too. Who are the real criminals? How far will his supervisor and the government go in order to gather information on innocent civilians?T.F. Coleman knows how to write a convincing and suspenseful story. It is a well detailed plot which has good characters to match. The drama began from the very beginning, making me want to find out what occurred next. It is obvious that the author spent quality time working on this novel, and his efforts were not in vain. T.F. Coleman was in his comfort zone, and his writing style is reflective of this. This story is one that will make readers give serious thought to their own privacy, wondering how safe they really are in their own homes, and how much information is on record about them. Deadly Provocation: A Year of Domestic Surveillance is a wonderfully engaging action book that is well worth the read.\"When obsessive power meets paranoia.",
