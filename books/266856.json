A “compelling” and “powerful” tale that “fans of Karen White and Marian Keyes will especially enjoy” (Booklist).Once a spirited, independent woman with a rebellious streak, her life has been forever changed by a tragic event twelve years ago.Unable to let go of her grief, she finds solace in the silent company of the souls of her local Victorian cemetery and at the town's lido, where she seeks refuge underwater - safe from the noise and the pain.But a chance encounter with two extraordinary women - the fabulous and wise Kitty Muriel, a convent girl-turned-magician's wife-turned-seventy-something-roller-disco-fanatic, and the mysterious Sally Red Shoes, a bag lady with a prodigious voice - opens up a new world of possibilities, and the chance to start living again.Until the fateful day when the past comes roaring back...",
