Drawing on real-life stories from the Bible (David, Joseph, Mary, and Martha) and the present day, he writes to help you:* Move past the feelings of crisis: panic, fear, paralysis, and overcontrol.* See God in your circumstances--even when he doesn't seem to be there at all.* Make peace with doubt, which can actually be an expression of faith.* Find hope through the redemptive power of community.* Ask the right questions in order to find real, satisfying answers.* Explore the relationship between shattered dreams and true spiritual transformation.",
