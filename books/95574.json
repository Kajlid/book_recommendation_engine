  "description": "Signed Edition, 1987, first printing (#478 of 500 issued by Stephen King's Philtrum Press), SIGNED by both Don Robertson, author, and Stephen King, who contributed an Introduction, on a special page at the back, a like-new, unread, unworn, unopened, unmarked hardcover, with an equally fine unclipped ($25 Limited Edition, $50 Signed Edition at top of front flap) dust jacket, from Philtrum Press. By Don Robertson. 276 pages. No ISBN. ** From an Amazon \"This book should be among the classics, not the out of print. It's full of vulgar language and vulgar acts, but it is also raw and real. This novel is complex and poignant. And will have you thinking about a great many things once your able to put it down. I bought this book because I found out Robertson is one of Stephen King's favorites. It's easy to see the influence in style. I've ordered two more out of print Robertson novels and eagerly await their arrival. Robertson is a modern genius. I'm still trying to figure out why he's out of print. This guy should be read in the colleges of America. Robertson can outwrite Don DeLillo any day of the week. And I like DeLillo.",
