To the world, they’re nothing but leather wearing, foul-mouthed bikers, but to me, they are my saviors. The light at the end of a very dark tunnel.  However, as my memory starts to come back to me in pieces, I fear the darkness ahead. Maybe the reason why I can’t recollect anything is because I don’t want to.  Life is sweet in heaven.
