  "title": "The Scout of Wounded Knee",
  "description": "Half-starved and disillusioned, Everett Ward searches for a new life after four years of war. He drifts down to Texas where he finds work on a cattle ranch. An encounter with Rebecca, the ranch’s Lakota kitchen girl, leaves him enamored, but it also starts a chain of events that spans decades and leaves the couple embroiled in a bitter clash of cultures. The Scout of Wounded Knee lifts the veil of romance from the western genre, blending historical and fictional characters to paint an uncompromising and compelling picture of post-Civil War America.Told through the memories of an aged frontier scout, this standalone follow-up to Michael A. McLellan’s In the Shadow of the Hanging Tree, is a story of friendship, love, remorse, and the end of a way of life in the American west.",
