  "description": "A Campaign of Hate One mistake ruined everything. Her best friend, Chelsea, hates her. Her other friends have happily joined Chelsea's campaign of bullying and humiliation. As her senior year progresses, Amy finds herself abandoned and completely adrift. Shutting down seems like the only way to make it through the days, and to escape a question she doesn't know how to answer: who is she, without Chelsea? Better yet, who was she, with her? Alone, or... Closing herself off is something that proves harder than she thinks, especially under the watch of her slightly invasive but usually well-meaning family. And then there's also Adam. Quietly perceptive and unflinchingly honest, Adam is a fellow outcast she never really noticed before. But one day she does, and something like friendship develops through a series of shared lunches and secret, late night confessions. Live, Breathe, Anything With her comfort zones gone and nothing left to hide behind, Amy's world opens up in ways she never expected. Through it all, she looks back on the history of her friendship with Chelsea, and tries to come to terms with the event that led to its end. This is a standalone romance and coming of age story. Due to strong language and explicit sexual content, it is recommended for mature readers only.",
