  "description": "The Pledge of Allegiance was the origin of the Nazi salute and Nazi behavior. Under Germany's Nazis, the swastika symbol was crossed \"S\" letters for \"SOCIALIST\" (for the National Socialist German Workers Party). Those are only two of the amazing discoveries in this blockbuster that have been left out of similar books on this topic.This blood drenched book offers eye-popping new analysis of the origins of fascism and explores the discoveries of the historian Dr. Rex Curry. Replacing conveniently manufactured myths with surprising research, the author Micky Barnetti reminds us of the history of robotic chanting en masse and on cue, accompanied by violence for anyone who refused to submit.Discover the secret of how the military salute was the origin of the fascist salute.Study the Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part).Learn how the word \"Fascist\" is related to the word \"faggot.\"Calling someone a fascist is the fastest way to shut someone up, defining their views as beyond the pale. But who are the real fascists in our midst? According to the author Micky Barnetti, the pledge remains the first fascist bullying that begins each day in government schools (fascist schools) in Police State USA.The quintessential Liberal Fascist isn't an SS storm trooper; it is a public school teacher brainwashing children every day for 12 years of their lives.These revelations may sound odd to modern ears, but that is because we have forgotten what fascism is. In this smart, contentious book, Barnetti turns our preconceptions upside down and shows us the unvarnished meaning of Liberal Fascism.Find out why, if the truth were taught about the Pledge of Allegiance, then everyone (other than fascist kooks) would refuse to perform Francis Bellamy's quotidian mechanical ritual.The fascist salute was performed by public officials in the USA from 1892 through 1942. What happened to the photographs and films of the American fascist salute performed by federal, state, county, and local officials? Those photos and films are rare because people don't want to know the truth. Public officials in the USA whopreceded the Adolf Hitler and the Benito Mussolini were sources for the stiff-armed salute (and robotic chanting) in those countries and other foreign countries.Explore how the \"ancient Roman salute\" myth originated from the city of Rome in the state of New York (not Italy), Francis Bellamy's hometown. Learn about Mussolini's strange gift to the city of Rome, a statue of two human male infants suckling on a female wolf. That statue remains ondisplay in Rome, NY.Find out who you are, what you are, and how you got to be that way. Also learn who you should your government's schools (fascist schools).Remove the pledge from the flag; remove flags from schools; remove schools from government.The Pointer Institute proudly presents another news-breaking volume from the Dead Writers Club (DWC) and Micky Barnetti.A portion of the proceeds of the sale of this book will aid the \"Stop the Pledge Foundation\" to liberate children and adults from the Pledge of Allegiance.
