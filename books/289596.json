  "description": "Beneath the stars of the Nebraskan sky, Bo Sutton and I made promises to each other that we swore never to break.  Then I did.  Now five years later, I am forced to return to the very spot where I broke both my vow and my heart, with our daughter in tow.  I never regretted my decision to protect my daughter from the same heartbreak I felt all those years ago.  Then I did.  I’m aware I’m bad at love, but when secrets come to light that reveal more than just my daughter’s paternity, I know that I am going to need to study up quickly to protect what is left of my heart.  Can Bo ever forgive me for my secrets and sins?  Can we rediscover the map we left in the stars and pick up right where we left off?",
