  "description": "When Jared spots his sister's very vanilla assistant in a BDSM club, he can hardly believe it. He's lusted after Tess for years but didn't think she could handle his darker needs. Like his predilection for cuffs. And whips. And spanking. Hell, for domination of every kind. But as soon as he sees her wearing a collar, he's lost to his desire. He vows to claim her for his own. For Tess, dressing up as a sub while researching an article she's writing is a lark-until she sees Jared in the club. She may be new to the Dom/sub scene, but she knows what she wants. With Jared-and only Jared-can her deep, primal desires come to light and be fulfilled. Let the lessons begin.",
