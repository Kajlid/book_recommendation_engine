  "description": "We've all read the doomsday books, seen the doomsday movies. However, have you ever wondered - what happens next? What if someone survived and rose to the challenge of starting a new society and getting it right? What if that someone said, \"God saved me for a reason and I'm going to do things His way this time.\" 'Sanctuary' is the story of one girl's journey through that possibility.",
