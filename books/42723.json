  "description": "GALLANT'S LAIR A simple mission of mercy had involved lovely Caro Farrell with the notorious Tony Gallant, a darkly handsome man of dubious background. To save her reputation, Caro consented to masquerade as Gallant;s \"betrothed\" and to serve as governess to the two Indian children who were his wards. But in her first days in Evrington, the Gallant manor house, doubts assailed Caro's mind. Who was Tony Gallant? Why had he brought her there? And what was behind the sinister foreign plot that threatened them all with kidnapping and murder?",
