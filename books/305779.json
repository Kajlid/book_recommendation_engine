  "description": "Fifty million dollars.That’s how much my sister’s freedom cost. She’s moved on. I haven’t. I think about the horror of her kidnapping every day. Every hour. Every goddamn second.Someone has to pay.Yet despite my relentless searching, each road leads to a dead end.Until a chance meeting with my secret high school crush changes everything.She promises answers where I only have questions. She vows to support me on my quest for justice.Except I’m on a path to self-destruction, and if she’s not careful, I’ll take her down with me.***A lot can happen in a decade and a half.I’m no longer the shy, awkward girl who blended into the background. And he’s no longer the guy who excelled at everything.He’s bitter and angry and filled with a thirst for revenge.Yet despite the intervening years, those suppressed feelings of lust reappear.But he’s dangerous, and if I allow myself to become embroiled in his desire for payback, I might just lose everything.",
