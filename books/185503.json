  "description": "\"It is a pleasure to meet you, Ambassador. I'm Isabella Piori, your Attach√©'s new assistant.\" \"Is that right?\" This man riveted me. I was in a trance. He was raw sex in a tux and nothing like I had ever seen before.  He entered my life like an unexpected storm out of nowhere. I couldn't help myself and I didn't want to. He was beautiful, rustic, and confident. There was something between us when our eyes locked onto each other. It was electrifying. I had never wanted anything so much in my life. His love changed me and made me stronger. He made me realize that my life could be so more. But it hurt. I hurt. I became someone else.",
