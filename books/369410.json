  "title": "The Malory Debate: Essays on the Texts of Le Morte Darthur (Arthurian Studies)",
  "description": "For the past fifty years, debates about which text of Malory scholars and teachers should prefer have sparked much which is the most authentic or authoritative, Caxton, the Winchester version, or a mixture of both (as proposed by Vinaver)? The papers in this volume represent the most important contributions to the dialogue; previously published articles have been updated where relevant and new issues are presented in several original essays, while the introductions place the argument in its theoretical and historical contexts.Professor BONNIE WHEELER teaches at the Southern Methodist University; Professor MICHAEL SALDA teaches at the University of Southern Mississippi; Professor ROBERT KINDRICK teaches at the University of Montana. MICHAEL N. SALDA, KEVIN GRIMM, SHUNICHI NOGUCHI, CHARLES MOORMAN, P.J.C. FIELD, WILLIAM MATTHEWS, ROBERT KINDRICK, HELEN COOPER, TOSHIYUKI TAKAMIYA, YUJI NAKAO, NORMAN BLAKE",
