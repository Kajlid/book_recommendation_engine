It is there, among the faded portraits of its original owners, that Ginna Jones meets Neal Frazier, a recovering plane crash survivor. Young, handsome, and disturbingly familiar, he is someone Ginna swears she knows. But from where . . . and when? Her questions are answered when a walk in the garden sends Ginna and Neal spiraling back through the decades to the time of the Civil War, when two lovers were parted by death, their fates unfinished, their destinies waiting. Now, these two travelers from another century will be plunged into a world of lost dreams to embrace a passion that time cannot dim . . . and to fight for one last chance to love again.",
