  "description": "Catriona Graham is unhappy in her cottage home, aware of her father's ill-concealed dislike, and it soon becomes apparent that there is some shabby secret connected with her birth.When Finlay Stalker, a wealthy gentleman, travels to his country estate in Ayrshire, he meets Catriona under strange circumstances, and she, touched by his kindness, cannot forget him. He returns in the autumn and recognising her intelligence and the fact that she is not wanted in her own home, proposes to adopt her. Catriona thinks romantically of her new life but is soon surrounded by as much jealousy and antagonism as existed in her old life in the village.The most violent of these hatreds proceed from Finlay's sister and her step-daughter Muire, but there is consolation in the growing attachment between Catriona and Finlay's nephew, Neil, an aspiring doctor.The coming of Kenneth Craig, Finlay's relative, brings tragedy and sorrow to Catriona, alienating her from her guardian so decidedly that she contemplates running away with her favourite brother, Tom, but is only prevented from this course by the advent of a totally unexpected love.",
