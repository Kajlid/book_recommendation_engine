  "description": "Buck Reilly's a lot like the rest of us -- trying to make ends meet and hoping for better times. He's living in a Key West hotel and operates Last Resort Charter and Salvage aboard a 1946 Grumman Widgeon flying boat, hunting for sunken treasure and taking on an occasional passenger, no questions asked. But when he delivers a mysterious woman to a mission boat destined for Cuba, things start going downhill quick. He faces down the dark forces of Santeria priests, Cuban Secret Police, and an FBI agent with a grudge. Buck has nothing but ingenuity to save his skin and the lives he put in peril ... and prevent a war with America's longest-running enemy ... When you see the world through Buck Reilly's eyes, the view will never be the same.About the AuthorJohn H.
