  "description": "For Lavender Gin and Carson, life has changed beyond all recognition. Determined to keep a promise made to an old friend, they have formed a new group of allies and are reduced to hunting down zombies and Thinkers alike in rat-infested sewers, armed only with whatever makeshift weapons they can lay their hands on. Things are already tough enough. When Carson goes missing, Lavender finds she not only faces the possibility of carrying on without him, but that she is also caught up in a head-to-head challenge for leadership. As if all of this was not enough, a twisted brand of evil watches them from the shadows, leaving a trail of calling-card corpses in its wake. Slowly, Lavender realises she is also faced with another enemy; one she can neither see nor fight, but which threatens to take away completely all that she now holds dear. Will she and Carson ever be reunited and if they are, is it anyway too late to matter?‘The Undertaking,’ is the sequel to ‘Sleep, Think, Die: The Zombie Apocalypse - Where a Little Knowledge is a Dangerous Thing,’ by S P Oldham.",
