  "description": "It’s the first day of March, and it has been a great year for Ravi Shastry, a regional head at an international bank. Promotions and increments seem within reach, life is good, and the month of March should be very merry.Until trouble in Imperial Bank, Brazil, snowballs into an international crisis, and the Indian bank also has to lay off one-fifth of its staff.And battlelines are drawn, conspiracies are hatched as everyone struggles to make sure their name is not on the laidoff list. Meanwhile, Ravi’s wife is having her own professional and personal crisis, and Ravi must protect his team, his family, and himself—all of which is not helped by mysterious tweets from @ImperialInsider, who seems to know everything that is happening.This crackling page-turner (set over a period of 31 days) reveals the ruthlessly cut-throat world of the banking industry, but also its humour, quirks and strange camaraderie.",
