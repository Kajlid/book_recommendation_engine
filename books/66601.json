  "description": "The tabloids called him the Velvet Viper. He abducted children, four young girls. None of them could remember exactly what had happened...all they recalled was a strange dream of black velvet walls, fragrant flowers. and soft, tinkling music. It wasn't much of a lead for D.A. investigator Sarah Spooner. But it was enough to launch a maddening descent, into the workings of one man's twisted, criminal mind. And the dangers are far more personal than Sarah could have ever imagined...Because Sarah has a daughter of her own.",
