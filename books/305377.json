  "description": "Beneath the earthen clay of America's southern forests, the shattered bones and charred remains of brave men lie entombed amid traces of long coagulated blood and shrapnel from a time long passed that many have forgotten. History's dark secrets rest deep beneath the surface of a pool comprised of carefully fabricated lies and warped distortions of times gone by.Within the pages of the first two installments of the God Walks The Dark Hills series (contained in this book) you'll journey alongside a Congolese boy who was sold into slavery, bought his freedom and fought in the American Civil War in a confederate militia called Heaven's Seven. A true black-sheep, this African warrior overcomes insurmountable odds, the United States federal government, and supernatural forces of darkness.",
