  "description": "Our colonization ship crashed, stranding us on a strange new world.To make matters worse, my best friend disappeared while scouting the area near our crash site.In my search to find her, I’m stolen by a dragon—a creature straight out of every fairy tale book I’d ever read as a child.He takes me back to his kingdom and I’m shocked when he shifts into a man—a fierce Drakarian warrior. He claims that I am his fated one—his Linaya.Despite my protests, he refuses to let me go—and I cannot deny that I’m drawn to him in ways I do not understand.The more time we spend together, I begin to wonder: what would it be like to be fated to a dragon?",
