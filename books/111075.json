  "description": "“First in the Texas series from the #1 New York Times bestselling author. “One of those rare books, the kind the reader doesn’t want to end.” —Green Bay Press Gazette   Young Billie Ames was naive but a real knockout when she met Moss Coleman at the Philadelphia Navy Yard during World War II. Within a few months she was pregnant and married to him. It was a marriage that brought Billie—and her mother, Agnes—across the country to Austin, to a 250,000-acre spread called Sunbridge, and into the world of the Texas rich. Billie works to acclimate to Texas and her new home at Sunbridge, her role as Moss’ wife, and the challenges she faces from her social-climbing mother, her gruff and demanding father-in-law, and the events of the world around her. We see Billie grow stronger in heart, mind, and belief as her children are born, her marriage to Moss changes, and she comes into her own as a Coleman—and a woman in her own right.   “A big, rich book in every way . . . I think Fern Michaels has struck oil with this one.” —Patricia Matthews   “A steaming, sprawling saga . . . As always, Fern Michaels writes a full story with bigger-than-life characters we would look forward to meeting.” —Romantic Times   “Fine fare for Fern Michaels’s fans!” —The Philadelphia Inquirer",
