  "description": "Pedro Almod贸var is one of the most renowned film directors of recent years. Talk to Her is one of the most discussed and controversial of all his films. Dealing principally with the issue of rape, it also offers profound insights into the nature of love and friendship whilst raising important philosophical and moral questions in unsettling and often paradoxical ways.This is the first book to explore and address the philosophical aspects of Almod贸var's film. Opening with a helpful introduction by Noel Carroll that places the film in context, specially commissioned chapters examine the following topics:The relationship between art and morality and the problem of 'immoralism' Moral injury and its role in the way we form moral judgments, including the ethics of love and friendship The nature of dialogue, sexual objectification and what 'listening to' means in the context of gender Almod贸var's use of allusion and the unmasking of appearances to explore hidden themes in human nature.Including a biography of Almod贸var, Talk to Her is essential reading for students interested in philosophy and film as well as ethics and gender. It is also provides an accessible and informative insight into philosophy for those in related disciplines such as film studies, literature and religion.Contributors: Noel Carroll, A. W. Eaton, Cynthia Freeland, Robert B. Pippin, C.D.C. Reeve, and George M. Wilson",
