  "description": "A new comedy series by the sick mind that brought you Deathcreator.Shtulls had fought a bloody war for the human kingdom despite not being a human himself. He watched his men die and struggled on until he beat the demonic emperor and returned home a hero.But on the eve of his medal ceremony, he encountered a being that changed his life for the worse.Now he's cursed, poor, homeless and without mana.His curse forces him to say or do whatever he thinks is the worst thing possible and has robbed him of his honor and dignity often in hilarious ways.But in this standard videogame like world there must still be hope for the fallen hero and perhaps that hope comes in the form of a half-succubus paladin.Warning: This book contains extreme violence, graphic and frequent sexual content and a main character that is literally forced to do things that will make you cringe.This book has elements of LitRPG, Isekai, harem, fantasy tropes and horror.",
