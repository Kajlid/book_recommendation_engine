  "description": "The fusion of man and machine comes too easily for Max and his new phone. He names her Destiny, and she knows him, she understands him, and she brings him regular gifts: apps that defy human logic and that lift him to a position of godliness. But all that power comes at its price, and it’s not long before Destiny comes to collect her toll. She wants what’s hers. She wants what she’s braved generations to accomplish, and she’ll do anything she can to make HIM the one who fulfills her ultimate plan.",
