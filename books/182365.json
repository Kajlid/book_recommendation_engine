  "description": "After unwittingly being posted as Regional Sanitation Specialist in a dry-as-toast village on the edge of oblivion, fate thrusts Eron into the middle of the biggest social upheaval since the apocolypse 500 years earlier. Cast feet first into the vast network of roads inhabited by a highly organized nomadic subculture and genetically engineered megafauna, Eron finds himself on the run from the Auckian Guard, even though he's technically a member. Unable to go home, he and a wild boy from the wastelands head Westward at the dubious advice of local villagers, but one question remains. Will they find a good place to hide?",
