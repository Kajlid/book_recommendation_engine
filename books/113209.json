  "title": "Land of the Meat Munchers",
  "description": "Life in the HDB heartlands can be a real bitch. Especially when every uncle, auntie, ah beng, foreign worker, ang moh and maid out there wants to eat your flesh. It's 28 days - or at least we think it's 28 - after the zombie apocalypse. This is Jim: Ghim Moh resident, undergraduate and apocalypse survivor. Sanctuary is waiting in Tiong Bahru, but there are five million very hungry meat munchers in the way. And all he's got to fend them off with is his parang and a backpack. Sure, there's Selina the crazy girl with the tattoos and Raj the law graduate to help out. But it doesn't mean they can't get infected. Welcome to the brand new Singapore, where meat munchers and wayangs roam the land, and you'd better have a weapon ready. After all, when there's no more government to complain to, survival is your own problem.",
