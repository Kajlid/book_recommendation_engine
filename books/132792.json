  "description": "Even the greatest assassin in the galaxy had to start somewhere. Snatched up and whisked away light years from home, young Bawb finds himself thrust into an entirely new life. One filled with brutal training, sweat, and pain, where injury and even death are a terrifying reality. With abilities he didnâ€™t know he possessed manifesting under the extreme pressure, one thing was certain. Like it or not, this was his destiny. It would be a difficult path, but if he survived the myriad challenges ahead, he might become a full-fledged member of the Order. Possibly something more. But when the curious boy stumbles headfirst into a mystery the likes of which even the great Masters of the Order had failed to solve, it becomes abundantly clear something more was lurking in these walls than just physical and mental challenges. Something that could change his fate forever. Author Note: This series follows the origins and adventures of Bawb, a fan favorite character from the Bad Luck Charlie books (the Dragon Mage series). This series contains no spoilers for the Charlie series. You do not need to have read the Charlie books first. Also related to this series is the Space Assassins series, which takes place directly before these books. The Space Assassins series is closely related and many characters from that series also appear in these books. Note that there are some spoilers if you have not read the Space Assassins series first, but none that I feel will ruin that series.",
