  "description": "Meet me… in the place where the sun kisses the horizon and sinks into blue shades of you and me.Meet me there… where everything was always perfect. You and me and the damp grass at dawn and the gray dirt in the late evening rain.Meet me where we were ourselves and not these two people who can’t even say I love you.Meet me there and maybe we’ll remember…We’ll remember the us we were before them, before miles, before lost hours, and you’ll ask what color the sky is, and I’ll say blue like your eyes.And you’ll smile, and I’ll forget I ever missed you.****Luka and Rook have been best friends since they were nine years old.Five years ago, Luka threw it all away.When his dad’s health takes a turn for the worst, Luka must come home to say his goodbyes and mend the bridges he burned all those years ago. But coming home is harder than he imagined, and after reuniting with his family, there’s only one person he needs.Rook…His best friend.The one man he pushed away, the one man, no matter how hard he tried to forget, he can't stop himself from loving.Even if loving him means breaking his heart all over again.",
