  "title": "Eating People Is Wrong",
  "description": "Forty-year-old university professor Stuart Treece is rather set in his ways, and in the midst of the changing attitudes of the '50s, his encounters with the younger generation are making him feel decidedly alien. When he falls disastrously in love with one of his students all his efforts to acclimatize are hilariously undermined.Timeless and brilliant, Eating People is Wrong is Malcolm Bradbury's first novel, and established him as a master of satire.",
