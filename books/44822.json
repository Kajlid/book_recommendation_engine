Her hope lies with immortal Templar Knight Lucan. Her life depends on oaths she knows nothing about. For countless centuries, Lucan of Seacourt has lived with the knowledge that his brother killed their family. Now, as Azazel's darkness eats away at his soul, old betrayal stirs suspicion. He trusts no one. Not even the seraph who can heal his dying spirit. With the fate of the Almighty hanging in the balance, Lucan must find faith in something more terrifying than the dark lord's creations. He must learn to believe his heart.At the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.",
