  "description": "During one fateful night of death and loss, twenty years ago, Mitchell lost almost everything he held dear. Not only were his parents murdered, but his younger brothers were kidnapped and thought lost forever. Since then, Mitchell has not only had to lead the felines in rebuilding their society, but he’s had to protect them from future attacks. This leaves little time for his own wants and needs. Being the second born, wolf Shifter Dean, has always lived to serve others. He’s never disobeyed orders, even when one of them dictated that he had to give up a man he loved. Broken and alone, Dean vowed never to open his heart to another. Then both of their lives are turned upside down when it’s discovered that a rogue wolf from Dean’s pack is holding one of Mitchell’s lost brothers captive. The men find they have no choice but to work together to save him. That’s easier said than done since wolves and felines have never gotten along. That doesn’t stop Dean and Mitchell for falling for each other and after one night of passion, things change between them forever. But will duty and honor keep them from their happily ever after? If so, will either man be able to recover from the loss?",
