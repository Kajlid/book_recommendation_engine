  "description": "My mother warned me Jolie West was forbidden. Of course, I didn’t listen. Because all it took was one look at the girl with flaming, fiery hair, and I was captivated.Enthralled by her beauty and the blaze I saw burning behind her blue eyes.From the first touch of her warm skin, I was burned.Singed.That is until one conversation with my father turned my world upside down. He let me know I had family duties that I couldn’t walk away from.I went from fire to ice and broke mine and Jolie’s hearts.It’s what was best for her.Me? Not so much.My soul was lost the day I sent her away.Vowed right there she would forever own it. Even if, she’d never know.That was years ago when we were just teenagers. Not a day has gone by that I don’t crave her. Miss that spark that made a man like me come alive.I thought I was protecting her until I wasn’t. Someone hurt Jolie, and I won’t rest until I find out who.Now that she’s back in my life, I won’t let her go.Consequences be damned, I’m finally going to claim what’s mine.",
