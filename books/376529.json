  "description": "In David Martin's rollicking romp, playfully illustrated by Randy Cecil, little ones can follow the actions of animal babies and discover all the wonderful ways their bodies can move.We've got ears, and you do too.We can pull them.Can you?We've all got hands for clapping, necks for stretching, and feet for kicking. We've all got eyes that close and mouths that open (and often do). But best of all, as this colorful menagerie is happy to display, we've all got bellybuttons â€” for tickle-tickle-tickling!",
