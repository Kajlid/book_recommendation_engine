Sweetbreath is the second mystery of the Allie Lindell series— a story of family secrets, murder, crooked insurance schemes, drugs, chocolate cravings and chocolate-chocolate chip cookies that are to die for.

But at what price? Her relationship with her life partner begins to unravel, and she is forced to make a choice. Restless with her job as an at-home mom, Allie misses the crazy deadlines, office banter, even rush hour traffic. With the lure of chocolate, it’s just too much and Allie makes the biggest move of her adult life.She investigates the possible murder and quickly learns there is a not-so-sweet side of the business world. As her own family begs her to back away, Allie finds she can’t. She’s her own worst enemy but with the best intentions. Nothing in life is ever easy as Allie learns it’s not just candy to die for—it just might be worth killing over. Following the scent of a murderer and chocolate, Allie is soon in over her head. This time, her sweet tooth just might get her killed and her hero is the most unlikely of the bunch.",
