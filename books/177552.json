  "description": "Angel Weiss can’t believe that her old friend Brian has stood her up at their wedding, for a stripper no less, ruining her plans to collect on some old college bet money. If you can’t trust a man to follow through on a fake wedding, who can you trust? So maybe she is a little uptight and suppressed, as Brian points out, but after watching her father run through six wives, she can’t help but be a little bit of a control freak. Who never intends to get married for real. Rick Dengler did the marriage thing and the only good thing that came out of it was his daughter.Otherwise, it just left him broke and disillusioned. So he isn’t looking for anything but illegal campers when he’s doing rounds through the park on his job as a ranger. What he finds is a sexy blonde in heels frozen in the path of a black bear.Which leads to them both covered in poison ivy. Which leads to stripping down to what nature intended in a heart shaped hot tub. Which leads Angel and Rick to conclude that maybe they’re not out of the woods yet when it comes to falling in love with a person all wrong for you..",
