Brijit and Kelly huddle in their underground shelter, safe from the nuclear winter that darkens the Earth. Life is easy underground but they must face the reality of a new and hostile world. Radioactive ruins and hostile survivalists are the least of their worries when the land starts to empty of warm bodies for Brijit to feed from. When there are no more humans or animals, where can Brijit turn to feed herself and keep her sanity?",
