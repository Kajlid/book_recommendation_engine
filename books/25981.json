  "description": "Being relocated to a small-town PD in Colorado was the last thing I needed. Being assigned to babysit the captain's daughter didn't help either. She's quirky, young, and unfortunately, the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. Cap only has one rule. Keep my hands to myself. Turns out to be harder than it looks. Now I live in her house, and at night I hear her cries. She's haunted by her dreams just like I'm haunted by my past. She may be crazy, or she may be the only key to unlocking the dark secrets of this town. The clock is ticking, and the closer we get, the more dangerous it becomes. We both heard the captain's warning loud and clear......too bad neither of us listened.Book 1 of the Timber Creek Series. Series will contain interconnected standalones.",
