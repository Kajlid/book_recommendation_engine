  "description": "Rose Allison Flynn grew out of her troubled childhood, went to college, became a teacher, married a lawyer, raised two children and didn’t ask any questions. For 37 years. Facebook led her to Jake, the now long-married boyfriend she left in 1969 and the Internet fields their emotional reunion. Rose wants more from life and Jake feeds her passion online, but makes no promises. How the two characters deal with their love and longing through texts and private chat boxes is poignant. Set in the traditional Midwest and Southwest, Rose’s poetry and the creation of a novel within a novel make this a unique and timeless love story.READER REVIEWS\"Cheryl's book reminded me of THE BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, this is a terrific read!\"- Jerry D. Simmons, Former Time Warner Publishing Executive\"Television was the only screen in the house when Rose and Jake first fell in love. But Rose left Jake. Pay phones became cell phones, letters became email and computer technology put Rose and Jake face-to-face in a love story that is electric, passionate and fated. Leave your keyboards and pick up your eReaders for this adventure in romance!\"- Mary L. Holden, editor and writer",
