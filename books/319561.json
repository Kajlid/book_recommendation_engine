  "title": "The Running Trees",
  "description": "A striking original, deftly humorous collection of stories that considers the quest for truth: how we come to it or alternatively avoid it.A fervently comic debut, The Running Trees leads readers into a series of conversations — through phonelines, acts in a play, and a rewound recording of a police interrogation — to reveal characters in fumbling bouts of brutality, reflection, isolation, and love.The relationship between two siblings disintegrates after one asks the other for the pen; a professor and his former student get drinks years after a \"romantic\" encounter; a book club meets only to find that they have wildly different opinions about a new memoir about their town; and a long-haired feline contemplates existence and consciousness while his cohabitant licks his butthole.Whimsical, unconventional, humorous, and always pitch-perfect, The Running Trees explores how we desperately try to communicate with each other amid the gaps in meaning we create",
