  "title": "My Too Tight Vagina",
  "description": "Vaginismus is the involuntary contraction of the vaginal muscles during sex. It's a psychological disorder that causes the woman's vagina to 'close shut' at the sign of penetration. In the tensed up state, inserting anything into the vagina (from a tampon to a penis) is very painful, and sometimes impossible. Many people with vaginismus will define their attempts at sex as 'hitting a wall'. Their vagina is impassible, often thought to be 'too tight'. My name is Dawn, and I have vaginismus. Within this book you will find the sexually explicit, provocative, and controversial details of my twenty-three years of life. I hold nothing back as I tell the world about my life, living with vaginismus and all of the struggles, triumphs, and heartaches I've felt as I've learned to love, and let others love, my too tight vagina.",
