  "description": "Hi, I'm Nancy Drew, and I've got a case to crack. Actually make that two cases. First a gorgeous Faberg√© egg has been stolen. Who would have the heart to snatch such a precious family heirloom from someone new to town? Some housewarming that is!  And if this isn't enough to keep me busy, someone's running through gardens and stomping on all the zucchinis. Needless to say, it's a big mess -- in more ways than one. Especially for Mr. Safer, who is suspected of squishing the squash. I'm pretty sure Mr. Safer's innocent. But who's the real vegetable vandal?",
