  "description": "Would you surrender your soul for love of the King?Lena has protected human souls all her life. As a Vampire and a Guardian of the Order, it is her honour-bound duty. In the war against the Fallen, acting first and thinking second is what's saved her skin time and time again, but her disregard for orders soon catches up with her when her boss is seriously injured because of her own, selfish mistake. Forced to take responsibility for her actions, and lead a team of Guardians who don't trust her, Lena is thrust back into the Vampire court and the path of her very own kryptonite; Thorn. The raw power of his soul calls to her and his mere presence lights a fire within her that she cannot contain. With Vampire magic waning and the race in crisis, can either of them afford to ignore Nature's call? If they do, the future of the race is in jeopardy. If they don't, they will both lose the most precious part of themselves; their souls.",
