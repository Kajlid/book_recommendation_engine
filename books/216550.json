  "description": "Debbie Macomber takes readers to Promise, a ranching community deep in the Texas hill country. A good place to raise a family, Promise still has a few secrets hidden beneath its everyday exterior. In the third book of the Heart of Texas series, the question is: Who's the father of Caroline's child? Everyone in Promise wants to know, but no one's ever asked or ever will. Maggie's five now, and Caroline Daniels has kept her silence all these years. It doesn't change how the people in this community feel about Caroline. They're protective of her and Maggie; they care. Especially rancher Grady Weston, who's beginning to realize he more than just cares. Original.",
