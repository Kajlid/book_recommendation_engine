  "description": "When Nani val Dynia awakens in the jungles of Brazil, she has no idea who she is or how she came to the tiny missionary hospital. The only clues to her past lie in the whispered words of a village elder and a forgotten necklace buried at the bottom of a flour jar. Three years later a group of six teenagers unexpectedly find themselves bound for the same Brazilian jungle, where they meet Nani val Dynia and learn of her strange past. What seems to be an accident whisks the seven friends off to the world of Milana where they quickly find themselves under threat from the Hunters of Avoria.  The Pillar of Light follows Nani and her friends as they seek to unravel her past, discover a way home, and find their place in a strange new world as The Legends of Milana begin to unfold.",
