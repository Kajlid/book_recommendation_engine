  "description": "\"There was no “after work” or “vacation”. We were never truly “off”, or at least that’s how it felt. Our obligation was to help, anybody at anytime.The tragedy of 9/11 was still fresh in our minds, and we had an elevated sense of paranoia. It didn’t help that Vegas SWAT responded weekly to calls downtown, and the cops and FD's always needed us for something.Combine that, with the two million people in Clark County who called “911” throughout the year, and you’ve got one hundred thirty-five, full-time EMT’s with a five-year life expectancy.\" - Armando Almase.Synopsis:The profession of a first responder, whether a police officer, fire fighter, or ambulance attendant, is usually a thankless one. We don’t do it for the recognition or the money, both of which are very minimal anyway. The reason is usually more complicated than we admit. Sometimes, what lures us in turns out to be an insignificant reason for why we stay. “Helping people”—you’ll hear that a lot. It turns out there are very few people we can actually help. “Saving lives”—you’ll hear that too, but statistically, the odds are not in favor. No, if we manage to stay with it long enough, those reasons aren’t enough to keep us going. There’s a subtle transition most of us don’t notice, but ultimately, the job becomes about our partner and the people we work with; most of us see them as a second family. It’s also about holding on to a single feeling: hope.In 2002, Armando Almase began working for a private ambulance company in Las Vegas, Nevada. As some claimed, the average job burnout for an ambulance attendant in Las Vegas was five years. Armando pushed his way through six, providing medical treatment and transportation to over 12,000 men, women, and children.",
