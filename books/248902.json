  "description": "It's a Wild West story, but it's also a love story. A young man, Cole Flynn, just 14 years old, rides into trouble when he stops at a ranch just outside Las Vegas, New Mexico, the meanest, wildest town in the Territory. He stops to ask for some water for himself and his animals and meets a young widow who's cattle are being stolen by a gang of outlaws. Cole decides to help her and takes on the toughest gang in the land. He kills one in a fair gunfight, and the Purvis gang comes after him, repeatedly trying to kill him. At one point, they kidnap the young widow, and Cole ups the stakes and dynamites the saloon owned by the gang's leader. He frees the widow and they ride off to make a life for themselves, but John Purvis, the gang's leader is vengeful. He repeatedly sends men to kill Cole, who has to be on constant alert or face his own demise.",
