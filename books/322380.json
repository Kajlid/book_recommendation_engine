  "description": "The world gave me everything.  After surviving a plane crash, I was lucky to be alive. It was a harsh truth, but one that changed my perspective on how fragile life could be.So when a fellow survivor caught my eye, I owed it to myself to take a chance and follow my heart. Bowen Michaels was guarded and broody, but I saw through his well-formed armor. Much like me, he was broken and lost, but together we found our way through the darkness. For a brief moment, wrapped in his arms, it felt like maybe he was right about fate and we’d been destined to find each other all along. But when buried secrets of the past erupt, igniting us both, it was hard to believe we’d been fated for anything other than failure. The world gave me everything. And then it took it all away.",
