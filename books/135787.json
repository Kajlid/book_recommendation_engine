  "description": "Death was said to have been born from a whisper, but Cerina Black had not made any sound at all when she’d been named his servant. Tied to the Death God by her unknown heritage, she is not only bound in eternal servitude to him, but cursed to know death, too. Everyone’s death. A burden she cannot seem to find the remedy for. After receiving a letter of admission to attend Arcane Academy, a school for the most magically gifted, she begins questioning every step that brought her this far. The life she leaves behind is just as blurry as the future ahead when she begins her first year as a Divination and Necromancy student. Nothing is as it seems in Arcane. While Cerina grapples with her magical abilities, she finds herself part of a conspiracy to free an imprisoned Demon God who once again wishes to gain control of the realm and many more. Amongst the evil she has to fight in order to escape the hunt of those hungering for her strange powers, she also finds the devil. The devil wears no disguise in Arcadia, not unless he is haunting you. And Damon Hawthorne was haunting her. The Prince of Hell seeks to leave his past behind while she delves into hers, only for both of them to find each other entangled in it. Who will betray the other first? Unless they both do. Welcome to Arcane, Class of '380. Watch the shadows. Or they will watch you. \nCity of Alabaster\n is a standalone dark fantasy novel with elements of dark academia, part of the \nDaughters of Chaos\n series, which will contain several other standalones taking place in the world of \nValinhel\n.",
