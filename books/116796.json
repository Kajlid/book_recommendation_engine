  "description": "Arcanum Mutatio is an 8,000 word short story.Life outside of the capital city is fraught with danger, especially as the night sets in. The township of Clearwater can rest easy knowing that they not only have a Red Order Master Hunter, but his two apprentices patrolling the area for demons who may have broken through the front lines into one of the last havens known to humanity. William Mathers is fed up with playing sidekick to Seth Wright and Astral Daamon, both established as skilled demon hunters at an early age. Instead of training with his companions, he opts to learn an ancient transformation ritual which he believes will give him an edge over his competition. But can he do it without losing his humanity in the process?",
