  "description": "As the only Beckett cousin who is still unattached, I'm a shoo-in to win the bet with my cousins to be the last man blissfully not in love by Christmas. Of course, I know they're still going to make me follow the rules of our bet and go on six dates with the same womanâ€”but I've figured out a way out of that too. I'm getting married. Is it love? Not even close. Chelle Finch needs a temporary husband and I need to win this bet. We agree to put a ring on it knowing that in six months this marriage of convenience will end in divorce. Except, somehow dating my wife has me realizing that I don't ever want to take this ring off if it means losing her.  What does the guy who can talk his way out of anything have to do to sweet talk his temporary wife into forever?",
