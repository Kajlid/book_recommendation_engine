  "description": "Come one, come all, to the circus of death. My name is Thana. I’ve never really fit in anywhere. A loner, a loser, invisible to everyone, even my parents. Except him. When he sees me, he decides to invite me to his unique family. When the ringmaster has his sights set on you, you can’t run. You can’t escape. The circus is a freakshow, a place where nothing is what it seems. Blood, death, depravity and desperation; you’ll find it all beneath the red tents. In a place where death is not the end, how can anyone dare to find happiness? I guess I’m about to find out. I don’t have a choice. Because when you die, this circus keeps you… *Circus of Death is a 42,000 word novella, and it includes graphic scenes of violence, along with steamy scenes. This is a MFM romance and contains other themes some might find dark. Read at your own risk. *",
