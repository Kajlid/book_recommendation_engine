  "description": "The fiction thriller and suspense novel takes from recent history about a fanatical religious rebel group, called the Lords Resistance Army (LRA), fighting against the Ugandan Government with a reputation for using abducted children as highly effective but brutal army. The novel challenges how the Developed Western world would treat their children if they were caught up in a war in a foreign country where the child was forced to take up arms to fight to survive. How would the parents rationalise this and what actions would they take in desperation? How would the politicians react and rationalise this and what actions would they be forced to take to appease their constituents?Two teenagers from two very different cultures (one from a high achieving middle-class Australian family); each going through their own vastly different personal struggles who meet for very different reasons and become bonded in friendship and childhood experiences in a blissful and an adventurous world of village life. However, an unexpected attack by the LRA now forces each child to respond based on their upbringing and intuition surfacing the very essence of their humanity which emerges in the terrifying rebel attack. What if they were forced to take sides that were unexpected? what would be the outcomes and how would their parents and governments respond? A gripping finale to a very divergent beginning, full of suspense, and unpredictable directions.",
