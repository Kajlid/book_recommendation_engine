  "description": "On a brisk autumn day in 1686, eighteen-year-old Nella Oortman arrives in Amsterdam to begin a new life as the wife of the illustrious merchant trader Johannes Brandt. However, her new home—while splendorous—is anything but welcoming. Johannes is kind yet distant, always locked away in his study or at his warehouse office, leaving Nella alone with his sister, the sharp-tongued and forbidding Marin.But Nella's world begins to shift when Johannes presents her with an extraordinary wedding gift: a cabinet-sized replica of their home. To furnish this miniature gift, Nella seeks the services of a miniaturist—an elusive and enigmatic artist whose tiny creations mirror their real-life counterparts in eerie and unexpected ways.Johannes' gift helps Nella to pierce the closed world of the Brandt household. As she uncovers its unusual secrets, she begins to understand—and fear—the escalating dangers that await them all. In this repressively pious society, where gold is worshipped second only to God, being different is considered a threat to the moral fabric of society. Not even a man as wealthy as Johannes is immune to this.Only one person seems to see the fate that awaits them. Is the miniaturist the key to their salvation—or the architect of their destruction?Enchanting, beautiful, and exquisitely suspenseful, The Miniaturist is a magnificent story of love and obsession, betrayal and retribution, appearance and truth.",
