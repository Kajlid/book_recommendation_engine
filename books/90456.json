  "title": "Relict",
  "description": "Four leisure travelers boat their way to Palmer Atoll, deep in the inky heart of the Pacific Ocean, hell and gone from anywhere, not guessing that they have stumbled upon the lair of something ancient and terrible. It watches them from the tropical waters, a lurking evil with an endless appetite: a monstrous, many-armed thing, a species of a bygone age with a golden gaze. Set in an exotic, remote island purgatory-paradise, \"Relict\" is a hybrid horror novella that grips you tightly in its clutches and won't let you go.",
