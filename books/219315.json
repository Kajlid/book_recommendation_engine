  "description": "A princess has no choice.Winter is fading, and the east is moving in.When a company of Slavic noblemen travel into the principality of Postich, Germania Princess Lillith feels only one thingâ€”fear.Being high society, being royalty, such a feeling is foreign to her, though not as foreign as the tall, raven-haired nephew of the Slav King...But when he looks at her with dark eyes of severe indifference, the fear becomes something more than she can bear. Beyond the race of her heart and the weakness of knees...the sweet terror makes her virginity weep.Taken by the Slav is the first in a medieval romance series that seduces the limits of choice, love, and the risk to be had in defying it all.19,000+ word * Historical Erotica * Adult Content",
