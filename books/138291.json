  "description": "The long-awaited second book in the AGU: Border Patrol series, resumes the storyline of the first book. The severely damaged SC Destroyer Perry, nearly destroyed while battling the Clidepp destroyer Glassama, is awaiting the arrival of a Space Command ship-transporter vessel, which will convey it to the Mars shipyard for repairs. Meanwhile, the supreme rebel leader, known only as X to preserve his true identity, decides that Space Command's involvement in the affairs of the Clidepp Rebels was totally unacceptable. Conveniently ignoring the fact that his people illegally entered GA Space to perpetrate an attack on a diplomatic vessel, he believes the Spaccs had no business getting involved. He conceives a diabolical plan to exact his revenge against Space Command while using them to promote his revolutionary agenda.",
