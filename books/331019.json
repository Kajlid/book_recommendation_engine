  "description": "Sometimes your dream guy isn’t who you think he is. Sem has been stalking me for months. He shows up everywhere I am and lurks in the background, his eyes always on me. I don’t understand his fascination with me, but he won’t leave me alone. He’s definitely not my type. He’s too big, too reckless, and too feral. But then one night he breaks into my apartment and dares me to do something crazy and I can’t say no. Then I do it again. And again. Now it seems we’re both addicted to this secret little game. But when I begin to see the man beneath the brutish exterior, will falling in love prove to be the most reckless bet yet?",
