  "description": "What will the greatest ruling family in the history of the galaxy be like?When the studious, determined microengineer Lady Felicia Sorensen is asked to partner Emperor Victor Sinclair at a ball, little does she realize that her world is about to be overturned. Sick of the socialites who can only see his status, the Emperor falls madly in love with her. But she is so single-minded in her dedication to her scientific career that she treads, more than once, on his most painful memories and psychological issues!Nevertheless, he is so determined to have her that he entices her with all the resources at his command, from sexual stimulation and outrageously expensive gowns to promising her that she can ‘write her own job description’. Is it love, or is it manipulation? Felicia does not want to be merely the source of ova for the Imperial Heir, nor does she like being the center of attention. And an assassination attempt proves that the publicity of being an Imperial fiancée means her mere presence generates continuous danger, even from rival scientists on other planets!Will Felicia choose her Imperial lover and tough out the extreme political and social pressures with the supreme ruler of the Empire, or will she choose her goals and help thousands, millions, possibly billions of people through her intellectual achievements?This science fiction romance is the first of the seven-part To Be Sinclair series. The saga begins with DIGNITY and its companion volume MAJESTY, which describe the romance and first years of marriage of the Emperor and Empress of the Sinclair Demesnes. A few scenes describe sexually explicit behavior.",
