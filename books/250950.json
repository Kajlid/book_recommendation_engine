  "title": "White Guys on Campus: Racism, White Immunity, and the Myth of \"Post-Racial\" Higher Education",
  "description": "Winner of the 2019 AERA Division J Outstanding Publication Award and the 2019 ASHE Outstanding Book AwardOn April 22, 2015, Boston University professor Saida Grundy set off a Twitter storm with her provocative “Why is white America so reluctant to identify white college males as a problem population?” White Guys on Campus is a critical examination of race in higher education, centering Whiteness, in an effort to unveil the frequently unconscious habits of racism among White male undergraduates. Nolan L. Cabrera moves beyond the “few bad apples” frame of contemporary racism, and explores the structures, policies, ideologies, and experiences that allow racism to flourish. This book details many of the contours of contemporary, systemic racism, while engaging the possibility of White students to participate in anti-racism. Ultimately, White Guys on Campus calls upon institutions of higher education to be sites of social transformation instead of reinforcing systemic racism, while creating a platform to engage and challenge the public discourse of “post- racialism.”",
