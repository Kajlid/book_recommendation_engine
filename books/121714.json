  "description": "For a century, the Americans and Soviets had maintained an uneasy alliance based on the CoDominium, a world order in which no other power or combination of powers could threaten their mutual hegemony. Thus did the Americans and Russians learn to live at peace with each other.But nothing lasts forever, the CoDominium's energies are nearly spent, and internal conflicts are ripping it apart. The future belongs to colony worlds like Spartaâ€”if they can survive the death-throes of Earth's civilization.To do that they will need men who understand the art of war, men like mercenary commander John Christian Falkenberg, and Lysander, Prince of Sparta, the first Prince of Mercenaries. This is their story, as told by Jerry Pournelle, best-selling author of military science fiction.",
