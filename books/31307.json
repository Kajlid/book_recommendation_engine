  "description": "The star that led the three wise men could be the same star wished upon by those longing for a wish to come true. In the opening novella, \"Christmas Child,\" 15-year-old Melanie feels cheated when her baby sister, born at Christmastime, lives only a few days. But the brief life of her sister shows Melanie the lasting value of love. Brenda struggles between noble intentions and real desires when she becomes the last chance for happiness for a dying boy in \"Last Dance.\" The final story, \"Kathy's Life,\" describes a girl who appears to have it all. Kathy is beautiful, intelligent, and has the perfect job as a live-in caregiver for a couple's baby boy. But not everything is as perfect as it seems: Should Kathy give up the one person she loves most in the world?",
