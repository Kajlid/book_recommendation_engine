  "description": "Naddie works down on the farm, but there isn't livestock here or fields of vegetables growing. This is a farm for the dead. Naddie and a team of doctors study death and decay in order to help police investigations and in the understanding of how we change in death. But something is wrong at the farm. A new body has been brought in and defies all previous notions of what happens once a person dies. What happens is enough to make Naddie not only question her beliefs, but her sanity as well.",
