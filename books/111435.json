  "title": "On The Verge",
  "description": "A satirical novel written mostly as poems, On The Verge tells the story of Tom, a young and environmentally idealistic hitch-hiker who is picked up by the huge, bad tempered and reactionary truck-driver Arno. As the ill-matched pair journey together over two days, their adventures become ever more surreal, the poet Tom fantasizing about Arno's teenage daughter, and being haunted by images of a unicorn. The line between reality and Tom's bizarre, drug-addled poetic imagination becomes blurred. The book is being sold to raise funds for a rhino conservation project in Africa.",
