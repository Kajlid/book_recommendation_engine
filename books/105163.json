  "description": "A few months have passed since Charlotte Johnson stumbled upon the existence of magic. A few months since she forced her way into a hidden society of magic-users and dragon-studiers.A few months since she helped Professor Mediochre Q Seth bring down an international smuggling ring.And since Mediochre Q Seth fled from her life entirely, taking with him her last reliable link to the new world of adventure she had uncovered.Now, for good or ill, a strange body and a familiar face in Charlotte’s own neighbourhood grant her a way right back into the middle of everything she thought she’d lost – and this time, she’s not letting go. But the Mantically Aware world might be more dangerous than before now, and for an inexperienced party like Charlotte, it could be fatal – or worse. Strange things are happening in the Undead community, and a lot of the humans don’t like it. As things become increasingly less black-and-white, Charlotte and Mediochre are going to need all the help they can get to work out who the real bad guys are, without becoming a part of the problem themselves...",
