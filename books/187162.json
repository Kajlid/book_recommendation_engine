  "description": "What's more fun than a barrel of monkeys?\"Twenty Chimps on a Plane\"... and the nine other darkly humorous short stories contained in John Elray's latest work, You Thought You Had It Bad.In \"Twenty Chimps on a Plane\", retired Air Force pilot and wannabe animal psychologist Daniel Grundwasser seeks to prove a bona-fide animal behaviorist wrong by showing that twenty chimpanzees can be perfect angels when taken on an afternoon charter flight. Wanna bet?Then there's \"The Resurrection\", where one man's religious devotion has unexpected consequences for himself and his family as their world collides with that of the Living Dead. (The Pope loved it!)And just when you thought things couldn't get any more over the top, Elray hits you with \"The Earwax Fairy\", in which a young girl talks her father into a role play that gets him into a world of trouble.That's only a sample of the antics in this satirical, off-beat collection of side-splitting tales by a writer who takes his humor very seriously.Wickedly funny and irreverent, You Thought You Had It Bad is guaranteed to make you think twice about drawing that razor blade across your wrist, chambering that bullet, or making a meal of your bottle of sleeping pills. You'll want to stick around if for no other reason than to read Volume 2 (coming soon!). Hilarious, and well worth forgoing today's Big Mac lunch to buy it. After all, laughter is by far the best medicine. 127 pages.Contents:Part 2 - God Returns In His UFOHanguk Yoja Bangu Hato ClubThe ResurrectionTwenty Chimps On A PlaneThe Earwax FairyHigh ImpactWelcome To Red SquareJackpotWhen We Were MonkeysMeet The Antichrist",
