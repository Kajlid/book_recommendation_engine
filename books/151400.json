Her father cofounded the digital mapping company, and he died for it—on a cartographic expedition he didn’t even need to take.

And being with Connor, an old childhood friend, turns out to be the only thing that makes Tanya feel normal again. Soon she’s spending every moment she can with Connor. But when they sneak into her father’s old office late one night, they stumble across a deadly secret. The next day Connor disappears.Tanya isn’t just bereft; she’s terrified. It’s clear that people at MapOut are willing to kill for what she and Connor discovered.
