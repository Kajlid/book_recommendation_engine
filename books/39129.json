  "description": "Wands are for pretenders. Staffs for the impotent. Magic is an Art, and the only thing a real Wizard uses to create is his mind. Joshua Awen casts spells as easily as he argues the theory behind them. During the school year he's a prodigy, but the summers are a different story. He chooses to spend those in a place where he can't work with the subtle, complex, and powerful force he was born to. He trains to fight with a simpler, rougher, brutal kind of magic. The summer before his senior year Joshua has to do more than train. He's asked to use his full range of abilities to help the man who taught him how to fight. The consequences of his decision force Joshua to delve into the nature of his magic and reconsider what he believes a Wizard should do with his power. This text is only 25,000 words long.",
