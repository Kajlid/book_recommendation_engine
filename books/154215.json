  "description": "Some Doors Should Never be Opened A mother gone missing … A desperate family in turmoil, offered a second chance … A forbidden room where terrible secrets are screaming to be heard … When Scott Dawson’s wife, Holly, disappears, leaving her family at the brink of bankruptcy, the last thing Scott expects is a helping hand from nowhere, a rich and never before mentioned Uncle Alastair. Uncle Alastair is dead, but his will promises to save them all — if the Dawsons follow its stipulations. 1) Scott must live in the ancient estate with his children, Hudson and Hazel. 2) The children can never leave the grounds at the same time. 3) And no matter what, no one is allowed in the basement. Will a sprawling estate haunted by yesterday’s ghosts and devastating secrets help a struggling family finally overcome all that life has thrown at them, or will it be the Dawsons’ undoing?",
