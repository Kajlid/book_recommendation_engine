  "title": "Hostile Living",
  "description": "Giving in to every indulgence and piece of bare flesh was what the city demanded. In Nottingham where carnal delights and discarded clothing mixed with enough alcohol to sink the British island, a hostel was erected as a Mecca for pilgrims of pleasure and new experiences to find shelter. All too familiar with the city and its influence, Will takes his place amid the hostel residents to finish university and get on with his life. But finding a balance between work and pleasure isnâ€™t an easy task when the city demands playtime. Trapped in uninhibited living, what he doesn't expect is that life holds more than nightly episodes. And when a lovely face catches his eye, he is forced to choose between a delusion of weekend fulfillment and the growing desire for something real.",
