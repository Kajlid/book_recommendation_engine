To secure his future Dorian has to finish the masterpiece his father started over 20 years ago, but there’s a problem. Dorian is an artist who has got to know his models intimately before he can capture them on canvas, but Dorian is a connoisseur of dark delights and has a very particular taste in women. The muses Dorian requires are a rarity, and with time running out he has to find seven further women before the Saul family inheritance is lost forever. Carla is a divorcee and a runaway. Slightly overweight, 32 years old and lacking in confidence she is surprised when her sultry new neighbour Suzie recommends that she takes a job as an artist’s muse. Nervous, terrified but desperate for money Carla is left with no choice but to take the job and attend the sittings. In his studio Dorian takes Carla on an erotic journey that will not only reveal the true nature of her sexuality but will change her life forever. Adam is a successful lawyer and he is also Dorian’s brother. Adam has a vested interest in the completion of Dorian's masterpiece and has taken it upon himself to ensure that his brother finishes the painting, whatever the costs. Contains BDSM, MMF - 56k words. The Third Muse is written for people over the age of 18.BDSM Book Reviews: http://tinyurl.com/lrfsszh",
