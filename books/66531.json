I have, for a very long time! Many people talk about this but I have not met many who can explain how to actually LIVE this in simple, straightforward terms. Well, I finally found someone, Odille Rault, who has written a book that does just this. \"BEYOND THE MAGIC PILL explains how to change those destructive, negative thoughts and feelings we all have about ourselves, into Loving, positive thoughts and feelings.

As I read this book, I felt as if she was writing about \"my\" life! I laughed, I cried, and I learned that I could change my perception of myself and others into a much more Loving and productive thought process. Unconditional Love! How many times have I heard or read that this was how we are meant to LIVE? Too many to count! But never before have I found the pathway leading to this way of Life, until now! :O) Odille has blessed us with her profound wisdom, and if you want to change the way you feel about yourself and others, her book will help you. If you are willing to do the work she details in her exercises, you will be able to change your entire life. You will learn to Love yourself unconditionally and you will be able to Love others this way, too, no matter what the circumstances are around you. You will be able to LOVE UNCONDITIONALLY, NO MATTER WHAT! Peace and Love amongst the chaos!
