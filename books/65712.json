  "description": "A story of alien abduction to the interior of the moon. A group of young people set out on a simple kayaking holiday in New Zealand. Threatened by an earthquake and an ensuing tsunami, their only apparent means of escape is to enter a series of tunnels they find at the foot of a cliff. Trapped in the tunnels, they discover technology that is clearly beyond the capability of current human science and knowledge. They begin to suspect that the tunnels have been created and are perhaps controlled by a superior alien life form. What they don't know is that they are now the subjects of an experiment. An experiment that was started to determine whether intellectual advancement of the human race was possible. Disappointed in the results the aliens were now considering whether mankind should even exist as a universal life form. Their actions and behaviour could result in the obliteration of the human race, the final nail in the coffin of mankind.",
