  "description": "Sydney Cove, 1799: it is three years since Governor Phillip departed. Against a background of continuing convict settlement, hunger, rebellion and the terrifying force of barely understood land, the saga of Ellen Prentice and het Mannion family continues. Stephen Mannion marries the lovely Conor Moore, and Johnny Prentice goes bush - to re-emerge for one last confrontation with his old master.An outstanding literary achievement, meticulously researched and deeply felt, The Timeless Land trilogy remains an unrivalled portrait of the earliest days of European settlement in Australia. Eleanor Dark used actual journals, letters and other historical documents to create her story and breathe life into a range of characters historical and fictional, white and black, free and in bondage.",
