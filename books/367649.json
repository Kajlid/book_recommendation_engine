Whenever her parents have a shouting match, the pressure of running for freshperson class president gets overwhelming, or her beautiful (and short) sister calls her a giraffe, grabbing a handful of red nuts somehow helps. Cassie has medicine for her asthma attacks; why not have a prescription for \"unhappiness attacks\"?",
