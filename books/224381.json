  "title": "Park Ranger Sequel: More True Stories From a Ranger's Career in America's National Parks",
  "description": "In this, Nancy's second collection of her real-life adventures as a Park Ranger and as a city medic, she tells of births, deaths and life prolonged in between in her inimitable style. There's a great chapter on her training at FLETC, the federal law enforcement training school. She ventures further afield to Mt. Kilimanjaro (yes, we are aware it's not an American National Park but it's a good story) and writes about a solo expedition she made more recently in the snowy wilds of California. If you've never ventured off a tarmac trail or if you spend all your time in the wild, you can enjoy this book and learn a lot in the process.",
