  "title": "The Heir",
  "description": "As his elderly relative lay dying, insurance salesman Mr. Chase stands in the wings, waiting to inherit the manor of the soon to be deceased. Yet once in possession, Chase deems the home entirely impractical and a burden whose only useful purpose is to be sold for capital. For him, the house holds none of the charm that had so beguiled its former mistress. But as the wheels are set in motion for the sale, an inexplicable change begins to take place within him, and soon Chase finds himself falling deeply—and irrevocably—in love with the very house he had once so scorned.",
