  "description": "In a dying forest - infested with bark beetles - impish, stick creatures called Twigs are forced to hide in a cave, or be devoured by ravenous barkbiters! A young Twig named Leaf attempts a foolhardy rescue, but instead he leads them all into greater danger. Now they are pursued by barkbiters and fire! Still, the Twigs have courageous companions. Three loyal salamanders and a fearless, misplaced chameleon guard the Twigs as they escape over a barren ridge. In their darkest moments, a spirit bear stalks them. And the barkbiters are relentless. Soon the firestorm panics all the forest creatures! But there is one passage south, if only the Twigs discover it in time! Illustrated by David Murray, an award winning Disney and Universal Pictures artist.A percentage of royalties is donated to nonprofit groups advocating for protection of wildlife, nature conservancy, forest preservation, and climate change research.",
