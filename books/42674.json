  "description": "\"A little masterpiece, not only in the history of prison literature, but in that of literature itself.\"-The BulletinLen Tarbutt is serving a life sentence for attempted homicide. After a brief period in jail, he is transferred to the maximum-security ward of a mental hospital, where moments of absurdity and anarchy will remind readers of Ken Kesey's One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. But The Treatment and its award-winning sequel, The Cure, form a single story that pulses with darker and more disquieting undertones. It is a compelling, disturbing, and often humorous account of one man's fight to survive incarceration.",
