But by turning the plans a bit each day, he finds a way to alter them, turning the masterâ s creation onto its head!Â Discover what mystery and excitement a small change of perspective has brought to the Palazzo. Â In this M.C. Escher-inspired masterpiece, D.B. Johnson pushes the picture book form to new extremes.
