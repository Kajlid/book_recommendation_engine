  "description": "She’s a former socialite and MyHeartChannel host who wants her life back. He’s a philanthropist and shameless flirt. Both have plans and neither wants a relationship, but the magic of Christmas in Victoria, Canada, might just make all their secret wishes come true.  Alyssa Jones-Blakely had it all—wealth, a place in high society, and a popular MyHeartChannel showcasing her impeccable sense of fashion and globetrotting lifestyle. Loss of the family income sent her tumbling to the bottom of the social ladder. While she’s long since righted her own wrongs, she remains shunned and sharp-eyed for an opportunity to get back where she was: living a fabulous life.  Ex-Marine Dean Stallings went through rough times after his war-zone injury. Years later, he’s spending his life creating tiny house villages to help people experiencing homelessness. He’s happy as a single bachelor, flirting and keeping things light on the dating scene. A relationship would only slow him down, especially to a shallow ex-socialite.  When Dean stumbles into Alyssa, he sees a beautiful woman to flirt with and she sees a ticket back to her old life. Will Dean’s belief in second chances include the woman who may break his heart? And will Alyssa open her own heart this Christmas to discover that the best things in life don’t come with a designer label?",
