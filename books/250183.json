  "title": "Then There Was You",
  "description": "New York Times Bestselling Author Claire Contreras is back with a new contemporary second chance romance . . . Love and the right timing were two things I didn't believe in. Love is about walking to the edge of the cliff and taking the leap together. Timing was never on our side. My first mistake was hooking up with my best friend. My second came years later, when we met again, and I fell for her. My third was letting her go, because I had to. Because a love like this wasn't built to withstand the winds coming in our direction. Love and timing. I didn't believe in either. Then there was you . . . This is book 1. Book 2, My Way Back to You is available now and in KU.",
