  "description": "Sassy, smart and suddenly single Courtney Stone is a typical modern LA girl. That is, until she wakes up one morning in Regency England in the body of Jane Mansfield. At first she thinks she must be dreaming - maybe she's read all of Jane Austen's books a few too many times - but as time goes on she finds there is a lot she needs to get to grips with: a new accent, a new body, a wicked new 'mother', and most excitingly, a new man in her life: the dashing, dishy Charles Edgeworth.But is he a Darcy, a Wickham, or merely a confusing distraction? As Courtney trips through the social minefield of life in Jane Austen's England she wonders: Will she ever get her twenty-first century, west-coast life back - and does she even want to?",
