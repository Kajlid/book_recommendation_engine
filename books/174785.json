  "title": "In Season's Dream",
  "description": "This book is broken up into seasons. The imagery and content of the poems in theseason reflect elements of the season. The best of which are In Quiet Moments, Hurricane Sandy, Endurance, Oblivion, and Fragment. Most of the poetry of this collection reflects the woodlands and coasts of Massachusetts, with a few set in Salem. Some of the poetry as well will involve the elements of fantasy, which may appeal to younger audiences. As with my last collection, there are snippets of reality and everyday life, which will appeal to young and old alike.",
