  "description": "Big Girls Do Cry is the story that Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons fans have been waiting for, a look into the glitz and the glory that was the Jersey Boys' story as witnessed by one of the group's biggest fans. In the tradition of scandalous tell-all's by rock groupie loyalty like Bebe Buell, Pamela des Barres, and Pattie Floyd comes a feisty and fun new April Kirkwood. Our intrepid narrator is a sassy blonde Ohioan, a fun-loving flirt with a love of music and Italian men. And she has one of the craziest stories in Four Seasons history. An innocent childhood friendship with one of music's biggest stars led to a scandalous teenage romance, which soon blossomed into a stormy off-and-on affair for the next few decades. Yet through thick and thin, Kirkwood managed to find time to have a rollercoaster love life that you won't soon forget.",
