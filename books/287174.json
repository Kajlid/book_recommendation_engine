  "description": "When I was nineteen, I left Texas and my dysfunctional family behind, and I haven't looked back. Life was good for a while. I joined the Satan's Knights motorcycle club and immersed myself in art. The kind of art that requires a gun and a body as a blank canvas. But all good things must come to an end, and I soon found myself as a single father, struggling to find my place in a new charter. Now my estranged mother wants me to come home, which means facing my past. And that doesn't just include my family. It also includes the childhood friend I left behind. All grown up and pissed as hell, Bess is giving me one hell of a cold shoulder. I'm not the Ryan Perry she remembers, and she sure as hell isn't willing to get to know Needles, the man I am now. With her fancy clothes and her holier-than-thou attitude, she's creeping under my skin and filling my head with impure thoughts. I need to get back to New York before I get hooked on something I'm not supposed to have, or worse, start believing that this is my Rite of Passage.",
