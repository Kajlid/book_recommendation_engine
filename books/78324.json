  "description": "It began with a dream in the heart of God. Against the soundless sweep of infinity, the Great Creator shaped a world and peopled it with children formed in his own image. And the world is now the stage where a great human drama is playing--the Fall of the human race, its redemption, the ongoing battle between good and evil, and the coming again of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
