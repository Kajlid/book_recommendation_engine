  "description": "B-movie megastar Bruce Campbell of Evil Dead, Army of Darkness, and Bubba Ho-Tep fame comes to comics with this adaptation of his upcoming feature film. With more talent than you could fit in his freakishly large chin, Campbell not only co-wrote the film with David Goodman, but directed and starred in it as well. However, in order to see his vision realized unadulterated by budgetary constraints, Campbell put the version of the script he wanted to shoot into the hands of artists Rick Remender and Hilary Barta. Man with the Screaming Brain tells the story of a wealthy American businessman determined to exploit the crippled economy of a former Soviet state torn between communist roots and capitalist greed. But when Campbell's character hits on the wrong gypsy girl, he soon finds himself in the grip of a mad scientist with a twisted brain-transplant scheme worthy of Dr. Frankenstein.",
