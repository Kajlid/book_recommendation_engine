  "description": "As the last emperor of the Tang Dynasty takes his own life rather than surrender to his usurping nephew, a Radhanite merchant slips out of the besieged capital carrying a heavy weight in his pack: A parting gift from the Emperor himself.  A carefree holiday in Venice for former Military Intelligence Officer Roan Mercer is interrupted when he foils an attempted theft from Basilica San Marco. More thefts and the kidnapping of a seemingly harmless professor of Byzantine Studies soon follow.  From Venice to Rome, from Istanbul to Samarkand, the race is on to prevent one of the worldâ€™s greatest treasures from falling into the hands of an unscrupulous family of art thieves.",
