  "description": "I'm a Dog, You're a Cat is a short, delightfully humorous book filled with beautiful watercolor illustrations that highlight the sometimes quirky personality traits of felines and canines and how they mirror those of humans, especially as it relates to their interpersonal relations. Dog and cat owners who are in relationships will understand and appreciate the correlations and conclusions drawn from this unique comparison. How wonderful it would be if we were able to discover a new insight that helped us all communicate more effectively with the special people in our life. This book will help you identify if you are hard-wired more like a cat or a dog and how to understand that dog or cat in your life. By using a little humor to gain a deeper appreciation of your partner, you can begin to understand their behavior and how to react in those instances when you just don't see eye to eye on things.
