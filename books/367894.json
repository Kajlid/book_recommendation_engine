  "description": "Until his death in 1999, Jacques Lecoq taught indefatigably at the International Mime and Theatre school he founded in 1956. Here, for the first time in English, and in Lecoq's own words, are his philosophy and his teaching methods - probably the greatest influence on world theatre over the last thirty years. In chapters entitled Personal Journey, The World and its Movements, The Road to Creativity, & New Perspectives, Lecoq sets out his unique architecture of the body in space and explains his most famous techniques such as neutral mask, acrobatics, bouffons and the grotesque and play, and discusses the actor's approach to situation, character, environment, emotion, physical and vocal preparation and of course movement.\"In life I want students to be alive, and on the stage I want them to be artists.\" Jacques Lecoq",
