  "description": "Mary Sutter is a brilliant young midwife who dreams of becoming a surgeon. Eager to run away from recent heartbreak, Mary travels to Washington, D.C., to help tend the legions of Civil War wounded. Under the guidance of two surgeons, who both fall unwittingly in love with her, and resisting her mother's pleas to return home to help with the difficult birth of her twin sister's baby, Mary pursues her medical career against all odds. Rich with historical detail--including cameo appearances by Abraham Lincoln and Dorothea Dix, among others--\"My Name Is Mary Sutter\" is certain to be recognized as one of the great novels about the Civil War.",
