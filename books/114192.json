  "title": "An Elven Game of Rhymes: Book Two of the Magical Poems of Zardoa Silverstar",
  "description": "This is book two of the poems of Zardoa Silverstar. Most of these poems in this current volume were inspired by the ancient Elven Poetry Game that Zardoa Silverstar created. You may ask, if Zardoa Silverstar created this game, how can it be ancient? We leave that as a puzzle for you to ponder. The Elven Poem Game goes like this. An elf writes a poem and another elf takes one line from that poem and creates another poem from it, and then the first elf takes a different line from that new poem and creates another poem, and so forth. Sometimes the line has to be changed somewhat to make it work with the new poem but most of the first lines, and thus the titles, of these poems came from other poems.",
