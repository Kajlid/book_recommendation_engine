  "description": "This series of ebooks features creative artwork from artist, author and proud Aspie Maranda Russell (Aspie is a nick-name for someone who has Asperger's Syndrome, a type of high-functioning autism). As the series' title suggests, this book shares the stories and inspiration behind some of the artist's recent artworks. Maranda is an artist who isn't afraid to be silly or fun in her art, nor is she afraid to tackle hard subjects, look at things in a different way or share those views with others. Quickly becoming a highly collected outsider/folk artist, Maranda Russell uses this ebook series to share the joy she finds in personal expression with the world.",
