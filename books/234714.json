  "description": "Warning: Contains HOT Historical Regency Scenes that don't leave much to the imagination! A surprise bonus is also included inside for a limited time!   Gregory has a bad reputation. It’s a reputation that surpasses him and ensures that all respected daughters are kept locked up after dark.  He’s the town rake, and he’s actually kind of proud of it.  His father isn’t happy, though, having spent too long building up his reputation as the town’s banker to lose it over Gregory’s poor choices.  When Gregory finally steps over the line his father decides to take matters into his own hands. He arranges a marriage for his son with a girl, who has a reputation just like his, but Gregory is stubborn. It doesn’t matter that she’s perfect for him, because he won’t marry her on principle.  At least that’s what he thinks, until a day out riding changes everything. Gregory has already slept with another girl.....and the secret is right at the tip of someone’s tongue.",
