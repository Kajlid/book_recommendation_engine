Desperate for change, he needs a way to gain the perspective and courage needed to do so. After a crushing Thanksgiving encounter with his abusive, semi-ex-girlfriend, he ventures to the local island of Nantucket in search of that much-needed perspective. Little does he know that this magical, timeless island will challenge, then shatter, every perception he's ever had about life -- both his own and in general -- as his three-day weekend becomes an adventure spanning centuries.He's about to meet the woman of his dreams - but there's a catch. She may only exist in his mind. All George knows is he loves her and would do anything for her. But would he DIE for her?",
