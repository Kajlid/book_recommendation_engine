  "description": "Wren Fraser can think of better times to go into labor. Say, when she's not on the run, or when there's a hospital nearby. Better yet, when there's not a major flood trapping her in an abandoned house. She needs a rescue...\"now!\"It arrives in one Alec Harper. Strong, competent \"and\" good-looking, the detective keeps her safe and doesn't leave her side. He even takes in Wren and the baby when they have no place to go.For a woman wanting her independence, it's shocking how quickly she settles in with Alec. The situation seems a bit \"too\" domestic. And the sizzling attraction between them is making things worse. She keeps telling herself to walk away, yet she can't. Or should that be, she doesn't want to?",
