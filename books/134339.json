  "description": "Is it love, or just a little harmless sex?Max has always been Anna's knight in shining armor. But Max has always seen her as a charming, and very sexy, little sister.Until Max's cold fiance dumps him, Anna unloads another of her many conquests and she invites him over for margaritas and Mexican food. Too much tequila, too much flirting, and too many years of fighting the attraction â€” Max loses control and has mind-blowing sex with Anna on her couch. And in her shower. And in her bed.When the sun rises the next morning, both of them must face that their night together is just the first of many. For Max, he knows he wants Anna forever, but convincing a commitment-phobe like Anna is no easy task. For Anna, she can't believe she has finally slipped beneath Max's steely self-control. He is every woman's dark, wet fantasy come true. But what happens when Max pushes Anna for more than just A Little Harmless Sex?This book was previously published, but has been substantially revised and expanded for Samhain Publishing.Warning: this title contains the following, explicit sex, graphic terms for body parts, torture via silk stockings, a little spanking, and shower and office sex.",
