  "description": "Long before Politically Correct Bedtime Stories invaded bookstores, Americans were getting their giggles from Fractured Fairy Tales, those delightfully twisted parables brought to us between the cliffhanger adventures of our favorite cartoon heroes, Rocky & Bullwinkle. This collection, illustrated with classic art from the animated series includes the comical retelling of 25 classics such as Pinocchio (who starred in his own variety show \"The Pinocchio Doody Show\"), Jack and the Beanstalk (did you know that Jack grew a beanstalk in the outfield so he could catch fly balls for his baseball team?), or King Midas (who became a dentist so he could give his patients gold fillings). This satirical humor loved for so long by so many, is a must-have for fans of the show and anyone who loves classic fairy tales--with a twist.Witch's broomFrog princeRumpelstiltskinSeven chickensSir GalahadTale of a kingHansel and GretelPinocchioElves and the shoemakerThom TumPrincess and the peaSon of King MidasGolden gooseFlying carpetBeauty and the beastAladdin's lampAbsentminded kingGoblinsCutie and the beastPrince Hyacinth and the dear little princessSon of RumpelstiltskinEnchanted gnatJack and the beanstalkEnchanted fishKing Midas",
