  "description": "Dear Author,I cry out in pain as my body changes. The muscular power of my body expands and my scales slide off my torso, revealing flesh. What’s happening to me? I don’t know who I am, or why I can smell the heat coming from the man carrying my limp body over his shoulders. He’s strong for such a small being. He cares for me, washing sweat off my brow while the rest of my body changes. Now, I am part of the human world and I need to find out why. But this man, this beautiful man who rescued me from the forest floor touches me sweetly, and I know he is mine.Photo Description: A man in the process of changing to a snake, or a snake in the process of changing into a man.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event.
