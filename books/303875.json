But one day she and her brother are rushed out of Germany in alarming secrecy, away from everything they know. Their father is wanted by the Nazis â€“ dead or alive. It is the start of a huge adventure, sometimes frightening, very often funny, and always, always exciting.Judith Kerr was born in Berlin and left Germany in 1993 to escape the Nazis.
