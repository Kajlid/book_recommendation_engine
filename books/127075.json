  "description": "Attempting to Define is a series of four books of poetry. Attempting to Define: Love is the first of the series. This small poetry collection looks at the light and dark sides of romantic love. The poetry is unassuming in form, introspective, playful, sometimes heartbreaking and often sardonic, but always honest. The love we experience is, after all, tainted by our own faults.",
