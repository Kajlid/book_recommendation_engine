  "description": "Love blooms, even in death... When the goddess of beauty steals a precious flower from Thaedus, god of death, he demands retributionâ€”her son Prosoper must become his prisoner. To his surprise, Prosoper is far from an unwilling captive. Prosoper has been kept isolated from the world by his mother, who is determined to protect his innocence. But Prosoper is nearly two centuries old and longs to break free from his mother's control. Only the God of Death can give Prosoper the chance at life he desires. And only the Son of Beauty can save Thaedus from despair. This fantasy novella is inspired by the Greek myth of Hades and Persephone, with a gay romance twist! Perfect for fans of mythology and fairy tales.",
