  "description": "From the Wall Street Journal bestselling author of 44 Chapters About 4 Men, (inspiration for the Netflix original series Sex/Life) comes an immersive romantic suspense trilogy with a dark, dystopian twist.I swore I’d never step foot in this town again, but thirteen foster homes and a looming apocalypse later, here I am. Not because I’m having some emotional end-of-the-world crisis—like literally everybody else on this planet—but because the key to my survival is buried somewhere in these woods. I just have to find it before April 23. All I need are some basic supplies, a place to stay, and a sucker willing to help me out, which is exactly what I think I’ve found when I rescue a local girl from an angry mob. Okay, I kidnap her at gunpoint. Regardless, I expect her to be so grateful to the handsome, tattooed bad boy who just saved her life that she’ll do anything to reciprocate. Instead, she refuses to follow directions, runs away repeatedly, and nearly gets us killed every chance she gets. The girl has a death wish, and if I don’t cut her loose, she’s going to take me down with her. But … I can’t. She and I are like two sides of the same damaged coin. Forged in dark secrets. Stamped with violence and pain. One who will do anything to survive. And one who can’t wait to die. But no matter how badly I want to keep her, doomsday is coming, and on April 23, only one of us will get our wish. * Previously published under the title Praying for Rain. ** A comprehensive CW is available on the author’s website.",
