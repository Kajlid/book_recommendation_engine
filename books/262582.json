  "description": "Chase, I fucking loathe you. Nah, that's putting it mildly. I hate your very existence. I hate that your emerald eyes draw me and every other clueless girl in. I hate that when your lips quirk into that devishely sexy smile that my heart skips a beat. Most of all? I hate that you want me. Because the truth is, I'm not good enough for you. I lie. I steal. And I break anyone who dares to get close. So the question is, why do you? And more importantly, why do I keep coming back for more? Sincerely, AddyP.S. Fuck off.",
