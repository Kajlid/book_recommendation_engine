  "description": "I acknowledge the contribution of my mother and father for their blessings and my careful nurture and of my brothers for their intellectual companionship. I also acknowledge hereditary contribution of my grandfather whom I have never seen but whose stories as “pioneer and the first English Teacher” still prevail as folklore in my hometown. I am grateful to my wife and children for their support in writing. Also I am grateful to ShriRajenderKrishan and Ms AparnaChatterjee from Boloji.com for building my confidence on writing poems and to ShriRamaraoVadapalli for his kind remarks.I acknowledge the contribution of my mother and father for their blessings and my careful nurture and of my brothers for their intellectual companionship.
