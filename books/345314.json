  "description": "Luminous illustrations by Bagram Ibatoulline combine with Brian Alderson’s wry retelling for a gorgeous gift edition of a well-loved tale.A childless woman visits a witch who gives her a barleycorn — and hidden in its bloom is a tiny girl. For one so small, Thumbelina’s life is full of misadventures as she floats through the pages like a wisp on the wind, encountering kind and unkind creatures in succession. But old Mrs. Toad with her \"rek-kek-kek\" and the alarming Man in Gray cannot crush her spirits, and Thumbelina’s gentle concern for a winged soul in need paves the way to her freedom and happiness. In a warm, witty retelling accessible to younger children, Hans Christian Andersen’s tale of a girl no bigger than a thumb is lavishly illustrated by Bagram Ibatoulline. Showcasing art evocative of Victorian storybooks — with a touch of the dreamlike Rousseau — this is truly a breathtaking edition of a treasured classic.",
