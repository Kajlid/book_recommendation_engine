  "description": "Batman Beyond (\"the future of crime-fighting!\") got an excellent kickoff in the first few issues of DC's comic series starting in November of 1999. But before those comics appeared, DC issued a \"miniseries\" that bordered on the craptacular, with six issues published separately from March to August of the same year, and now collected in this trade paperback. Beginning as a nearly verbatim rehash of the TV pilot, the series never seems to find its footing, something writer Hilary J. Bader remedies in the \"real\" series later. A couple of these stories approach almost acceptable status--the third, Blight-fightin' issue (\"Never Mix, Never Worry\") and the sixth story on the normally sexy Inque (\"Permanent Inque Stains\")--but unless you've gotta have it, leave this one to the kiddies. --Paul Hughes",
