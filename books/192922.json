  "description": "From Scout Media comes A Matter of Wordsâ€”the first volume in an ongoing short story anthology series featuring authors from all over the world. In this first installation, no limits were set on genre, allowing the authors to lead the reader to destinations unknown. From the outer limits of the galaxy to the darkest depths of the ocean, A Matter of Words conquers the struggles of everyday life before revealing the dramatic loss of innocence and disturbing the reader with things that go bump in the night. Whether to be enlightened, entertained, or momentarily caught up in another world, these selections convey the true spirit of the short story.",
