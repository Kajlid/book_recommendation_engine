Sunny Chase is willing to be another notch on Noel's bedpost, after tragedy of her own. Despite their playful intentions, they find themselves poised to fall, especially if Noel’s old-school Italian mother and Sunny's cross-dressing uncle have anything to say about it. The only thing standing in their way is Noel’s niece, Harper, who is also captivated by one of the Chase women. Love becomes a complicated family affair. Robin Alexander’s latest romantic comedy has all the ingredients to warm you on the inside as you slip into the fall.",
