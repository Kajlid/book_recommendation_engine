His long track record of getting himself into trouble is getting longer. Forced against his will to undertake an impossible task, Kaniel has to lie to his only friend, risk his life, and trust a girl he only just met.Kanielâ€™s life is no longer his own, but he is not a fighter, he was never able to defend himself. He was just an average guy in a special but small city, working hard to get out. Now he may be trapped forever, stuck between two worlds and a war.",
