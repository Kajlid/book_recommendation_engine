  "description": "Gregory Hunt had always been the best - whether he was handling the toughest legal cases in Texas or coming to the rescue of damsels in distress. Only, this particular damsel was one he had loved once before - the regal Princess Anna von Oberland, whose privileged position made her off-limits. Now she needed his help, and Gregory had to risk all to save her. Because under the watchful, yearning eyes of Anna's four-year-old son - whose handsome features strikingly resembled his own - this tried-and-true Texan sensed more urgency than ever!",
