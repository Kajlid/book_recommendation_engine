  "description": "THE SPECTACULAR SEQUEL TO \"DON'T PAY THE FERRYMAN\" -- The town of Carthage has a long history of mysterious fires, and once again, the fiery destruction has crept back into the townspeople's lives. However, the reemergence of the fires is just one of the town's concerns. Five years after \"Don't Pay the Ferryman,\" Carthage is experiencing a new threat at a time when greed, and apathy have reared their ugly heads over the town. The sudden appearance of a Grim Reaper-type figure has presented a new threat for the residents; but is he a new villain, or has he been around Carthage before? No one has been ruled out as a suspect, leaving the possibility open that the killer could be someone we know and trust. Dave \"Bucky\" Morgan and Roger Fasick join together once again in an attempt to halt the spread of the Reaper's terror. To defeat the Reaper and stop his madness, they will have to dig up clues to the Reaper's origins as well as overcome their own mounting distrust.",
