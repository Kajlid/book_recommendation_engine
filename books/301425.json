  "description": "This text is the result of a drug that revealed the scaffolding.This drug was provocative and induced a certain feeling of dying.No ego death, no juvenalia, no experienced commonality.To write about the self without using any pronouns that denominate the self.To rewrite the process of being an individual.Away from the idea of sentience looking out.Toward the idea of objects looking in.Circles are objects.They look in.Josiah Morgan's chapbook is a poet's film about the kinesis of violence, a codex of ritual horror and youthful jubilation, lexically assembled as if by a troubadour in the dreamworld of a self-referential loop, in relation to abject cultural tableus, nuances and ellipses.",
