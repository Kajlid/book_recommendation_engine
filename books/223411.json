  "description": "What would you do to save the ones you love? In the aftermath of a war that sees the survivors of humanity flee to a remote corner of the galaxy, a force awakens deep underground with the ability to change the balance of power. The prize? Nothing less than planet Earth herself. In a group of genetically engineered children, we find our heroes. Cassiopeia and Caesar discover love, not only for each other, but for the very forces hell bent on destroying everything they hold dear. With the help of an Artificially Intelligent Computer, the Admirals daughter, and an ancient member of the very alien race they’ve been created to destroy, these unwitting weapons of war fight for the salvation of all. Rising like a Phoenix from the ashes of a burned-out world, it’s an all-out battle to Begin Anew.",
