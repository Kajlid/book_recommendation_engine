The party is being hosted by Minerva Wilder, older sister of the murdered Aramis, who does not believe the man convicted in her sister’s death is guilty. Cope thinks the invitation is a thinly disguised ruse to get a detective and medium to help solve the decades-old murder once and for all.When one of the invitees is none other than Aramis’s convicted killer, newly released from prison, Jude wonders if he’s back to take revenge on the people who sent him to jail or to prove he was innocent all along. After a prominent guest is brutally murdered, Jude and Cope realize there is a killer with unfinished business among them.Only one person has all the answers, the ghost of honor, Aramis Wilder. Will she reveal the name of her killer, or will Jude and Cope be next?",
