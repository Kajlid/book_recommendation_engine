  "description": "For the past few years, April Johnson has watched her brothers and sister fall in love and marry, and now she wants that for herself as well.When Noah Donner steps into April Johnson’s veterinary clinic a few days after Christmas in need of someone to adopt his ailing grandfather’s schnauzer, there is no way she can say no to those blue-green eyes and Captain America shoulders. Noah’s, not the pooch’s, although little Pookie’s eyes have her in a puddle, too. And it’s just her luck that the kind-hearted soldier is being deployed in a few weeks.Noah is overwhelmed with gratitude when he learns April is visiting his grandfather while he’s away. And when the letters and care packages start arriving, Noah can’t help the feelings that grow for her. When he returns for the holidays and sees April in person, he gets to witness her generosity and smiles firsthand. She’s even more beautiful--inside and out--in person than she is in her letters. But has he misinterpreted her acts of kindness or could there be something more between them than peppermints and packages?",
