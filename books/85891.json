  "description": "What if you woke up and began your morning by devoting the rest of your life to a murderous rampage, a never-ending cannibalistic spree? And what if you were only one of thousands who shared the same compulsion? This novel depicts just such an epidemic. It's the compelling, terrifying story of a devastating virus. You catch it through conversation, and once it has you, it leads you on a strange journey—into another world where the undead chase you down the streets of the smallest towns and largest cities.",
