  "description": "Dirty cops ... a strangled community ... a secret justice system. Welcome to HOLCOMB COUNTY.A mute little boy is the only witness to a savage beating that's left his father in a coma. His only attempt at communication is a series of purple drawings ... always the same, the same shape over and over.Sterling Greaves, a former police informant, has been scared out of his right mind by harassment at the hands of the local police when he tried to report their activities. He surfaces long enough to make contact with a member of The Organization, the one he calls \"an angel.\"When average citizens are at the mercy of corrupt law enforcement, they often suffer in silence, having no one to turn to, no one left to trust. With its exacting standards for judicial conduct and procedure, and its vast network of resources, The Organization offers a level playing field that allows true justice to emerge.Coming soon: The Organization Book 3 - JESSE BUTTERFLY",
