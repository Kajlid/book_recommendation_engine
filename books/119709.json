  "description": "They Win. You Lose.: Book 1 in The Implosion Trilogy\nSex, Violence & Songs from the Shows.\nThey Win. You Lose. is a very funny thriller. Mick and Jim are two incompetent, Soho-based, corporate video producers who drink too much, don't earn enough and get too many death threats. So when the Mafia come calling, demanding back rent of Â£6,000, they have ten minutes to do a runner. All they have is an old Morris Traveller (a Woodie, if you're in the US) and a tank full of petrol.Their sudden flight takes them to the sex trade in Southsea, out-of-body experiences, horrendous amateur dramatics, Death Metal pubs, foul-mouthed, 80-year-old punk grannies and hit men dressed in pink Mexican outfits.Under constant threat from mafia enforcers, they get offered a mystery job in Las Vegas. When they arrive in the US, six Reservoir Dog lookalikes are waiting for them. They make their escape using the world's most mercenary taxi driver.During the next 24 hours, they chicken out a freight train, walk six moonlit miles across the desert with cactus-punctured groins, find out what badly manufactured LSD can do to you, avoid Thelma and Louise suicide-a-likes, have sex with Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, make a commitment in front of a Bourbon-fuelled Elvis at Big Derek's Gay Marriage Emporium and blow up a Harley Davidson. The final showdown takes place with the Mafia boss in the world's most unspeakably lurid theatrical environment. A very neat twist propels them from sudden death into a totally different way of life.Or does it?",
