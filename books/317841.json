  "description": "Alabaster Penitentiary, Volume 2\nCorrectional officers get a bad rep. But in our case, it’s fully justified.We’re not 𝘨𝘰𝘰𝘥 people… We’re guard dogs. As twisted as the inmates we patrol, courtesy of the monster who created us.Prisoners ourselves on an island of manipulation, we’ve spent years drowning in vices to dull reality. If these walls could talk, I’m telling you… they’d scream.They call me Velle, but that’s 𝘖𝘧𝘧𝘪𝘤𝘦𝘳 𝘊𝘩𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘭𝘭𝘦 to you. Hands dirtier than my mind, I have no qualms with staying ruthless to keep these creatures in line.And I’m not alone.𝘑𝘰𝘺 𝘑𝘢𝘮𝘦𝘴𝘰𝘯 is my partner in crime, and my ex. Together we rule Alabaster Isle like Bonnie and Clyde, only prettier and far more dangerous. It’s the two of us against this wicked, secluded world.Until he shows up…Although we need him, the rookie is a problem. Flipping me upside down, using my own hidden desires to tempt me.𝘙𝘰𝘰𝘬… with his green eyes and country boy smile…He has no business luring me into something that will get everyone hurt.Let it be known, denying myself and dominating this role is my default setting. But with him in the picture, I’m struggling to keep it intact.The mask is slipping, control I can’t lose wavering as we welcome our newest psycho to the roster. Let’s hope, for all our sakes, 𝙄𝙣𝙢𝙖𝙩𝙚 #101 doesn’t do anything stupid. **Joyless is a MMF romance with its own HEA, and while it explores new characters, it is highly recommended that you read Volume 1 first, as the timeline mirrors that of Distorted and there will be references to Distorted in Joyless that could spoil book 1.**",
