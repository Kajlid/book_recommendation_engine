  "title": "Fear of Our Father",
  "description": "Even after a childhood of abuse and fear, Stacey M. Kananen was shocked when her brother, Rickie, admitted his guilt in the cold-blooded murder of their terrifying father, and years later, their helpless mother.But the greatest shock was to come--when he claimed that Stacey had helped him. In 1988, when Rickie and Stacey's father, Richard Kananen Sr., apparently left their home in Orlando, Florida, the family was so relieved that they never reported him missing. Fifteen years later to the day, their mother disappeared. When police became suspicious, Rickie admitted to Stacey that their father's body was under the cement floor of their mother's garage, and their mother was buried in Stacey's own backyard.Overwhelmed by grief and horror, Stacey's brother convinced her that they should commit suicide. After a failed attempt, she woke to discover her brother arrested--along with the realization that he had probably never intended to kill himself at all. But his betrayals were not yet over: On the eve of his trial in 2007, he suddenly claimed Stacey had been in on it, and she found herself charged with murder with a gung ho rookie detective who was convinced she was involved.This is the tragic and triumphant account of one woman's struggle to overcome her past, clear her name in what would become a dramatic public spectacle of a trial, and finally escape the nightmares that had haunted her entire life.",
