  "description": "When lingerie heiress Brandy Summer gets cold feet and runs out on her Vegas wedding, she has nowhere to turn - so she hijacks a hunky biker waiting for a red light and begs him for help. What she doesn’t know is that her instincts are right: the groom has a hidden agenda. He needs her money to pay off his gambling debts and she’ s his ticket to the good life.  Marco Vargas isn’ t sure what he’s getting himself into when he rescues Brandy, but figures he’ ll do the chivalrous thing. He offers her a job in his bar and the chance to sort out her feelings. But it seems that keeping Brandy hidden is easier than keeping his hands off her; and what will happen when Brandy discovers that Marco has secrets of his own?80,000 words",
