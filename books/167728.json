  "description": "Life can be exciting in a typical American city of the near future. There are highways on top of highways, cars that drive at super-speeds at the push of a button, humanoid robots that roll down the sidewalks, and dog-size robots that look more like spiders—shiny, black, and with a multitude of legs. It’s a thriving modern society; but Lani Dee, an immigrant from a remote island, is not thriving. She is confused, lonely, and scared. As Lani tries her best to be strong and to find happiness, solutions are offered—but can her new life ever really be the same as her simple island life?",
