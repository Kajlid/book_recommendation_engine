  "title": "Second Reading: Notable and Neglected Books Revisited",
  "description": "For seven years, beginning in 2003, the Washington Post ran a series of articles by Jonathan Yardley, the subtitle of which included, \"the Post's book critic reconsiders notable and/or neglected books from the past.\" Yardley's criteria for his selections were admirably informal: \"books I remember with affection and admiration but have not read in many years, books I would like to encourage others to discover.\" His choices, as one might expect, were eclectic: Titles by Hemingway, Steinbeck, Dickens, Carson McCullers, and Anne Tyler rubbed shoulders with books on baseball, football, jazz, and film comedy. This trade paperback collects these gems and it arrives with the best possible endorsement: It is reading that will inspire you to seek out some of these classics.",
