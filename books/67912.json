  "description": "Judy Mandel is the replacement child for her sister who was killed in a tragic accident. It would be years before she would understand how the event, that happened before she was born, shaped her life. A plane crashes into a familyâ€™s home. A two-year-old girl is critically burned and a mother is forced to make an impossible choice. The death of a child leaves a hole in the family that threatens to tear it apart. In a great act of hope, the parents give birth to a \"replacement child,\" born to heal wounds and provide a \"salve for the burns.\" The child unwittingly plays her role throughout childhood, riding the deep and hidden currents of the family tragedy. In this powerful story of love and lies, hope and forgiveness, Judy Mandel discovers the truth that changes her life forever and forces her to confront the complex layers of her relationships with her father, mother, and sister. When she has her own child, her epiphany comes full circle.",
