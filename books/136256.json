  "title": "In a Shallow Grave",
  "description": "A soldier named Garnet Montrose returns home to coastal Virginia bearing a grotesque injury which is nauseatingly repellent to anyone who sees him. He hires two young male caretakers, Quintus Pearch and Potter Daventry, who look after his disability. They also act as a go-between with Garnet's childhood sweetheart, now the widow Georgina Rance, delivering her messages in a desperate attempt to restart their interrupted relationship.With vivid Gothic imagery and drama, Purdy explores the varieties of love and the powerful transformations it can make in anyone's life. Readers will not soon forget Garnet, Quintus, and Daventry for the genuine human love that they share—and reject—and how they discover their way in the world.",
