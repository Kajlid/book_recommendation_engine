  "description": "Anna always looked forward to summer holidays. This summer is different. Anna is sent to live with her Grandfather, an eccentric artist in his strange new studio. She's terribly afraid that she will be left alone with her books while he paints every day, the summer dragging on page after page. A chance meeting on the ferry, secret gatherings in the garden, and a painted door, quickly change Anna's perceptions. The painted door opens to exciting adventures: ancient and mysterious, dangerous and magical. Most unexpectedly, the painted door opens to opportunities for friendship and self-discovery.",
