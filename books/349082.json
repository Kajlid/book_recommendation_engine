  "description": "New Ramoth. A city covered in scar tissue, where survival of the fittest decides who's on top and crime is the only promotion system. Enter Eddie \"Dog Boy\" Gnash, ex-carnival freak turned private investigator. Now the bodies are piling up, and the fate of New Ramoth rests in the hands of this fur-covered freak- Eddie Gnash, Sideshow P.I. \"Nathaniel Lambert and Kevin Sweeney have worked seamlessly to create a page-turning powerhouse of a book. Vivid and brilliant, SIDESHOW P.I. is a must-have for any horror/bizarro collection.\" Rio Youers, author of EVERDEAD and END TIMES \"A fun read all the way through. Better than Arnzen's Licker and I read it cover to cover. This was very intelligently written, humorous, well paced, and beautifully edited.\" D.W. Green, author of KIM CHI FLYING FISH",
