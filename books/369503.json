  "description": "When a boat travelling to Australia hits a reef and is destroyed, only one family survives. Shipwrecked on an island, and with no sign of rescue, the Robinsons are forced to use whatever means possible to stay alive.Through their struggles, the members of the family learn, not only how to survive, but also how to enjoy themselves in the face of adversity. The pastor, his wife and four children share many experiences together - both arduous and fun - and grow closer as a result.This classic tale of adventure on a desert island is exciting to read, as much as it is a story with a moral.",
