  "description": "I've been knocked up by a killer  I've never been the rule breaking type. Being professional meant everything to me. Then I met Owen. Inked, powerful, sexy beyond belief... And a convicted murderer. I was just supposed to talk to him, that was all. But things got out of control. When his hard muscles wrapped around my body, hands gripping every curve... my mind melted. There were no thoughts, no questions about what I was doing. I knew it was wrong, I should have said no, but I didn't. The way he f*cked me in my office was beyond explosive. I had become his in every way. Just like he wanted. And I needed. Now, I'm pregnant. I didn't expect to get knocked up by this bad boy. How do you tell the man you should want to run from that he's a father? I need time to think. Too bad he just got out of prison. And I can't hide from him any longer.  Author's Note: This 53,000- word bad boy romance is a standalone full-length novel. Contains a HEA and over the top sexiness that may be uncomfortable for some readers.",
