  "title": "Triumph on Everest (Direct Mail Edition): A Photobiography of Sir Edmund Hillary",
  "description": "This exciting photobiography celebrates the extraordinary life of the New Zealand farm boy who in May 1953 became the first person known to have reached the summit of Mount Everest. With climbing partner Tenzing Norgay, the iron-willed Hillary crossed deadly icefalls, clawed his way up vertical walls, and persevered through gale-force winds until he finally stood at the top of the world. Along with this gripping adventure, readers follow the explorerâ€™s trek to the South Pole, his quest to find the Abominable Snowman, and his continuing efforts to help the Sherpa people, without whom, Hillary is convinced, he never would have scaled Everest.",
