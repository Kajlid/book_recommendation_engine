Escape with Ford would be so simple.But if Ruby leaves, her community is condemned to certain death. She, alone, possesses the secret ingredient that makes the water so special—her blood—and it's the one thing that the Congregation cannot live without.Drought is the haunting story of one community's thirst for life, and the dangerous struggle of the only girl who can grant it.",
