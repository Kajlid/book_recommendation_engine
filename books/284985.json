  "description": "Convicted of witchcraft and sentenced to hang, Tempest Winslowe is swept from the gallows by Captain Garrett D'Arcy. Aboard the Wind Rover, Tempest forges new friendships and wins the admiration of the crew as first a pirate attack, and then a storm at sea test her mettle. But her most troublesome challenge lies in the containment of the impassioned fire that simmers just below the surface of her carefully controlled demeanor as she is thrown into close daily contact with her entirely too charming savior.",
