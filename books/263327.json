  "description": "*Do NOT read this blurb if you haven't read Parts 1 & 2, you've been warned!*  When shall we meet again... When the hurly-burly's done, When the battle's lost and won...  Death is no damn fun. Ask Persephone Gosse. People act like you're invisible, they won't listen to a word you say and nobody offers to buy you a drink.  Seph's had enough. And she's not the only one. Things are going to hell faster than you can say vampires, werewolves and bears. Seph and her ex-Jack Frost are the only ones who really know why.  Between the two of them they might have a chance of saving the FTC world. But that's a problem. Since Seph is a ghost.  And Jack is the reason why.",
