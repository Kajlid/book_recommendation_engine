  "description": "A warlord's choice is not to be questioned...  Zoey Swann deals with the impossible. Impossible assignments, impossible expectations, impossible warlords... But no one's as difficult, infuriating and enthralling as Daegon, the Corgan warlord the curvy diplomat has to convince to not wreak havoc on his own people and the rest of the alliance along with it. That's one mission that's easier said than done, though.  When unexpected forces arise to destroy all Zoey and Daegon hold dear, it's time to put aside their differences and try to work together.  The fact that it means spending a lot of time together with the fierce warlord is no small bonus, even if it is unexpected.  Daegon has had enough of seeing the Corgan people wither away. Though the new chieftain is the last man he'd trust to lead his kin, dangers that surround the proud warlord lead him to tough decisions. Trust his heart and the little Terran smartmouth who seems to have run off with it, or trust his head and do things the Corgan way.  By killing everything in sight and taking stock later.  Well, maybe there's a way to do both. Get the girl and save the world.  It can't be that impossible, right?  Daegon: Alien Warlord's Conquest is the second book in a series of scifi romance novels, following Corgan warlords and the human women who love them. This book contains plenty of love, lust, violence and epic battles, so buckle up!  These books can and should be read as standalones, there are no cliffhangers and each book contains a guaranteed happy ending!",
