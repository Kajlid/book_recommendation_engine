  "description": "The battle my father led was supposed to be a rescue mission. It was anything but. It was an ambush I didn’t know about until it was over. A war that no one walked away from. Except my little sister. I was forced to take on the role of the Alpha of our pack. I was eighteen.After the dust settled, our pack was nearly destroyed. Decimated. I was broken. In far more ways than losing my parents. A wolf’s connection to the rest of his pack is strong. But that of an Alpha? The pack is our responsibility. Losing anyone takes a toll on us that’s indescribable. It’s like losing a limb. My job is to avenge my pack; my parents. I lost my entire family.I don’t have time for stupid things like mates.My wolf doesn’t agree. As soon as he caught Kaia’s scent when my dead mother, who is one of my spirit guides, called me to the edge of our territory when she was in danger, that was it. For both of us, much to my dismay. But she’s human. There’s no way in all of the Hells I’ll ever accept her as my mate. Ever. Shifters and humans don’t mate. It’s a rule I put in place years ago. A rule to protect humans from suffering the same fate my human father and human sister-in-law did.On the day I plan to reject her as my mate to the Moon Goddess, hidden secrets are revealed that throw us both into chaos and threaten to consume our entire world. Now, I face the biggest decision of my life. Do I give in to the call of my wolf’s heart, or lead us both down a path of destruction neither of us will ever come back from?",
