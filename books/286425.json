So when Colin Flannery, the cocky sales director for Platinum Aviation, offers to let me in on closing a major deal, I don’t have to think twice.All I had to do was spend one weekend schmoozing clients with him while we pretended to be a couple.All I had to do was resist his hooded, sleepy bedroom eyes and his long, lean body.All I had to do was not do it again the second night.All the condom had to do was not break.And now, all I have to do is figure out how to tell my boss that he’s going to be a father.Piece of f*cking cake.ONE SHAMELESS WEEKEND is a STANDALONE, full length, fake boyfriend accidental pregnancy, enemies-to-lovers romantic comedy.
