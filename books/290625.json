  "description": "In this modern day tale of forbidden romance, can love conquer all? Carrie Armstrong joined the Air Force seeking education, experience, and travel. What she didn't expect to find was the one thing military rules clearly state she can't have, Staff Sergeant Beau Adams. Throughout the 14 years of his life that Beau has dedicated to the Marine Corps, he's never had reason to regret his decision to make the military his career, until now, when loving Carrie, the only woman he can picture growing old with, could cost him his future. As the tension between them increases to the breaking point, their ability to resist temptation weakens. Forced to make a choice, do they willingly risk everything theyve worked so hard to gain by Crossing The Line?",
