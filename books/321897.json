  "description": "The collapse of the Soviet Union and the introduction of a naked capitalism in that country and in Eastern Europe, as a consequence of the counter- revolutionary policy of Gorbachov and Yeltsin, represent a turning point in the international situation. It is a victory for imperialism and reaction.These counter-revolutionary events exacerbated all basic contradictions in the world: the contradiction between socialist countries and imperialism, the contradiction between oppressed people in Asia, Africa, Latin-America and imperialism, the contradictions between monopolies and imperialist powers and the contradiction between the working class and the bourgeoisie. The forces of reaction, racism, fascism and war have started their offensive on a world scale.In this situation, parties and organisations, that stay loyal to the revolutionary principles of marxism-leninism, are trying to draw the lessons from the counter-revolutionary processes which destroyed socialism in the Soviet Union. Faced with the offensive unleashed by the reactionaries, they feel the need to unite for a counter-offensive in favour of the oppressed and exploited masses, in order to keep high the flag of socialism and communism and to restore confidence in the socialist future of mankind for all those who are fighting against capitalism and imperialism.We have drawn up a minimal common framework allowing marxist-leninist organisations of different tendencies to meet, to exchange experiences and analysis and to take common initiatives.This minimal common framework, stated in this document, will allow us to discuss frankly and openmindedly the important ideological and theoretical divergences and to tackle the current issues of policies and tactics. That minimal common framework will allow us to start a process of theoretical and political unification.",
