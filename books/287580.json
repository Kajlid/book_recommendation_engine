  "description": "The capital Umo Portana has fallen to the goddess Utuni.  But Gryff isn’t about to let the rest of Utun fall to the serpent Archon.  The only problem is, Utuni’s blood aura makes her legions more powerful with each monster that’s killed, so Gryff and his team realize they’re going to need a little help.  Gryff expects maybe a few Utun men to join his cause. He definitely doesn’t anticipate raising his own army.  But, with his own forces, Gryff could lay siege to the capital and usurp Utuni once and for all.",
