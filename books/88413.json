  "description": "I wrote this little non-fiction journal style book from a notebook I kept in 1972 during a trip a girlhood friend and I took to Europe at that time. The itinerary was loosely based on the Hemingway novel The Sun Also Rises so yes there is drinking in Paris cafes, no money, a wild drive from Paris to Pamploma and then to Madrid, including a bullfight a riot,and Ceuta, Heidelberg ,London and the terrific assortment of people that we met along the way. This was before GPS and cell phones , Vietnam was raging and the only terrorists we knew about were Irish and German. I did not meet famous artists or writers, but the places are still there and now when I reread Hemingway a lot of it really comes to life and I know what he wrote was \"true\".-Linda Pashley MurrayI so enjoyed reading the narrative of your trip to Europe in 1972. It is a wonderful account of the adventurous travels oftwo young American girls, experiencing the various cultures they encountered along the way within the context of the history going on during that period of time. I am so glad you kept the journal as you went along because doing so you were able to recapture what it was like to be in your shoes. Reading it brought me back to memories of younger days. Life is an adventure to be enjoyed while somehow not succumbing to unforeseen pitfalls.\"-Connie Pashley McDade",
