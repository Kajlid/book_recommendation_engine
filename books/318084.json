  "description": "In this revised and updated edition of Who Killed Kurt Cobain?, the authors recount Courtney Love's surprising response to the controversial book's publication and her efforts to suppress the documentary Kurt & Courtney, which also explored the theory that Cobain was murdered. The film eventually appeared in more than forty cities throughout the country.In this compelling work, the reader will encounter a bizarre and fascinating cast of characters: the respected Beverly Hills private investigator hired by Courtney Love to find her husband, missing from a Los Angeles drug rehab center, who later declared Cobain's death a murder, not a suidcide; the father who accused his own daughter of murdering Cobain; the Los Angeles musician who was allegedly offered $50,000 to kill Cobain and was mysteriously found dead shortly after passing a lie detector test given by the world's top polygraphist.These and many other revelations offer compelling reasons to officially reopen the case of Cobain's death to find out how he really died.",
