  "description": "Rex Richardson is the only child of a reclusive and eccentric multibillionaire. Having grown up on a private island whose native society is so gloriously free that its people have developed enhanced mental powers that have enabled them to live in peace and unity for four hundred years, Rex has spent the decade since 9/11 trying to adjust to American life. He sees his father's country as incapable of fostering any kind of happiness, and he worries that this outer world is going to swamp and destroy his childhood home where humanity has evolved to perfection. In an effort to protect Atlantica forever, Rex has made it his goal to mentally free and to spiritually unite all Americans as a first step toward uniting the world. Rex begins an experiment on a twelve-thousand-acre Texas ranch to determine whether Americans living as Atlanticans live will be able to develop the powers of their minds. But when he moves his family to Texas to oversee his project, he puts a considerable strain on his marriage to a woman who had envisioned a more conventional life of wealth. This clash between incompatible cultures results in the dissolution of Rex's marriage, followed by an epic custody battle that involves three generations of his family. Into all this chaos comes Lyshann McKenzie, one of the few Americans who understands what Rex is trying to achieve. Can their blossoming love help him to resolve his differences with his family ... and at last come to terms with the modern world? Letters from Love is a seven-novel saga that tells five fresh and engaging love stories. Spanning almost five hundred years, the series will give you a new appreciation for your own glorious potential.",
