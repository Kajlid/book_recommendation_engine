  "title": "The Untold Life of Peter Lee: \"born of slave parents, the property of Colonel John Stevens\"",
  "description": "After finding the sole public reference to slavery on a bronze plaque in her adopted hometown of Hoboken, New Jersey, author Holly Metz began a search for the life story of the enslaved man mentioned there. Peter Lee, who lived to the age of 98, worked all his life as a butler for the Stevens family, who were widely known for their vast fortune, engineering innovations, and development of the city of Hoboken.Who was Peter Lee? Poring over thousands of pages of deeds, letters, farm books, newspaper articles, and ledgers, Metz uncovered Lee’s ancestry, his mother’s fate, his father’s service in the War of 1812, and Peter’s residence near the home of a pioneering female journalist who hosted abolitionist Frederick Douglass during his many visits to Hoboken. Previously unexamined ledgers kept by Stevens elder John II were also found, revealing his deep investment in the slave trade. Beginning in the 18th century and ending at the dawn of the 20th, The Untold Life of Peter Lee narrates the story of a resilient man and his extended family, reporting on lives lived under Northern slavery and beyond.",
