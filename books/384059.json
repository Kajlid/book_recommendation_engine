  "title": "Genius in the Shadows: A Biography of Leo Szilard, the Man Behind the Bomb",
  "description": "Leo Szilard has long been overshadowed by such luminaries as Einstein, Oppenheimer, and Enrico Fermi—with whom he codesigned the first nuclear reactor in 1942. A shy, witty eccentric, the Hungarian born Szilard lived both sides of the arms race, working first to prevent, then to hasten, and finally to outlaw nuclear weapons.\"Lanouette's book is eminently readable. . . . An excellent book spiced with telling anecdotes about a strange man who influenced world history.\"—Max F. Perutz, New York Review of Books\"Lanouette's exhaustively researched and artfully written account of one of the most underrated figures of the atomic age establishes Szilard as both a curmudgeon and a posthumously honored prophet.\"—Gregg Herken, Nature\"William Lanouette . . . has written the most sensitive and lively biography. . . . The book gives an excellent picture of the man, and makes most interesting reading. I strongly recommend it.\"—Hans Bethe, Physics Today\"A wonderful book about this endlessly fascinating man . . . one of the most entertaining stories in recent years. . . . A keeper.\"—Dick Teresi, New York Times Book Review",
