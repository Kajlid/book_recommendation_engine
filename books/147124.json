  "description": "\"Susan B. Anthony didn't live long enough to see women get the vote, but her tireless dedication shines through on every page.\"--The Washington Post Book World Failure Is Impossible brings together--for the first time--a wide-ranging, spirited collection of Susan B. Anthony's speeches, letters, and quotes, linked by contemporary reports and Lynn Sherr's insightful biographical commentary.By allowing the legendary suffragist to speak for herself, Sherr brushes the dust off of the Susan B. Anthony icon, introducing a new generation to the brave, brilliant, funny, and, most of all, prescient woman she really was.\"Lynn Sherr has done us all a great service by bringing to spectacular light the too long neglected story of one of our greatest patriots--a genuine hero who helped change for the better the lives of a majority of American citizens.\"--Ken Burns",
