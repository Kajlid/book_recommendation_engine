  "description": "Ian West has his summer all planned out—go down to Florida, stay in his family’s beach cottage on Olympic Cove, and work on his first novel. But his plan gets thrown for a loop when he meets mischievous twin sea gods Bythos and Aphros and discovers he’s their fated consort. As if that wasn’t enough, something in the Gulf of Mexico is turning mermaids into legendary monsters and gods into demons. Now, Ian not only has to finish his book and navigate the complicated waters of a ménage relationship with twin sea gods, he also has to stop an insane deity from turning the planet into a wasteland. No pressure.",
