  "title": "Barchester Towers and The Warden",
  "description": "Set in the quiet cathedral town of Barchester, these two classic Victorian novels have delighted generations of readers since their first appearance in 1855 and 1857. Rich in wit, satire, and memorable characters, the books portray the well-ordered world of English provincial society suddenly troubled by scandal and ecclesiastical intrigue.In THE WARDEN, the kind, innocent Reverence Septimus Harding is challenged by indignant church reformers - while his lovely daughter Eleanor finds herself, to his dismay, falling in love with her father's accuser.Trollope's lively story continues in BARCHESTER TOWERS, regarded by many as his masterpiece. Here the formidable Mrs. Proudie, the bishop's wife, does battle with both her one-time protege Mr. Slope and the conservative party led by Archdeacon Grantly; the result is social comedy of the highest order.This Bantam Classic edition reprints in their entirety both THE WARDEN and BARCHESTER TOWERS, the two inspired the acclaimed television series, BARCHESTER CHRONICLES.",
