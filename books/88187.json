  "description": "The wryly amusing and revealing story of one man’s journey into the swinger lifestyle that “transcends most of the usual boundaries of sexuality…and leaves the vanilla world behind” (The New York Times Book Review).An estimated fifteen million strong worldwide, swingers are everywhere—a huge community hiding in plain sight, whose erotic pastime remains a complete mystery to the rest of us. In Swingland, Daniel Stern outs himself and the secretive society he loves, recounting his ten-year transformation from a lonely guy who couldn’t get a date into a veteran sexual adventurer. With wit and infectious enthusiasm, Stern shares all the hard-earned wisdom he’s acquired in America’s swinging underground. He encounters plenty of bumps and bruises along the way, including countless rejections, missed opportunities, and one particular AARP orgy. But slowly and surely, through an impressive series of threesomes, foursomes, and moresomes, this “Vanilla” newbie becomes a much sought-after partner for couples looking to spice up their relationships. Travel with Stern on his exploits, learn a whole new lexicon (there aren’t many single women swingers, or “Unicorns,” but plenty of MFMs, FMFs, MMFMs, and MMMFMs), and gain free, invaluable advice should you decide to take the plunge (be honest, sensitive, and hygienic!). “Equal parts memoir and guide book” (New York Post), Swingland is much more than a “unique, voyeuristic exposé” (Kirkus Reviews). Lovingly written, with a keen sensibility regarding the sensitive and often misunderstood subject, Stern’s narrative is as improbably safe as it is fun—and impossible to put down.",
