  "description": "After sixteen hundred years on this earth, Bryn Arthur has reached the end of her rope. Year after year, the only thing that changes is the number of human-eating fey that stalk the night. Each night, Bryn ventures out to reduce those numbers and protect a family she's no longer sure deserves protecting. But if the last member of the bloodline of Arthur dies, darkness will fall and the earth will crumble.Elaine Hughes is just a regular young woman with a regular job who lives in a regular house in Los Angeles. Each weekend, she comes home to an empty house, and each Monday she drives back to her nine-to-five with chagrin that nothing has changed. When she's attacked in the same parking garage she's been using for years, she's saved by a beautiful warrior maiden with red wings and golden eyes, and she's confronted with the possibility that things in this world are not as they seem.The Crimson Dragon combines the real world of Los Angeles with the magical world of dragons and the legends of King Arthur. As Bryn and Elaine face their worst fears and emotional trauma, they also face the real chance that the two of them are in for more than they bargained for.",
