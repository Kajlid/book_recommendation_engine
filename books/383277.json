  "description": "Love can be a force of nature.Serengeti Shifters, Book 3Mara Leonard is through hitting the snooze button on her biological clock. The Three Rocks Pride schoolteacher is ready to get serious about starting a family, and she needs a serious man to make that happen.Regrettably, that means crossing less-than-serious Michael Minor off her list of potential mates. Michael is impulsive and passionate, but his spontaneity leaks into shapeshifting whenever his emotions run high a tendency he should have outgrown long ago. As a sex buddy, he s delicious. Daddy material? Disqualified.Michael is blindsided by Mara s rejection. Nine years separate them, and his genetic malady means no one in the pride treats him as an adult. But if she thinks he ll simply slink away to lick his wounds while she steps into the arms of another man, she has seriously underestimated him.The tricky part will be convincing his over-analytical lover that he s more than a disposable sex toy. That real bravery means tearing up her damn checklist and following her heart. And doing it without letting their explosive sexual chemistry expose the Pride s secrets to the outside world.Product WarningsThis book features break-up sex, make-up sex, a lioness who s a cougar and a hot young lion who s grown up in all the right ways. All electrical shocks are purely metaphorical.\"",
