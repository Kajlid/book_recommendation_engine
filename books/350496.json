  "description": "It's the edgy gift book for every unmarried woman who's fending off her nudgy mother and overly concerned (over-bearing?) friend, who can't go to a holiday dinner, class reunion, shower or wedding without hearing the usual round of questions. Something like So, why aren't you married yet? Or sometimes, Still not found that special someone? Or any variation thereof.Delightful, irreverent, and witty, Even God is Single, So Stop Giving Me a Hard Time is an affirmation for every girl who's single and loving it. Even God is Single is strong, sexy, smart, and edgy. And joyous-it celebrates singlehood, just as it pays homage to the self-assured and savvy woman who knows that you're not half a person just because you're not half a couple.Even God is Single asks is it \"monogamy\" or \"monotony?\" Shows that given the 50% divorce rate, you haven't missed out on marriage, you just skipped a few divorces. And fearlessly examines the role models. Married? Frankenstein, Linda Tripp, and 20,000 Moonies. Single? Catwoman, Superwoman--and, of course, God.",
