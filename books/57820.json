  "description": "Six children keep Kate Thompson busy. Her oldest daughter, Jess, is almost sixteen and acting the part--something Kate had hoped to avoid. Yet, she's quick to remind herself that it could be so much worse. Besides, there are more important things to worry about than adolescent moodiness, like convincing her husband that they're ready for one more baby. Jess gave up competing for attention at home a long time ago. But now, even her best friend doesn't seem to have time for her. Then Jess meets Emily online. Unlike everyone else in Jess's life, she can talk to Emily about anything. Emily understands her. Emily listens. When the unthinkable happens, and Jess disappears, Brad and Kate Thompson realize that they missed something--something big. How could this happen in their home? To their daughter? Most important, will Jess ever come home again?",
