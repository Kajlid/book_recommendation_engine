  "title": "Cemetery John: The Undiscovered Mastermind of the Lindbergh Kidnapping",
  "description": "Evidence, opinion, and logic have discredited the notion that Bruno Richard Hauptmann --electrocuted in 1936 --acted alone. In this meticulous and authoritative account of the crime, the trial, and the times of the Lindbergh kidnapping, Robert Zorn clears away decades of ungrounded speculation surrounding the case. Inspired by his father's relationship with the actual accomplices --including the mastermind --he presents the clearest ever picture of a criminal partnership, which would shake every class and culture of American society. Using personal possessions and documents, never-before seen photographs, new forensic evidence, and extensive research, Robert Zorn has written a shocking and captivating account of the crime and the original \"Trial of the Century.\"From the ecstatic riots that followed the Spirit of St. Louis on either side of the Atlantic, to the tragic night that would shake America's sense of security, to the horror of the New Jersey morgue where Lindbergh insisted on verifying the identity of his son, Zorn's skillful treatment meets this larger-than-life story and gives it definitive shape --revealing the true story behind the crime, for the first time.",
