  "title": "The Yada Yada Prayer Group Gets Real",
  "description": "The Yada Yadas thought they had a handle on forgiveness, but it seems God has them on a crash-course to an even deeper level. After everything the Yada Yadas had been through in the past eight months, I told God I could sure use a little \"dull and boring\" in the new year! But that was before Leslie \"Stu\" Stuart moved in upstairs. Ms. Perfect herself and me--Jodi Baxter--living in the same two-flat? A recipe for collision. Then Delores Enriquez's son Jose wanted to throw my Amanda a quinceanera --a coming-out party, Mexican style--and they're only fifteen! At least Bandana Woman, who held up our Yada Yada Prayer Group at knife-point last fall, was safely locked up in prison . . . or so I thought. We visited her, like the Bible says; even sent her something for Christmas. But then she ends up back in our face. I mean, how far is forgiveness supposed to go? I guess I should have realized that with eleven Yada Yada sisters as diverse as a bag of Jelly Bellies, life would always be unpredictable. All I know is that the longer we Yada Yada pray together, the more \"real\" things are getting, not only with each other but with God. Dull and boring? Not a chance.",
