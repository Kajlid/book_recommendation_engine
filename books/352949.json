  "description": "The last time Jasmine King was aboard the Heptoral, she escaped by the skin of her teeth. This time she won't be so lucky. Trapped on a ship full of sex-starved aliens and out of the pheromone blocker that holds off her physical transition, Jasmine makes a desperate escape attempt...and fails. The consequences are disastrous--she's mated to three horny warriors, and one has a huge bone to pick with her. What's a girl to do but fall in love? The last time Shauss saw Jasmine, the deceitful little Terran stole his bondmate from under his nose. This time he won't be so trusting. Finally master of his own bond, Shauss names secondary mates Jasmine feels safe with...and lives to regret it. One can't stop puking long enough to claim her. The other challenges Shauss' supremacy by digging into his psyche at every turn. What's a Dom to do butÂ bed them all into submission? He sets out to do just that, but his domination takes a brutal turn when he discovers Jasmine's deadly secret.Reader Contains a sultry female/female sex scene.",
