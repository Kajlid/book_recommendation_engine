And I am certainly not a boy, but a girl.But it was a Royal Decree, and if I don't obey the Decree, there was a threat of death to me and to all I hold dear.To keep them safe. To keep me from losing my head, I packed up what little belongings I had and enrolled at Wyvern All-Boys Academy.Everything at Wyvern School for Boys was meant to intimidate. Being the only girl at a school of incredibly handsome boys, especially the Four Princes, was intimidating.Not to mention the cutthroat competition that literally cuts students from the school.I'm stuck in a hard place...either get killed by defying the Royal Decree and also get everyone I cared for, killed. Or stick it out at Wyvern School for Boys, despite all the bullying and cutthroat games Wyvern has in store for me.Of course, there is no choice...I must survive Wyvern School for Boys, or die trying.Did I mention this is a school for Dragons, too?
