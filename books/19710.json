In this story, George O'Kelly, an aspiring engineer turned insurance salesman, fights to recapture the love of Jonquil Cary. When George receives a letter from Jonquil that sounds \"nervous\" George quits his insurance job and heads down to Tennessee to convince Jonquil of his love for her. Upon arriving, George finds Jonquil in the company of two younger boys and he knows that something is wrong. After their break-up, George leaves Tennessee to pick up the pieces of his life. We return to George over a year later as he comes back to see Jonquil again. The years have been good to George - he is tan, well dressed and successful. When the two reunite, things have changed.",
