  "description": "Have you ever seen a fireman who’s so insanely sexy you’d actually consider DIY-ing a little at-home arson just so he’d show up at your front door?Dramatic, I know, but hear me out.Chiseled hot body, bright blue eyes, and the sexiest smile I’ve ever seen—the first time I saw Garrett Alexander in my exam room, it took everything inside me not to do something crazy like mount him during his yearly physical.Not only is he a total babe, but he’s charming, hilarious, and the kind of single dad that would make your ovaries explode—the total freaking package.I know you’re probably wondering, What in the heck are you waiting for, girl? Go get yourself a fireman!But, see, there’s one teeny-tiny (read: huge) problem—if we got together, we’d have to keep our relationship a secret.I know. Who even am I? Some heroine in a freaking forbidden romance novel?Let me guess, now you’re probably thinking...Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Don’t do it, girl. Don’t fall for the sexy, off-limits man. It’s not worth it.Well, too late. I already went and did it.And I have a feeling this fire of ours is going to go up in a big, mushroom-cloud-worthy, ball of figurative smoke.A Single Dad Romance",
