  "title": "Through Black Spruce",
  "description": "Will Bird is a legendary Cree bush pilot, now lying in a coma in a hospital. His niece, Annie, has returned to sit by his side. Broken in different ways, the two communicate in unspoken kinship, and the story that unfolds is rife with heartbreak, fierce love, ancient feuds, and the bonds that hold a family, and a people, together. As Will and Annie reveal their secrets -- the tragic betrayal that cost Will his family; Annie's search for her missing sister, the famous model Suzanne -- a remarkable saga takes shape. From the bush country of Northern Ontario to the drug-fueled glamour of the Manhattan club scene, Boyden tracks his characters with a keen eye for detail and a rare empathy for the empty places concealed within the heart. An unforgettable novel of Aboriginal life amid the dangers and harsh beauty of forest and city Through Black Spruce establishes Boyden as a writer of startling originality and uncommon power.",
