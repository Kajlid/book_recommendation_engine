  "description": "Best friends for their whole lives, Cole and Brooke didn’t plan the pregnancy that led to their teenage marriage.  After a year of being miserable and feeling like a failure, Cole leaves, knowing his wife and child will be looked after by his trust fund, and wanting to make more of his life to make his family proud.  Four years later, he tracks them down, and finds that while he’s lived a good life, she’s struggling—balancing two jobs while raising their daughter, Kaia.  It doesn’t take long for Cole to realise that he doesn’t just want to fix things. He wants to get to know Kaia. And he wants Brooke back.  If only life was that simple.  This book does not contain the conclusion of the story. The story ends in Book 2, Rising.",
