  "description": "When young radio reporter Billy Batson speaks the name of an ancient wizard \"SHAZAM!\" he is magically transformed into the World's Mightiest Mortal - Captain Marvel! Marked by a distinct art style, Captain Marvel made his debut in 1939 in Fawcett Publishing's WHIZ COMICS and, for a time, even outsold his publishing rival SUPERMAN. This delightful hardcover collection reprints the Captain Marvel stories from those early WHIZ COMICS, introducing Captain Marvel, Billy Batson, the evil Dr. Sivana, the wizard Shazam!, and more. It also includes the famous \"ashcan\" edition of the first issue of WHIZ!",
