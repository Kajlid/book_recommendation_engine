  "description": "Through determination and hard work, Troy Mulligan had become the man he always wanted to be. He is happy, healthy, has a wonderful family and successful career. A surprise inheritance helps enlighten him to the prospect that the basic measure of the United States economy, the dollar itself, is unstable and dangerous. As the industry which he works becomes more and more oppressive through government over-regulation, he decides to change his life's path and focus on helping people instead. When a billionaire approaches him with an idea to start a new global currency based on precious metals, he jumps at the chance to help, feeling that he will be improving the lives of people who don't necessarily understand the danger they are facing under the current monetary system. However, introducing sound money to the world economy has far deeper implications to its' power structure, and Troy is about to find out what lengths some will go to preserve it.",
