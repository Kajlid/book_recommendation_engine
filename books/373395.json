  "description": "In this beautifully crafted and uplifting novel, the author of the acclaimed Spinning Forward welcomes readers back to the lush Florida island of Cedar Key, where the vibrant shades of hibiscus and azaleas are the perfect backdrop to a colorful, quirky community . . . In the four years since Monica Brooks moved to Cedar Key, she's found a home, a husband, and now a business to love. Taking over her mother's bustling knitting shop is a welcome challenge, but Monica's exciting plans are waylaid by unexpected news. Her husband's ex-wife has been deemed an unfit mother, and custody of their eight-year-old daughter, Clarissa, is to be transferred to Adam. Going straight from honeymoon to motherhood-especially when she's unsure she wants children-leaves the normally even-keeled Monica doubting herself at every turn. Yet in a place like Cedar Key, nobody goes it alone. With help from friends and relatives, Monica, Clarissa, and Adam begin to forge a close-knit family of their own-one that will need to be strong enough to withstand all the surprises set to unravel . . . Praise for Spinning Forward \"Poignant, absorbing, humorous . . . a debut that tugs at the heart\". -Sophia Nash, author of A Dangerous Beauty \"Captures the essence of what often lies in each of our hearts. Don't miss it\" -J.L. Miles, author of Cold Rock River \"Like a lazy island summer . . . a story of secrets and loss, friendship and recovery, and rediscovered love\". -Laura Castoro, author of Love on the Line",
