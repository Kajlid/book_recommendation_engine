  "description": "I look like any other woman. I’m not that tall, I don’t have a ton of muscles and I don’t walk around, carrying a shield. This is why I in reality have no business dealing with someone like Donovan Calloway. He’s a cutthroat lawyer who takes no prisoners and now he’s after me. My boss wants me. There, I said it. He wants the girl with the short skirts and the big hair. I have his attention but his methods to get mine are, well... let's just say they're unorthodox.",
