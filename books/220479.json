  "description": "Diane, an uneducated young Australian mother meets by chance, Maggie, a sophisticated American poet. Their pen-friendship changes both their lives. Everything, from age, class and nationality seems to separate them but both are struggling to cope with personal issues. Maggie is trapped in a marriage involving infidelity and rape, as well as grieving for her eldest daughter Anna. Diane unconsciously yearns for the same opportunity of an education given to her brother but denied to her. This is a story of two unfulfilled women finding each other when they need it most.",
