  "description": "Cynthia can understand how Anahera feels just by looking at her body. Cynthia is twenty-one, bored and desperately waiting for something big to happen. Her striking fitness instructor, Anahera, is ready to throw in the towel on her job and marriage. With stolen money and a dog in tow they run away and buy ‘Baby’, an old boat docked in a beautiful bay, where Cynthia dreams they will live in a state of love. But strange events on an empty island turn their life together in a different direction. Baby is a sunburnt psychological thriller of obsession and escape by one of the most exciting new voices in New Zealand fiction.",
