  "description": "Consequences: Book Three (The Celtic Vampyre Saga)286 pages (print length)Once inside the walls of Castle de Cr√ºel, Nathaniel and Faelynn quickly realise that they might be in over their heads. An unexpected meeting with someone of significance from his past throws Nathaniel into a tailspin, which does not bode well for Faelynn, whose chances of surviving her trip to Newfoundland go from slim to nothing in the matter of an instant. Faith in herself and her cause was responsible for getting her this far, but without anything less than a divine intervention, her fate seems set in stone when Nathaniel is taken prisoner and tortured by the newly-elected head of the North American Vampyre Union. To make matters worse, Faelynn is forced to choose whether he gets to live or die. The only problem is that she has to choose between the two most important men in her life: Nathaniel and her father. Either way, nobody can win when she makes this impossible choice. Or can they?This intriguing and passionate saga would be attractive to the habitual readers of Gothic literary works, paranormal romance, and horror.*Warning: Some scenes within Consequences: Book Three (The Celtic Vampyre Saga) contain graphic language and explicit violence.*",
