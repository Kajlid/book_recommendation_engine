  "description": "For fans of Irvine Welsh and Chuck Palahniuk, this  brash comedic farce is narrated in a unique politically incorrect manner—not for the faint-of-heart, but very, very funny  Our unnamed hero is about to experience the worst week of his life. Waking up in a boat in a car park miles from home missing a shoe is just the start—by the end of the week he will have been beaten up more than once, arrested several times, crossed the twisted leader of a Ukranian Mafia cartel, had very, very bad sex with a nymphomaniac wheelchair-user, been mistaken for a serial rapist, and faced death—his own and someone else's. Not bad for a man whose biggest claim to fame so far has been his ability to do nothing constructive at work except play practical jokes with his nerdy colleague's sandwiches. With its idiosyncratic spelling and grammar, unique internal monologues, and a sprinkling of invented words, this tale is as wild as I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell with more references to drugs than Trainspotting , leaving readers with a warm glow inside and an inane grin on their faces—not unlike that of the nameless and unfortunate hero.",
