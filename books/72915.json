  "description": "London hat designer Eliza Keating is sent on a date by her friend Lady Victoria Manning. Sir Todd Montgomery appears to be a proper English gentleman, but appearances can be deceiving. He has a passion for raising race horses, and his desires come first in his life. He has little time or patience for women, especially those as independent as Eliza. The date goes awry, and it will take a lot more than an apology to get back on Elizaâ€™s good side.",
