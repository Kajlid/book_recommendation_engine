  "description": "When crime reporter Derek Brandt paints ghost whisperer Christine Wilson as a charlatain on the nightly news, her sister Ron, an actual ghost, is incensed. Defying her sister's wishes, Ron takes it upon herself to haunt the skeptical journalist and turn him into a true believer. But Ron gets more than she bargained for when she discovers Derek is already haunted--by the ghost of his murdered brother, Jimmy. After spending years watching over his kid brother with no way to communicate, Jimmy is ready to do whatever it takes to get through to him so he can move on to his final rest. Ron is happy to help, but they need Chris in order to relay Jimmy's message to Derek. Only problem is, despite all evidence to the contrary, Derek is still convinced Chris is a fraud. And after what he did to her reputation, Chris isn't exactly filled with warm feelings for Derek, either. Can the Wilson sisters help Jimmy break down Derek's resistance and accept that his brother is still present and in need of help? And can Chris and Derek put aside their mutual distrust for Jimmy's sake? If they do, they just might find that enemies can turn out to be kindred spirits.",
