  "description": "They call them The Raven Three. They’re the most powerful and dangerous guys in town. Everyone respects them. Everyone fears them. No one ever challenges them until me.  But I have nothing to lose and nothing to fear but myself. So they give me a choice. Learn to fear them, or they’ll make sure I do.  But they weren’t expecting me to be so stubborn. And after a dangerous challenge, The Raven Three become The Raven Four.  There are rules that everyone has to obey, the most important one being we all have to stay friends.  But none of us have ever been good at following rules.  **Recommended for mature readers due to language and sexual content.**",
