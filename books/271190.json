He's recently broken up with his girlfriend and is actually talking to me...like a girl, not a bud. Just when I think this might be the happily-ever-after I've dreamed of, my brothers ruin it all. Suddenly, every boy in Sweet Water won't touch me with a ten-foot pole--including Ky. But when I'm suddenly paired with Ky for a project in yearbook, it seems like he's struggling to keep his distance.
