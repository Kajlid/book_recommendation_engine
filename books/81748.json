The two accused killers—teen lovers Bobbi Jo Smith and Jennifer Jones—were on the run, intent on going out in a cross-country blaze of glory.M. William Phelps exposes a gripping tale of sexploitation, lust, and betrayal, while questioning the court's fateful verdict in a tantalizing forensic puzzle. Were both girls equally guilty of murder? Or was one merely a pawn in the other's dainty, blood-stained hands? Includes 16 pages of dramatic photos.\"Phelps is the Harlan Coben of real-life thrillers.\" —Allison Brennan\"Phelps's writing reads like a mystery novel.\" —Suspense Magazine\"One of America's finest true-crime writers.\" —Vincent Bugliosi",
