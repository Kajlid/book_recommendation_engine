  "title": "Chickens, Mules and Two Old Fools: Tuck into a Slice of Andaluc√≠an Life",
  "description": "If Joe and Vicky had known what relocating to a tiny mountain village in Andalucia would be like, they might have hesitated... They have no idea of the culture shock in store. No idea they'll become reluctant chicken farmers and own the most dangerous cockerel in Spain. No idea they'll help capture a vulture or be rescued by a mule. Will they stay, or return to the relative sanity of England?",
