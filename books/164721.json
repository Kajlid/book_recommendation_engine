  "description": "Can a gift certificate to a fetish club and a pervertable Christmas decoration bring two co-workers together? Cindy has fantasized about spanking Marley ever since her fellow designer admitted to missing the sexual kink after ending a short-lived relationship. Rigging the office gift exchange is simple compared to admitting her growing feelings for the other woman.Marley can’t believe Cindy’s thoughtful present. The gift certificate to NYC’s notorious fetish club, Bottoms Up, would be perfect if Cindy herself were the one swinging the paddle, but admitting to having a thing for her co-worker could ruin a perfectly good working relationship as well as a treasured friendship.",
