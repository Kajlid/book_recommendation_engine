  "description": "Who dares to read The King in Yellow?A man pursued by a church organist who wants his soul. An artist plagued by repeated sightings of a watchman who looks like a coffin worm. Ghosts, wayward cats, and scientific dabblings with dire consequences. Each of these ten tales is chilling in its own right, but taken together, they weave a wickedly eerie spell that is sure to enthrall.United by vague references to a play with the same name, which never appears in the book—a play that \"induces despair or madness in those who read it\"—The King in Yellowis undoubtedly Robert W. Chambers' finest work. The book quickly gained an influence over generations of writers of \"weird tales,\" long before there was even a name for them. H. P. Lovecraft greatly admired the book, hailing it as achieving \"notable heights of cosmic fear.\"Chambers' genius will take readers to the most horrifying place of all—their own imaginations.This beautiful new reprint includes an introduction by creator and writer of True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto.",
