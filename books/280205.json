  "description": "#NeverTrustATitan  Maisey thought the worst thing to happen to her was Insta shaming or a midnight shift at the Crab Shack. Until she got dragged into the world of the gods.  Or more specifically, the world of one very annoying, bad at sarcasm, sex on legs, Titan.  Cronus was everything she never knew she wanted, or needed, in her life. And then he just left.  Left her alone, with no idea what's happening to the world, what's happening with the sins.  Only someone miscalculated. Whether it was Cronus or the fates, there's no way they can do this without Maisey.  Turns out, she's the most important piece",
