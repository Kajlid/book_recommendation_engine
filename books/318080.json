And if Iris would tell him the truth before he discovers it. And if Thomas would stop showing up at her house being the perfect mix of cute and sexy!It’s going to be HARD to stay away from him...While the romance in PAPARAZZI is a stand-alone, the plot is a continuation of events that began in BACKSTAGE (Roadies series #1).
