  "description": "Are you brave enough to really want to wake up?There are great books on how-to meditate, great books on why we should meditate, BUT not so many on why we don’t meditate.Why is it so challenging to achieve a daily practice?Why don’t our practices bear fruit?Don’t Wake Up! It Will Ruin Everything offers a gentle alarm bell, penetrating our sleep and reminding us of the possibility and cost of awakening. Don’t Wake Up! offers a humorous, mildly ironic look at several attitudes that get in the way of practicing mindfulness. By taking advantage of the power of paradox; looking at why waking up is dangerous actually strengthens our mindfulness practice.",
