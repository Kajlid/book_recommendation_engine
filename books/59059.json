  "title": "Yukiko's Spinach",
  "description": "Narrator or character? Reality or fiction? In this tender work of cinema, Boilet recounts an intimate love story in today's T?ky? between an everyday Japanese girl, Yukiko, and her occidental lover. Passionate, gentle, fresh and vibrant, it is a love so strong it hurts. Quietly paced, the story unfolds in a host of innovative techniques both narrative and visual. At the heart of the title is Boilet's deliberate (mis)use of the pronounced Japanese for [i]navel[/i] and [i]spinach[/i]. First serialized in 2000 - 2001 in the monthly Furansugo Kaiwa it is the defining work of Boilet's [i]Nouvelle Manga[/i] movement.",
