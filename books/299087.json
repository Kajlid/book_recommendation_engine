  "description": "Conner “CJ” MontgomeryI have one goal in life – finally prove my father wrong by becoming the youngest partner in my law firm. I’ve got time for exactly three things: work, work, and more work. I can’t lose, until my boss gives me one final challenge: make the first mentorship program at our Baltimore office a success and the promotion is mine.  Returning home brings up too many memories. Too many distractions. Especially when I run into Colette Dubois, the only woman who ever tempted me to make my life about more than work.  On the verge of the biggest success of my life, what will it cost me to take one more risk?  Colette DuboisI already gave up my dream of performing on Broadway to take care of my ailing mom. When they threaten to turn the lights off in my dying community theater, too, I won’t let anything stop me from saving it. It’s the only thing to bring a little light into the darkest period of my life. I can’t afford to be vulnerable, but that’s exactly what I am the moment CJ Montgomery walks back into my life after ten years of living on the West Coast. We shared a kiss all those years ago. I thought we would have the summer after high school together, but he fled in the middle of the night.  Unfortunately my heart doesn’t know when to quit. Not when we spend time together. Not when we share an unexpected kiss. Not when he repeatedly tells me he won’t be here long.  Taking a risk isn’t easy for me, but this one could change everything.",
