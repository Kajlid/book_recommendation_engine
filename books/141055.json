  "description": "Stuck on a dead space station, dismantling it from within and playing nanny to a host of the Colarium’s delinquents, Flynn Monroe can only think of two things that could make his job worse. He gets both. When his boss’ son shows up on the detail, the smart mouthed kid gives Flynn a bigger headache than the extra pair of hands deserves. Before the workday can even begin, an explosion kills a quarter of his crew, and Flynn realizes there’s more to this assignment than keeping an eye on the Senior Colari’s kid, and getting Beta Five taken apart. Tyler “Hawk” Harris likes explosions. Just ask any of his last thirteen COs – a record number for a man who’s been in the fleet less than three years. A harmless joke gets him assigned the unenviable job of pulling apart Beta Five and lands him under the supervision of a babysitter with a scar for a necklace. When the station is infiltrated by enemy agents, the explosions are not Hawk’s fault – he swears.",
