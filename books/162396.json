  "description": "No husband, no boyfriend, no pets and definitely no children... These were the \"rules\" that took magazine CEO Leila Owens to the top. Always in charge, in control, she was never rattled. Until she finds a baby in her kitchen on Christmas-and a sexy neighbor wearing next to nothing knocking at her front door... Garrick Grayson didn't know whom to comfort first, the howling infant or the career diva without a clue. But with a little help, Leila's soon juggling bottles, naps and meetings, while Garrick is falling for adorable Emma-and gorgeous, feisty, maternally challenged Leila. Garrick had sworn off women married to their jobs; Leila had sworn off everything else. So why, when they were together, did things feel so...right?",
