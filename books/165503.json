  "description": "It's been eight years since The Shattering, the day that time unravelled. On a windswept moor there's a body, brutally nailed out across a fracture. One half of the body has been dead no more than an hour or two whilst the other half, ravaged by the passing of decades within a Red Plus Zone, is little more than a skeleton. For DCI Sam McCall, a man whose demons have returned once more to haunt him, discovering the identity of the victim will only be the beginning. In the days that follow, he'll face once more the terrible truths of a world where time is broken, and find himself battling to stay sane amidst the chaos of this new, unforgiving reality.",
