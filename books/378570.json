  "title": "Dreamhealer",
  "description": "DreamHealer was originally self-published by Adam when he was sixteen, and has gone on to become an underground bestseller. The book tells the story of how the author came to discover his unique energy healing abilities, and how he became one of the most talked about healers in his country. He has been called “a miracle worker” by The Globe and Mail and his high-profile healings of astronauts and rock legends have catapulted him into standing-room-only events and consistent national media. DreamHealer is a story of both his coming to terms with his healing gift at such a young age, and his remarkable healings of people with myriad health concerns. His writing is inspirational and enlightening, and his insights into healing offer hope to anyone. Like James Van Praagh’s Talking to Heaven and Sylvia Browne’s Adventures of a Psychic , Adam’s DreamHealer heralds a new voice in spirituality.",
