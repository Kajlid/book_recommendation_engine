  "description": "“Chilling forensics, riveting suspense sequences, grisly details, and a diabolical villain . . . [a] standout thriller.” — Kirkus Reviews NYPD’s top cop, Homicide Commander Lt. John Driscoll, believes there’s a sociopathic killer on the loose murdering prostitutes in New York City—someone who calls himself “Tilden” and claims to have been sexually abused as a child by his mother’s john. But he soon discovers Tilden’s not a run-of-the-mill sociopath. After all, would a common murderer have taken the time to embalm his victims, which the city’s chief medical examiner determined was the cause of their deaths? Driscoll, a man haunted by the events of an unstable childhood himself, must put aside any sympathy he may have for Tilden and put a stop to his murderous rampage. Teamed up with Sgt. Margaret Aligante and Det. Cedric Thomlinson, who have their own issues to deal with, the commander sets out to bring Tilden to justice before he kills again . . . “O'Callaghan is back with a vengeance . . . a complex but nuanced thriller that grabs you by the throat and never lets go.” —Gregg Olsen, #1 New York Times –bestselling author of If You Tell and Water’s Edge",
