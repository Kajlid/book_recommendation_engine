That there is a piece of himself he is desperate to find. He needs answers. Answers his parents refuse to give. Who says you can’t come home again? Who says you can’t return from a grave you never knew you were lying in?  Miracle has always felt that someone is missing from her life.

Deep in her heart, she knows they have met before, but where and when?  Rebel Black has made a lot of mistakes in his past, but he’s moved on with his life.

In the center of the danger he craves, the face of an angel he’s not seen in nearly forty years just may be his end or his salvation.  The road ahead is perilous. Blood will be shed, lives will be changed, and ghosts will be resurrected. The Black Rebel Riders’ MC Saga continues. Are you ready to ride?",
