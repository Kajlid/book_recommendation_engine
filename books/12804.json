  "description": "How to comfort a young child who misses a special person when he or she is away? A treasured picture book creator has the perfect solution.Love Waves are what we send to our loved ones until we can be together again. Invisible and strong, they can fly across town or around the world, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that neither time nor space can keep love from finding its target. Combining a wonderfully concrete concept with her cozy pastel illustrations, Rosemary Wells offers an ingenious way to ease the separation anxiety many children feel when parents go to work, or live in separate homes; when close friends or relatives move, or live far away; or whenever a loved one's absence calls for an extra dose of reassurance.",
