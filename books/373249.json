  "description": "Otter Lake is a sleepy Anishnawbe community where little happens. Until the day a handsome stranger pulls up astride a 1953 Indian Chief motorcycle - and turns Otter Lake completely upside down. Maggie, the Reserve's chief, is swept off her feet, but Virgil, her teenage son, is less than enchanted. Suspicious of the stranger's intentions, he teams up with his uncle Wayne - a master of aboriginal martial arts - to drive the stranger from the Reserve. And it turns out a band of marauding raccoons are willing to lend a hand.Gently farcical, culturally illuminating, hilarious and wise, Motorcycles & Sweetgrass established Drew Hayden Taylor as a powerful new voice in Canadian fiction.",
