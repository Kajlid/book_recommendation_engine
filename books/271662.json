  "description": "The house talks. It breathes. And it's hungry. The Kings have been in the creepy old place, their new home, for only a few days, but they've experienced enough terror to last a lifetime. And the mystery is growing even more baffling. Shadowy and shifting, the big house conceals doors into other worlds that blur the line between memories and dreams-and the slightest misstep can change history forever. At least, that's if they believe the trembling old man who shows up claiming to know them. \"There's a reason you're in the house,\" he tells them. \"As gatekeepers, we must make sure only those events that are supposed to happen get through to the future.\" The problem is that horrors beyond description wait on the other side of those gates. As if that weren't enough, the Kings are also menaced by sinister forces on this side-like the dark, ancient stranger Taksidian, who wants them out now. Xander, David, and Toria must venture beyond the gates to save their missing mother-and discover how truly high the stakes have become.",
