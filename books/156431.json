  "description": "Brand New Ancients is the tale of two families and their intertwining lives, set against the background of the city and braided with classical myth. Here, Tempest shows how the old myths still live on in our everyday acts of violence, bravery, sacrifice and love â€“ and that our lives make tales no less dramatic and powerful than those of the old gods.",
