  "description": "Can humanity save itself before it’s too late?It is the year 2084.The last of humanity exists in AI-controlled incubators, living perfect virtual lives, while our planet stands desolate.Eric Smed is one of the last remaining humans on Earth, as he writes an essay on the history of our species.His account is a world ravaged by climate change, endless conflict, and humans’ eventual – and willing – retreat into the safety of Artificial Intelligence.Humanity has proven itself incapable stewards of the planet, and in order to save both ourselves and the natural world, we have forsaken it by severing all ties with reality, choosing instead to only live in digital dreams.In this speculative, yet all-too-believable future, the virtual utopia humanity has created is also its ultimate dystopia. We have everything we desire—but only in dreams we could not achieve ourselves, either individually or as a society.Part speculative fiction, part true history, The Dystopian Utopia explores centuries of human advancement, the deterioration of our environment and our repeated failure to unite for meaningful change.A powerful cautionary tale, The Dystopian Utopia warns of the path we are on—while reminding us that it’s not yet too late to choose a different future.",
