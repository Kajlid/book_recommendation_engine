  "description": "Kinsey's skills are about to be sorely tested. She is about to meet her match in a couple of duplicitous, world-class prevaricators who quite literally take her for the ride of her life!'L is for Lawless,' but you could call it 'Kinsey Millhone in Bad Company.' Call it a mystery without a murder, a treasure hunt without a map, a quest novel with truly mixed-up motives. Call it the return of Kinsey as a bad girl - quick-witted and quick-silvery. She pokes her nose into everybody's dirty laundry as she joins up with a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde in an 'Our Gang' comedy that will take her halfway across the country and leave her with a major headache and an empty bank balance.America's favorite borderline delinquent is back with her one-liners and her energy level on high, romping through her fastest and funniest adventure in this, her twelfth foray into the alphabet of crime.",
