  "description": "A Japanese boy, his father, and a crowded department store provide the setting. Originally published in Japan, \"I Lost My Dad\" provides a fresh approach to an age-old theme... Lost! Gomi's solid, simply painted figures against white backgrounds are refreshing. Children will happily take part in this playful quest, which helps to assuage this common fear with its happy ending, and parents will welcome the opportunity to discuss what steps to take if the situation arises in their own family.",
