  "title": "This Is Why I Hate You: The Tragic Story of Arthur Gale",
  "description": "Within these pages wait violent fights, disease, death, controversy, sexuality, tragedy and crime. This journal documents a hateful young man's path to darkness. Many events that occur are based on real events. You will find many moments from the authors own life sewn into the life of Arthur Gale. You can only go so far before all hope of return is lost; this book reaches that point, and goes even farther. James represented the light, Arthur is the dark. There is no hero. There is only Arthur.",
