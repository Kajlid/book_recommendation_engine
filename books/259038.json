  "description": "Are second chances a myth? After twenty-five years, I expected champagne and flowers. What I got instead is heartbreak and a divorce. With my life a shambles, I hit the road and begin a voyage of self discovery and growth. When my keyboard reveals a world of sensual fantasy and dark desires, I don’t know whether to leap into the unknown or play things safe. What I do know is that I’m worth a second chance. I may be forty-five, but I’m not ready to give up on love.",
