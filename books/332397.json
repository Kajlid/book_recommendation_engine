  "description": "Lights. Camera. Action…I've got everything it takes to make it in Tinseltown: confidence, charisma, and a killer chin. Now all I need is a chance.But Los Angeles is full of hot, young hunks, and talent might not be enough to separate me from the cookie-cutter crowd.Well, you know what they say: fake it till you make it.So I devise a wild scheme to get noticed. Pretend I’m someone I'm not—goodbye Will O’Connell of Cincinnati and hello Liam O’Connell of Dublin. ‘Liam’ and his talent with accents is enough to get my foot in the door, but I never anticipated meeting the woman who has me more worried about keeping my foot out of my mouth.Enter Raven Locke, the dark-haired bombshell who puts the ‘tude in tattooed.On set, she’s the costumer tasked with fitting my pants, but all I can think about is how to get into hers.As my—I mean, Liam’s—budding career begins to heat up, so do our feelings.While Raven pursues her passion for fashion; I chase her heart.Our picture-perfect screenplay seems sure to send us riding off onto Sunset Boulevard… Until Raven finds out that Comedy and Tragedy aren’t the only masks I'm wearing. Our romance might be destined for the cutting room floor, unless I can salvage our story with a plot twist she won't see coming.*This first-person, male-POV rom-com has it all: lots of heat, plenty of heart, and a Hollywood-worthy HEA.",
