  "description": "It’s Christmastime on Elysia. The weather is as wintery as one can expect in a rain forest and our annual secret Santa game is in full swing. Yet for me, something’s missing. My heart aches whenever I think of mi familia back home. Still, I’m determined to make this Christmas a special one and when I meet a Grinchy, green alien living high on a mountain above our village I’ve suddenly got a project.For years this guy has been living in solitude—That ends now. No one should be alone, especially at Christmas. Family is the dearest thing to my heart and I’m going to make this Grinch a part of mine whether he likes it or not. But the one thing I didn’t plan on, was falling in love in the process.",
