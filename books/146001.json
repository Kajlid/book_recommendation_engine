  "title": "The Mephisto Waltz",
  "description": "\"Paula and Myles Clarkson's luck was in the ascendant. After a period of depression following his resounding failure as a concert pianist, Myles had decided, with Paula's encouragement to turn to a career in writing. Now the free-lance assignments that would finance his work on a novel were beginning to come in, among them a journalist's dream - the chance to interview the internationally celebrated pianist Duncan Ely. Astonishingly, the notoriously difficult Duncan warms toward him, sensing perhaps in Myles' love for music - and in his extraordinary pianist's hands - a kindred soul. The Mephisto Waltz is a spellbinder of a novel - a novel that makes Rosemary's Baby look like child play.\" The book was made into a major motion picture released in 1971 starring Alan Alda, Jacqueline Bisset and Curt Jurgens",
