She finds herself competing against five male assassins, in a remote alpine forest area of Japan.

Kaiya struggles to resist the irresistible lure of the Australian assassinâ€™s game of seduction. She is determined to come out on top in this grueling training program, with her heart also intact. When Kaiya returns to Tokyo nothing is the same. All six opponents are drawn into the existing deadly blood feud between Kaiya's father and uncle. Unexpected alliances emerge and loyalties are tested in a dangerous game of cat and mouse. *Warning: This book is intended to be read by mature audiences.",
