  "description": "Kali has been working toward her dream of building an airship and escaping the frozen Yukon for so long that she can scarcely believe it’s close to becoming a reality. There’s just one problem. Cedar, her friend and business partner (and maybe a little more), is in jail, and the American authorities are on their way to hang him. The Mounties aren’t listening to reason, so the only way to free him may be to break him out of their headquarters—if she can. Even if she succeeds, she’ll be branded a criminal for the rest of her life.",
