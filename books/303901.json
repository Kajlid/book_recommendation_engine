All the therapy in the world doesn’t seem to help, and no one wants to love him broken like he is.Raven’s patience and understanding seem genuine, but will he stick around when things slide backward? Because they always do. Can Raven accept Ireland’s limitations, or will he be like everyone else and leave in the end? Touch of Love is a hurt comfort MM romance with moderate angst. It is part of the Trials of Fear series but can be read as a standalone.**This book has been re-covered but has the same content**",
