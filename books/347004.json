  "description": "“Kimberla Lawson Roby is a true writer, a storyteller at the top of her game.”—Eric Jerome Dickey   Alicia Black is back! The pampered, privileged daughter of the irrepressible scoundrel Rev. Curtis Black and protagonist of Kimberla Lawson Roby’s New York Times bestseller The Best of Everything, Alicia makes her triumphant return in Be Careful What You Pray For. Alicia is newly remarried, to a man of the cloth who unfortunately mirrors far-too-closely her rascally dad. The Reverend Black himself, star of Sin No More, Too Much of a Good Thing, and other popular Roby novels, co-stars in Be Careful What You Pray For —a tale of love and ambition that once again deals with important issues as it tells a witty, moving, page-turning story, a bestselling combination that is a Kimberla Lawson Roby hallmark.",
