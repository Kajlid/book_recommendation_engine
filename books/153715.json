Will she and Senefru find a way to reconcile the past or will something much more sinister find her first?Excerpt from Burn My Soul: Part I-Revised : By Author Holly Newhouse and Editor Toni Michelle (A 5 star read! and not erotica, just one scene that's explicit)\"Jinny, my love, you were made for this, for me, for my touch and command, my kisses blistering you until you writhe beneath me like a puddle of pure want and need. Your body was created for the incredible pleasure a demon can bring, it's so damn sensitive and the sight of you in the throes of an orgasm as you scream my name, it leaves me speechless.\" Franklin said with love, want and desire coating his voice.",
