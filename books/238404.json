  "description": "HE KNOWS IF YOU'VE BEEN BAD OR GOOD....Picture-perfect Evergreen, California, nestled on the shores of Reindeer Lake in the snowy Sierras, is the perfect place for a no-strings holiday fling with a gorgeous Latin lover. Workaholic Kimberly Michaels didn't come to Evergreen only to enjoy herself, though; she's there to consummate a development deal in which her company will take over the town -- whether the town wants it or not. Ricco Maza, whose sister owns the quaint B & B where Kim is staying, may be the hottest man she's ever met (and the only one who can persuade her to relax enough for an orgasm!) but if he discovers why Kim is in town, she'll soon be finding more coal and switches than kisses in her Christmas stocking. And as Kim's frosty winter nights steam up with her sexy Santa, she realizes she's going to have to make a choice. Is winning the deal truly the most important thing in life, or will this jaded cynic let Santa finally give her a little taste of Christmas magic?",
