  "description": "Everyone died in the aftermath of the devastating Devil Virus that ravaged the entire population of Earth. There were no survivors. Five days later, however, the freshly dead returned to life. Zombie Gang: Regenerated Earth tells a different kind of apocalyptic zombie story. Some returned as Deadheads, who are like predatory flesh-eating zombies. Another group of beings rises from the dead. Those beings are self-aware and they have retained some of their once held human traits. A combination of human and zombie, they are called Zumans.Zombie Gang: Regenerated Earth follows a teenage gang of Zumans as they struggle to balance their undead existence with their survival against Deadheads and other Zuman survivors, many of whom are dangerous and predatory themselves. At every turn, unspeakable horrors face them as the structures of society collapses all around them. Led by 17-year old Enrico, the most human-like of the undead gang, he must lead the tattered remnants of society in the fight against the Deadhead uprising. It is a war of undead versus the undead. Oh, the Zumanity!A teen horror novel that is disgusting enough to make the hairs on your neck stand up, but PG enough to keep the adults off your back.",
