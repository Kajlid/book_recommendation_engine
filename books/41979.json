  "description": "The O'Rourke sisters are back! It's been four years since the events of Must've Done Something Good, and Sylvie is slipping back into her procrastinating ways. When Kate and Meg show up for another \"sisterly life smackdown,\" she can't believe it's happening again... But, if she's being honest, lounging on the couch all day watching Judge Carmen and making sure the soup cupboard stays in tip-top shape probably is not the life she was born to live. When Meg enlists Sylvie to help run a Common Sense Academy in town, she reluctantly agrees, thinking it may be just the thing to kick-start her life—and help her sister realize her dream, to boot. That is, until a rival school springs up, determined to drive them out of business. And as if that's not enough to worry about, Kate and Jared announce they're having a baby, prompting Sylvie and Evan to examine their own feelings about parenthood, and leading Meg to wonder if there could possibly be a future with Luke, the father of one of the Academy's most endearing students. Join the O'Rourke sisters as they don disguises, stage a mall melee, engage in school-to-school combat, and issue a televised ultimatum—all on their way to discovering that, when it comes to finding your dream, sometimes a little confidence is really all it takes.",
