  "description": "Detective Ben Russo is in trouble.  He just can’t remember why. When a car accident lands Ben in the hospital, he can’t recall anything about his life. What he does know is he’s enchanted by a tiny nurse named Tess, but can’t shake the feeling they’re both in danger. After being left at the altar, Tess Jansenn moves to a new town and starts over. When her ex-fiancé, Ben, shows up in the ER where she works with no memory of her, she must decide – tell Ben who he is or let him remember on his own. Can Tess forgive and forget what drove them apart, and when Ben remembers, will the consequences of his choices make it too late for love?",
