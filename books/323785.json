  "description": "A wickedly funny new festive adventure from a stellar picture-book collaboration! Hilda Snibbs takes her three mischievous little monkeys to stay with her Uncle Gilbert for Christmas. Among many amazing things, Uncle Gilbert’s prized possession is an ancient golden teapot, so the little monkeys must be very good. But what is supposed to be a traditional holiday is soon filled with chaos! Hilda begins to regret bringing the three little monkeys with her – until, one night, their antics come in very handy . . . Quentin Blake’s delightfully funny story is brought to life by Emma Chichester Clark’s beautiful mixed-media illustrations in this irresistible follow-up to Three Little Monkeys and Three Little Monkeys Ride Again.",
