What they find goes beyond everything they knew. What they find horrifies, but also entices. Their fellow survivors are so much more than they seem, their surroundings so much stranger than anything they could imagine.  Sometimes, it would seem, the future only arrives after the world burns.  A new future will now dawn for the few survivors of mankind. It will be a future created from the best humanity had to offer. It will be a future built upon impossible dreams, and impossible nightmares. Theres will be a new world soaked in the blood of billions. It will not be pretty at first, it will be dark and filled with every terror conceived by man.  But the night cannot last forever...in time, it will shine.",
