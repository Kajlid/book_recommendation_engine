  "title": "Now it Begins",
  "description": "Now It Begins is a comprehensive self-help book that draws upon personal testimony, professional guidance and the best of New Age thinking to empower people to fully take control of their lives.Split into 10 distinct \"phases\" it systematically tackles some of life's biggest and most personal questions about identity and interconnectivity, love and fear, and choice and destiny.Arguing that most of us are trapped in a harmful illusionary world of our own subconscious creation, Gary Markwick urges readers to break the mental chains holding them back and by exercising the gift of choice take responsibility for their own future happiness.At the heart the title is the simple assertion that once you can let go of illusion and draw upon a more fundamental, universal source of motivation, then you will reconnect with your true purpose on earth.Illustrated throughout with ancient learning and pithy stories that gently bring home the important points being made, Now It Begins will consistently inspire and encourage people on their exciting journey to freedom and fulfilment.The world is now on the verge of a great spiritual awakening and everybody owes it to themselves, and their neighbours, to tap into the limitless energy of the moment and bring about a lasting change for the better.",
