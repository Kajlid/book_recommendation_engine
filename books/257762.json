  "description": "Mick Jagger, Jimi Hendrix, Freddie Mercury…  They say I’ll be bigger than all of them.  They throw around words and phrases:  “Could be the greatest ever…”  “Revolutionary sound…”  I don’t give a sh*t about anything but my music. It’s my art. My escape.  Until I run into a fiery redhead coming out of the bathroom of my favorite dive bar. Literally run into her. Both of us pressed against the wall. Her panting against my neck.  Bristol’s different—quick-witted and snarky, not the usual groupie. She doesn’t care that every record label in the country wants to sign my band. She didn’t even know who we were until tonight.  But, she wants me. They all do. They want me to be that one mistake they tell their friends about after they’ve settled down in a subdivision and popped out a few kids with the perfect, even-keeled husband. That one time they slept with the bad boy rockstar on all the magazine covers.  There’s only one problem with Bristol—I don’t want to stop seeing her.  I don’t want anyone else looking at her, touching her, or calling her.  She drives me insane.  I have to make a choice.  Do I want Bristol or do I want to be a Rock God?",
