  "title": "The Ascent of Rum Doodle",
  "description": "Led by the reliably underinsightful Binder, a team of seven British men—including Dr. Prone (constantly ill), Jungle the route-finder (constantly lost), Constant the diplomat (constantly arguing), and 3,000 Yogistani porters—set out to conquer the highest peak in the Himalayas. Though a parody, it has become one of the most famous and celebrated books of mountaineering literature.",
