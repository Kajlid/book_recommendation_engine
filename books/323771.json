  "description": "Alanna Simms has been having a problem finding Mr. Right. But when she and her friends stumble across a charm shop just in time for Halloween, her friends think they have found the solution to her problem. Of course, Alanna doesn’t believe in magic, but at the urging of her friends, goes along with the whole thing anyway. But Alanna is unprepared when she finds a sexy pirate passed out on her living room floor hours after doing the magic spell. Considering how gorgeous he is, that wouldn’t be half bad, if it weren’t for two very annoying problems. One, they can’t get more than twenty feet apart from each other. And two, he spanks. That woman at the charm shop must have made a terrible mistake because Garren Dandridge couldn’t be the right man for her. Could he? - Eight chapters",
