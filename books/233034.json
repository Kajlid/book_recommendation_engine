  "description": "There’s a fine line between love and hate, and it’s about to be set on fire.\nBrix Ward is a Grade A prick.⠀⠀He's arrogant, spoiled, and self-centered. As the lead singer of A Rebels Havoc, he's used to women falling over themselves for a chance to tame the wild bad boy.⠀⠀Except for me.⠀⠀I still remember the boy I grew up with. The one who went out of his way to make my life a living hell. I did my best to avoid him at all costs.⠀⠀Imagine my surprise when our parents announced they had eloped, then left me to live with my new stepbrother. Alone.⠀⠀Now, no matter what I do, there's no escaping him. He's always there, tempting me, provoking me. Every moment of every day. The more we're around each other, the more the heat between us begins to rise.⠀⠀If he thinks he can hurt me again, he’s dead wrong.⠀⠀I won’t let him be the one to destroy me, even if it breaks my heart.",
