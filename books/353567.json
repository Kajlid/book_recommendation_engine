  "description": "After her center-court split with Aiden, Tessa put the SOS behind her. After all, cheaters never prosper! Now she's busy working on her faux-relationship with Aiden and negotiating the unfamiliar waters of \"technically single and pseudo-dating.\" Life can't get any more dismal for a one-guy kind of girl until an imposter hijacks the SOS, and it's up to Tessa to save her squad from slander. But with her best boy hot and cold, what's a kitten to do? Even worse, Tessa doesn't realize how much she's up againstâ€”because this copykitten is far more naughty than nice.",
