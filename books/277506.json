  "description": "Victor Bayne sees dead people. Working homicide is a cinch for him, since the victims can finger their killers, and give the how, when and why of their own demises. So work is no big challenge. It's the rest of Vic's life that gives him problems. PsyCop: Property contains PsyCop stories 3 and 4 (Body & Soul, and Secrets). In Body & Soul, Victor tracks down missing persons while his lover, Jacob, tries to find a home they can move into that's not infested-with either cockroaches, or ghosts. A deceased junkie with a bone to pick leads Victor on a wild chase that ends in a basement full of horrors. Secrets finds Victor and Jacob settling into their new home, but Victor finds the notion that Jacob's been holding back on some pertinent information distinctly unsettling, to say the least. Jacob's on a case that has him stretched to the breaking point, and Victor's old partner Lisa needs him to help her work through an ethical psychic dilemma. Find out more at www.PsyCop.com",
