  "description": "Kael has seen into the mind of the enemy and witnessed an abomination beyond imagining. Thousands of years of collaboration have allowed the Myndarym to construct a vast and complex system for exploiting the earth and its inhabitants. It is an ancient legacy of evil, and for the remnants of Null to destroy it, they must capture the system’s last surviving creator. Kael has only one advantage against this ruthless warrior, but leveraging it will take him through a battlefield of the world’s most advanced weaponry and expose his greatest weaknesses—patience and trust. The journey will bring them all together in ways they never thought possible, leading to a startling revelation that will shake the very foundations of the world. In book six of Jason Tesar’s bestselling Awakened series, the epic saga spreads across the globe in a web of intricate schemes that weave together the genres of fantasy, sci-fi, and military fiction.",
