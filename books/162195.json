  "description": "Jackie Holiday has moved to Amazon!  While recovering in the hospital from a hit and run car accident, Deidre McDonough meets handsome detective Tony Capella, who had no idea that falling in love would cause Deirdre to once again be fighting for her life. Join Deirdre and Tony in their action packed, thrilling adventure as they work to unravel the mystery of the Murder in the E.R.  Deirdre sat up on her bed \"I would SO love to shave my legs right now, but I'm not supposed to. There's sort of a metal rod going through my leg.\" Courtney picked up the shave gel and gave it a shake, \"Dee, you get way too hung up on rules.\"  Courtney pulled up the sheet, started rubbing on the shave gel and said, \"Gee, we could have done a bikini wax too. I wish I had thought of it.\" Deirdre laughed, \"Yeah, like that's ever going to happen.\" Courtney shaved Deirdre’s legs, rinsing the razor in the plastic hospital water carafe. Just as Courtney finished rubbing Deirdre’s legs with moisturizer, Deirdre saw Courtney's eyes grow wide. And who should walk in but Detective Tony Capella, \"Hi, I heard this was a big day and thought I'd…\" Tony looked down at Deirdre's freshly shaved legs, which he did not find flabby. No, not flabby at all. \"I'm sorry. I should have knocked. I, I should really… I should probably go.\" Courtney hopped up off the side of the bed, \"No, I was just leaving. You should stay.\" Courtney pushed Tony into a chair. \"I'll see you tomorrow Dee. Love ya’.” As Courtney leaned down to give Deirdre a kiss on the forehead, Deirdre whispered, \"Thank you Court. You're the best.\"  \"Yeah well I um… I just wanted to stop by and see how you were doing.\" Deirdre struggled between smiling, and looking nonchalant, \"That's cool. Did you find out who ran me over? \"",
