  "description": "Book 1 of the NEXT TIME AROUND seriesFreshly divorced at 40 yrs old, Chloe Zanders has few illusions left about her ability to make her dreams come true. She is never going to be thin, never going to be a famous singer, and never going to be sexy enough to keep a man like her handsome ex-football player husband from cheating. While the first two dreams might continue to flicker hopefully inside her, Chloe now accepts the last one had been doomed from the start. All her ex ever did in their marriage was find fault with her. After learning about the latest twenty-something in his life, divorcing Aaron is just a relief because it means Chloe can finally stop trying to save a relationship so obviously not worth saving. With her friends encouraging her to move on, Chloe secretly vows to herself that next time around, she is going to look for a man who will love her just as she is. When she meets 45 yr, Jasper Wade, his unrestrained kisses send lust and renewed hope singing through her. What Chloe feels for Jasper is disturbingly too much too soon, but how can she turn away from a man who keeps insisting sheâ€™s his every fantasy come true?",
