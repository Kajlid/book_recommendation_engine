  "description": "Mick must face the dragon council for breaking their laws, and while he doesn't seem too worried about his upcoming trial, Janet will do anything to keep him safe. She'll need a little help from her friends, old and new: Nash and Coyote; Cassandra, a powerful witch turned hotel manager; and Colby, a sort-of-trustworthy dragon. But now a new, dark power is stirring in Magellan that Janet must face, but even more frightening, one is stirring within herself.",
