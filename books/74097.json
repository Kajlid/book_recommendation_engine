But none of this prepared her for the shock of becoming a genie herself.At a time when she's trying to figure out who she wants to be, Margo is forced to become whomever her master wants. Everything she's taken for granted—graduating from high school, going to college, performing in the school musical, even being a girl—is called into question. But she’s also coming into a power she never imagined she'd have.How will Margo reconcile who she is with what she’s becoming? And where will she and Oliver stand when she's done?",
