  "title": "Little Book of Prayers for New Thought Christians",
  "description": "Prayer is considered by some to be elevated thought. Prayer can also be described as oneâ€™s highest intention. It is sometimes said that prayer is talking to God and meditation is listening to God. The common thread of the many and varied concepts of prayer and ways of praying is that it is the human aspiration and activity of accessing a mystical connection with the Most High. Whatever our belief, our style, our ability, or our concept of God, He/She/It meets us right where we are in our human consciousness and situation. Simply by our intention of holding spiritual space, our consciousness is lifted. By the mere act of praying, we are declaring and affirming that God is greater than any appearance, circumstance, or condition.May the following 12 preparatory meditations and 40 prayers that comprise this diminutive trove serve to move you into a greater realization of the truth of your being and inspire in you an expanded experience of GOD.",
