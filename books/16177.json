  "description": "A tragic past. A weak moment. One Kiss. Jake Winston has always done the right thing, which is why he walked out of his best friend's wedding over a year ago and took the job in London to avoid meeting up with Evan's beautiful, young bride. But now, Julia needs him, and he can't just walk away this time.Julia Hamilton is well acquainted with grief, but when she carelessly imbibes in a deadly combination of pain killers and martinis at her dead husband's funeral and confides to a complete stranger that she's unsure she can start over again, it leads to an inexplicable connection that never should have happened. After all, Julia loved Evan, didn't she? And, it turns out; Jake Winston has secrets of his own. Julia explains it away by telling her well-meaning friends that it was just one kiss in a weak moment for both of them. It doesn't change anything. Or, does it change everything? And, therein lies the problem.\nPlease be advised that SEEING JULIA contains adult language and adult situations and is not appropriate for young readers. (New Adult Fiction, Contemporary Romance)",
