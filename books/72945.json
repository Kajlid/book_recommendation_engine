  "description": "Five suburban mall rats and a washed up Goth singer find themselves stranded in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey where they discover two horrifying truths: The Jersey Devil, hellspawn of folklore and legend, is real; and New Jersey (as many already suspected) is the gateway to Hell!With the help of one lone witch, this small group must face off against their deepest fears and the most unholy monsters in a battle where their very souls, the world they live in, and any chance of returning to Hot Topic in one piece is at stake!The first novel by musician and horror media personality, Aurelio Voltaire, Call of the Jersey Devil is a hilarious and terrifying homage to 80s horror and genre films. Like a mad doctor, Voltaire has Frankensteined together elements of Evil Dead, The Breakfast Club, Poltergeist, and This is Spinal Tap to create a creature feature that will have you laughing out loud when you're not glancing nervously over your shoulder.Early praise for the book:\"Aurelio Voltaire continues his reign among the pantheon of Goth gods. CALL OF THE JERSEY DEVIL is sly and sweet, nasty and naive, sulphurous and charming, witty, wooly, crackling with evil and stunning in its sincerity. What a read! Long live Voltaire!\" - Caroline Thompson (The Nightmare Before Christmas, Edward Scissorhands, Corpse Bride, The Addams Family)\"I LOVE it! It's mental, and hilarious, and brilliant, and *kind of* gross\"- Joanne Harris (author of Chocolat, Runemarks, Runelight, Blue Eyed Boy)",
