The owner offers me the chance of a lifetime: if I keep my lips zipped about why I’m there, I can work off the loan in front of the camera. I’m thrilled, but self-conscious: who wants to work with a skinny twink like me? Then the biggest, scariest star of all asks for me. In fact, Daddy demands me. And, like both his partners warn me: what Daddy wants, Daddy gets. Can I really handle three bears? As they close in on me, I realise…it’s too late to run.DADDYGoldie is shy, innocent, brand-new…and totally irresistible. I’m going to make him ours. The three of us have enough love for a fourth. It’s supposed to be only for a weekend, but our golden angel’s secrets betray a broken soul that needs mending…and I’m the man to do it. Goldie’s sleazy ex is too cold for him, and this weekend might be too hot. But the four of us together? That feels just right. And when I find out why Goldie’s really there, we’ll stop at nothing to save our golden boy.Golden is a super steamy, standalone MMMM gay romance novella featuring a picturesque cottage in the English countryside, lashings of praise for a shy boy, one very fat cat who knows best, enough porridge for four hungry tummies, and a guaranteed HEA with absolutely no cliffhanger.",
