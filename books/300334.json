  "description": "Hard and fast in 280 characters or less. If his number one goal is to make me crazy, it’s working. This arrogant cook has never met a woman he wanted to sleep with more than once. Me? I’m an old-fashioned girl and a virgin to boot. I want the real thing and I want it to last forever. So why is he following me on Chatter? And asking me to Chatter him back? He may have a million followers, but his cocky one-liners won’t work on me. He says he’ll follow me to the ends of the earth, but I can't help thinking he just wants another conquest. And even if it is more than that, I'm not sure I can handle the heat he brings. Dear Reader, Benji’s a mountain man chef with an appetite. He’s starving and ready to eat whatever you’re cookin’! So place an order and take a seat, it’s time for a meal you’ll never forget! #yummy #whatsfordinner #ordersup #fingerlickinggood Love, Frankie",
