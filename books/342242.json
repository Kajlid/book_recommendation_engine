  "title": "Lost & Found: A Memoir of Mothers",
  "description": "For anyone who'd ever lost--or maybe even found--a mother. I swore I'd never let my birthmother into my life, but then Mom died of ovarian cancer and my birthmother, Val, found me through my mom's obituary. Hard to argue with fate. Harder still to let go of childhood promises, even when you discover everything you dreamed of being in part of who you are.",
