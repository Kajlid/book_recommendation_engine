  "description": "'This is a wonderful novel, powerful, humane and moving. It's also one of the best police procedurals I've read this year' Ann Cleeves How far would you go to protect your child? Can you really keep them safe? What if who they are puts them at risk? And what if they have blood on their hands? Teenager Allie Kennaway heads off for prom night, cheered on by her dad Steve and little sister Teagan. But Allie never comes home, beaten to death in an apparent hate crime because of her transgender identity. As police investigate the brutal murder, a crime that has appalled the country, one parent is at her wit's end with her son's behaviour. Are his outbursts and silences hiding something much darker than adolescent mood swings? And if her suspicions are correct, then what does she do? Another parent will fight tooth and nail to save his boy from the full force of the law. After all, blood is thicker than water and everyone should look after their own. But if he succeeds then Allie and her family will never get the justice they deserve. A groundbreaking story of love and hate, loyalty and betrayal, in a world of change. Praise for Cath 'Harrowing and humane. A real knockout' Ian Rankin 'It's always exciting to see a writer get better and better and Cath Staincliffe is doing just that' Val McDermid 'Remarkable depth ... The most grown-up writer in British crime fiction' Telegraph Complex and satisfying - Sunday Times",
