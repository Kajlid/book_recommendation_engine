The name, my name, is usually followed by fucking prick or self-serving bastard, and I can't say I haven't earned those titles. It's true. I'm not the good guy. I'm not the boy next door. I'm definitely not your Prince fucking Charming. Not even close. And I never wanted to be. Until her.  The day I pulled her from the wreckage was the day that my life changed. Who would have thought that one little lie had the power to throw two lives so off course?Love has never been in the cards for me, but now that she’s here, I have no idea how I’m ever going to let her go. Even if I don’t deserve her.Because like I said, I’m a self-serving bastard and some things never change.",
