  "title": "The Awokening: Clarity, Culture and Identity in the Web of Chaos",
  "description": "The digital age has birthed The Great Awokening. Grievances previously overlooked - mental illness, racism, gender identity, homophobia, the need for safe spaces - now occupy centre stage. The current cultural climate demands us to declare our standing quickly and emphatically - often without pause for understanding. Looking at how the concept of a spiritual awakening has evolved into present day 'wokeness' - and how it has in turn lead to further polarisation rather than unification - in THE AWOKENING, Ayishat Akanbi encourages an appeal to humanism. It is a timely and inspiring reminder of the power of curiosity and the benefits of intellectual humility, and an urge to partake in the gruelling task of developing self-awareness, such that we can become more socially aware - and aware of each other.",
