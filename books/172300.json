  "description": "Lana Dixon may have won her destined mate’s heart, but that was in Arizona. Now, she’s bringing her desert wolf home to meet her family — the sworn enemies of his pack. How far will they push her mate to prove himself worthy? And is their relationship ready for the test?* This 7500 word SHORT STORY takes place two years after the events of Desert Moon (Book 1 of the Wolves of Twin Moon Ranch series). It includes adult content and is NOT a full length book. It is, however, a fun, sexy, and action-packed tale with an up-close and personal look at Lana and Ty's happily ever after. The perfect follow-up for fans of Desert Moon! *",
