  "description": "Krista Sloan is a feisty redhead with a heart of gold. As a physical therapist she gives 110%. With a reputation for being the best at pulling no punches when it comes to recovery, Krista thrives on restoring her patients to their former glory. But behind closed doors she still hasn’t been able to heal her own heart since it was shattered into a million pieces, ten years ago, by the only man she’s ever loved. Chase Malone always had a love for music, and it showed in the way the sexy Adonis commanded the stage at every one of his sold out concerts. But his rock star status is hollow and incomplete because he can’t share it with his first true love. Every night that he sings to packed arenas, he sings to her, remembering the young love they shared and the night he had to leave her and his tortured past. When an emergency calls Chase back to Harper’s Crossing, he’ll have no choice but to face that tortured past and all the ghosts that come with it. Will Chase be able to find his place again in the heart of the woman that sheltered him all those years ago? Will Krista be able to open her heart once again to the one man who owned her mind, body, and soul? They’ll have to risk it all for their Crazy Love.",
