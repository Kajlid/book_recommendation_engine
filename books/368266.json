  "description": "The four previous volumes in Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling's anthology series of fairly tales retold with a distinctively modern edge have been hailded by reviewers as \"brilliant,\" \"provocative,\" and \"disturbing.\" In this triumphant new collection of original fiction, twenty-one of today's leading writers spin the cherished fables of childhood into glittering gold--offering magical tales for adults, as seductive as they are sophisticated.A jealous prince plots the destruction of his hated brother's wedding by inventing a \"magic\" suit of clothing visible only to the pure at heart...A young girl's strange fairy tale obsession results in a brutal murder... An embittered mother cares for her dying son who is trapped in a thicket that guards a sleeping beauty... In a bleak and desolate industrial wasteland, a group of violent outcasts lays the tattered myths of one Millenium to rest, and gives terrifying birth to those of the next.Erotic, compelling, witty, and altogether extraordinary, these stories lay bare our innermost demons and desires--imaginatively transforming our youthful fantasies into things darker, slyer, and more delightfully subversive.\nThe \"Snow White, Blood Red\" Collection\n#1. \nSnow White, Blood Red\n#2. \nBlack Thorn, White Rose\n#3. \nRuby Slippers, Golden Tears\n#4. \nBlack Swan, White Raven\n#5. \nSilver Birch, Blood Moon\n#6. \nBlack Heart, Ivory Bones",
