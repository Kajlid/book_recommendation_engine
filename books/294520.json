  "title": "The Tracker Hive Academy: Year Three",
  "description": "Turns out almost dying will leave you in a contemplative space, reflecting on violence, strategy, and revenge. For me, reliving those exact moments is the push I need to find the man who threatened my life. It also makes wasting time sitting in a classroom a pain in the ass.    After surviving a year and a half at Tracker Hive Academy, I'm left with wondering what's next for me: the-eight-element-carrying Junior Tracker with four boyfriends, a destructive alter ego, and no professional filter. Obviously, I have to face the person who wants me dead, but there has to be more to this, especially with certain allies involved.  Unfortunately, things only get more complicated when my sexy Trouble Four start having imbalance problems — again, making it difficult for everyone to tell them apart — except for me, of course. And if that weren’t enough, my Shadow wants to add to the chaos by attacking the very students we’re attempting to protect.  My life is definitely a shitstorm, and when my dad Alaric goes missing during an assignment, all bets are off.  I am the queen of my hive and I won't be told how to fight for what’s mine. With Zeke, Zion, Zackery, and Zeus on my side, there's nothing I need to fear — especially with Calvin as our wild card. We’re a deadly threat, and this hive survives best by doing one thing: breaking all the rules.    Game on.",
