  "description": "From Jen, the creator of the hit blog CakeWrecks.com, comes the \"best\" of the worst cakey creations out there: the grammar goof-ups, the unintentionally creepy, the accidentally suggestive, the ugly, the sad, and the just plain funny, all served up with Jen's unique blend of wit, sarcasm, and punny patter. Combining all-new material along with fan favorites and behind-the-scenes tidbits on the hardships and hilarity of running a popular blog, 'Cake Wrecks' is sure to please both new and old fans alike. Jen Yates has been a clown, a cash office accountant, a Jungle Cruise skipper, a small business owner, a children's book inventory expeditor, and a house painter. She loves all types of cake and the people who make them, especially if they share. She currently lives in Florida with her husband, John, and their two cats.",
