  "description": "Eagles mate for life. When the eagles of Gaspar choose a mate, the Eaglekins they are each true-bonded with become mates as well. Hydeia's eagle decides to mate at an inconvenient time. The attraction flowing between her and the Eaglekin male she is now connected to is hard to resist. But resist him she must; for she has been charged with a crucial task and isn't about to let anyone slow her down. Ammah can't believe his eagle has taken a mate, thereby entangling him with an Eaglekin female. He'd hardened his heart against the ways of his people long ago. Now he is faced with a stubborn woman who insists that he is her mate. But how can he walk away when the little fool is plunging headlong into danger? Worse, how will he withstand the magnetic pull drawing him to her?",
