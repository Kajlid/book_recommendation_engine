  "description": "Sun Catcher desperately wants to become a trusted scout for her tribe so she can prove that she’s worthy of keeping her beautiful mare, Sunshine. Unfortunately, on their very first scouting trip together, checking the mountain pass to their winter home, they are caught in a rockslide. Then Sunshine disappears! Hoping the wind-drinker has gone home, Sun Catcher returns as well – to find that Strong Bull, a powerful man among the people, doesn’t believe her when she says the pass is ruined. Even worse, Sunshine didn’t come home, and winter has come early! What is Sun Catcher to do?",
