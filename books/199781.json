A Decision for Mankind...When Ryan Webster is summoned to a Miami hospice by his grandfather, he knows the man he calls a hero is about to die. Ryan’s grandfather, a renowned zoologist and founder of the world's most famous primate park, tells him about a remarkable species of monkey kept secret by the Webster men since their discovery in 1926, the year after the Scopes Monkey Trial. When Ryan is convinced to use his unique gift with monkeys that he’s honed at the primate park, he reluctantly agrees that only he can rescue them and makes an impossible promise to find them and decide if the world is now ready to deal with the fallout from their revelation.As Ryan follows his grandfather's clues to California and beyond, he's tracked by a relentless mercenary, targeted by radical Christians and hunted by the world's most famous atheist. Aided by his crazy Iraqi War veteran turned surfer-dude uncle and the most enchanting but deadly woman he's ever met, Ryan discovers the monkeys can do much more than swim. The secret they carry within their DNA will shock evolutionists, rock the foundation of the Bible, and transform the life of every human being on earth.Now, his only hope to stay alive is to save the monkeys and live up to his promise to the greatest man he ever knew—and in the process become the man he's not ready to be.Swimming Monkeys: Genesis is an extraordinary thriller that blends real-science and riveting fiction to examine the on-going struggle between science, religion, and the fallout that could affect us all.",
