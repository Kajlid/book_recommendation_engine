  "description": "Alexander the Great. Genghis Kahn. Julius Caesar. Attila the Hun. Mao. Stalin. For thousands of years, the Stones have been hidden among us, giving a privileged few power to rule over masses, destroy empires and create new ones. It's near the end of the 21st century. When Matt Newmark was ten years old, his mother was killed in a vicious corporate assassination. For the last twelve years, he's been living off grid under the over-protective care of his father, running from dark forces, trying to stay alive. Now Matt finally has a chance to break away and start a new life. On the eve of a trip to Japan, he finds a dark rock in the shape of a claw. Life is never the same again. With the help of a Shinto priest, Matt discovers itâ€™s a Stone, a piece of ancient alien technology that gives him a sweeping view of history and control over time, matter and energy. But Matt is not alone. Mikal Ryzaard has a Stone of his own and a burning vision to eliminate suffering from the earth and bring back Paradise. With all the resources of a massive multinational corporation behind him, he tracks down Matt and makes him an offer. Join me or die.",
