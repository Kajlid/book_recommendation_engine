  "description": "Property. That's all I was. A pawn to be used at my husband's discretion. His twisted games turned my love into pain as he relished in my suffering. So I ran. A new name, a new look, a new life. Quiet and safe, far away from my tortured past. When Hank Lawless saunters into town, he kicks up more than sawdust and dirt. He ignites a flame of desire inside me I can't ignore. I offer my body, but he wants my heart -- a dangerous risk I just can't take. As he unravels my soul, my secrets soon follow, and I fear the devil will find me. I need to run again because, despite my feelings for Hank, my past is coming. And this time, he'll destroy us all.",
