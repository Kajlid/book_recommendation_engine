  "description": "*Cover reveal coming soon.*I keep telling myself I deserve more than what I have been given in life and love. I didn’t get to pick my parents but I did get to pick my husband, I thought I made a good choice little did I know…I deserved more than my toxic mother growing up and a father I never knew. I grew up too fast; I had no choice. My mother emotionally checked out on me and thought the answers to her problems were at the bottom of a bottle. I deserve more than the little attention my husband gives me. I married my high school sweetheart and life has been a constant struggle so of course, my marriage would be to. I married much like I grew up…too fast. Between the past and present, I have lost my sense of self, who I am and what I want. Can I finally learn to love myself and find what makes me truly happy? I have been surrounded by nothing but disappointment. I can’t keep standing by and watch as everything seems to be Coming Undone around me. *Warning*Contains Sexual Assault, Child abuse, Domestic Abuse, and Self-Harm",
