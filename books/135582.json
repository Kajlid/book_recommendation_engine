  "description": "After 38 years of employment, Matthew Lightfoot escaped the confines of corporate life with the intention of travelling the world.Instead of adding to his adventures in 150 countries, he found his movements restricted by the lockdowns imposed in response to the Covid pandemic.Nearly three years after leaving work he finally set forth again to discover whether it's still possible to travel independently and unplanned in a post-Covid world.Whether travelling through Europe in a motorhome, or South East Asia and India by dilapidated buses, overnight trains and slow-boats, the author of the 'Two Week Traveller' and 'Snapshots' continues to attract the incidents and adventures featured in his first books. This time though, the travel style is slow, long term, unplanned and on a budget...what could possibly go wrong?",
