  "description": "Aderyn is a maid at the castle of Vaughn, and a large event is approaching: the nobility ball. There, all the noble people in the kingdom and surrounding lands will gather and dance, and possibly Gwendoline, the princess, will choose a suitor. While the wealthy look forward to the event each year, the castle staff dread long days of preparation. This year, the nobility ball didn't go as planned. Everyone was dancing and socializing, but all turned dark. Mysterious figures killed the queen and the king, and many present at the ball were murdered as well. Gwendoline luckily escaped, though the princess's only lady in waiting died protecting her. Aderyn is recruited to be the new lady in waiting of Gwendoline, and she was grateful for the position, though greatly in fear. She is sent to a hidden place with the princess and a few other castle staff, and there, she uncovers many dangerous secrets. The survival of everyone is upon her, and she must make the most difficult choice of her life.",
