  "description": "In the fullness of time I have gone from victim to survivor of child abuse, but it was hard work getting there. I've managed to find love, like a phoenix from the ashes. My name is Tina and this is my story.  Tina is a fictitious character, but sadly her story is all too real for many out there. This book has been written to offer hope to survivors of child sex abuse, and to help inform the general public of the signs to watch out for. There is so much help out there; you can overcome your bad experiences. I have named the chapters, so if you’re sensitive to certain bits/have triggers you have a warning and the option to avoid the parts you really can’t face yet.Because it is for a good cause, this book will permanently be sold for 99c/99p (or equivalent in other currencies). *My proceeds from the first three months of Broken & Damaged Love’s sales have been donated to HAVOCAAnd I'm currently raising funds for Wave 105 1,000 Faces (until the end of April)****Please note that due to the theme of child abuse and sexually explicit scenes, this book is recommended for readers of 18+***",
