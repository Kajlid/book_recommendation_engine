How will he live with the desperate and dangerous choices he is forced into? And ultimately, can he survive the brutality and betrayal that surround him? A hard-hitting account of the alienation, conflict and power that rule the streets, WATERMELON will drag its readers along at a breakneck pace. Follow Mikey's authentic voice and compelling narrative as he leads you through his story, and right into its fatal, nail-biting conclusion.",
