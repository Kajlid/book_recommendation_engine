  "description": "Jolie Kearsley, a dreamer, hopeless romantic, and checkout clerk at the Sweet Penny Cove Library, has big plans for her future. Those plans have been on hold while she helps at home, but the chance for her big adventure looks like it’s finally just around the corner…she hopes. The only thing Jolie’s wanted as much as leaving town is getting the attention of Ian DeLuca, the boy next door, who’s been off following his own adventures and who, let’s face it, never noticed her anyway. When Ian returns home, will Jolie’s new reality measure up to her fantasies?  Join the residents of Sweet Penny Cove as they navigate relationships and their sometimes quirky harbor town. Romantic forests and picturesque beaches await.  This is the first book in the Sweet Penny Cove Romances series.",
