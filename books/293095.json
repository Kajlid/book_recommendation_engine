  "description": "The race of Men have never feared magic so much, nor have they ever had greater need of it...Princess Eleanor is just days away from marrying a man she barely knows. Her only consolation is her mother's ancient ring, a powerful royal inheritance Eleanor has waited years to claim as her own. The ring is a threat to the shifting world of magic - a world she has always been taught to distrust - but the only one who truly understands this is her talented new bodyguard.The sudden attack of a strange and terrifying beast threatens to unleash a war among the five kingdoms of Men; his own encounter with the creature sends the infamous halfbreed, William Ironstark, in search of the fulfilment of the ancient Foretelling of the Ringbearer, as well as a way to reconcile Elves and Men once more.While the strange beast continues its rampage among her people, Eleanor also finds herself torn between worlds; between duty and desire; between fear and necessity.Little does she know: everything rests on her struggle to accept the gift of her mother's ring...",
