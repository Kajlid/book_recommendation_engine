  "description": "Nate McCall wanted to forget the boy he was in the Priestley Boys home, the young man he’d been for years after. After a decade as a State Trooper, dedicated to his badge and refusing to let himself focus on anything besides his next case, he’s forgotten how it feels to love anyone so much that he loses himself to them. Actually, after being left behind by, Colin Tain, a man he all but worshiped, he’s done his best not to feel anything at all. But the death of his close friend, a fellow trooper, has Nate’s attention shifting from the daily grind. Anger and grief keep him driven, but more unexpected feelings slip in when he meets Ashlyn Coffey.Lust. Tenderness. Desire.Maybe that part of him isn’t dead after all.When Ashlyn hears Nate’s voice in the diner where she works to pay for nursing school, she wonders if the officer remembered her. The youngest child in a family of all boys, she’d been a wild teenager, but she’d changed so much and a few moments with him is all it takes for her to want to prove she’s not the same girl he hauled in to the station. There’s something magnetic and intense about Nate, and the ‘good girl’ she is now doesn’t know how to handle him.But he knows exactly how to handle her.From the beginning, Nate takes things slow. He has secrets, but he reveals them to Ashlyn, earning her trust as he finally shares the last piece of his past, his love for another man. Colin is the reason Nate has such a hard time letting anyone in, and she could hate him for it, only he has no place in the future she’s building with the man she loves. Except, she’s not sure she can give Nate everything he needs no matter how often he insists that she can.All that changes when Colin finally comes home.",
