  "description": "\"Dating is never mentioned in the Bible, not once.I’m not saying that dating’s a sin or that dating’s evil. What I am saying is that if we look to Scripture for specific answers on dating we’re not going to find any. That’s not a problem, though, because it has a lot to say about marriage, and when we figure out why God created marriage, we will figure out a lot about dating in return.\"",
