  "title": "The Long Walk Home: Paul Franklin's Journey from Afghanistan",
  "description": "The Canadian media were the first to bring Master Corporal Paul Franklin's story to the public, and it is only fitting that award-winning journalist Liane Faulder brings the full account of his return from a war zone. The Long Walk Paul Franklin's Journey from Afghanistan documents the recovery of a soldier injured in a 2006 suicide bombing that left one Canadian diplomat dead, and two comrades in arms wounded. Although Franklin made a promise to his wife that he would come home alive, he needed the heroic help of soldiers on the scene and a medical team abroad to keep his word. He lost both of his legs above the knee as the result of his injuries, but returned home determined to walk again. Within four months of his injury, and against the odds and predictions of doctors, Franklin learned to walk on artificial legs. He continues to represent the courage of Canadian troops overseas as he rebuilds his life at home with his wife Audra and their young son, Simon. As a family on a journey to recovery, they are determined to stand, and walk, together. The Long Walk Paul Franklin's Journey from Afghanistan is a story of loss, courage, love and hope. It inspires all of those military and civilians alike who wonder how they will take that next step when tough times challenge the body and the spirit.",
