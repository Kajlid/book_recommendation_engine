  "description": "She was going to die. She could feel it, her life ebbing away as surely as fine sand through fingers.France, 1963. It’s a time of great change, not least for Inspector Lucas Rocco. As part of a nationwide ‘initiative’ to broaden police operations, he finds himself moved from the Paris metropolis to a small village. His new patch might be rural, but it’s certainly not on his first day, he finds a murdered woman wearing a Gestapo uniform lying in a British military cemetery. When the body is removed by order of a magistrate from the police mortuary before Rocco can finish his investigation, he realizes he’s up against a formidable enemy. An enemy who will go to any lengths – even murder – to stop his investigation.",
