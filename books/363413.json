  "title": "The Loss Adjustor",
  "description": "Every Sunday, Caro finds herself back in the place where it all began, lured there by memory, guilt and all the losses she cannot reconcile. Constantly dwelling on the past, she immerses herself in work, where long hours insulate her from the world. For Caro, the present is two dimensional: it is history that is loaded with colour and scent. Sometimes she tries to get some perspective on those years, going over that terrible summer twenty years ago, when her band of three inseparable friends disintegrated forever. Estelle died two weeks after her fifteenth birthday. It was sudden, violent, shocking. Afterwards, Cormac left and never returned. Now she waits for release, which comes in the form of an unlikely alliance. Aifric Campbell's second novel is filled with longing, for childhood and the liberating power of friendship.",
