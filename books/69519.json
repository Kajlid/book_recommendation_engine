  "description": "Passions ignite in these all-new stories from four bestselling masters of contemporary romance… In Jaci Burton’s Hope Smolders, struggling divorcee Jane has put her personal life on hold to raise her kids — until she runs into Luke, her ex’s former best friend, who convinces her it’s time to start having fun again. Carly Phillips takes you back to the town of Serendipity, where overworked Alexa has an instant connection with a sinfully sexy football star on the dance floor. A one-night stand evolves into multiple nights when Luke decides to teach the good doctor about his own brand of fun. But when it’s time for him to leave town, will these Perfect Strangers be able to say goodbye for good? In Jessica Clare’s Legend of Jane, an intrepid Bloggess catches the eye of local law enforcement when she gets caught trespassing. Luckily, Luanne wouldn’t mind getting handcuffed by Officer Hotness… Single girl Chelsea is tired of feeling like the fifth wheel on her weekend jaunt to Lake Placid, until she gets stuck out in the cold and finds a muscular knight in shining armor to warm her up — in Erin McCarthy’s Ice Princess.",
