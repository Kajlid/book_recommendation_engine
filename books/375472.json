  "description": "Every year since her father’s death, sixteen-year-old Carmen Miller visits the sinkhole that took him away from her. One year, after getting too close and falling in herself, she wakes up in an entirely different world—a world where flowers have the power to bring back the dead. She runs into Alissa Morgan, a fourteen-year-old girl who has lived in this world her entire life. Soon after they meet, Alissa’s twin brother is murdered. The only way to bring him back is through the flowers, but getting to use them isn’t easy. The government of this world strictly controls the use of these flowers, and anyone wishing to bring back a loved one is forced to undergo an interviewing process, one that often ends in interviewees getting killed. Alissa befriends Carmen, hoping to convince the outsider to complete the interviews on her behalf. But as the days pass, Carmen falls deeper into her self-loathing, blaming herself for Alissa’s circumstances. Soon, Alissa finds herself facing an impossible decision— save her brother’s life, or send a struggling friend to their death.About the",
