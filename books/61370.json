  "title": "Werewolf, Virgin Offering",
  "description": "Each year a young maiden was selected from the townspeople as an offering of peace to the feared wolf pack. The ritual always played out the same. The beautiful virgin would be tied up on the ceremonial bed in a clearing at night. There an erotic feast would begin, as the wolf pack transformed into human shapes and a grand orgy would take place. The alpha male wolf would always be the one to take the virgin maiden, deflowering her in savage lust and filling her with the fluids that would transform her into one of them. The feast would last all night as the whole pack partakes in each others sinful pleasures. This year however there is only one maiden of age in town. Emily is the mayorâ€™s niece, and Mr. Thatcher was determined to save her from the pack. But what could one mere human do against the muscular alpha werewolf? Would he save his innocent Emily, or would she too experience the packs wild orgy upon her virgin flesh and succumb to her primitive lust that will transform her into one of their own? Check out the book \"Werewolf, breeding the virgins trilogy\" and get all three kinky stories in this three part series in one and save!",
