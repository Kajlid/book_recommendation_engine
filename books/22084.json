  "description": "He’s waited his entire life for her. Now she’s here. She surrounds herself with many, so he bides his time, planning, readying to kidnap his bloodborne bride. She surrounds herself with many, the blood bond between them thick and causing interference. Michaella Walker is clueless. She’s a stereotypical blonde living her life in a happy bubble. One family longs for her, the men pine to taste her, but only one controls, only one has the power to take her from her life and own her. It was unforeseen that the police would get involved in their prophecy. It was supposed to be so easy, she was predestined to become his lover, but now a man with a badge stands between him and his destiny. She was supposed to be psychic, yet she doesn’t sense whim. His ire at this snubbing dissolves the path ahead. He will take her. He will own her. She will worship him. She’d rather die. So it is decreed, the chosen one will perish, until the badge gets in the way again, her friends get in the way, the creed is destroyed because she has a secret weapon. She has love. This is a story told in parts, each part follows the next. This is Part 1.",
