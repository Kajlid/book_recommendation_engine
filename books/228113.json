  "description": "Retired police chief Daniel ‘Sticks’ Hetrick, still serving as unofficial consultant to his less experienced successor, has another murder to deal with in rural Swatara Creek, Pennsylvania. It soon develops the death of a local waitress is not the only trouble in the township. An elderly man has been seriously injured in the latest of a string of burglaries from the Amish, the burglaries may have a connection to unscrupulous antique dealers, there are items missing from the police department evidence room and rumors are circulating of drug dealing. What—if anything—does all this have in common? Could it be the strange Amish girl who may, or may not be, Flora Vastine’s new friend?",
