Now, something so incredible is happening, that she's not sure if it's real. How can it be? How can she walk through a strange door in the middle of the park, in the middle of the day, and find herself standing in a moonlit City street?The first time, Debra tries to convince herself it's some sort of hallucination. But it happens again. She's not dreaming; this beautiful colonnaded City is real. She has found a way through into the future.

Debra begins to wonder which world is real, and to which she really belongs...",
