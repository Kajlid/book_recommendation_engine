  "description": "My husband is not the man I married. The man I loved was, warm, kind, and sensual. This man is cold, distant, and cruel. The doctors say he’ll get better, and I want to believe them. But I’m losing faith with every hate-filled word past his lips. When he tells me our marriage is over, that he hates me and that I repulse him, I feel the last vestige of love for him die. With my marriage over and the future I had planned gone, I know I must go on, but I miss the confident woman I was; the one I see in the mirror is broken and tired.Until I'm hit by a blue-eyed storm.When I lock eyes with the sexy stranger at a bar, he makes me remember the carefree woman I was. Lost after that single night of passion, I thought my life couldn’t get worse, that things were changing.I was wrong.Now I carry a secret, a blessing. Yet I yearn for the man who is just a name to me, the memory of a night that changed everything, the only thing to get me through my days.As my world spins and things begin to clear, I see the deadly danger that has been under my nose all along. Now I am alone to fight for my life against a sinister evil I never saw coming.Torn between the fight for my life and my love for a stranger, I walk the tightrope between duty and desire and hope that I don’t fall and destroy us all.",
