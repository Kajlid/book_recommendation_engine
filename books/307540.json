  "description": "Wanting to be someone's first choice is never enough...MillaIt's like the universe dumped on me from day one. It wasn't enough that I had to put up with having Jasmine--a walking, talking, breathing Barbie doll--for a sister.\"Let's make Milla short, so she'll ALWAYS have to look up to her as well.\"Fine. I'd never wanted anything of hers anyway.Until a certain blue-eyed boy crossed my path, that is.And he fell head over heels.For my sister.Of course he did.How can I help Zayn with his studies and still escape with my heart intact?ZaynGetting a scholarship to play college football had been my dream since I first learned to throw a spiral as a kid. And I had the talent. Just not the grades. College programs expected their quarterbacks to not only pass their classes, but to do so by a comfortable margin. That was a skill set I needed to work on.Maybe I needed more help than I thought.I had an online tutor who wouldn't tell me who she was.An ex-girlfriend I couldn't shake.And the new girl, Milla, really didn't like me--everybody liked me. I'm a likable guy.Whatever. I could take a hit. I'd just rather be run over by a charging defensive lineman than get on the wrong side of Milla Kent. Which I somehow managed to do. Girls.Forget math. I needed a tutor for the opposite sex.",
