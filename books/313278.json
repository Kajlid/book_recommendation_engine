Just like that my future is decided—unless I find a way out.RomanWhen fate sends a human mate my way, I’m certain it has to be a mistake. An alpha is supposed to have an equal at his side.

It features a strong willed, not-so-human leading lady and a fierce yet loyal alpha who is determined to win her heart—no matter how many times she might reject him.
