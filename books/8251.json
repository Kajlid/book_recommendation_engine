  "title": "Mark's Not Gay",
  "description": "Mark Forest decides to sell his tattoo shop after he inherits his granddad's auto shop. When he glides down the highway on his motorcycle to visit his friends after his granddad's funeral, he finds himself in a small town filled with shape-shifters. Caden McQueen is only ninety years old and the youngest of the timber wolves, but he holds his own as a sentry who guards the mates residing in Alpha Maverick's home. Little does he know that Tangee's very straight friend who blows into town for a few days will turn out to be his mate. After Caden chases his fleeing mate into the city, he's attacked by rogue vampires and left for dead. Even so, his biggest problem may be how to get a guy so deep in the closet that he doesn't even know he's gay to come out. Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
