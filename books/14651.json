  "title": "The Silence of Our Friends",
  "description": "In 1960s Texas, a white family from a notoriously racist neighborhood and a black family from its poorest ward cross Houston's color line, overcoming humiliation, degradation, and violence to win the freedom of five black college students unjustly charged with the murder of a policeman.The Silence of Our Friends draws from the childhood of Mark Long, who, with co-author Jim Demonakos, has created a powerful portrait of a volatile moment in US history. With art from the brilliant Nate Powell (Swallow Me Whole) bringing the tale to heart-wrenching life, The Silence of Our Friends is a new and important entry in the body of civil rights literature.",
