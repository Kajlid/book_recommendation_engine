  "description": "Xavier and his siblings are warlocks, and are cursed. That is the only way to describe it. Their souls go from body to body giving them immortality. For hundreds of years they have searched for the only means to end their curse; find their soul mate. Giving up hope, and after burying many wives, Xavier just doesn't care anymore and longs for the permanent death which evades him. That is until a new student folder magically pulls itself from a stack to his open hand, and his world will never be the same. Could this girl be his soul mate, the means to end the curse which has plagued him for centuries? Devyn is everything he didn't know he wanted, including dying and a wizard, the warlock mortal enemy. Their forbidden love takes them to another realm, where a war is just beyond the horizons.",
