  "description": "“If this book isn’t a minor classic—and one uses the term ‘minor’ only because it is so gorgeously funny and not ponderous enough to be a major—well, one doesn’t know what book is. Let’s compromise and just call it a classic.”  --Will Cuppy, New York Herald Tribune The first book of prose published by either James Thurber or E. B. White, Is Sex Necessary? combines the humor and genius of both authors to examine those great mysteries of life—romance, love, and marriage. A masterpiece of drollery, this 75th Anniversary Edition stands the test of time with its sidesplitting spoof of men, women, and psychologists; more than fifty funny illustrations by Thurber; and a foreword by John Updike.",
