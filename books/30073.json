  "description": "1 Part / 9 hour(s) and 6 min.The grave is one wrong step away.Having narrowly averted an (under)world war, Cat Crawfield wants nothing more than a little downtime with her vampire husband, Bones. Unfortunately, her gift from New Orleans' voodoo queen just keeps on giving - leading to a personal favor that sends them into battle once again, this time against a villainous spirit.Centuries ago, Heinrich Kramer was a witch hunter. Now, every All Hallows Eve, he takes physical form to torture innocent women before burning them alive. This year, however, a determined Cat and Bones must risk all to send him back to the other side of eternity - forever. But how do you kill a killer who's already long dead?Jeaniene Frost, New York Times and USA Today best-selling author, lives with her husband and their very spoiled dog in Florida. Although not a vampire herself, she confesses to having pale skin, wearing a lot of black, and sleeping in late whenever possible. Aside from writing, she enjoys reading, poetry, exploring old cemeteries, spelunking, and traveling - by car. Airplanes, children, and cookbooks frighten her.Â©2011 Jeaniene Frost; (P)2011 Blackstone Audio, Inc.",
