  "description": "Edna, Amira, and Noof are neighbors but that doesn't mean they know what happens behind closed doors or that they have anything in common with their hired help. Maria, Maya, and Lillie live in the same compound as their employers but that's where the similarities begin and end. There's never a dull moment for anyone in this desert emirate. The unending gossip and unrelenting competition may be business as usual for expatriate communities but the unspoken secrets threaten to destroy life as everyone knows it.",
