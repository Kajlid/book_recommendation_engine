  "description": "The next generation of the Terrence Clan graces the newest era of the human world and the fantasy world made real, with its changes in technology and in various cultures coming together, especially in the 1996 Olympic Games. And the latest generation, over the years within this story, meet their loved ones as well. But new challenges arrive as well, when the daughter of the late Warlock Blightonyx makes herself known, taking on the name \"Ruby-Nightshade\". The Terrence Clan's faith is tested even more when Curtis Terrence departs this life, and when September 11, 2001 arrives- it's not just the human world that suffers from it. The War on Terror takes an extra spin when Ruby-Nightshade makes a pact with Osama bin Laden, resurrects Saddam Hussein and Abu Musab al-Zarqawi as undead, and merges the three into a monster that makes a bad situation worse!",
