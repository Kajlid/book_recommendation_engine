  "title": "Breathing Space: Book One of the Exodus Trilogy",
  "description": "The year is 2095. It has been decades since World War III has ended. The Earth is in severe ecological decline, the result of several centuries of mistreatment by its human progeny. Within a few decades, a century at most, Earth will no longer be habitable. Pollutants, wars, deep mantle mining, and everyday disregard for our planet have finally taken their toll, and now earthquakes, droughts, volcanic eruptions, and plagues are regular occurrences. Colonies have been established on all the larger bodies of the solar system, but these are small and hardly self-sufficient; it is widely recognized that, in order to save the majority of the species, humanity must find a new homeworld, ready-made for its existence. \"Ian Fydell's 'Breathing Space,' the kick-off novel for his ambitious Exodus Trilogy, is an unexpected SF treasure . . . and a cautionary tale in the most traditional sense. Evocative of the best of James Hogan and Robert Heinlein, this character-driven novel introduces us to a raddled, dying Earth and takes us along on a desperate effort to find a new homeworld for humanity.\" -Floyd Largent, San Antonio, TX Professional Writer and Editor \"Ian Fydell takes modern day Earth issues (environmental degradation, planetary exploration) and puts it all together in a futuristic, sci-fi thriller ... 'Breathing Space' is a page turning, heart pounding book, that makes you wonder just how close to reality we are on planet Earth now and how soon we may all be looking for a little 'Breathing Space.'\" -Edward J. Guster III, Fairless Hills, PA Environmental Scientist, USEPA",
