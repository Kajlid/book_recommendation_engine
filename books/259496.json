  "description": "My whole life I’ve known Finn Jeffries and Brady Sterling would be my undoing. The three of us were inseparable, but growing up with two boys as your best friends comes with it’s own certain type of growing pains. As a child, Finn was wild and free, and grew up to be a devilishly handsome man with a smirk that frustrated me as much as it did other things to me. Brady was brave and loyal, and the kind of man he grew into didn't surprise me a bit: devoted and gallant, with a handsome, trustworthy face that made my heart beat faster. We went our separate ways for college, but now it’s eight years later and a pact we made back then has brought us back to our hometown. Back to the complicated situation we ran from. Back to the love triangle we never really escaped. I love them both, and it’s time for me to make a choice. I’ve always known one of them would be my forever, I just never knew which one. And I still don’t.",
