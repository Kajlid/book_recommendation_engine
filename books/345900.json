  "title": "For the New Intellectual: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand",
  "description": "This is Ayn Rand's challenge to the prevalent philosophical doctrines of our time and the \"atmosphere of guilt, of panic, of despair, of boredom, and of all-pervasive evasion\" that they create. One of the most controversial figures on the intellectual scene, Ayn Rand was the proponent of a moral philosophy - an ethic of rational self-interest - that stands in sharp opposition of the ethics of altruism and self-sacrifice. The fundamentals of this morality - \"a philosophy for living on earth\" - are here vibrantly set forth by the spokesman for a new class, \"For the New Intellectual.\"",
