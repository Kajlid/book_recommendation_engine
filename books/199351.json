  "description": "When love seems out of reach...Chloe Maitland had begun to think of herself as the town spinster. Living alone in her father's house in a dying Oregon mining town, she had put away her girlish dreams and prayed for something more practical: that someone would answer her ad for a blacksmith to run the shop that was her father's legacy to her--and her only hope of holding onto her homestead. But the exhausted stranger who collapsed in her front yard looked as dangerous as the devil himself... and he was far more dangerous than Chloe could imagine....along comes a strangerTravis McGuire was a man who seemed to have no past and no future. He was doomed to the life of a wanderer and knew that his desire for Chloe had to be contained. But he hadn't anticipated finding a woman like Chloe--a woman willing to look his past in the face, to risk everything she had for the one true love she'd never thought she could find.",
