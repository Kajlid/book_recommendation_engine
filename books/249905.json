  "description": "The Healer Rise of the Pride, Book 7 Harold Blackwell, the pride’s healer, never imagined he’d be working to save the enemy. He took an oath the day he graduated from human medical school; to learn how to care for the sick and injured, but he never planned on saving a wolf. Luna Ray was scared and alone when she was rescued from the labs that studied shifters. Her family had been slaughtered by the Community, but her life was spared when she was saved by a panther. Being the only white wolf shifter in the world, she must learn to live with the pride who believes she is dangerous. Harold doesn’t want to have feelings for the wolf, but his panther demands he do everything in his power to heal Luna inside and out. The more time they spend together, the easier it is to accept fate when he touches her for the first time. *This is a novella and should be read in order with the other books in series.",
