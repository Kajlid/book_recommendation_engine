  "description": "Two stories in one book! Jen thinks she has the perfect gift for her husband Caleb's 40th birthday--the threesome he's always wanted. And she thinks she has the perfect candidate for it--her good friend Brianna. Brianna agrees to join the couple for their night of fun with one caveat. Jen has to engage in a threesome with Brianna and her boyfriend, the hunky Frankie, and anything Brianna does with Caleb, Jen will have to do with Frankie. At first Jen says, \"No way!\" But when Caleb says that they should do it, that he'll just sit back and watch, they strike the Devil's Bargain. But when faced with the ultimate temptation, can Caleb really hold back? And if he can't behave himself does that mean his wife will have to go off and be with another man? Devil's Bargain is a novella told in two parts. Caleb relates the tale of the first threesome, while Jen picks up the story when she goes off to be with Frankie and Brianna. It's a hot, erotic tale told from two sides!",
