  "description": "A captivating tale where fantasy and reality meet as the hearts of four strangers are thrown into circumstances, not of their own making. Bea lives a simple life working in a South London second-hand bookshop. It had been an especially difficult year, first with her uncle dying, then splitting up with Brandon, her philandering boyfriend. The shop's trivial daily conversations, local faces, and calm were all that she desired, but that was all about to change.No-one expects to bump into supernatural beings, let alone two opposing sects of a forgotten race. Her quiet existence quickly turns into turmoil as she unravels a secret past. A lost history in which love, revenge, betrayal, magic, and karma are not mere cycles of a soul, but a sacred journey of a much bigger picture.The future is not set in stone and the choices that Bea makes ripple through the cosmos. As the secret unfolds she realises that no matter what form your soul takes there are consequences for all actions in which time has no relevance â€“ we call it karma, they call it Vo-ror-bla.What would you do if your core beliefs of existence came into question? Book Two: Awake in Purple Dreams (In Progress)",
