  "title": "41: A Portrait of My Father",
  "description": "The Deluxe Edition of 41 is certain to be a collector's item and a cherished piece of Presidential history. Each copy will be hand-signed by President George W. Bush, printed on high-quality, acid-free paper, and bound in a full cloth case with foil stamping. Additionally, the book will include a 4-color frontispiece of a stunning never-before-seen portrait of father and son painted by President George W. Bush and will be slipcased and shrinkwrapped.  Forty-three men have served as President of the United States. Countless books have been written about them. But never before has a President told the story of his father, another President, through his own eyes and in his own words. A unique and intimate biography, the book covers the entire scope of the elder President Bush’s life and career, including his service in the Pacific during World War II, his pioneering work in the Texas oil business, and his political rise as a Congressman, U.S. Representative to China and the United Nations, CIA Director, Vice President, and President.  The book shines new light on both the accomplished statesman and the warm, decent man known best by his family. In addition, George W. Bush discusses his father’s influence on him throughout his own life, from his childhood in West Texas to his early campaign trips with his father, and from his decision to go into politics to his own two-term Presidency.",
