  "title": "Good Queen Anne: Appraising the Life and Reign of the Last Stuart Monarch",
  "description": "Queen Anne (1665-1714) was not charismatic, brilliant or beautiful, but under her rule, England rose from the chaos of regicide, civil war and revolution to the cusp of global supremacy. She fought a successful overseas war against Europe's superpower and her moderation kept the crown independent of party warfare at home. This biography reveals Anne Stuart as resolute, kind and practical--a woman who surmounted personal tragedy and poor health to become a popular and effective ruler.",
