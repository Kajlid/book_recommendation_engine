  "description": "Phoebe West has been head-over-heels in love with her brother’s best friend for as long as she can remember.Not that he’s bothered to notice.Despite several mortifying attempts at seduction and a decade’s worth of unrequited pining, nothing Phoebe does seems to make any impact on the man she’s obsessed over since her bra-stuffing days. Until she lands herself in life-threatening danger. After years working in special forces and private security, Nathaniel “Nate” Knox may be the only man on the planet who can save Phoebe from the enemies closing in. But the deeper he pulls her into his circle of protection, the harder it is to deny the unexplored attraction between them. And if they cross that line dividing platonic friendship from passionate romance… Phoebe’s heart will be in as much jeopardy as her life. CROSS THE LINE is a comedic contemporary romance about a woman who can’t seem to walk away… and the man who’ll go to any length to keep her safe. It is the second installment of the internationally bestselling BOSTON LOVE STORY series and can be read as a complete standalone. Due to sparks flying, suspenseful moments, steamy scenes, and one sassy heroine, it is recommended to readers ages 17 and up.",
