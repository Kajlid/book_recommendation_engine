  "description": "HOW FAR WOULD YOU GO TO GET HOME?Sam Welker's life wasn't supposed to turn out the way it did, but a family tragedy derailed his plans of realizing his potential in medicine, and now his wife and daughter are all he has.But that changes one night when, after learning of his daughter's cancer diagnosis, he wrecks his car and wakes up in a hospital with his family nowhere in sight.Sam discovers that he's stuck in the multiverse, switching between parallel versions of his life every time he wakes up, and the only way back home is to lose consciousness at the identical time and place he would be in his original universe.With each switch getting him closer to a cancer cure but further from the life he knows, Sam has to choose how far he's willing to go to cure his daughter. And with the memories of each new universe interfering with his own, if he doesn't find his way home soon he may lose his mind in a never-ending loop through his parallel lives.",
