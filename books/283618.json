  "description": "I’ve been in love with my best friend Katie Walker for as long as I can remember. We may have shared our deepest, darkest secrets but that one I’ve kept to myself. Before I got the courage to confess my true feelings, my cousin Gabe moved to town and swept Katie off her feet. I should’ve admitted how I felt but I couldn’t—especially once they got married.When I caught Gabe cheating on his pregnant wife, I snapped. A deadly fight erupted and before I could comprehend what happened, I was charged with his murder and sent to prison.The day I’m released, I go straight to Katie’s house. But after pushing her away for a decade while I was behind bars—she slams the door in my face—wanting nothing to do with me. While she’s determined to pretend I don’t exist, this time I’m not going anywhere. PUSHING YOU AWAY is a slow burn, angsty friends to lovers romance with lots of small-town, Southern drama. It's book 1 in the Noah & Katie duet and must be read in order.",
