  "description": "A fatherâ€™s love knows no boundaries. Especially, this father's.  Fadis the Ranger left his young son with the elves many years ago. Once his enemy, they were his son's only chance then. Now, a changed man himself as part of a crew under a sacred descendant, he returns to seek out the one surviving member of his family. But the lands are more perilous than they were when he left and son doesn't even know him.  When a chance encounter with a deadly rogue, her father, and a sickened dwarf that no magic can heal further spur them towards the safety of elven lands, they find the way shut. Darkness is upon the woodland realm. The elves have locked their borders to most travellers. While part of the crew is granted passage, old prejudices remain. Fadis, and the shadow elf, Evurn, are denied entry.  Separated from the others, Fadis and Evurn discover a disastrous plot that threatens the Western lands. Elves, dwarves, and men are about to clash but it is from the twilight realm of shadows their true enemy awakens. Fadis and Evurn must warn their friends and the elves who may be the only ones able to stop this tragedy... but who will believe them?  Return to the Aela Sunrise and the adventure of the Stormborn Saga, set before the events of the bestselling Half-Elf Chronicles and Rogues of Magic books!",
