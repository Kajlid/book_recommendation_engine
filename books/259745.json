  "description": "It's lonely being the queen of the dead. Hela longs for a life among the living, and a chance at love. When Loki grants her wish, she's elated…only to discover later that even a trickster god's daughter isn't safe from his deceit. How can she learn to adapt to life on Midgard if her presence disrupts the balance of life and death?Björn the Untouchable requires a wife…but isn't in a hurry to find one. Escaping the festivities of Yule, he discovers a naked woman in the middle of the forest. Something about her isn't quite right, and having the same name as a death goddess is a bad omen to be sure. Nevertheless, he's completely enchanted by her. Hela has only twelve days of the Yule celebration to remain human, but otherworldly threats linger. Can she find true love in the arms of a Viking warrior in the land of the living, or will she be the cause of an entire village's destruction? Only Loki knows, but he's not one to share his schemes…",
