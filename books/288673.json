  "description": "More than just life-and-death intimacy… Their love was the real thing. These men are heroes—strong, fearless… Fireman Ethan Winters ran headlong into a burning building to find Rosie Carrington. Rescue worker Brett Gannon defied the aftershocks of a San Francisco earthquake to prevent Haley Brubaker from entering her collapsing home. And emergency-room doctor Matt Walker braved gale force winds and rising floodwater to rescue scientist Molly Stanton. And impossible to resist! For Rosie, the heat in Ethan's eyes was enough to start a three-alarm blaze! As for Haley, being trapped amidst the rubble with Brett meant heightened tension—and heightened passion. And sheltering together from the storm, Molly needed Matt to make love to her. It was the only way for her to know she was still alive…and that she'd stay that way.Contents:\"Trapped!\" / Lori Foster\"Buried!\" / Donna Kauffman\"Stranded!\" / Jill Shalvis",
