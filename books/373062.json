  "description": "Twelve-year-old David Donald is a simple boy with an amazing gift—he is a spinner: a sportsman who becomes the stuff of legend. His guardian, Uncle Michael, is a spinner as well, though a different kind— a trickster, a shyster, and a mythmaker. Set between the wars at the beginning of a drought and a great depression, this David-and-Goliath story tells how a talented young boy beat the English at their own game. Exploring the violence and conflict, the honor and deep bonds created by war and sport within men, this unique fable investigates the tale teller who spins lies to reveal the truth.",
