Their lives become hopelessly intertwined after one wild night of rough passion, but afterwards they try to stay as far apart as possible. They aren't meant for each other. Getting together could be dangerous for both of them. And Jessica already has a nice job and a nice place, why would she throw it all away?  This is a romantic tale of twisted fate and broken rules.
