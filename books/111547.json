  "description": "When twenty-two year old Olivia LeRoux moves to New York City, she never imagined she was stepping into a world of passion, sensation, seduction and oblivion until the fanatical weeks she spent with Jace Rush, a captivatingly possessive businessman, shattered down around her with a truth that threatened to suffocate her and shred her heart. Olivia’s life spiraled out of control. One moment, she was texting her best friend about a bottle of wine, and the next, everything was black. Waking up in the hospital was one thing. But staring into the hypnotic blue eyes of a man she’d never seen before was another. When he asked her out, she couldn’t refuse. Something about him compelled her to release her inhibitions and jump headfirst into a sexual relationship unlike anything she could ever imagine. When the no-strings-attached relationship became tied down with the looming threat to Olivia’s life, emotions were heightened and catastrophic secrets were revealed. In the end, can Olivia accept Jace for what he is as a sadomasochist, or will her fears of his demons force her to ignore her heart and walk away?",
