With a sudden move in her future, and her in-laws putting pressure on her to stay, Jaycee’s torn between a future she doesn’t know she can have, and another that feels both certain and safe.With the life of herself and her son hanging in the balance, Jaycee makes a decision that pulls her and Mitchell apart, in the hopes that it might eventually bring them together.
