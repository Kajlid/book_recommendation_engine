  "description": "Most people look at Autism as a disability because they only see someone who isn’t acting “normal” and they haven’t learned about Autism. I think of Autism as just another type of person who does things a little differently. You might be wondering why I think of Autism differently than most people. This is because my little brother Carter has Autism. Carter is 6 years old and he is the best little brother.One out of 88 children in the United States has Autism, so at some point in your life, you will know someone that has it. Cameron Davis is a second grade student at Village Elementary located in Hilton, NY. He lives with his parents, two brothers, and dog.",
