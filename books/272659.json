  "description": "For sisters Robyn and Wren, nothing will ever be the same. The cities are burning, the world is in chaos. The dead are rising...and they're hungry. Safety? Security? These words are meaningless now. They fight, they hide, they run. No rest. No respite. All they can cling to is hope. Hope they can find others. Hope they can learn the skills needed to survive. Hope they can stay together. Their situation seems desperate, and the only thing they can depend on is each other. But is that enough?",
