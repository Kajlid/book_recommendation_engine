  "description": "\"Danifae Yauntyrr, former battle-captive of House Melarn, has come too far to stop now. She has regained her freedom after years of servitude, but has yet to exact her revenge. Though she has grown in both power and ambition, Danifae still needs to kill Halisstra Melarn. But how can she when she's followed by Quenthel and Pharaun into the heart of Lolth's reformed domain, a hellish world of demonic spiders bent on eating each other, and anything else stupid enough to get in their way - including the chosen vessel of Lolth herself.\" Halisstra has come to Demonweb Pits with a very different agenda. In her hands she holds the fabled Crescent Blade, a sword she believes will grant her the power to kill the Spider Queen herself - but only if she finds Lolth before the goddess fully completes her mysterious resurrection.",
