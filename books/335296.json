  "description": "**Includes mature content**Elise has never really felt settled, be it in relationships or her career. Regardless of her nomadic ways, one constant has always held true--her love for horses and being outdoors. When she inherits half-ownership to a rodeo ranch, she realizes her path in life has finally been laid. Little does she expect to find her very own cowboy at the end of it. Colt Tanner might be rough-around-the-edges, but he exudes the kind of steely confidence that intrigues her. Not to mention, he looks great in a pair of chaps. Even though Colt is her partner by circumstance, Elise is determined to prove to him she's serious about helping run the ranch. If only all these thoughts about just how good they could be together would stop getting in the way.Colt has waited half his life to fully own the Lonestar ranch. Then Elise Hamilton shows up out of the blue, claiming half-ownership. With sultry green eyes, long dark hair and kissable lips, the new part-owner of his rodeo ranch might be one of the smartest, sexiest women he'd ever laid eyes on, but Colt knows she's one-hundred percent wrong for him. Even if he could ignore the fact she's from the city, he won't allow himself to forget she was born with a silver spoon in her mouth. He's learned from his father's mistakes and has no intention of repeating history. Problem is, like all temptations, the more he tells himself Elise is 'hands off', the more he wants to put his hands on.BAD IN BOOTS * HARM'S HUNGER (Book 1) ~ Novella* COLT'S CHOICE (Book 2) ~ Novel* TY'S TEMPTATION (Book 3) ~ Novel* JOSH'S JUSTICE (Book 4) ~ Novel",
