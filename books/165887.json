  "title": "Gideon's Fall:when You Don't Have a Pray",
  "description": "Gideon is a contestant, fighting for his life in a world teetering on chaos. A landscape populated by two hundred kilo augmented raging homicidal maniacs, pansexual harlequin drug lords and messianic sociopaths driven by pulsing neon vistas of salvation smoldering inside their fevered skulls. Eric Richard Gabrielsen provides a dark, wry, and entertaining look at the biggest issues facing the world today by combining the public hunger for violence, the clash of religions, the rise of biotechnology, and the unintended consequences of globalization.",
