  "description": "They say you can’t go home again… When Tucker Pettigrew returns to Sweetwater, South Carolina after a thirty year absence, he knows that his reappearance will stir the town pot. The sole grandson of the most powerful man in town, Tucker wants to understand why his recently deceased mother fled Sweetwater all those years ago with little more than the clothes on their backs. What he discovers will rock not only his own foundation, but that of the town itself. Sarah Barnwell is a woman with her own ghosts to face, and they’re there to greet her on her first night back in town. The bully who made her already rocky childhood a kind of living hell is all grown up now, but he still has Sarah in his sites. At first antagonistic, Sarah and Tucker eventually realize that a shared property line isn’t all they have in common. And that roots, whether the plant be beautiful or deadly, run deeper than you think.",
