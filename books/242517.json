  "description": "KILL YOUR SISTER’S HUSBAND, AND THEN I WILL KNOW THAT THERE IS SOMETHING IN YOU! Chhota Shakeel to Sadiq Jalawar Munna Jhingada, Farid Tanasha, Baba Reddy… hitmen and executioners all. Each with haunting tales to tell. The executioner has no remorse. He is the man who strikes the fear of his boss in everybody’s heart. While he has no criminal empire of his own, his barbaric bio-sketch could fill several police case diaries. Those who live by the bullet die by the bullet – almost every last man of them. But in their short reign of terror, they leave a trail of devastation in their wake. In this no-holds-barred book, undercover reporter Gabriel Khan, backed by years of behind-the-scenes work, provides an insight into the lives of twelve of the most vicious and fearless hitmen of Mumbai, giving readers a first-hand insight into what fuels the men behind some of the bloodiest battles and showdowns in the city.",
