  "description": "Deception. Envy. Obsession. A whisper of a rumour here, a taunt of false promises there. I allowed myself to be led. Far worse than the alcohol could have ever accomplished and I nearly lost everything in the process. Now I'm just trying to make things right, to fix my mistakes. But I don't know if it's even possible at this point. Because there are threats looming on the horizon I never would have imagined. A wraith from a past I canâ€™t even remember. My choices are my own. But I'm not alone in this struggle. All I can do is hope I don't destroy everything before I have a chance to finally make things right again. Because nothing is off-limits. Not even murder. And the Sweet is the exhilarating conclusion to The Bitter.",
