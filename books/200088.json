  "description": "Klaus Ericsson is trapped in a derelict freighter drifting in deep space, the victim of a pirate attack. A competent and respected engineer — that is, when he can keep his mouth shut — he must baby-sit his only fellow survivor, a rookie tech named Antoniy Gureivich.  In the absolute silence of their metal tomb, each man suspects that the other may not be what he had thought. Their only chance for survival is an unlikely rescue, the remote chance that a ship will reach them before their food and air run out.  Their situation cannot possibly get worse.  Until they are rescued.  The new flagship of the Federal navy picks them up, on her maiden voyage to quell a simmering rebellion in the Oort Cloud. Captain Emily Conagher is far too young for such a command, and knows far too much about Klaus and Antoniy. Perhaps the timely intervention is just a coincidence, but Klaus does not believe in coincidences.  Their rescue unravels in short order. Klaus and Antoniy are plunged into a fight for their very lives, and for the lives of thousands that depend on them.  Who is friend, and who is foe? Survival depends on making the right choices, and ultimately on getting creative with the laws of physics.",
