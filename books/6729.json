  "description": "I think therefore I am, and it's about time I stopped being so ridiculously ridonkulous . . .Just when things were starting to look up for Lottie her life's gone a bit pear-shaped, wonk-ways and downside up again. Her mum's all soppy over a bloke with a horrible shemo* daughter, her best pal Goose has disappeared in a cloud of nerd-gas and Lottie's in the midst of an existential crisis. There's only one thing to do - get the hell out of Cardiff and go on the road with the gorgeous Gareth Stingecombe (and his manly thighs). But things donâ€™t go to plan, and Lottie starts to realise she might have been a bit me me me lately. . .",
