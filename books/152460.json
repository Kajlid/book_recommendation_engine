  "description": "Natural Wiccan Arissa Kensington takes a job at the vampire club, Fang, in an attempt to help protect the vampires’ mates who are being targeted by anti-vampire fanatics. She expects to perform protection spells and help out around the coven’s office, but she never expects to meet her mate or that he will have flashing purple eyes and double fangs. One thousand-year-old vampire Brone has spent the better part of his immortal life with a sword in his hand. One look at the beautiful Wiccan, Arissa, and he knows that he’s found his beloved mate, and he’s willing to walk away from everything that he knows for her. When the coven’s enemies attack the one meant to protect them, can Brone get to her in time? This story contains a vampire assassin, the Wiccan who loves him, a dragon who needs saving, and a heart-stopping battle. Expect possessive vampire behavior, spell casting, a sassy Wiccan, and plenty of neck biting.",
