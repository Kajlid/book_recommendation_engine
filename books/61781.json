  "title": "Paradise Rediscovered: The Roots of Civilisation",
  "description": "In a long-forgotten era - an age of slavery, of glorious new scientific innovations, revolutionary wonders, warrior heroes, Titans, Druids and bards, magicians, dragons and serpents, of angels and gods; an age of immortality and sacrificial death, of oppression, exploitation, social upheaval, indeed the age of the catastrophic biblical flood and, the fulcrum to social structure, of the struggle for control of the closely guarded secret and eternal wisdom of the undying Holy Elect of Paradise - in a long forgotten era, a man, just a mortal man, may have escaped his death by usurping the power of the goddess and her people to his own ends in a political coup that changed his world, and produced ours... Join Dr Michael Cahill as he explores the origins of civilisation, using information from history, archaeology, mythology, linguistics, geology, astronomy and philosophy to learn more about who we are. Paradise Rediscovered will challenge your intellect and spur your imagination, as you journey with him to uncover secrets, solve mysteries and consider the foundations that shaped our modern society and may yet change its face again. Note: This title is published as a two volume work in its physical edition, and as a complete work in its digital editions.",
