  "description": "Katie likes to believe she's invisible. It seems much safer than being exposed as she is--shy, poor, awkward. So getting up on stage in the school production of The Taming of the Shrew should be complete torture. But as Katie tells it, something totally unexpected happened when she stepped on stage: \"My head exploded. I loved it. Acting hit me like a sucker punch and I loved, loved, loved it! . . . Invisible Katie became visible Katharina.\" Evan Cooper is, as they say, another story. He knows just what it takes to get noticed, and he uses every one of the skills he's honed after years of being the new kid. Like tossing the keys to his father's high-end Audi to a kid he's never met, first day of school. \"I have insurance for car theft,\" he explains to a shocked Danny. \"And there's a full tank.\" An abuse of the power that comes with privilege and money? Sure. But more dangerously, is his romance with Katie another version of the same thing? Or is it the real thing?From the Trade Paperback edition.",
