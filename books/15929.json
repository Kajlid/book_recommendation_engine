  "description": "It has been two days since the most dangerous gunman this side of the Mississippi, a mysterious man in black named \"Joe,\" apparently shot his two-timing woman down. Now that he is headed Mexico-way, his boss has put a price on his head and sent his colorful henchman and huntresses out to do him in. Inspired by Nathanael West and Jimi Hendrix, To Fade Out Than Burn Away is an action movie written as \"classic literature,\" diving into the head and hearts, like bullets do... but in a much more insightful and rewarding way.",
