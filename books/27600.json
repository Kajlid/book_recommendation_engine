  "title": "Mr. Bradley & The Amazing Smoke Giant",
  "description": "A cursed demonic army of 100 airships fly towards a new world. Organ pipes echo from the chamber of their once noble General. On board a train, Prince Harker tries to figure out where to go in life now that he's been banished. In the middle of them, sitting atop the desert city of Plaxion, is Princess Gabella; the key to breaking the curse and bringing a Dark God back from the dead. My pitch: Pirates of the Caribbean 1 with a touch of Tim Burton in a steampunk world of strange races and evil rulers.Like most of you, I've saved Princess Peach, Zelda and a dozen others hundreds of times in my life. It's only natural therefore to take the classic tale, dress it up in steampunk leather, give It some swords and rifles, toss in a Vampyr and some rebellious clowns and see what happens. This book is the kick off to a five book series titled the Skull & Angel. I plan to get each one out every six months or so, if not sooner with other books coming in between each one. It's a fast paced adventure story that balances humor, horror, drama and mystery in a tight story of awe and intrigue.",
