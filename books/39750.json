  "description": "All I Want By Sally Painter 1250 A.D. A total solar eclipse darkened all of Europe. It was the kind of event ripe for birthing a legend…a man and a woman who loved each other so much each gave their life for the other. …or so the legend goes. Jeanne McBen's antiserum for a modern day plague is stolen, and her brother kidnapped by the madman responsible. Desperate, she stumbles into the arms of sexy highlander Mael MacRaigl, but must learn to trust her intuition instead of science and embrace the wild, passionate love and final truth he brings. Mael MacRaigl, a tormented man, lost his one true love, Jeanne McBen, 755 years ago. He's found a way to be with her again and is depending on the burning passion they shared to span across centuries. There's just one problem—Jeanne doesn't remember him and when he sends her back to 1250 AD, Mael doesn't know her. Can Mael and Jeanne rediscover the deep, fiery love they once knew? Can Mael woo her into his bed long enough to win her heart—again—and stop their separation from happening a second time?",
