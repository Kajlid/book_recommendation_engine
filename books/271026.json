  "description": "Samantha Matthews turned her back on her wealthy family to focus on social work. To some, she’s the heart of kindness. To others, she’s caught up in a never-ending battle to make up for the harm her family—and their companies—inflict on the world. So finding Samantha at a charity bachelor auction is hardly surprising. Only she’s just bid on the wrong guy. Oops.Samantha was supposed to bid on her brother’s bestie. But it’s nearly impossible to tell one stick-in-the-mud CEO from another, and somehow she’s managed to snag herself one dead-sexy Taylor Jennings. Only the completely insufferable billionaire cuts her off dismissively before informing her that sex is definitely off the table.Now Samantha’s ready for some sweet payback. She’s got plans for Taylor, and all of them involve heat, sweat, and hammering…for Habitat for Humanity. Only Taylor isn’t quite what she expected. And Samantha’s about to get just what she paid for.",
