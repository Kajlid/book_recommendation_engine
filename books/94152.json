  "description": "SULLIVAN'S WOMAN (1984)He loomed out of the fog, like some mythic figure, but Cassidy St John soon discovered Colin Sullivan was flesh and blood .... and all man. He had fame, wealth, charisma...and a reputation with the ladies. Yet, from the moment Colin focused his attention on Cass, she was torn between prudence and the irresistiblie desire to be reckless with her heart. Colin was unaccustomed to refusal, particularly from women. Yet Cass intrigued him as no other woman ever had. She had spirit, beauty... but it was her innocence that drove him to hold back and - for once in his life - not simply take what he wanted. ISLAND OF FLOWERS (1982) When Laine Simmons comes to Hawaii for a reconciliation with her long-estranged father, she does not expect Dillon O'Brian, her father's handsome young business partner, to oppose her. But Dillon is convinced that Laine is responsible for the family misunderstanding. He is sure that Laine is only after her father's money. Now Laine must fight her growing attraction for this stern, loyal man. No matter how much she craves it, she knows that she can never find love with a man who mistrusts her.",
