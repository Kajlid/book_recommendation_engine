  "description": "I’ve been in love with Cole Rogers, the cowboy next door, for as long as I can remember.Not for his money, but for his hard work, heart and protectiveness towards me. All he sees when he looks at me though is the tomboy working my daddy’s ranch.When my ranch is in financial danger, I sign up to sell the only thing I own of worth: my v-card.I never imagined auctioning myself would be how I’d get Cole’s attention, but sure enough he’s the winning bid. I finally get the man of my dreams, only he’s too much of a gentleman to claim his prize.I know Cole and I belong together, and I’m done playing it safe. He may have saved my ranch, but I’m going to save him right back.",
