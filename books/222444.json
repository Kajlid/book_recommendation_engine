  "description": "Barbara Levine's struggle with a then-inoperatable brain tumor led her to discover \"seedthoughts\" and \"core beliefs\" that link one's mind and body. She traced common phrases like \"that breaks my heart\" and \"it's a pain in the butt\" to underlying beliefs on which they are based and the symptoms they cause. The revise and updated edition clearly describes this mind/body language link.",
