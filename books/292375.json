Formerly sick little girl Alya has now grown up and is determined to live her life the way she wants. But her creators have other ideas.\n Alya’s existence is about to change when she and best friend Hanuel stumble upon the biggest conspiracy the world has ever seen.With her increasing ability to outfly her peers she still hasn’t figured that she could be central to Continent One’s plans to discover new lands by any means necessary.With secretive authorities closing in and no way to outfly them, will Alya figure out who she is in time before the only freedom she has ever known is taken from her?The future of mankind depends upon genetically modified humans who can fly, and a girl who will stop at nothing to be truly free. Alya and her friends abide by strict rules imposed by a tough enforcement agency that monitor and restrict their flight—that is until they discover secret plans to conscript an army of their peers who will be forced to travel across the raging weather systems of Earth, in search of a new continent. Along with shocking recruitment revelations comes Alya’s recognition of her evolving abilities to outfly her peers. So begin some dubious theories that she may have been illegally modified as part of the conspiracy to find new land by any means necessary—even if that risks Alya and her friends’ lives.",
