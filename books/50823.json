  "description": "Are you ready to truly LOVE the life you have while you CREATE the most extraordinary life you can imagine? This book gives you exactly what you need to do both! Taking Life Head On begins with the dramatic true story of Hal Elrod's incredible triumph over tragedy, then gives you his powerful formula that is GUARANTEED to empower you to truly love every moment of your life while creating the life of your dreams. At age 20, Hal's world ended when his car was hit head on by a drunk driver, he died for 6 minutes, broke 11 bones, suffered permanent brain damage, and was told by doctors that he would never walk again. Yet, Hal was happy. So happy, in fact, that his doctors thought he must be in denial. Defying the logic of doctors and temptations to be a victim, Hal went on to not only miraculously take his first step just 3 weeks after being found dead and told that he would never walk again, but he would eventually run a 52-mile ultra marathon, become a hall of fame business achiever (at age 26), and international motivational speaker, success coach, and #1 bestselling author.",
