  "description": "Nobody ever goes upstairs in Margaret's house. So what is making the strange thumping noises up there? And why is there a toy rabbit under the kitchen table? Margaret's Ghost is just one of a collection of short stories consisting mainly of horror and science fiction, ranging from a classic gothic tale-Jack Trevellyn-to the Wyndhamesque Victim of Fortune, and the modern Waiting for Daddy, with its spine-chilling twist. There is also the occasional excursion into romance with A Castle in Spain and Jess's Girl. But most of these tales take you to a place which is not quite as it seems. It's bedtime now. Time to go upstairs. Time to take a look. Just one look.",
