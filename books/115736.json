The song is a Christmas song, and the wish is a wish that Clara wishes every year during the week leading up to Christmas...Fast forward to a week later, when Jack comically discovers that Christmas is in fact Clara's birthday. Through a change of events, Clara realizes that the greatest gifts cannot be bought, and that sometimes sacrifice does come with a happy ending. A short story of 3,450 words, The Christmas Wish takes place both before and directly after Clara Claus, the first book in the fan-favorite Snowflake Triplet series.",
