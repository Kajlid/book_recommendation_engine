  "description": "Everbound University is the mandatory graduate school for anything that goes bump in the night. Not going isn’t an option, unless you want to be hunted down for illegally inhabiting the mortal world.All legacies — the descendants of the Four Houses — are required to attend because we’re all cursed, and the only way to break our curses is through binding our hearts in a quintet. Becoming part of a quintet is a dream come true. Destiny fulfilled. A gods-given, merciful blessing.For me, it’s a hard pass. I can’t be bound to anyone else. Trust me, it wouldn’t end well.So when I’m placed in a quintet, I promptly reject all four of my matches for their own good. But these powerful, gorgeous, high-profile legacies have no idea how to handle rejection, because…The cutthroat blood fae shows me his soft side. The charming dragon shifter won't leave me alone. The unhinged nightmare prince calls me darling. And the gorgeous ice elemental is as overprotective as he is cold.They're the kind of deadly perfection that draws attention. Which is exactly what I'm trying to avoid, since no one can know my secret. I'll do whatever it takes to make them decide I’m not worth the chase. The problem is, no matter what I do to make them hate me, it only seems to have the opposite effect…",
