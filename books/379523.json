  "description": "While fuel shortages, hunger and random violence bring chaos and anarchy, scientists struggle to perfect the Archmorph, a computer program so vast it may solve the entire riddle of human history. The focus of their study is Hawkins Island, once a paradise in a hostile world. But Dr. Elsa Adams is looking for more than a scientific answer there. Hawkins Island holds a mystery of her own past: a love that may never have happened, one golden afternoon that only she remembers—a love trapped somewhere in the folds of time and space. Now Elsa will risk her friends, her career and her life—for a discovery that may stand between humanity and total annihilation.",
