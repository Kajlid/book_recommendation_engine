  "description": "Newly appointed to the Major Crimes Team, DI Joe Faraday investigates the brutal murder of a local prison officer, Sean Coughlin—and begins to build a disturbing picture of the dead man’s life. With few friends and many enemies, Coughlin appears to have been a murder waiting to happen. Was the killer a recently released prisoner with a homicidal grudge? Or do the clues lead to Coughlin’s past? Deadlight forces Joe Faraday to step outside the investigative process and explore a wider violence—not just the darkness cast by an evil man, but the ever-deepening shadows of a half-forgotten war.",
