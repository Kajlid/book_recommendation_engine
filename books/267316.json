  "description": "Jane Austen meets Lord of the Rings in this epic fantasy novel…  A CONFLICTED PRINCESS With her father’s kingdom teetering on the brink of ruin, Princess Kathleen’s approaching wedding day is Candoreth’s only hope of survival — but it is an arranged marriage she hasn’t chosen. The last time she had spoken to her waiting suitor, the powerful Prince of Tyath, she was only a child. What’s more, Kathleen holds a secret, a magical secret, and it is one that if she cannot hide, may destroy her homeland.  A TORMENTED GUARDIAN Jared, a fearless warrior with a dark past, yearns to avenge his sister and rescue his brother from a murderous barbarian horde. But before he can do that, his Master tasks him with escorting a princess across the hostile lands of Desnia, and delivering her safely to the altar. Yet this journey will not be as easy as Jared thinks. Haunted by his past, the princess becomes an unlikely confidante and object of his affection. So when the wedding procession is attacked, Kathleen and her guardian find themselves not only in a fight for their lives, but in a battle to navigate the pitfalls of forbidden emotions.  A DANGEROUS JOURNEY With war on the horizon, and the fate of an empire filled with political strife hanging in the balance, will Jared and Kathleen sacrifice a powerful alliance for true love?",
