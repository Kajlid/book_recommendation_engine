Leena Cote was nine when she was recruited, and for a girl who couldn't stay out of trouble, and whose parents struggled to make ends meet, the decision was more than simple. At sixteen, Leena’s time has finally come.When Leena begins the 180 day intergalactic journey aboard the Pioneer, her dreams of becoming a scientist are crushed before they start. The Project Frontier leaders assign her to be a Ranger: a position that Leena has never even heard of. And her training onboard the ship points to something dangerous, something lethal. But just when Leena’s future on Pollux seems bleak, Win, a fellow Ranger, teaches her that life on the new planet may be the right start she has always wanted.Yet unbeknownst to Leena, Pollux holds secrets that she could never imagine. For the first time in her life, the dying Earth she left behind seems like a dream compared to the deadly planet that she has no choice but to call home. But then again, there’s one rule in Project Frontier, one cardinal rule that drives every person on Pollux: Don’t look back. Because no matter what Leena does, there is no going back.",
