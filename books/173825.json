Like his brother, he wants a Unicorn, a life slave to surrender her every desire and need to him— who is, in essence and body, the very same woman his brother, Trenton Leos, already possesses. He also wants Paris Dalqeaute.He had that powerhouse body in his domineering grip once before, but Diesel purposely let the fallen angel slip through his fingers. Being a Master of Doms within the BDSM lifestyle, Diesel knew he had to set Paris free— thinking and hoping Paris would eventually come back to him, and submit to Diesel willingly, not just because Paris’ job description required him to. After all, Paris had been hired as the director for the fetish and BDSM events down at the island resort Diesel and his brothers owned. Except Paris never did return; while he proved his value to his title, he has also been using his work to hide from Diesel.It’s been a year now and Diesel’s bed and life have remained empty ever since. It’s time the running stopped.Finding Paris wasn’t going to be the hard part– breaking down his walls to trust them both to commit to a life together was going to be the real challenge. But even if Diesel succeeds, there’s a problem with their future— what’s to come threatens the lives of everyone Diesel loves— and he doesn’t even know it yet.MM / MMFM / Erotic Romance / Drama / Action / BDSM – D/s THE DOMION OF BROTHERS SERIES: (chronological order)Becoming His SlaveDomming the HeiressA Place for CliffRough AttractionTaking Over TrofimRight One 4 Diesel",
