  "description": "Love and compassion are beneficial both for you and for others. Through your kindness toward others, your mind and heart will open to peace. Expanding peace to the larger community around you will bring unity, harmony, and cooperation. Expanding peace further still to nations and then to the world will bring mutual trust, mutual respect, sincere communication, and finally successful joint efforts to solve the world's problems. All this is possible once you learn HOW TO EXPAND LOVE With this illuminating and instructive handbook, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, offers sensible, everyday guidelines for transforming self-centered energy into outwardly directed compassion. Drawing on exercises and techniques established in Tibetan monasteries more than a thousand years ago, the Dalai Lama describes a seven-step, self-directed program to help us open our hearts and minds to the experience of unlimited love, transforming every relationship in our lives -- and guiding us ever closer to wisdom and enlightenment.",
