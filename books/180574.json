Even though he's always kept things professional, when a snow storm strands Chelsea at the bar, forcing her to spend Christmas with him, he can no longer control his desires.Despite being sad about missing out on Christmas with her family, Chelsea's not sorry to be spending time in the home -- and bed -- of a man she's wanted for over a year. But when Chelsea finds a note revealing Brandon's true feelings, she must decide if she wants a Christmas fling, or if she has some Christmas confessions of her own.",
