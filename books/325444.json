Many children will feel the same way about his book.Here M.B. Goffstein creates Goldie's world, a world whose center is the little house in the forest where she lives all alone, a world alive with warmth and love. In the simple words and pictures of Goldie the Dollmaker there is the same gentleness and quiet joy that endear Miss Goffstein's earlier books to a growing audience.",
