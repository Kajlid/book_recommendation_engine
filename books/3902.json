  "description": "Dark Horse Comics and Archie Comics Publications are thrilled to present the archive library series everyone is talking about -- Archie Archives! Now the earliest and most hard-to-find stories in the history of Archie comics can be read and enjoyed in gorgeously produced, full-color hardcover books. Seventy years ago, a small independent comics publisher in New York introduced a new kind of character to comics fans. Archie Andrews, the red-headed teenaged \"everyman\" we all grew up with. Volume 1 of the Archie Archives series shines the spotlight on young Mr. Andrews' earliest adventures on the streets of Riverdale and all the trouble he's caused along the way.",
