  "description": "Eden's beauty was testament to a centuries-old dream to turn a barren, rocky world into a paradise where mankind could live in peace. But Eden wasn't paradise. Torn apart by decades of colonial rivalry, the provinces were deeply divided, and as two rogue provinces begin yet another bitter fight, the Union is forced to step in before they go too far, causing the entire planet to descend into war.Andy Moralee finds himself quickly sucked into the conflict, and nothing could have prepared him for the depths that humanity had sunk to out in the forest - where loyalty was achieved at the end of a gun. Ordered to ally with one side of Eden’s warring factions, he fears he now has two enemies to watch. In a desperate moment, Andy must choose between his mission and the only thing that separates him from the evil that lives in the forest … his soul.Published by The Electronic Book Companywww.theelectronicbookcompany.comA New York Times Best-seller Listed Publisher",
