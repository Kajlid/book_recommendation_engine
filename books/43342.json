  "description": "In order to get Maggie out of an uncomfortable situation in her college dorm, Jesse and Alex lied to her in order to make her feel more comfortable in accepting their invitation to become their third roommate. Now they find themselves in the unenviable position of posing as gay lovers while they want nothing more than to form a polygamous relationship with Maggie. What follows is months of frustration for all three roommates as the men try to ease her into their world and seduce her into their shared bed. When Maggie's months of pent-up frustration finally erupt, she finds herself swept up in a sensuous journey as her two lovers seduce her into a relationship that she had never imagined, even in her most vivid sexual fantasies.",
