  "description": "Dear Author,My two men can’t STAND each other. It’s not a general dislike and it’s not a case where they can avoid each other. Unfortunately, they share a circle of friends and family They met when they were in high school and there seemed to be a bit of attraction despite their vast differences, but something happened and they are at each other’s throats. Verbal throw-downs, the occasional thrown punch has happened at more than a few shared get togethers. Dear Author, how can two men who can’t stand each other come to realize that the other man is the one person they can’t and don’t want to live without?Photo Description: 1. At the beach, a man with close-cropped hair and the physique of a Greek god hefts a rugby ball. Dark hair dusts his arms, legs, and chest. Another smattering of hair dips from his navel into the waistband of a very small pair of shorts.2. Two men grapple as they brawl, anger and adrenaline spurring them on. Neither will be the first to give in.3. A young man with beautiful eyes and a two-day scruff of beard stands on a train platform. His jeans are worn, and his linen shirt is wrinkled but clean. He has a backpack slung over one shoulder, beaded bracelets on his left wrist and a fedora covering his dark hairThis story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
