  "description": "A chosen few are able to freely travel between the land of the living and the land of spirits. The spirit realm acts as a multiverse full of diverse realms and possibilities. Ryoku Dragontalen, a normal teenage boy, has the ability to cross worlds, where spirits revere others like him as 'Defenders.' Ryoku seeks the aid of a young prisoner trapped somewhere in the spirit realm: Chris Olestine, the last existing link to his family, needs Ryoku's help to escape. In exchange, Chris claims he can find Ryoku's lost sister. However, matters take a confusing turn when spirits like the honorable Will Ramun and the scathing Sira Jessura claim to know Ryoku from somewhere before. The epidemic isn't just limited to them, either. The spirit realm knows Ryoku Dragontalen already. Could this information have to do with Ryoku's lost sister, or are there greater forces at work?",
