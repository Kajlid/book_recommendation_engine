  "description": "Are you a fan of Salvador Dali? Do pages of images resonating with meaning make you smile? Then you must own this book. Part quasi-autobiography, part dream diary, part strange descriptions of \"Jimland Novelties,\" this book is a \"brilliant pastiche of crazed emotions, wonderfully textured with lush, attentive artwork [and] oddly haunting,\" says Hugh Bonar in a Comics Journal review. There is nothing like Jim Woodring. Period.",
