  "description": "A maiden trying to save her dying father. A brutal monster housing a lonely heart. Can the two of them save each other from a tragic fate, or will their differences keep them apart?  When Beatrice's father falls victim to a deadly illness with one cure, the family weeps in despair. Knowing there is no way to get their hands on the cure, they begin saying good-bye.  But Beatrice disagrees.  She's never cared much for flowers or myth, but others do, and they'll pay handsomely to have the infamous beast's enchanted golden roses in their hands. The beast is cruel, monstrous, and fiercely protective of his flowers. To own one is a show of power.  Beatrice doesn't care about power. All she wants is to save her father. But many have tried to steal the roses, and all of them have vanished forever.  Determined nonetheless, she disregards her fears and heads to the beast's isolated mansion to steal as many roses as she can. She believes the monster can't be reasoned withâ€”until he catches her red-handed and makes her an offer.  He will save her father in exchange for Beatrice herself. For the next five years she is to remain in the mansion and keep him company, for beneath his brutish exterior is a cursed and lonely heart.  With no other choice, Beatrice gives herself up to the monster.  This Beauty and the Beast retelling is perfect for fans of magic, fairy tales, and sweet love stories. It can be read by people of all ages.",
