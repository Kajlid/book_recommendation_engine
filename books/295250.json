  "title": "Passing on Bypass Using External Counterpulsation : an FDA Cleared Alternative, to Treat Heart Disease Without Surgery, Drugs or Angioplasty!",
  "description": "A new way has now been found that does not use surgery to treat heart disease and its biggest symptom, angina. For the first time since the invention of heart surgery a unique program has been designed to treat angina using the body's own ability to heal itself! The latest in computer microprocessors, mechanical and electric engineering, physics and an in-depth understanding of the physiology of the coronary circulatory system has been combined by scientists to develop a treatment that encourages the heart to heal itself. This new, safe, simple and affordable technology is called External CounterPulsation. ECP is a noninvasive procedure that allows patients to grow their own bypasses naturally. It often works, even in cases where bypass surgery or angioplasty has failed or wasn't completely successful.",
