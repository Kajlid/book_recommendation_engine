  "description": "These boys weren’t born cruel, savage, and merciless. Someone made them that way.\nThe boys who started out as my tormentors saved my life.From who? None of us are quite sure. But when I wake up, somehow alive and mostly in one piece, I wake up to a changed house.Cayde and Dean seem to have turned over a new leaf. Instead of hurting me, they want to protect me. Instead of terrorizing me, they want to make me feel safe. And instead of punishing me—well, actually, I’ve learned to like that part.But even if they think the game is over, I know it’s just begun. There’s still people out there who want me dead, and secrets I need to uncover. Secrets that will shake the very foundations of what I’ve always believed—and if I keep going down this path, Blackmoor itself.There’s just one more piece I need in order to win.Jaxon King.Merciless King is the third book in the Blackmoor heirs series. It contains material that may be sensitive to some readers. There are no heroes in this series, and it will get much darker before the dawn. This book is for those who like their men cruel and damaged, their romance dark and questionable, and their emotions toyed with until the very end.",
