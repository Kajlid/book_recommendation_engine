  "description": "15-year-old Ellie Bumbalow had only ever known three things: magic, chores, and bullying from her sisters. Crafting magic came as easy to her as breathing. She could not imagine a world where it did not exist. She also could not imagine a world outside of her house and her chores. That is until she saves the life of a Cooper. Ellie knew better than to help a Cooper. It was not only because the Coopers and Bumbalows were in a blood feud. It was because Ellie’s sister would kill her for ignoring the one rule that kept Bumbalows safe: never help a Cooper - they’ll just stab you in the back. With a single act of kindness, Ellie embarks on an adventure that will change her life forever.",
