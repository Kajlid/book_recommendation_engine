  "description": "Recently widowed Serena MacDonald Stewart focuses solely on her childrenâ€”to the exclusion of career, artistic pursuits, and her sanity. When her brothers ask her to use her long-ignored business skills to oversee the family guest house on the Isle of Skye, she thinks it might be a chance for a new start. But her hopes for a smooth transition are dashed when, the current hotel manager, Malcolm Blake, turns out to be irritating, condescending ... and incredibly attractive. This is your invitation into a sparkling Scottish romance brimming with heart and heat.",
