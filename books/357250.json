  "description": "Thomas awakens to a nightmare. There are Angels, Demons and hideous creatures he can’t identify. The plains of Eden are darkened by the host of Lucifer’s Legions. Their attacks upon the walls of Heaven are never ending and his army is growing thin. If Cain is the only mortal man upon this battlefield, what does that make Thomas? At night the wasted cities of mankind’s past arise from Eden’s desert sands and they salvage what they can before the dawn. Behind him, he can feel the judging eyes of the Archangel’s as they stand atop the walls; they do not join the battles unless they must. The walls of heaven are guarded by the souls of mankind and failure is not an option in the land of the dead.",
