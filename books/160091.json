  "description": "As a hippie and drug user who had grown-up in a dysfunctional family, Greg Laurie knew what it was to be lost. A seventeen-year-old, long-haired Greg soon discovered his passion for seeing people rescued from hopelessness and transformed into renewed beings with a saving faith in Christ. Laurie quickly became a wonder and an example as to how God could use someone with a sordid past to impact the world with the gospel. Throughout Greg’s autobiography, be encouraged by the trials he overcame and the far-reaching impact these lessons have had. The Lord’s influence in Greg’s life has been thoroughly evidenced by the fruit seen from the ministries Greg has planted, watered and grown; namely, Harvest Christian Fellowship (one of the 8 largest churches in America) and the Harvest Crusades. Greg Laurie’s legacy has been seasoned with trials and questions, but if God can take a hippie from a severely dysfunctional family and raise him to be one of the nation’s leading evangelists and pastors, what can God do with you?",
