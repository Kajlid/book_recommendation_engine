  "description": "A multitalented combination of Dave Barry, P. J. O'Rourke, and Rick Reilly, David Feherty is the nation's wackiest and most popular on-screen golf personality. His back-of-the-book \"Sidespin\" column is the most turned- to feature in Golf Magazine, and his unmistakable Irish lilt and sensibility is a mainstay on CBS Sports golf broadcasts.But what of his rumored dark Irish sense of humor? What does Feherty really think-- and cannot share on national television-- about the Sturm und Drang of the professional golfing world? Or, for that matter, what does he think is the appropriate diet for those of us who like to partake of a wee bit of adult beverage in the evening? Now, at long last, readers can distill Feherty's uncensored brand of idiocy for themselves.Sure to put a smile on the crankiest duffer in the family, Somewhere in Ireland, A Village is Missing an Idiot answers the question all Feherty fans have been asking themselves for a year≈† who is this guy and why is he here?",
