  "title": "Gothic Pathologies: The Text, the Body and the Law",
  "description": "This is a wide-ranging book about aspects of the Gothic, from classic texts such as Frankenstein and Wuthering Heights to contemporary fiction by Iain Banks, William Gibson and many others. It approaches the texts through looking at the opposition between the Gothic and the law, suggesting ways in which Gothic at all points produces transgression. It looks at horror fiction by, for example, Stephen King and Robert Bloch, as well as stories from China and Hong Kong, and suggests new ways in which contemporary literary and psychological theory might relate to and address the Gothic.",
