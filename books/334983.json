  "title": "Edison's Ghosts: The Untold Weirdness of History’s Greatest Geniuses",
  "description": "Overturn everything you knew about history’s greatest minds in this raucous and hilarious book, where it turns out there's a finer line between \"genius\" and \"idiot\" than we've previously known. “As Albert Einstein almost certainly never said, everyone is a genius – but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” So begins Katie Spalding’s spunky takedown of the Western canon, and how genius may not be as irrefutably great as we commonly understand. While most of us may never become Einstein, it may surprise you to learn that there’s probably a bunch of stuff you can do that Einstein couldn’t. And, as Spalding shows, the famous prodigies she explores here were quite odd by any definition. For  Edison's Ghosts is filled with examples of the so-called best of humanity doing, to put it bluntly, some really dumb shit.  You’ll discover stories that deserve to be told but never the hilarious, regrettable, and downright bafflingly lesser-known achievements that never made it into our history books, until now.",
