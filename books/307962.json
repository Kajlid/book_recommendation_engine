Not that I can blame them. Daddy has never been the standard father figure. He was too busy cheating and drinking to notice that he had family that needed him.Now, five years later, my ex-stepbrothers are the biggest private investors on the west coast and my dad is barely scraping by.When daddy suddenly up and disappears a month before Christmas, it turns out he owes a lot of money and he’s bailing on the bill…See, I had no idea that the life we lived was funded by gambling…and unpaid debts. Debts that have suddenly come due. When two massive mafiosos show up in my small Portland gift shop claiming that I have to settle his back loans with money—or my flesh—I’m thoroughly freaked out.Now, I have nowhere to turn—except to them.After all, they say the devil you know is better than the one you don’t…But I’m not sure if I am more afraid of my ex-stepbrothers and their dark unforgiving demeanor—or the mob. And if I accept their help, they promise me one thing; They’ll save me, but I’m going to pay for all of my father’s sins…with my body.And the only thing getting decked this season, is my bottom.Looks like this Christmas, I’m getting Double Scrooged…",
