  "description": "My name is Roy Morgan, and while being a half-demon warlock doesn’t pay the bills, it’s a nice perk.Or at least it was.Now bodies are falling from the sky, someone is taking control of supernatural powerhouses and using them up like this is the expendables, and if that wasn’t enough, some A-hole is trying to open a gateway to the deepest darkest pits of Hell.Let me just say, if that bastard gets out, we’re all totally screwed because what’s in Hell, is supposed to stay in Hell.My name is Roy Morgan, and this time, if I want to save my friends, I might need to let the demon side of me come out and play.",
