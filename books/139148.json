  "description": "Talon Avery took one look at the new girl on campus and lost his shit. The renowned lady’s man is completely out of his element as he feels the strong pull from just that one look. All his life he’s heard the fantastical story of what he likes to call ‘the family’s curse’. The legend the men call the lightning zap. Supposedly the Avery men have some sort of enlightening experience when they meet THE ONE. But Talon’s always known that wasn’t for him, and would never be. He had too much love to give and there were too many damn women in the world to share it with. Women adore him and he’s had the conquests to prove it. Now the hot shot star athlete finds himself in the precarious position of the one doing the chasing. Not that he plans on letting that shit go on for too long. He’s smooth and charismatic and saw no problem getting what he wants, as he always does. There was just one problem. No one remembered to tell him that finding THE ONE would turn him into a caveman who’d forget all basic common sense. Or the fact that modern day women didn’t really go for the ‘me man you woman’ brand of dating. It’s a fun bumpy ride as the over possessive Talon stakes his claim and tries to deal with the new jealous, obsessive man he’s become.",
