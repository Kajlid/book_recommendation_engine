I also believe everyone else in life has just that… except for me, of course.  I came close to having that once with my own family. I had a loving mother that treated me like her little princess.

I was destined to be alone and hurt, both emotionally and physically scarred.  The only skeletons that remained of my once happy family was a father I adored, but who lived hundreds of miles away, and a mother whom I had spent most of my own life saving from her demons.  Like many people, they are scarred so deep that when they bleed, it is a reminder that they are still human.  I have a secret. A secret only I know about.

Their presence in my life spun me on my heels, turning my world yet again upside down, and right side up all at the same time.  What I find could either save me, or finally push me over the edge.  Here is my story…",
