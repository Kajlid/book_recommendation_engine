His only need, his one weakness—Chance—a woman from his past he can never have, can never trust. Wyatt will be forced to see her and face the old feelings that have haunted him for years,. He will also have to finally do battle with something inside him that is trying to take control of his mind.  And his only chance of survival depends on a love that will be pushed to the very edge.  ** This book was originally published as Wolfe Tale but has been re-edited and revised.",
