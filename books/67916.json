  "description": "Winner of the 2013 Books for a Better Life Acorda Wellness Award and the 2014 Silver Nautilus Book AwardResilience is the ability to face and handle lifeâ€™s challenges, whether everyday disappointments or extraordinary disasters. While resilience is innate in the brain, over time we learn unhelpful patterns, which then become fixed in our neural circuitry. But science is now revealing that what previously seemed hardwired can be rewired, and Bouncing Back shows us how. With powerful, time-tested exercises, Linda Graham guides us in rebuilding our core well-being and disaster-proofing our brains.",
