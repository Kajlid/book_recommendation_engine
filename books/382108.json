Now, after ten lonely years honing his skills with a gun, Jacob Constantine is back in New Mexico, hell–bent on justice—until he's ambushed by bandits and saved by an angel on her own deadly crusade.With a gun slung low across her seductive hips and vengeance in her eyes, Serenity Campbell isn't who she seems to be. But neither is the mysterious bounty hunter who threatens to drive her desire into dangerous territory. Together they track their prey with the same intensity they circle one another. But will their growing passion be enough to right the wrongs of the past and bring two damaged hearts together?",
