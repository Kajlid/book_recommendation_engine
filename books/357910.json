  "description": "It is from the Biblical saying the Harold Coyle has taken the title of his new novel, God's Children . Yet peacekeeping is not child's play. A tale of high-tech warfare set in near-future Solvakia, God's Children is the story of the 3rd Platoon, Company, 2nd Battalion of the 13th Infantry, and two young officers who try to keep a peace that is falling apart before their very eyes.Simultaneously an action-filled adventure and a study of contemporary issues facing today's soldier, this novel displays Coyle's vast knowledge of military affairs through thrilling yet realistic scenes. Proving once again that Coyle is a master of military fiction, God's Children is as timeless as war itself.",
