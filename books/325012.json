  "description": "Kidnapped. Broken. Hopeless.Confined into a dark, abandoned basement with nothing but the clothes on my back.There's no escaping obsession, especially one honed by a serial killer who's bound and determined to call me his. Forever.Every day grows more dire with death circulating my existence.I believe all hope is lost until I'm saved by my own monster, the man who enslaves my soul.His darkness is even more dangerous than my abductor's, his obsession even more deadly. But my life is still at risk, and I find myself barely able to hold on to my sanity as danger once again looms in the distance, the walls closing in on me at every turn.The mania I've attempted to keep hidden after all these years is cracking, shards of insanity splitting from my chest and falling to dust at my feet.I have no choice but to stalk through the madness and hope I make it out alive.",
