  "description": "Alana Simmons is obsessed. She had a number of ho-hum frustrating experiences with BDSM. They've whetted her appetite, leaving her hungry, wanting more, needing more. So, with her usual determination, she seeks ultimate experience with reclusive trainer Sir Ethan Kendall. Alana's persistence intrigues Ethan. She'll get more than she bargains for if she comes to England, Ethan informs her. He's not into dabbling, he's serious about his subs embracing the entire experience, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. Certain that's what she wants, she follows his directions, landing on British soil where she's met by his chauffeur, the compelling Thomas. Although she'd convinced herself she was prepared for every possibility, Alana could never have imagined everything the men would demand from her. Her life will never be the same. This book contains M/M sex as part of a polyamorous relationship",
