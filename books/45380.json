  "title": "Rome's Last Citizen: The Life and Legacy of Cato, Mortal Enemy of Caesar",
  "description": "The first biography of the final man to stand against Caesar—whose principles and defiance became a rallying cry for future revolutionsHe was Rome’s bravest statesman, an aristocratic soldier who slept on the ground with his troops, a Stoic philosopher and staunch defender of the sacred Roman tradition, who inspired early Christianity: This is the story of Marcus Porcius Cato.Cato’s life is a gripping tale rich with resonances for our own turbulent politics. Cato grappled with homegrown terrorists, a public and private debt crisis, a yawning gap between rich and poor, and a fractious ruling class whose lives took on the dimensions of soap opera.This is the story of this uncompromising man’s formation in a time of crisis and his lifelong battle to save the Republic.",
