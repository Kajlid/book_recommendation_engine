The only problem is that no one knows where the Girl of Water is, nor do they know if the power she wields has awakened in whatever body she has chosen to possess. Intent on tracking her down, a host of supernatural warriors descends upon Tokyo, all thirsting for the imminent destruction of mankind. All, that is, except one rogue swordsman, who is inexplicably duty-bound to protecting the Girl of Water at all costs.The hugely popular Japanese blood-and-guts manga series has finally arrived in the U.S.!",
