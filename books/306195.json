  "description": "Indigo James was a successful author until the day she got writer's block, and everything changed. Weeks turned into months without anything but fleeting thoughts and half-ass ideas. That is until the day she met Mila Aeressâ€”aka the Goddess of Chaos. Suddenly Indigo is thrust into a world she only thought existed in books. Now she's bound to her writing for a completely different reason. Her life and her works are more than labors of love; they're a matter of life or death. Each new manuscript becomes a book of sacrifice when her blood literally turns to ink.",
