  "description": "My goals for my final year at university were:  1) Kick ass at my internship 2) Keep hiding from my family 3) Stop frying my phone battery by accident with my powers.  Then I walked into the first day of my internship at a hot indie record label to find that my old life had collided with my new one.  Five hot guys in a band called Phoenixcry, I’m supposed to manage them, and oh yeah, PS, they’re werewolves. I’ve left the magic world behind, but I’m still a witch and witches and werewolves don’t mix.  But doing the wrong thing was always my M.O., so now I’m out on the road with a band full of sexy, growly werewolves. But the magic world is one step behind us: there are hunters on our trail, and if they catch us the boys are dead and I’m back at home under lock and key.  Oh, one more thing, I think I’m falling in love with them. Not just one of them, all of them, and to make it super complicated, I think they feel the same way.  So I had to revise my goals for this year:  1) Kick ass at my internship 2) Don’t fall in love with the band 3) Stay alive  Sounds easy, right?  ==========  Meet Darcy Llewellyn, fourth year university student, music intern, and secretly a witch. This is the story about how she meets and falls in love with the werewolves that make up the band Phoenixcry: Finn Gunner, Elias Gunner, Charlie Gage, Wesley “Ace” Rivers, and Cash Legend.  This steamy Reverse Harem Romance is over 80,000 words in length, and is the first in a series about Darcy Llewellyn and her pack of werewolf lovers.",
