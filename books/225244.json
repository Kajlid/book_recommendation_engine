  "description": "On May 1, 2013, I got the call that every mother dreads ... my family was in a terrible car accident. As the day unfolds, I would say my final good-bye to my eldest daughter. My husband would become paralyzed from the neck down and near death several times. Lastly, just ten days later, I gave birth five weeks early to my fourth child. This would put my faith to the test. But, by God's grace and support of my spiritual family, I found the beauty in the storm.",
