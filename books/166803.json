  "description": "This series of lectures, delivered at Oxford in 1921, concentrates on the relevance of the spiritual life in light of psychology, showing that psychology clarifies religious experience rather than destroys it. Perhaps the most important aspect of this work is the personal and intense quest for reality and a refusal to settle for anything else.",
