  "description": "This raw, brawling novel, first published in 1957, is a fiercely realistic account of naval combat during World War II--in particular, the hell that was Nazi submarine warfare. \"A German counterpart to The Caine Mutiny\" (Frederic Morton), SHARKS AND LITTLE FISH is based on the author's own experiences as a young submariner. \"It is as uncompromising, vivid, and unfalsified an account of war-time naval life as has appeared.\" (Times Literary Supplement)",
