  "description": "When the storm began, young Sarah was left behind as her friends ran away. She was all alone. Or so she thought. Sarah heard voices, and desperately called for help. Sebastian and Trevor heard her, and the rescue was a success. A strange, new friendship was born. You see, Sebastian and Trevor are dragons, who started the day miles and miles away, chasing the silver birds whose wings didnâ€™t move. Through the long, stormy night, Sarah and the dragons talked, and when Sebastian and Trevor brought Sarah safely home, she knew she had made new friends. But she had no idea what adventures were about to unfold. \"Sarah and the Dragons\" is a story of friendship and family, overcoming obstacles and finding the joy of life in even the smallest things. Sarah teaches a lesson on the way to treat those different from us.",
