They've been bitter enemies since Jeremy punk'd Madison freshman year. Then Madison gets paired in an anonymous \"pen pal\" program. While the school election heats up, so do the letters between Madison and this guy who calls himself Blue. They're practically hooked up on paper -- and they've never even met! Election Day reveals all -- the winner, the loser, and the school's hottest new couple.",
