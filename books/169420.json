  "title": "Sweet Nothing",
  "description": "It is enough to break any man: watching what could have been my future slip away before it was ever in my grasp.The possibility of losing someone I loved, before she was even mine, is something I never would have imagined. Certainly nothing I'd ever wish on anyone. I go to her every day and wait. Wait for the impossible, for a sign, for her to look at me ... hoping sinners are granted miracles, too.  Just one glimpse of him was all it took. In the next lane, at a stop light, was the man I would fall in love with and marry. People talk about the kind of love that takes time--love you fall in to. We were more like a crash and burn, and when our lives intertwined I would never be the same. He was the man I would cherish the rest of my life, who would father my children. In an instant our life together began, and in an instant it would end. The late nights; the excuses; the lies. And in the blink of an eye, it was like we never were.  For the first time, experience a heartfelt, jaw-dropping novel by #1 New York Times bestseller Jamie McGuire, and New York Times bestselling author Teresa Mummert.  When you think you know what's happening, you're only half way there.",
