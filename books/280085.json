However, killing someone, even in the mafia world, isn't something that can be done on a whim. Least of all by the Boss himself. Thatâ€™s why he turns to people from his past to make it right. And once he's set his mind on something, he will stop at nothing to get things done.Loyal to few, ruled by none.Untamed contains graphic violence, sexual assault and adult situations some may find offensive.Due to the information included in the book about the plot of \"Innocent\", it can be read as a standalone.",
