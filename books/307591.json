Time is not on my side to whisk her away.There are a few problems.I’ve learned every good thing comes with its own challenges.And she’s a good thing.She’s shy, bashful, and won’t let me near her.And the Ruthless Kings are getting in my way.But I’m not leaving without her.It’s a good thing I don’t.Because another man enters the picture, one that she seems terrified of, and I don’t like to see those doe eyes scared.I’ll slay her dragons and make sure she lives the fairytale she’s always wanted.It’s time take to take my heart home.In Portland.She might have been my target, but she ended up marking me.",
