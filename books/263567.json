  "title": "Rebuilding Society from the Ground up: Corporations and Citizens as a Source of Inspiration for Society",
  "description": "Our societies have come to the end of the road. We need a fundamental reconstruction of the systems and institutions that now govern us and redefine the roles of all the players with a stronger focus on making things work by respecting the human dimension. This is not a choice between socialism, and capitalism or any other –ism. There is no future for any pure –ism. Life is too complex and interdependent for that. We need organic institutions with a clear view of purpose and values. We need governments that guide and inspire, rather than direct and control. We need corporations that pursue value creation for all stakeholders and finally we need citizens that reassume their personal responsibility for the wellbeing of society.",
