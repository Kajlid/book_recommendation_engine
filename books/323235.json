  "description": "Lexi’s Reminders* Work.* Don’t think about your birthday tomorrow. Or debt, your crappy apartment, and nonexistent social life.* Re-stock wine and ice cream because that’s coming.* Die in a raging blaze of humiliation when the super-hot and very delicious fireman waiting in your office is not in fact the strip-o-gram birthday present you suspected.* Reschedule the fire safety inspection you 100 percent failed because of said humiliation.* Figure out how you, in fact, agreed to fake dating Mr. Not a Strip-O-Gram Fireman to help him with a bet.* Oh yeah, and do not fall for this guy. Seriously, they call him One Night O’Neil. Red flags all over the place.* Remember, this is fake dating, even though his very talented, very real lips are doing some sexy things you definitely like.* Realize bending one tiny rule can’t be that bad, can it?* Except bend too far, and something breaks. Something you can’t get back.",
