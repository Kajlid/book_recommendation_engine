  "description": "Sealed inside their Choctaw all-terrain cruiser, Frank Drager and his son, Ronald, rappel down a canyon wall. Their agile vehicle scans for the rare wild animals preserved for the most priveleged sportsmen. As shadows lengthen, thirteen-year-old Ronald takes his first tentative steps into the mountain wilderness...and disappears. In the comfortable North American hive of supermalls, feel-good drugs, and computer-guided traffic patterns, the Drager disappearance becomes a media event and a public outrage. The search for Ronald begins, but few suspect the truth: The boy has been captured by a secretive, cave-dwelling people, and is fleeing with them to the desolate south. Pressured by a fearful public, the ruling government prepares to launch a military campaign against the cave dwellers with a chilling final goal; the swift and decisive end of Nature. As carrion birds write cryptic messages in the sky, three top-flight agents track the Drager boy across a forbidding desertscape. Meanwhile, Ronald tastes the raw and intoxicating power of Nature, and glimpses his role in the fate of all living things. But he must lead a fight for sanity in the face of a shockingly real nightmare--a world literally at war with itself.",
