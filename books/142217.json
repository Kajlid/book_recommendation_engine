  "description": "Faith and Zac grew up together. Faith grew up in a supportive and loving family while Zac’s family was basically non-existence. Both have the money and looks, and they couldn’t be more suited for each other. Even as each ventured onto different paths of lives, they continued to remain friends—best friends. It was a line that neither dared to cross. But when Faith’s father collapsed and was sent to the hospital, Faith’s perfect little world was turned upside down. Upon arriving at the hospital and seeing Faith in the arms of another, Zac saw the real possibility of losing her and decided to step up. But not everyone was happy about the change, and amidst the chaos, more trouble awaits. *This is the new re-edited and revamped version of Done Being Friends released in 2012.",
