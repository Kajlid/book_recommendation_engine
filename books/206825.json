  "description": "Christopher Is a husband, Musician, Artist and Pagewalker. A what? Oh yea, believe it or not he was married last year and his wife and he are both really happy. Oh wait, the last thing? Right, yea, of course! A Page-walker! To put it very simply, He can step into the pages of a book. Literally, and VERY literally. Before things get all serious and philosophical and we look for deeper meanings in his multi-layered memoir I would like to point out that yes, He does actually stand on the pages of a book. He sets it down on the ground, open on the page he so desires, take a step onto it and stand on the book. On doing so he is transported into the book or the story. After writing a story while at school Chris forgets about it until he is given the book as a gift years later. Unknown to him at the time he posses the powers of traveling inside. To his surprise, so does his wife. That's where things get exciting, and weird.",
