  "description": "With my roots ripped from our family tree and placed on another branch, I’m on a quest to reclaim my legacy… Every action I’ve made since I was five years old was to secure my place in the Whittenhower family. Living in Misery Castle, driving past the manors of my mother and siblings at least twice per day, then staring into the eyes of the father who refused to claim me, this irrevocably changed my path in life. I’ve manipulated and schemed and took ownership of people who didn’t belong to me, because those who abandoned me also refused to claim them. Was my behavior due to vengeance, validation, or love, I’ll never know. But now that I’m on the cusp of everything I’ve worked toward, I’m unsure if I ever wanted it in the first place. Unbeknownst to me, there was a greater force at play, weaving its evilness around Dominion and her people. With a new quest in life, I must connect to the family members who abandoned me. While trying to figure out how to love someone freely and without reservation, I’m finding who Daniel Whittenhower II was truly meant to be. \tPublishers notice:King is the 8th installment of the Mistress & Master of Restraint series. Originally published in 2013, it was taken off-sale in late 2014. Rewritten and re-released in July 2018, it's another book entirely. Those who read the original may wish to reread the final edition before moving forward in the series. It would be much appreciated if you updated your reviews to reflect the changes, as what used to be is not how it is now, which will confuse new readers. Thank you.",
