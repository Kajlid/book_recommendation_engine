  "title": "The Ballad of Billy Badass and the Rose of Turkestan",
  "description": "An exciting modern fantasy based on Cherokee traditions; a moving love story; a cry of protest against crimes against native peoples - and more. A young Cherokee, his dead (but still sarcastic) shaman grandfather, and the Asian woman they both love. One crackling hell of a book - suspenseful, funny, sad, angry, with people in it who come alive and whom we really get to care about, and with a close, unblinkered look at lifeways that are strange to most of us but touch our hearts. - Poul Anderson.",
