  "title": "Here Comes Darrell",
  "description": "If he isn't at the Barretts' house, delivering firewood with his dump truck, you might find Darrell on his backhoe, digging a swimming hole for the Murphys, or, depending on the season, plowing the Harts' steep driveway with his snowplow. Darrell makes sure each family has what they need for every seasonâ€”which means he rarely has time for his own home. So when a fierce storm blows into town, how will Darrell, too, end up safe and sound?Vibrant woodcuts accompany this warm, gentle story of neighbors helping neighbors in a small-town community set in the North.",
