  "title": "Damaged Goods",
  "description": "On paper, Marcus, Texas, looks like any other small town in Texas. Its landscape is charming, lifelong residents have a shared history, and business is booming. But soon after Joanna Lucas moves to town, she makes startling discoveries. Her next door neighbor had her leg gnawed off by a loose tiger, a beer-drinking emu lurks on her property, and her real estate agent neglected to mention that something in Marcus was making the residents very sick. While Joanna ponders hiring illegal immigrants to work on her newly acquired but dilapidated house, others are wondering about Joanna. Is she the one? Could she be the outsider they have been looking for to turn things upside-down and reveal the ugly truth?With such heavy topics as corporate greed, industrial pollution, illegal immigrants, and corrupt politicians, only the residents of Marcus could make Damaged Goods a comedy. Prepare to cheer and laugh out loud as they fight city hall!",
