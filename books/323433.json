  "description": "Brand turns her clear, unflinching eye to issues of sex and male violence toward women; how Black women learn the erotic; the vulnerability of Black female life in the city; and the stereotypes of Black females in popular culture. She looks at the denial of racism by the white liberal cultural elite, the centrality of 'whiteness' in definitions of North American culture, the responses of the dominant culture to difference, and white appropriation and representations of Black culture. The history and experience of Toronto's Black community are illuminated in essays charting the differing issues and politics confronting white and Black immigrant groups, the growth of the Black consciousness movement, and the coming of age and the inner lives of a new generation of Blacks in the city.And she examines her personal history, further exploring her themes as she journeys home to Trinidad, tells of being turned down for a job, describes becoming a leftist, reviews her influences as a poet, and considers the process of filmmaking as a metaphor for the way each of us makes decisions about what we will - and will not - see.",
