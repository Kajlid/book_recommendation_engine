  "description": "Accused of having murdered hundreds of her servants, Countess Elizabeth Bathory was walled alive in her castle until she died. Years later, desperate to know the truth behind his infamous mother's crimes, young Count Paul seeks out the only man still alive who can tell her story: Countess Bathory's court master and confidante, Benedict Deseo. However, revealing the truth could destroy the old man's sanity and, very possibly, ruin the family reputation which the count so desperately wishes to preserve. Using real names and places, this historic novella tells the behind-the-scenes story of what happened to Countess Bathory, including her own personal torture, the rage and fear that drove her to murder her servant girls, and a gothic tale of undying love.",
