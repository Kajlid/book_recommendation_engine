  "title": "How Saeter Robbed the Underworld",
  "description": "The day before his coming-of-age ceremony, Eirik's fathers tell him a bedtime story about of the son of the god of Love and the son of the god of Envy—one beloved by all, who knows no pain; the other who lives in his shadow and feels nothing but.  Still fuming from a fight with a friend, Eirik is not in the mood for stories. However, he quickly becomes engrossed in the strangely relatable tale of love & betrayal and how Saeter and Skault trick the underworld out of a very special prize…  An M/M fantasy romance with bisexual protagonists. Full of found family, daring rescues, shape-shifting tricksters, and Norse-inspired mythology.",
