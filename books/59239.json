  "description": "The Wrong Guy At The Right TimeWhen Victoria Talcott's life had been in danger, he'd swooped in to save her. When she'd faced more threats, he'd appeared again. In fact, Sam McGarry seemed to always be in the right place at the right time, saving her life —and setting off sparks in her heart. Trouble was, sparks were exactly what Victoria was trying to avoid. The university archivist craved security and family, especially during the Christmas season. She knew full well that the sandy-haired man with the amazing smile didn't fit into her life—nor she into his. Now if she could only convince her heart of that.",
