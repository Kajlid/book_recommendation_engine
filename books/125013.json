  "description": "Eva Dunbar is afflicted with an unusual ability: she is the hand that writes for the dead. Her latest brush with the other side has her writing the words \"dead in the water\" over and over in her notebook. Unnerved and unable to share her strange life with others, she is ostracized by her peers. Once upon a time, though, Eva was best friends with golden boy and now high school hero, Jesse Williams. Now he's wormed his way back into her life, and she's not sure if that's a good thing or not. Will Eva be able to trust Jesse with her secret? Will Jesse help Eva, or abandon her again? And will Eva ever find out what \"Dead in the Water\" really means?",
