  "title": "The Real Story of Ah-Q and Other Tales of China: The Complete Fiction of Lu Xun",
  "description": "Lu Xun (1881â€”1936) is one of the founding figures of modern Chinese literature. His celebrated short stories assemble a powerfully unsettling portrait of the superstition, poverty, and complacence that he perceived in late-imperial China, and in the revolutionary Republic that toppled the last dynasty in 1911. This volume presents Lu Xun's complete fiction, including 'The Real Story of Ah-Q', 'Diary of a Madman', 'The Divorce,' and 'New Year's Sacrifice', among others.Julia Lovell's new translation of Lu Xun's short stories is accompanied by an introduction to the writer's political and literary life. This edition also includes suggested further reading, a note on Chinese names and pronunciation, a chronology, and notes.",
