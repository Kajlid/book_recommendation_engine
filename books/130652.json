  "title": "The Universe in Verse: 15 Portals to Wonder through Science & Poetry",
  "description": "The Universe in Verse is an ode to wonder and an exploration of the human search for truth and meaning.  Poetry and science, as Popova writes in her introduction, \"are instruments for knowing the world more intimately and loving it more deeply.\" In 15 short essays on subjects ranging from the mystery of dark matter and the infinity of pi to the resilience of trees and the intelligence of octopuses, Popova tells the stories of scientific searching and discovery. These stories are interwoven with details from the very real and human lives of scientists—many of them women, many underrecognized—and poets inspired by the same questions and the beauty they reveal. Each essay is paired with a poem reflecting its subject by poets ranging from Emily Dickinson, W. H. Auden, and Edna St. Vincent Millay to Maya Angelou, Diane Ackerman, and Tracy K. Smith, and is stunningly illustrated by celebrated artist Ofra Amit. Together, they wake us to a \"reality aglow with wonder.\"",
