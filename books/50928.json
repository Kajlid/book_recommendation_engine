Now I'm forced to work with three of them.An elite mission calls for our best vampire hunter – me – but I'm shocked to find the team is full of vamps. Even worse, it's a mission I can't refuse, and I loathe the agent in charge.Hudson broke my heart a decade ago, and that was before he became a vamp. He and his equally tempting twin Jackson can go screw themselves. Even more infuriating is the buff former bodyguard Nico, who can't keep his hungry eyes off me.We're a misfit team destined to fail, almost as if someone wants it that way. It's up to me to figure out what's really going on here. I'll play nice until these vamps reveal their bloodlust.Then it's time for what I do best... ending them with a strike to their hearts.A Match Made in Hell is the first book of the complete trilogy, Mel's Vampire Coven, a steamy paranormal romance where the men will fight to earn her love, and she will choose them all.",
