  "title": "Becoming Me: Journal Affirmations for Girls Vol 2",
  "description": "Excellent as a journal for one girl or as a tool to use in a group setting for writing and discussion. Each entry covers a different topic and then allows space for the reader to do their own writing. Topics are particularly relevant today, such as the entry, \"The Heart of a Bully.\" Doesn't talk down or issue simple edicts, such as \"love yourself,\" but takes a different approach, which respects intelligence and individuality. There is an emphasis on empowerment, self-esteem and personal accountability. The Heart of Bully What can be found In the heart of a bully? It’s not what you’d expect Words spoken with feigned strength In a heart that is afraid of itself The heart of a bully Beats in the most irregular way Unable to cure its ills It can only express its pain In the most destructive ways The heart of a bully Points to others So that they themselves Might not be seen Terrified to reveal The ugliness of their own pain The heart of a bully Has not the courage To confront the destruction within Instead wielding their pain To produce heartbreak in others The heart of bully cries out Unable to recognize That even as it wreaks havoc It too cries out for mercy Too ashamed to ask for help The heart of a bully Boasts not strength But the despair of utter brokenness",
