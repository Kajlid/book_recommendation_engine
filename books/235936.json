  "description": "Shelter from a storm leads Gwen to an isolated, run-down, farmhouse occupied by three eccentric, almost diabolical, women. And when she realizes they have actually been waiting for her, expecting her to arrive, Gwen knows the first shivers of terror. She has walked into their trap; there is no way out. Every escapeway is blocked; every window barred. For the women have lured her there to participate in an ancient ritual - a ceremony so disgusting that the idea of it almost plunges Gwen into an abyss of insanity. As the time grows short and the hour of horror nearer, Gwen's fear mounts. For she knows the ceremony of evil they have planned, because she has heard the Whispers from the Dark Side of Tomorrow.",
