  "description": "This book is part of a series.It contains Graphic language, violence, and homosexual relations.Glory days? If high school was their glory days, the outcast gay teens at the outreach centers run by Caden Fournier were screwed. For most of them, the torment they received at those schools and at the hands of their own families was enough to make living on the street seem like a better proposition.Enter Camp Pride and its devoted staff of volunteers and backers. For college students Kory Maguire and Will Cooper, the camp was a way for them to help abandoned and confused gay kids find their way in life. And it didn't hurt that the incredible hunks - ex-Navy SEALs Jacob Steele and Seth Ralston - were working there, too. Straight Kory ran into Jacob in Seattle several times and found himself having lots of definitely un-straight thoughts about him. Will had been abused by his ex-boyfriend and was skittish of all men now - especially if they were twice his size, like Seth.Werewolves Jacob and Seth have found their mates in Kory and Will. But have the fates gotten it wrong? What if Kory can't commit to a relationship with a man? Is Will too skittish to trust and give himself to someone so much more powerful than he? And can everyone put their own problems aside so that the campers can feel safe and find strength in being loved?",
