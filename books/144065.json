  "description": "A house-sitter gets her mojo back in this hilarious and touching love story Â Teacher Jenny loves her summer job house-sitting, and she's looking forward to a fortnight looking after The Old Rectory, a quintessentially English pile stuffed with glorious artwork and books. Owned by two celebrated writers, everything about it boasts of a successful family, reminding Jenny of her own happy home life before divorce. In a sizzling heatwave, as Jenny encounters the forceful personalities of the family dog and the eccentric neighbors, she soon starts to realize that the Lewis family may not be as enviably perfect as their big portrait above the fireplace suggests. And a new friendship may represent a surprise second chance in Jenny's life that paints a whole new picture.",
