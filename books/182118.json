  "description": "\"Jayson\" is the true story of a 20 year old Blue Jay. It is similar in many ways to Margaret Stanger's book \"That Quail, Robert\". Jayson was rescued by Vicki after hopping into her life in August, 1984. The bird has lived with Vicki and her family ever since, and is still alive, now residing on Cape Cod. Jayson's story includes how the bird came into Vicki's life, rehabilitation efforts, why the bird was not \"put down\", its unusual personality and strange behaviors, medical problems and surgeries, and the little bird's influence on Vicki and her family.",
