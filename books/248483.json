  "description": "She’s his best friend’s little sister and off limits.College freshman, Finley Farrow, has two fairly ambitious goals this school year: make the football team and get over Shepard Connelly. The gorgeous football player with the magnificent voice would one day be a star on or off the field. But he’ll never see her as more than his best friend’s sister. Now her eye is on the end zone. Making the team could turn out to be the easy part. Practicing with Shepard every day while ignoring her feelings? The real challenge.Shepard hasn’t had it easy like the Farrows. He won his ticket to the prestigious Layton University through football. Yet his passion lies in music. His killer smile can get him almost any girl he wants, except the one girl he can’t have. Everything he’s wanted to say to her is channeled into his soul wrenching lyrics. But he’s been sitting on the sideline far too long and it’s time to make a move before the team’s starting quarterback wins her heart. A life altering accusation could fumble everything for him. Most importantly, his big play for the only girl he’s ever wanted. Family, friendship and love bind them together. Secrets, lies, and rules keep them apart.",
