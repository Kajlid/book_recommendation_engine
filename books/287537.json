  "description": "A teen girl who will do whatever it takes to find a date for her sister’s wedding.Mia’s friends love rom-coms. Mia hates them. They're silly, contrived, and not at all realistic. Besides, there are more important things to worry about—like how to handle living with her bridezilla sister, Sam, who’s never appreciated Mia, and surviving junior year juggling every school club offered and acing all of her classes.So when Mia is tasked with finding a date to her sister’s wedding, her options are practically nonexistent.Mia’s friends, however, have an idea. It’s a little crazy, a little out there, and a lot inspired by the movies they love that Mia begrudgingly watches too.Mia just needs a meet-cute.",
