  "description": "The heat building between them is ready to erupt, threatening to shatter the wall around a soldier's heart.Former Green Beret, Zackary \"Sin\" Sinclair has a secret nipping at his heels. And he'll do anything--go anywhere--to keep that info locked down tight. Including playing along with the news that he's the father of his best friend's little sister's baby. But there's no way in hell that's possible since he hasn't touched a woman in years. That, and his best friend has no idea Sin's been hiding the fact he's gay since they were teenagers.KinKaid Wolf Pack Enforcer, Aydin Michaels is his cousin's new pet project. If he doesn't sober up and fall in line, he'll be kissing his new career goodbye, and more than likely, packing up to head back east. The last thing he needs is a smokin' hot human male with eyes that turn him inside out trying to play his hero.When a bar fight goes wrong and Sin ends up bitten, Aydin is charged with tracking him down--before he shifts--and educating him about those in the world who aren't quite human. Rule number one: in order to survive, shifters stick together. But convincing the hardheaded soldier on the run to stay put, preferably with him, is easier said than done. For Sin, putting down roots means paying a price. He either betrays a friend and risks losing the only family he's ever known, or walk away from the man who's claimed a piece of his soul.",
