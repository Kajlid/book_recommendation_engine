  "description": "*This is the followup to The Line That Binds*While searching for answers involving Stockton Estate's stone well, Ben Shadows and LJ Wayde discover one truth: the curse is real. Unfortunately, that truth has LJ facing the same fate that's been tied to her bloodline for generations. The curse has given her the ability to help others conquer their greatest weaknesses, but it comes with a torturous price. As the rush of helping people starts to outweigh the pain of the consequences, LJ moves toward acceptance. She considers it a gift, a chance to make up for the way she treated people in the past. Ben pushes on to find an end to the curse despite LJ's reluctance. He fears the real consequences are far worse than LJ's current symptoms, possibly linked to her Aunt Janine's memory loss. His love drives his need to protect her, even if it means hiding the next piece of the well's mystery. When LJ finds what Ben has kept secret, she may never forgive him.Will he lose her heart before he can save her mind?**Recommended mature YA for mild language and mild sexual content.**",
