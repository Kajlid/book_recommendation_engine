No trouble. He’s had enough problems in his life and he isn’t looking for more. Or he wasn’t. That is until Nicole DaSilva showed up in her tight pencil skirt and pumps. He’s never turned down a good girl who wants to go bad. And from the looks of her, Nicole wants to be very, very bad...Nicole may share her shiny black hair and blue eyes with her twin sister, but that’s where the similarities end.

But with the family business in trouble—and her cheating ex-fiancé being a complete jerk—Nicole comes home to escape her life and fix everything else.
