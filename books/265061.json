  "description": "Thousands of business books are published every year— Here are the best of the bestAfter years of reading, evaluating, and selling business books, Jack Covert and Todd Sattersten are among the most respected experts on the category. Now they have chosen and reviewed the one hundred best business titles of all time—the ones that deliver the biggest payoff for today’s busy readers.The 100 Best Business Books of All Time puts each book in context so that readers can quickly find solutions to the problems they face, such as how best to spend The First 90 Days in a new job or how to take their company from Good to Great . Many of the choices are surprising—you’ll find reviews of Moneyball and Orbiting the Giant Hairball , but not Jack Welch’s memoir.At the end of each review, Jack and Todd direct readers to other books both inside and outside The 100 Best . And sprinkled throughout are sidebars taking the reader beyond business books, suggesting movies, novels, and even children’s books that offer equally relevant insights.This guide will appeal to anyone, from entry-level to CEO, who wants to cut through the clutter and discover the brilliant books that are truly worth their investment of time and money.",
