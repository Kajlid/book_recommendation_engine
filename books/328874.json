  "description": "A mafia princess and a mafia prince walk into a bar…It should be the beginning of a joke. To me, my father setting me up with Dante Scarano is a joke—just not a particularly funny one. But when the night ends with me up against a wall and Dante’s hands on my body, I know I’ve underestimated him—and the power he and his father wield.I might be forced to marry him, but nothing about this relationship is real. Not our vows, our marriage, or the way my body responds to his. At least—that’s what I tell myself, every time Dante sets me on fire.Dante isn’t my husband, he’s my enemy. A man who I plan to take down, just as soon as I get the chance. Isn’t that what the vows say, anyway? Til death do us part.Here in this city, the Rosarias rule. But it’s about to get savage.",
