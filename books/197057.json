She wants nothing more than to mourn quietly and celebrate Christmas with her adoptive brother while they decide what to do with the ranch they inherited. What she doesn’t expect is the extreme attraction she feels for her adoptive brother when she lays eyes on him for the first time in years.  Bear shifter Leo has mixed feelings about leaving his billion-dollar business in California to return to his family ranch in Texas.
