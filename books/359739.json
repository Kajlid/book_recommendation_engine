  "title": "Primitives of Kar",
  "description": "Tragedy strikes the village when girls are kidnapped and elders are killed and brutalized while the warriors are out hunting, and the bulk of the tribe has moved to the winter camp. It's the beginning of a strange tale which evolves and changes as the story goes on. They start with questions and each step they take seems to increase the problems without providing any answers. Trying to assess the unseen enemy and defend their people and lands from an unprecedented threat, it soon expands beyond their borders and involves neighboring peoples. \"Primitives of Kar\" represents the start of the story. They are primitive, but the Vikar are not stupid. It merely reflects where they are in their stage of development. Korban is a fierce warrior, but he's also a decent man. Meeting Princess Lanai was a huge factor in his life, and was somewhat traumatic. Saving her life drew her notice, but that didn't mean it would be smooth sailing with her. Quite the opposite. She seemed to have a knack for evoking him, for as much as he tried to fight it. He'd never met a woman like her. The danger, the continuing increase of attacks spanning the continent left no time to ponder. The extent of the peril never lessened and trying to cope with each different situation took more than just courage. They had to learn to adapt and that meant finding ways to cooperate with unfriendly neighbors. Korban had never sought notoriety, attention, and certainly not leadership, but they followed him around nonetheless. Where this would ultimately lead, nobody had any idea. The shocking developments that the future held were daunting, and even survival was in doubt.",
