  "description": "Tammy T. Stone, BJ, MA, is a Canadian writer and photographer currently residing in Japan. Her poetry and short stories have appeared in various literary journals magazines, and she also writes about the arts and wellness for several publications internationally. She is at work on a novella and a novel. This is her first poetry collection.\"Formation” begins with the attempt to engage with a lost childhood through words – but ultimately, it is a search for something deeper, the mining of then and now for a love that hovers, ever elusive. The search inspired a journey eastward, where inner and outer worlds collide. In their form, content and spirit, the poems in this collection reflect the varied landscapes of Southeast Asia, India and Japan. “Formation” takes the reader into the heart of the poet’s reminiscences and passions as they mesh with the lively physical, natural and spiritual spaces encountered.",
