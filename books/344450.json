  "description": "War-reporter Rob Luttrell is expecting a soft assignment when he's sent to Kurdistan to cover the excavation of the world's oldest human civilization. But, soon after he arrives, the site is violated, first by sabotage-and then by death. Meanwhile, a Scotland Yard detective investigating a series of spectacularly grisly murders discovers a link between the victims and what is happening in Kurdistan. As the two men race to prevent more deaths, they close in on a biblical era secret that will shake the foundations of the modern world. The Genesis Secret and its audacious blend of science, history, and suspense burst onto the scene, becoming a sleeper hardcover hit. The paperback publication of this wonderfully atmospheric, fast-paced thriller is sure to find an even broader audience and catapult debut novelist Tom Knox into the ranks of bestselling authors like Raymond Khoury, Kate Mosse, and Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child.",
