  "description": "When Sasha Stryker meets Ariston Kavanagh, she is entranced by his good looks but mystified by his odd behavior. After all, he keeps asking her how she sees him while standing right in front of her. Yet, she can't deny the strange and powerful attraction she feels for him. Then she discovers a terrifying, heartbreaking truth about him when she is attacked by a lioness one night! To her utter bewilderment, her savior is a white tiger that morphs into the last person she wants to be indebted to. This encounter shatters her notion of the world as she knows it and her love affair comes to a crashing halt when all the facts come to light. Just as she is trying to cope with her new reality, nocturnal creatures called Friaries try to kidnap her for their own nefarious purpose.",
