  "description": "JurnieWhen I ran up to the strange man in the bookstore, he seemed the safer option compared the the man who wouldn’t leave me alone. I had no idea I’d just wrapped my arms around Bonham Thompson from Pushing Daisies.More than that, I don’t know who Pushing Daisies are. I’d grown up sheltered after my sister made the biggest mistake my parents could dream of. They’d locked me down in response. Now I was just trying to get through college to get out from under their thumbs.But Bonham has me wanting to let go in ways I hadn’t dreamed of. The downside? He’s gone most of the time and women throw themselves at him.Can I trust being with someone who has the life Bonham does?Bonham.Jurnie needed me and I stepped up before I’d even known her name.Then we talked and she was the only woman I’d met recently that didn’t want something from me. I’m only home for a week and falling for her is a terrible idea. I’d be on the road for months at a time. She’s innocent and doesn’t understand that the women are part of my job. Not that I’d ever wrong her in that way but it’s hard for her to watch.I get that but when she runs, I want to chase her. I’ll need to prove to her that she’s the only one I think about and find a way to make her understand that she’s the only one for me.",
