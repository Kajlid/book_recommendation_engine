When Anya and Micah declare their love for each other, the battle for the souls of the star-crossed angels stretches across the heavens.

With love and lies blinding Micah, Anya fights to get him to face his demons and return to Heaven, even if it means hearts will be broken.  The battle for the angels begins where it left off. Between Heaven and Hell is forbidden love.",
