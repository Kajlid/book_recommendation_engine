When needed, these Circs take on an altered form, one neither man nor animal, but something in between. But unlike Roane and his squad, the Circs coming out of Pearson Labs aren't sane... Except for Caitlyn Chase, a female Roane can't get out of his mind.As Caitlyn matures into the female Circ she was meant to be, she sets in motion a chain of events that will forever alter her future and those of Circe's Recruits. In the process, she'll fall in lust, in love with Roane, and in danger as she finally finds out who she really is. Only with Roane and her newfound friends can she hope to keep the PPA at bay while they crush an agenda that may spell the end of them all.",
