  "description": "We all have choices to make in life—and those choices define us. They tell us who we are on the inside and show the outside world what we are made of. Sometimes our choices are right, and sometimes they are wrong. But no matter what, they are always ours, and as such, we should own them.  Jamaal’s Journey follows an African American student named Jamaal through the last two months of high school as he encounters several situations that force him to make important decisions about himself, his relationships, and his future. Through the choices he makes—and by embracing their consequences and outcomes—Jamaal arrives at a new level of maturity and comes to better understand his character.  But getting there isn’t easy…  Along the way, Jamaal tackles issues and problems that all young adults face. And as he does, he is confronted with both internal and external conflicts that test his will, determination, and sense of right and wrong.  Filled with laughs, emotion, and a strong element of hope, Jamaal’s story is one any high school student can relate to—and it’s sure to help many of today’s teens in their own journeys from adolescence to adulthood.",
