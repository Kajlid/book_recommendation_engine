  "description": "Dutch Peyton has spent all of her fourteen years in the small farming town of Marston, Virginia, and life is pretty good. It seems so, at least, until that blazing hot drought-plagued summer when Dutch's sophisticated and apparently flawless cousin, Norma arrives. Norma knows all about life, all about love, all about how to get what she wants--and she's ready to teach Dutch everything she knows.But even with Norma's advice, Dutch can't seem to decipher the feelings of red-haired Ethan Cole. And she feels helpless against the drought crippling both the tobacco crop and her family's morale. Dutch's troubles build like summer rain clouds as she uncovers family secrets that threaten to bring changes as powerful as the Dixie storm so desparately needed by the parched land.Includes an interview with the author.",
