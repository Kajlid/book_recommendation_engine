  "description": "After prospering many centuries in a paradise known as the Inheritance, the Estates believed their fortune would endure forever. But then the rain stopped, and famine ravaged the land, eroding the old alliances. Battles over dwindling resources have killed thousands, and the once-peaceful continent now teeters on the brink of apocalypse.The only salvation is the Cornerstone-an ancient relic of immense power-and although many doubt its existence, Lieutenant Mordecai will gamble his life for a chance to revive his Estate. He must hurry. A malevolent rival also covets the relic, and if Mordecai fails, the Inheritance will surely collapse. Should he succeed, however, he risks destroying immeasurably more, because with the Cornerstone, even the smallest choice can change the world.",
