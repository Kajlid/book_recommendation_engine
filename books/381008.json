  "description": "Heather Hamilton is always wishing for things. Not just big stuff - like world peace or for a date with Brad Pitt - but little, everyday wishes, made without thinking. With her luck, she knows they'll never come true . . .Until one day she happens across a lucky charm. Suddenly, the bad hair days stop; a handsome stranger answers her ad for a housemate; and she starts seeing James - The Perfect Man, who sends her flowers, excels in the bedroom, and isn't afraid to say 'I love you' . . .But are these wishes-come-true a blessing - or a curse? And is there such a thing as too much foreplay?",
