  "title": "The Genius of Empathy: Practical Skills to Heal Your Sensitive Self, Your Relationships, and the World",
  "description": "Ignite empathy as a superpower for transformative personal healing, deeper relationships, and more potent work in the world.Empathy is so much more than feeling deeply―it holds transformative power to heal ourselves, strengthen our relationships, and amplify our purpose. Dr. Judith Orloff, known for landmark works like The Empath’s Survival Guide , introduces empathy as a daily healing practice and form of emotional intelligence. It is not only for highly sensitive people but for all deep feelers and those who want to develop empathy as a new skill.Drawing on insights from neuroscience, psychology, and energy medicine, Dr. Orloff shows us how to access our sensitivities, soothe our nervous system, and stop absorbing the emotions of others. She begins with the magic of empathy to find greater self-love and healing―including from trauma. Subsequent chapters apply empathy to our relationships, communities, and the world. Exploring each chapter’s practices, you’ll learn the art of empathic listening, how to stop overthinking, and the importance of setting healthy boundaries and loving detachment to prevent overwhelm, burnout, and more.This practical, action-driven guide helps us connect our minds and hearts to embody our most authentic, fierce, and compassionate selves. “Cultivating empathy is a kind of peaceful warrior training,” says Dr. Orloff. “You will learn to be both strong and loving, neither a pushover nor rigid. Wherever you are in your life, this book can meet you there and lift you higher.”",
