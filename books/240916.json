  "description": "\"love is more thicker than forget  more thinner than recall  more seldom than a wave is wet  more frequent than to fail\" (E E Cummings)Love is always kind. It is enduring. It does not bear a grudge. Love always trusts. It is never selfish. It is unbound. It is hopeful. It always defends. However, love, as we all know, is a two-sided thing; with the joy comes the pain! “The hottest love has the coldest end.” - SocratesWhereas the joy of love comes as a swift flowing river, the pain when arrives, is always more intense, more unbearable, and sharper - the river of joy comes first and then follows the vast ocean of pain. Love and pain - these are the two powerful emotions that almost all of the classic poets have touched in their work. The goal of this book is to present readers with a collection of some of the best poetic work of influential poets like Emily Dickinson, Christina Rossetti, E E Cummings, Sara Teasdale, Amy Lowell, Robert Browning, John Clare, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Ella Wheeler Wilcox, and Elizabeth Barrett Browning.",
