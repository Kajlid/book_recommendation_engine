In the second assignment, students write to persuade Leo to accept Stargirl OR persuade Stargirl to find a better way to fit in with the group OR persuade you that Leo and Stargirl acted appropriately in the book and wouldn't need to be persuaded to do anything differently. The third writing assignment gives students the opportunity to do some creative writing by writing the plot summary for a sequel to the novel Stargirl. Students are assigned to do a project with this unit. Students are members of the Sunflower Club, a club of students who pledges to do something nice each day for someone other than themselves. Students will try to keep this pledge and keep a list of what they did each day. After about two weeks, students will share their experiences with the class.",
