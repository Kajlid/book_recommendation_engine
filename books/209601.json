  "description": "Alex Hensley thought that discovering vampires existing in Sydney was as dangerous as her life could possibly get, but she was wrong. Her very survival still depends on her ability to keep the secret. Just when Alex believes she has a grip on her new life, Nicholas, the teenage son of her estranged cousin shows up unannounced and gives her a chilling note from his mother, begging for help; the boy is in grave danger.Nicholas, though kind and mild mannered is not forthcoming and Alex senses something is dreadfully wrong. The more Alex delves, the closer she is to igniting a war more personal for her than she ever dreamed. Though she cannot turn the boy away, something perhaps even worse than vampires has been unleashed in Sydney. The vampire nation scrambles as tensions rise. Their hold over the city has never been challenged like this, and they would rather destroy Sydney than relinquish it. How can Alex hope to protect Nick, when the entire city is under threat and Alex can warn no one?Ideals will be shaken. Friendships will be tested. Allegiances will be questioned.The streets of Sydney will shatter as a bloodthirsty battle, once thought to exist only in myth, rises at the full moon.",
