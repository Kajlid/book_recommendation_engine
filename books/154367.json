  "description": "From the back This book deals with the upheavals which have taken place in the ideological and political fields in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in the years 1986 to 1990. Political degeneration, operative from 1956 onwards, set off a process of progressive subversion of the economic foundations of socialism.The first part begins with a reappraisal of Prague Spring of 1968, distant harbinger of the velvet revolution. It goes on to describe the complete restoration of capitalism, in which act one was played by Poland and Hungary. The victory of peaceful counter-revolution in the latter country leads us to look again at class struggle and repression in Hungary in the years 1945-1953 and then during and after the armed uprising in Budapest in 1956. The violent political confrontation which shook Rumania at the end of 1989 and the beginning of 1990 allows a thorough insight into the mechanisms of class struggle under socialism.The second part deals with the collapse in the Soviet Union. At the end of 1989 one conclusion was two years of glasnost had brought the Soviet Union to the edge of the abyss. In the name of anti-Stalinism, all socialist ideas were scrapped and the name of universal values, conservative ideology made its comeback. At the precise moment when bourgeois nationalism was breaking out and threatening the Soviet Union with disintegration, the country came closer to the West and, as proof of its good intentions, orchestrated a series of conservative coups in Eastern Europe.",
