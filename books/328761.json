  "description": "A failed marriage.A longing for escape.An unexpected romance.With her girlish days of blind innocence behind her, Eleanor finds herself more than just physically bruised, as she attempts to battle through her darkest days in the aftermath of an unprecedented season.Fallen from grace, traumatised, friendless, and alone, there seems little left to live for and even less to find meaningful occupation in as she vows never to return to her husband after his vile treatment of her.Far from being where she expected to be by now; prettily situated and much at her own leisure in a marriage of comfortable convenience, Eleanorâ€™s future has never been more uncertain.Taking refuge at Cuddington might keep her safe from his attempts to reclaim her, but shunned from society, dropped by her friends, and sinking her family into ever deeper depths of disappointment with her failures, it is a bitter-sweet refuge that soon has her longing for escape.Just when all seems lost and bleak, something unexpected begins to emerge from a most unlikely quarter and reminds Eleanor that life is still worth living, love is not dead, and not all new acquaintances are worthy of mistrust.Will this emerging new relationship help to restore all that was set asunder and show her what it really means to find friendship, trust, and love?",
