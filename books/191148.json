  "description": "After the death of her husband, Suzanne Dillon is driving through the desert when she comes upon a man on a horse, standing in the middle of the road. The resulting car accident sends her into another time, another place, and into the arms of a handsome stranger. Shunned by the white man, not trusted by the Chiricahua, Cody Black Fox is caught between two races and in love with a married woman who is from another time and another place. He promises to get her back to where she came from before the birth of her child. He promises to love her and the child, but if he gets her back to her own time, will he get that chance? ~~~ Excerpt: “Are you a movie star or something?” she asked him lamely, looking up at him. “Movie star?” he echoed with obvious confusion. “I know nothing of this movie star. What is a movie star?” She gazed into his dark brown eyes and could see the genuine question in them. He really didn’t know what a movie star was. There was no way he was lying about this. He honestly didn’t know what a car was nor did he know what a movie star was. With a feeling of disbelief and even dread, she asked him in a trembling voice. “What year is it?” He arched his dark eyebrows with surprise. “1860.” Her mouth dropped open in horror. “No! It’s 2015,” she said hastily. “It’s 2015!”",
