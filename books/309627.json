  "description": "“I'm Mila Rossi and this is Sideline Sports.”I’ve worked hard to make a name for myself as more than just the pretty girl on the sidelines doing bits to keep the audience entertained. I earned my spot as a Sideline Sports anchor. I made sure nobody can claim nepotism because I’ve told no one that Randall Harris, the star Quarterback of Los Angeles's Football team, is my big brother.I wanted to succeed on my own merits and thanks to my hard work over the past year, I've not only snagged a trip to the Super Bowl, but exclusive interviews with each playing team. Finally, all my dreams are coming true.“The guys call me Coach Wilkens, but you can just call me Toph.”As Seattle’s Offensive Line Coach, I’m thrilled that our club is playing in the biggest game of the year and that we have a chance to take home the trophy. That should be enough to keep my mind on the job at hand, but when I find out a perky little sports anchor will be spending two weeks with my team during that time, I can’t help but worry. I’m divorced, not dead, and she’s not just gorgeous, but also whip smart and knowledgeable about the game. She’s the total package and a total distraction.This is the biggest game of my career. It could make or break me. So imagine my surprise when I realize, so could she. I've always been able to separate the personal from the professional.Until now.",
