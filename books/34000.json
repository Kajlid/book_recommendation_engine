  "description": "Patti Davis didn't really adopt Aretha, her first cat. Aretha adopted Patti. When her second cat, Skeeter, moved in, Patti came to realize that she -- a self-avowed dog person -- was now officially in thrall to two very demanding little felines. In 12 short chapters, each delightfully illustrated by Ward Schumaker, the author recounts how her life was changed for the better by living with and learning from her cat companions. In \"The Mouse That Got Away\" Patti learns a valuable lesson about hope, and in \"The Little Scoundrel\" she realizes just how wrong a first impression can be. Davis closes each charming vignette with a \"Life Lesson.\" The lessons, like the stories they illuminate, are thoughtful and perceptive. Davis has produced a small treasure of a book; it's sometimes wry, sometimes moving, always universal, and, most importantly, wise.",
