  "description": "A full moon. An ancient castle. A mission that could mean bending a few rules—or laws.\nWe’re still on the Continent and still trying to find answers. Records from vampires should be able to tell us if they really have been up to nefarious deeds where werewolves are concerned—if only we can find this supposed ancient library. Now, though, we may be getting in a bit too deep…\nThis is Book 3 in The Witch and the Wolf Pack series.",
