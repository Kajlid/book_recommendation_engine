Many have speculated for years about the torrid love affair between their fallen designing star and Italy's most notorious crime boss Don Giovanni Battaglia. Mirabella is overjoyed. She has it all, a husband who loves her, a new sisterhood with her long lost twin, healthy children, and a loving family that supports her. Now is the time to reclaim her passion for designing. Giovanni loves his wife, and though her reemergence into the fashion world would expose them to the risks of fame and celebrity, he willingly makes the sacrifice. Nothing is more important than his Bella’s dreams. However, a very dangerous enemy lurks in the shadows. He has watched Mirabella’s life blossom with seething hatred and envy. He wants the woman and life he thinks was stolen from him, and he is prepared to burn the Battaglia dynasty to the ground to have her again. Secrets, plots of revenge, and lies infiltrate the Battaglia family. The destruction and pain left behind are catastrophic and can only be healed by true love. But will Giovanni and Mirabella learn that lesson too late?”",
