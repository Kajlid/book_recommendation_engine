  "title": "The Magical Path: Creating the Life of Your Dreams and a World That Works for All",
  "description": "At the start of his career, Marc Allen never took a business course; he simply made what he calls “a sloppy, disorganized, lazy, and intuitive search through the books of Western magic.” There he found the tools that took him from being a poverty case to a multimillionaire and helped him create one of the most successful independent publishers in the country. In The Magical Path , he presents these tools — effective, easy-to-apply practices, including affirmation, visualization, and guided meditation — that can change the course of readers’ lives in miraculous ways, as they did his. Because these tools are so simple and powerful, Allen calls them magic . But far from esoteric, they are tools anyone can use to achieve their dreams and goals.",
