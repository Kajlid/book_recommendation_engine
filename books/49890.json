Despite her finery and airs, she is drawn to the young armory worker, who is distant yet disarming.     Love is not the only entanglement. The nation's enemies are afoot. They creep within the very walls where America's defenses are being forged. Who are they? When will they strike? Who will survive their terrorism?     Intrigue of the heart and intrigue of the times are only part of this compelling story – book three of the Deer Run Saga. This series finale is a gripping mix of romance and deception, faith and forgiveness, transgression and trial.",
