  "title": "Shifting: The Double Lives of Black Women in America",
  "description": "“Always moving, at times haunting, and often inspirational, Shifting provides a richly textured look at the lives of Black women. Jones and Shorter-Gooden poignantly portray the day-to-day challenges and triumphs of ‘sisters’ at work, in relationships, and in their spiritual lives.” — Bebe Moore Campbell, author of What You Owe Me Based on the African American Women's Voices Project, Shifting reveals that a large number of African American women feel pressure to compromise their true selves as they navigate America's racial and gender bigotry. Black women \"shift\" by altering the expectations they have for themselves or their outer appearance. They modify their speech. They shift \"white\" as they head to work in the morning and \"Black\" as they come back home each night. They shift inward, internalizing the searing pain of the negative stereotypes that they encounter daily. And sometimes they shift by fighting back. With deeply moving interviews, poignantly revealed on each page, Shifting is a much-needed, clear, and comprehensive portrait of the reality of African American women's lives today.",
