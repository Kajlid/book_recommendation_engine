  "description": "This second book in the Dica Series, Of Weft and Weave, takes up where Leiyatel’s Embrace left off—but nearly two-thousand years into that ending’s new future. To a time when an army of Nouwelm has long been overdue setting foot south of the Gray Mountains. A time when the Certain Power, Leiyatel, is again drawing close to her end. And when Lord Nephril’s long wilderness years are also set to be drawn to their own end by a strange message delivered by the maverick Galgaverran, Pettar Garradish.Written in the old Bazarran language, no longer remembered by the ancient and ailing Nephril, he and Pettar begin a quest to discover the meaning of the message. This takes them first to the nefarious Bazarral district of Yuhlm, where they search out Nephril’s old acquaintance, Melkin Mudark. There, they find Yuhlm to have been greatly changed over recent years—on the cusp of a new mechanicking age, promising a rebirth of the ingenuity of the original ancient Bazarran people.But Nephril is rapidly declining, ill equipped for the rigours of any quest other than the reinvigoration of his own weft and weave of Leiyatel. And so begins a journey of many ambitions, as the tale weaves its way through political upheavals and vested interests, on the way to rediscovering the essential riches of knowledge long ago secreted away beyond the Gray Mountains. Can a way be found to save Leiyatel? To complete Nephril’s newfound purpose? To satisfy all the needs of those drawn into the quest’s long and arduous travails? Life, though, has a habit of surprising—no less so than in the quite literally wonderful Castle Realm of Dica…and beyond.",
