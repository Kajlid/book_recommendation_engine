  "description": "Art history student Rodrigo is in the middle of a busy semester when he literally runs into a sexy librarian. He and Ian discover they have more in common than just instant attraction and friendship; there's a kinky element to their affair they both enjoy. But Rodrigo is also drawn to Professor Daniel Sullivan, and he just can't shake the desire he feels for the older man. The end of the term reveals a few surprising secrets about both objects of Rodrigo's desires, and while he's thrilled by the games of trust and passion with Ian, it's fantasies of Daniel dominating him that are setting Rodrigo on fire. Reprint: This novella was originally published in the Dreamspinner Press anthology Size Matters.",
