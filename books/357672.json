Goddess help him, this woman strips his soul to the savage core, and enduring it is eating through his control. Little sister-in-law normally avoids him at all costs.

Now he understands the violence of that distant age when her kind walked his world.What he will not allow is for her sacrifice to be the blood price of peace. The future will be theirs, even if it’s his blood purchasing it.These Lions are big and dominant. They fight to kill and love ’til death. Nothing is taboo when it comes to their females and the pleasure these males take so much pride in providing.",
