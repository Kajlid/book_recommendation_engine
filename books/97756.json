  "title": "Nuptial Knots: New Marriage and Knotty Realities",
  "description": "Rachna Singh grappled with this question as she saw marriages around her crumbling. This book is a culmination of her observations and experiences as she talked to, cried with,and shared the pain of these couples. After the success of her first book, ‘Dating, Diapers & Denial’, Rachna shifts gears from ‘anecdotal humour’ to what she calls ‘therapeutic fiction’ to write six sweetly tantalizing stories that gently unravel the knotty realities that newly-married couples face. Each story is based on a true account, and unscrambles a different aspect, each, of the intricate relationship called marriage. The narration is languorous, enthralling, and is peppered,lightly, with her characteristic humour.",
