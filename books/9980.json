  "description": "Early on the morning of May 19, 1948, the long siege of Jerusalem's Old City is lifted as patriot soldiers break through the Zion Gate. But the celebration is short-lived-a long battle ensues. Moshe Sachar, a professor and strategist for the Haganah group, must keep the movement's momentum alive in the face of a dissenting mayor and a disguised SS assassin who has infiltrated the group. Meanwhile, Rachel, his pregnant wife, tends to the growing numbers of wounded at the hospital. Bodie and Brock Thoene bring to life the stories of a striking cast of characters in an epic story of heroism, tragedy, romance, and faith set against a momentous turning point in the history of the world's most sacred city.",
