  "description": "It’s amazing to be a dominant wolf… if you’re male.When you’re a nineteen year-old girl who can beat the crap out of every wolf in your pack, suddenly it’s not so great. Love isn’t everything, I know; but even the most powerful she-wolf submits to her mate. If you can’t be dominated, you can’t be mated.And an unmated wolf has no place in the pack.My one hope is the clan gathering in the Blackwood Forest. Every wolf in the continental Americas attends, and a few seriously sexy wolves catch my eye. I’m bound to find at least one who can match me, right?Then there’s my other problem: My alpha is a grade-A jerk. After treating me like a genetic freak my whole life, he suddenly decides to stake a claim.But I can’t refuse the challenge, and my wolf won’t back down. Either I submit to the alpha and become mated to his skeezy pelt, or I win the challenge and my freedom… by taking his place as alpha.Only no one has ever heard of a female alpha, and if I become one, I’ll never find a mate.Wolf Shunned is the first book in The Alpha Queen Legacy, featuring a badass heroine, a dark fantasy world, and loads of sexy wolf shifters. Be warned: This is a slow burn, why choose romance. Once you pick this story up, you won’t be able to stop devouring it until the very last page.",
