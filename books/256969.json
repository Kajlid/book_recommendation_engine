  "description": "Determined to get a fresh start, away from ex-boyfriend, Allie finds safe haven in a small town in Nebraska. Her brother asks his old army friend Sam to help Allie settle down and take care of her. Sam is a loner, physically and mentally scarred after army accident, but he owes Jack a favor and agrees to look after Allie. When the two of them meet, Sam feels attracted to her. Allie, on the other hand, has no interest in a troubled ex-soldier other than friendship. Her main goal is to live and work in solace. When she injures her neck in a car accident, Sam offers her to stay with him while she heals. During her stay, Sam’s initial attraction grows into genuine feelings for the girl under his roof, but when he confesses his love to her, she doesn’t respond back. However, when an abusive ex shows up and Sam saves her, Allie is more than thankful- she wants to help him the way he helped her. One night she kisses him and much to her surprise, she likes it. And then… she wants more. Sam will take whatever he can, knowing she will eventually leave back home. But home just might be where he is.",
