  "description": "Manolete, last of the great Apache chiefs, has broken out of the reservation, and terror sweeps southern Arizona. Ranchers scramble for their weapons in the certainty that Manolete and his braves will now seek a terrible revenge. In a small town in the path of the Apaches, eleven-year-old Katy Malone and her widowed mother are living a quiet life when a cavalry officer rides into their world. On the eve of retirement, Colonel Red McGregor pauses for a moment to water his horse, but a freckled face and a sudden smile stop him and change his life forever. \"Apacheria\" is the tale of a fatherless little girl's longing and love, and of two old enemies and their final confrontation at the frontiers of humanity.",
