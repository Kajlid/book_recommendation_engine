  "description": "Klara  Everyone always says love will find you when you’re not looking. Well, they’re not wrong. Except, the man my heart stupidly fell for was more interested in playing his own twisted game of catch and release. Claiming me for himself, then pushing me away when I got too close, but there was an aura of darkness clouded around him. A darkness that beckoned to me. A darkness I was grateful for when those he thought he could trust ripped me away in the middle of the night to be a pawn in their own sick, twisted game.  Braxton  She was supposed to be an itch I needed to scratch. That red dress and those pale blue eyes called to me like a siren. In my line of work falling in love is dangerous. “I believe there’s good in you, Brax,” she had said. “Baby, I’m the thing monsters are afraid of,” I warned her. I pushed her away, thinking she would be safe from this fucked up life I lead. I couldn’t’ve been more wrong. My enemies smelled fresh blood. They knew if they wanted to take me down, they had to get to her. But it wasn’t my enemies I had to worry about. No, the threat was a lot closer than I thought. It shouldn’t have surprised me. After all, the devil was once an angel. Klara was my light out of this hell, and now she was in danger of being snuffed out. But not if I could help it. They should’ve thought twice before taking what belongs to me. Now, I’m out for blood, and I’m not stopping until my concrete floor runs red.  *Only suitable for 18+",
