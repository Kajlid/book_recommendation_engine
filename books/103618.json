But she’s never been a fan of the military and wasn’t prepared for the conditions she finds there. Even more disturbing is the escort who’s assigned to her—the impossibly arrogant Gabe Thompson. He’s all Army, and all man. Struggling to keep her cool while fending off his advances, Alexis feels the heat of the desert in more ways than one.  A Bad Boy Pushed to His Limits Gabe Thompson has no use for attachments. He knows his sexy charm and cocky attitude can win him any woman he sets his eyes on—until he meets Alexis, the headstrong brunette who has his pulse racing and his temper flaring. Gabe knows he’ll need a new kind of weapon if he’s going to bed the sexy volunteer, but every time he looks into her dark, soulful eyes, he feels a different kind of need.  A War That Forces Them to Rely on Each Other When Gabe and Alexis are trapped by an ambush, they need to trust each other to make it out alive. As fear and desperation turn to respect and passion, Alexis is beginning to see she can’t live without Gabe, and Gabe is discovering that love might actually be worth fighting for.
