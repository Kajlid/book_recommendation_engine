He doesn’t care what anyone says or what Quinten does, he and his jaguar know the kind of man he is.The kind who saved his life.The kind who comforts him when he wakes up terrified.The kind whose calm commands set his blood on fire.Convincing his bossy human they’re meant to be together isn’t going to be easy.
