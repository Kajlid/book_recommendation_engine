  "title": "The Bigfoot Paradox",
  "description": "Onion Weed, Tennessee, population 839-or more if you count all of the bigfoots living in the woods, and all of the bigfoot hunters that have invaded the town searching for the creatures. J.T. Meeks is a shy 12-year-old kid who has always been interested in finding a bigfoot. When he gets mixed up with Billy Matrix, the self-proclaimed authority on the \"North American Bipedal Great Ape,\" things get interesting-and dangerous. How will J.T. find his place in this world of bigfoot hunting-a world filled with telepathic psychics, spiritual hippie surfers, and self-promoting media personalities. J.T. soon discovers that there is more to the bigfoot legend than meets the eye, as he uncovers his true destiny and learns much about himself in the process.",
