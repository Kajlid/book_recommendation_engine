  "description": "The search for a missing baby drives this heart-pounding page turner, from Edgar Award Winner Susan Shreve ( Lucy Forever and Miss Rosetree, Shrinks ). It was just a few minutes. Stuck in a hotel room babysitting while the rest of her family celebrated downstairs in the hotel, Jess thought she'd try on her sister's wedding dress in the large bathroom while the baby slept. But when Jess opens the door again the baby is gone. Fighting guilt and terror, Jess and her kleptomaniac sister Teddy evade the swirl of police and hotel staff in their own desperate effort to get Baby Ruby back before it's too late.",
