Jones, has been keeping kids laughing—and reading—for more than twenty-five years. Over 65 million copies sold! Meet the World’s Funniest First Grader—Junie B. Jones! One of Junie B.’s top front teeth is loose! Only Junie B. is not that thrilled about this development. Because what if she looks like toothless Uncle Lou? And even worse . . . what’s all this tooth fairy business? Like, who is this woman, really? And what does she do with all those used teeth? So many questions, so little time. USA Today :“Junie B. is the darling of the young-reader set.” Publishers Weekly :“Park convinces beginning readers that Junie B.—and reading—are lots of fun.” Kirkus Reviews :“Junie’s swarms of young fans will continue to delight in her unique take on the world. . . . A hilarious, first-rate read-aloud.” Time :“Junie B. Jones is a feisty six-year-old with an endearing penchant for honesty.”",
