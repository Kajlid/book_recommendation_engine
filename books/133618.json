  "description": "Cathelen was young, innocent and totally unprepared for the flood of overwhelming need that the tall arrogant pirate aroused. He came into her life, swept her into an endless wave of ecstasy and left with the morning tide. And though the lovely blonde beauty was bound to another, she was possessed by an uncontrollable passion that could not be denied. Unknowingly, he had unleashed the fires of her heart-and only he could satisfy her desire...Adam was wild, worldly and totally unprepared for the insatiable need that the tempting vixen aroused. Her honey-sweet lips beckoned him, her sparkling violet eyes seduced him and her soft silken flesh promised him a night of reckless love. But one night would never be enough, one caress would only be the start-one kiss would forever spark the flames of a lifetime of raging Windswept Passion.",
