  "title": "After Hours: Tales from the Ur-Bar",
  "description": "Science fiction and fantasy readers have long shown an affinity for a good \"bar story\". Now some of today's most inventive scriveners have decided to tell their own tall tales-from an alewife's attempt to transfer the gods' curse to Gilgamesh, to Odin's decision to introduce Vikings to the Ur-Bar, from the Holy Roman Emperor's barroom bargain, to a demon hunter who may just have met his match in the ultimate magic bar, to a bouncer who discovers you should never let anyone in after hours in a world terrorized by zombies.AN ALEWIFE IN KISH - Benjamin TateWHY THE VIKINGS HAD NO BARS - S.
