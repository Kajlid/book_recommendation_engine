  "title": "Retaliate",
  "description": "Being the Vice President of the Sin City Outlaws Motorcycle Club comes with its perks. Respect, power, and easy women whenever I want. I have control in everything I do. Because of that, I wasn’t expecting my president to put me on babysitting duty, and on a female cop of all fucking people. I kill law enforcement, not protect them.  Alessandra pretends to be the good-guy hiding behind that shiny badge. But I see the darkness dancing in her eyes, and it draws me to her in the worst way. I want to devour that act of innocence, pull her over the line of justice, and into my bed.  I just wasn’t expecting the handful of secrets I got behind that badge of honor I ripped from her chest. Because now, we’re retaliating against a common enemy together.    This is book 3 in the Sin City Outlaws MC series. It is recommended you read Reign, and Mercy before Retaliate. Enjoy.",
