  "description": "For years, tales of DRAGONS from another world kidnapping and enslaving humans have been circulating in Jason Mastersâ€™ world, while for a slave girl named Koren, the stories of a human world seem pure myth. Together, these two teens will need to bridge two planets in order to overthrow the draconic threat and bring the lost slaves home. The Dragon Prince Has Hatched The stakes are raised when the foretold prince is crowned. While Koren and Jason race to the Northlands of Starlight to find the one person who can help them free the human slaves, Elyssa and Wallace strive to locate Jason and assist his quest. Soon, all four discover that the secrets of Starlight extend much further than they had imagined. Meanwhile, Randall and Tibalt have returned to Major Four and find themselves teamed with the dragon Magnar, who has arrived to help thwart the governor. No one knows how the prophecy will be fulfilled, but one thing is more than ever, the survival of the dragons depends on humankind, and they will do anything to prevent the slaves from escaping.",
