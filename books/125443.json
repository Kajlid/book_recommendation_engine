  "description": "Was it gang warfare? Was this about drugs? Was someone new shaking a serious fist at the old guard? DI Tom Calladine didn’t think so. He trusted his instincts and they were telling him that this was something else entirely. Murder – brutal and gory in the extreme it may be, but it had nothing to do with the gangs on the infamous Hobfield Estate. Someone was secretly working on a quest of his own. A killer with an inventive mind who killed with skill and left bloody remnants of his victims strewn out all over Leesworth. Finding the culprit would prove challenging and in the end give him the shock of his career so far.First in the Calladine and Bayliss series of detective novels.",
