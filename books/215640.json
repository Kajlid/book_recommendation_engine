Now, as one of the world’s most notorious thieves, she uses her unparalleled gift for merging magic and machine to take on any job that will thwart Loom’s tyrannical oppressors.Cvareh would do anything to see his sister usurp the Dragon King. His family’s house has endured the shame of being the lowest rung of Dragon society for far too long. The Alchemist Guild on Loom might hold the key to their triumph, if Cvareh can get to them before the Dragon King’s assassins.When Arianna stumbles upon a wounded Cvareh, she sees an opportunity to slaughter an enemy and make a profit off his corpse.But Cvareh sees an opportunity to cut a deal with the one person the king’s assassins might fear. He offers her the one thing Arianna can’t refuse: A wish of her greatest desire, if she brings him to the Alchemists of Loom.Joined by a trigger-happy gun mage, the trio will make their way across the steely, gear-crusted, and deadly landscape of Loom, in a story of a world divided, where magic clashes with machine, and the cost of power is blood.The Alchemists of Loom is the first book in a complete, dark fantasy trilogy set in a divided world of magic versus machine, gritty adventure, brutal and bloody sorcery, enemies to lovers, and deep friendships. It is perfect for epic fantasy readers looking for a unique and deep world.",
