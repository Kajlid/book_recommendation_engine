  "description": "\"The Rover\" or \"The Banish'd Cavaliers\" is a play in two parts that is written by the English author Aphra Behn. It is a revision of Thomas Killigrew's play \"Thomaso\", or \"The Wanderer\" (1664), and features multiple plot lines, dealing with the amorous adventures of a group of Englishmen and women in Naples at Carnival time. According to Restoration poet John Dryden, it \"lacks the manly vitality of Killigrew's play, but shows greater refinement of expression.\" The play stood for three centuries as \"Behn's most popular and most respected play.\"",
