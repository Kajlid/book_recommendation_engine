How about getting warnings from your supervisor for errors in your reports or the deteriorating relationships with your colleague, just because you are unable to catch enough hours of sleep every night?Well, you are in luck because this is a review of what could possibly be the best, safest, and the simplest technique for managing insomnia. All you have to do is answer this: do you think you can trick our brain into falling asleep within minutes? While there exist multiple programs devised to help patients with insomnia, this technique has been tested on several individuals. It was also recorded with the help of a licensed hypnotherapist, who is also an advanced Neuro-Linguistic Programming Therapist.The recorded audio shows that you can lead yourself to a deep sleep state, fast, by using a step-to-step relaxation technique, also called self-hypnosis.What causes insomnia?With an increasing number of individuals suffering from insomnia and the subsequent increase in the number of accidents and job losses resulting from insomnia, it is important to understand the condition before trying to treat it.The inability to fall asleep, stay asleep for long or having trouble falling asleep al describe insomnia. All these result from brain activity.When you are awake, your mind is fully alert, and your muscles are full of blood and ready to act. Hormones associated with fast action are also high. In the brain, the alpha and the beta waves are active.On the other hand, your mind is relaxed as are the muscles. The muscles may even appear to be paralyzed when you are asleep because blood is stored in the intestines when you are asleep. In your deepest and the most restful sleeping state, your brain operates on the slow theta waves, and the delta waves which are even slower than the theta waves. Therefore, your brain is completely relaxed when you are deeply asleep.Self-hypnosis for insomniaAccording to this technique, and every other insomnia treatment technique, you send your body into sleep through relaxation of the mind and body. The self-hypnosis technique is built on this line of thought â€“ since sleeping pills send your body into sleep by relaxing the mind and the body, why wouldnâ€™t you fall asleep by using a safer technique that relaxes the body and mind? The self-hypnosis technique supposedly puts the brain into a light relaxing trance, and it also triggers the brain to move in close to the theta and the delta wave functions.",
