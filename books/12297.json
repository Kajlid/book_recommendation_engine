  "title": "Montana's Vamp",
  "description": "Gabriele Sloane has been picked on his entire life by the coven he grew up in. They taunted him, ridiculed him, and downright hated him. When they do the unthinkable and kick him out, Gabby is forced to find a new home. Dodging the sun and low on his diabetic supplies, he wanders aimlessly until he finds himself in the arms of one bald and sexy shifter. Montana Graton hates vampires with a passion. His best friend was killed by one. Hungry and bored, he decides to visit the diner in town. The little redhead sitting one booth over looks good enough to roll around in the back of his truck with-until the smell hits him and he discovers the redhead is his mate. Can Montana set aside his hatred and claim the little vamp, or will he allow his festering hate to surface and turn his back on the sexy little fireball fate has given him? Note: Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
