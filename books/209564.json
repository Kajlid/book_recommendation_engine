  "description": "An isolated town in Montana overcome with a mysterious illness. One doctor in town, out of ideas. A last resort - to call in a specialist from The State Department. The residents of Traveler's Rest rejoice as he produces a vaccine, but who is this man? And who is the other stranger in town? As the medicine is distributed, those won't be the only two questions being asked. Because soon, bizarre things begin happening inside their bodies, and it becomes apparent that the illness isn't their only threat. Can Sawyer Langley, lifelong resident and father of two, unravel the mystery and save his family - and town - in time? Or is the macabre plot afoot simply too sinister for one man to overcome? One thing's for sure - it's a hell of a ride to the end.",
