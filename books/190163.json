  "title": "The Swordfish",
  "description": "During the course of an idyllic summer's day in the country, a senseless crime is committed. In its wake, fantasies and passions, desire and grief unite the destinies of the villagers. Most affected is young Martin: his fertile imagination leads him to identify turn in turn with a swordfish, Clint Eastwood and above all, Jesus Christ. With a cruel yet masterfully witty touch, Claus brings the reader into close contact with such fundamental matters as loss, religion, passion, desire and crime. Widely regarded as the most distinguished and contemporary writer from the Low Countries and a candidate for the Nobel prize, Hugo Claus is best known for \"The Sorrow of Belgium.\"",
