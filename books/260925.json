  "description": "Why sell your soul when you can rent it? Mark Vedis is an average cop. Average for a mage in the Paranormal Police Department (PPD), anyway. After years of doing the jobs nobody else wanted, his career, and life, seemed to be on hold. Then he met a foul-mouthed demon who filled him with power, turned him into a warlock, and dumped him into a world of wealth and debauchery that was disturbing at best. When an enemy strikes who is far beyond what the cops in the PPD have ever seen, Mark is forced to travel to Thailand and face threats from all sides. But he soon learns that the chief of the Bangkok PPD is on the take, the local mafia is stirring up trouble, two of his team members have already been killed, and his new partners have trouble keeping their clothes on in public. Okay, the public nudity is probably the least of his worries.Worst of all, everyone in the supernatural community despises what he's become. To them, 'warlock' is a dirty word...If you like Jim Butcher, Domino Finn, Michael Anderle, M. D. Massey, Rick Gualtieri, Orlando A. Sanchez, K.F. Breene, Shayne Silvers, Ilona Andrews, Brad Magnarella, Patricia Briggs, or Kim Harrison...you'll have a blast with the first book in the Southeast Asia Paranormal Police Department.",
