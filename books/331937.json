  "title": "AWAKENING: The Rise of Western Civilization",
  "description": "From Stonehenge to Sulla, this first volume deals with the emergence of Western Civilization from the Late Paleolithic Era to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. It includes Sumeria, Egypt, classical Greece and Rome and the First Great Race War of Attila the Hun. Also revealed in this work is the one true cause of the rise and fall of the world’s greatest empires—that all civilizations rise and fall according to their racial homogeneity and nothing else—a nation can survive wars, defeats and natural catastrophes, but not racial dissolution.Previously published as chapters 1 to 19 of 'March of the Titans.' The text has been revised, updated, and expanded.",
