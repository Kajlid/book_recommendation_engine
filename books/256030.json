  "description": "Sometimes, power is more of a curse than a blessing.  Everything changed the day I met the Patton triplets. I found myself whipping through the air on a veritable roller coaster, with highs so amazing, I wasn’t sure I’d survive it and dark tunnels that sucked away my will to fight. But they were always there to bring me back from the brink.  With the threat of exposure hanging over my head, I had no choice but to become a test subject, a scientific experiment forced to perform like a circus monkey and donate tubes of blood weekly. I performed without complaint…for the most part. I was, after all, still me.  Things started to go sideways after a visit to The Divine Church of Purity, a cult-like religious group that had one purpose: rid the world of Alts. The web of secrets and lies surrounding the good doctor began to unravel just before he injected me with…something. Remember that roller coaster I mentioned before? That was the moment I hit the drop dive, rolling out into a corkscrew I was sure would never end.  Alt abilities more diverse, more powerful and more dangerous began to emerge and I found myself on the run. Whether I was running from the doctor, the human population, or myself, I had no idea. But I did know one thing.  No cost was too great. I would go as far as it took to protect my family and my boys, even if it meant protecting them from me.   Recommended for ages 16+ for mature content.",
