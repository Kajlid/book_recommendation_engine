  "description": "His father was a werewolf. His uncle may be a vampire. Its time for fourteen-year-old Trey Laporte to discover the beast within. . . Trey thought he was an ordinary teenager. Then he meets a mysterious stranger, Lucien Charron luminously pale, oddly powerful, with eyes that seem flecked with fire and skin that blisters in sunlight. Somehow Trey finds himself in a luxury London penthouse, like a Bond villain's lair. It's the heart of a sinister empire, built on the powers of the netherworld werewolves, vampires, sorcerers, djinns. And Trey himself has a power that's roaring to break free. Is he a boy or is he a beast?",
