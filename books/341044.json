Many of the sto­ries deal with the famil­iar Poe themes of mur­der, obses­sion and pas­sion, but this vol­ume also con­tains many often-​overlooked tales of the fan­tas­tic and comic, par­o­dies and hoaxes, includ­ing ‘The Unpar­al­leled Adven­ture of Hans Pfaall’, ‘Mes­meric Rev­e­la­tion’, ‘Hop-​Frog’, and & ‘The Imp of the Perverse’.The book includes a sec­tion in colour, and con­tains use­ful essays from notable schol­ars: an intro­duc­tion by Kevin J.
