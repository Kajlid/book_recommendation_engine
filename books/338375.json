  "description": "Sometimes, the best rides are unexpected. Orson Mackenzie didn’t want a relationship. Perfect. Neither did I. But what started as a fun ride with no commitment turned into hitching our cars to the same train. Orson needed my insurance. I needed his tax break. So we signed a piece of paper to make me his not-so blushing bride. Forever was never the destination. Until Orson unexpectedly changed course, and we found ourselves on different tracks. Now, it’s seven months later, I’ve lost my apartment and, luckily for me, my husband still has a heart of gold. And a spare bedroom. I can move in with my fake husband, right? How hard can it be? Except I’m having a hard time overlooking how his eyes undress me and the way his voice rasps when he calls me sweetheart. And the more time we spend together, the more I see through his happy-go-lucky exterior. He needs someone in his corner, and for once, maybe I need someone in mine too. I shouldn’t fall in love with my husband. But my heart might be thumping to the bumpy tune of forever. Our Ride To Forever is a romantic comedy featuring a secret marriage of convenience and lots of roommate shenanigans in a house with only one shower and very, very thin walls. Enjoy the comforts of a small town theme park, filled with lots of love and even more steamy, sizzling spice!",
