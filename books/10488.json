  "description": "It would seem that Vince Luca is just like any other high school guy, but there is one thing that sets him apart from other kids - his father happens to be the head of a powerful crime organization. Sure, Vince's family connections come in handy for certain things (like when teachers are afraid to give him a bad grade), but it can put a serious crimp in your dating life! How do you explain to your girlfriend what your father does for a living? When Vince finally meets a girl who seems worth the trouble, her father turns out to be the FBI agent who has been watching Vince's family for years and wants to put his father away for good.",
