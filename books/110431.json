  "description": "Can tuna fish sandwiches bring reconciliation and redemption?Cecilia Jackson thought so and made it her final wish to have three women come home to Boots, Texas and make her top-secret, award-winning, sought-after tuna fish recipe for her funeral fixins. Cecilia relished her role as spiritual mentor to the three and taught them to follow Jesus. Belinda Kite, Donna Dougans and Maggie Shanks haven't been back to Boots since the \"incident\" that destroyed their friendship twenty five years ago on their high school graduation night. Now only one of them has any interest in the \"fairy tales\" of their childhood God. Belinda is running from the law, Donna is desperate to find love no matter the cost and Maggie holds a secret that could take her life.Tension from the past makes the trip in all of their suitcases and appears when they reunite. As they begrudgingly make the sandwiches, they find themselves fighting each other, heart-wrenching memories, and two old crusty women. Imogene and Lola Bee, cohorts of Cecilia, are frantic to get their hands on that recipe and not let citified young'uns hightail it out of Boots with the town's coveted covert document. Will the recipe bring reconciliation and redemption or all-out war to the West Texas desert?",
