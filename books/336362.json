  "title": "Transfigured Sea",
  "description": "On the shores of the ocean, Laura and Daphne fantasise that they are mother and daughter, mother and Sea Sprite. They both have problems in their past, which they need to resolve. They set out to explore every aspect of the sea, from an estuary and mangroves to Antarctic waters and the deep ocean. Mother Sea is a whisper of emotion and a memory of intuition. She dwells in the subconscious. Sea creatures abound, from sea urchins and stingrays to dolphins and sharks. Some of these parallel the behaviour of the women. Sea nymphs accompany them and they are assisted by a special conch shell. While they are exploring the sea, the women also explore their own make-ups. Laura remembers interactions with her own mother. Daphne needs healing. However, they have no idea of the profound changes which will come to them.Poems are scattered throughout the book, which is also poetic.",
