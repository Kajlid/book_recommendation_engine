Can John and Ball stay out of the crosshairs long enough to answer the riddle that keeps running through Ball's mind?Ball is a science fiction novel set in a world populated by intelligent machines for the first time. If you like your robots hilarious instead of homicidal, you'll love the witty and colorful M.O.I.s.",
