He's a down-at-heels limo driver who lives in a run-down house in the back woods of upstate New York, with no family or ties other than his ex-cop cousin, Millie.And then, into his life barrels a girl he had never expected to see again—the daughter he'd given up fifteen years before.Vida, now a twenty-year-old Iraqi war veteran, is AWOL, and running for her life. She has no where else to go, and has come to Pack for help. She believes a fellow American soldier in Iraq killed her best friend, and is now coming after her.",
