  "description": "Musings of a Hideous Mind: Short Stories to CHILL your very soul! From weddings and childhood homes, to the paranoid ramblings of a mad man and the failing brain of a writer, there is no telling where the pathways of a hideous mind will lead. In the first of a trilogy of short stories, welcome to horror, a genre so expansive, yet summarized by such a small word. With a torrential downpour of blood to crazy clowns and repentant werewolves, this collection covers a wide range of the horror genre and serves up a terrifying feast of soul chilling tales that will haunt the readers mind long after the pages have been closed.",
