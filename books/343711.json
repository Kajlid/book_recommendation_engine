  "description": "Artist and storyteller Christy Kane creates life size, one-of-a-kind, handmade dolls then photographs them in antique settings to illustrate her original stories of social misfits. She is a triple threat whose dolls have remarkably distinct personalities, whose photographs are nuanced and richly detailed, and whose stories are haunting and unforgettable. This collection of stories includes the tales * Lily (who has lost nine fingers, one-by-one, due to her careless fascination with a sewing machine), * Polly (who has been unable to stop traveling the world since receiving a pair of roller-skates on her fifteenth birthday), * Callalilly (whose unchecked temper has doomed her to becoming a hook-handed piano player), * The triplets Hyacinth, Azaeleah and Violah (whose baby sister Wisteria has gone missing under troubling and mysterious circumstances).",
