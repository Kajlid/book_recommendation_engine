  "description": "\"There's an artful, edgy rebellion being waged in the funny pages, and one of its brightest revolutionaries is Stephan Pastis.\" -- Fort Worth Star-Telegram\"The cartoon Pearls Before Swine is written by a psychopath.\" --reader complaint, Wichita EagleThis collection of Pearls Before Swine makes a happy return to home and hearth as only these scamps can. An iconic portrait that captures the essence of modern life, Pearls Before Swine is a heartwarming American original.A gifted storyteller with a sick sense of humor, Stephan Pastis is rapidly becoming a master of the cartoon art form. His pearls of wisdom are sly and subversive, smart and shocking. And incredibly funny.It's a jungle out there. The only way to survive is with friends, a thick skin, and, a good dose of cynicism.* A sense of humor, along with a little animal instinct, is just what The Saturday Evening Pearls offers.* Pearls Before Swine was named Best Comic Strip in 2004, and again in 2007 by the National Cartoonists Society.",
