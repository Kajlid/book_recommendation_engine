  "description": "Lightning sears a scene against the eye. Trapped between reality and death, every scrap of life is fighting for existence. To stop fighting is to die. Some precious moments of peace can be stolen from small pockets of calm. Life can take a breath and wonder at the harsh beauty, but only for a moment, then struggle resumes. And others watch...The Shaytonian Chronicles continues around the Circle: Is Talkar the tool of the Council or the fangs at their throats? Shaytonians will use anything and anyone to succeed. So why does it always seem to fall on him? And what of the Enemy? A prophecy is made: \"She is the start of the Circle, you are the end.\" Talkar fears he'll end up trying to save the world--again. And it's not as if he even likes it.",
