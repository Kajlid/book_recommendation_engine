With an eight-year age gap between us, I went off to college and started my career while she was still learning what she wanted to do in life. I’d check in with my little sister, Cameron, every few weeks and occasionally ask about Scarlett.Imagine my surprise when Cam mentions Scarlett was just dumped by her first ‘serious’ boyfriend.I’m now thirty-two and Scarlett is approaching her mid-twenties. She’s turned into one hell of a woman, and I’m ready to take what should’ve been mine from the get-go.I put a couple things in my little sister’s head to make this think it was her idea, but in all actuality, it was mine.All I have to do is be Scarlett’s date for Valentine’s Day. Who wants to sit in their apartment sulking about their ex anyway?Little does she know just how filthy her valentine will be.",
