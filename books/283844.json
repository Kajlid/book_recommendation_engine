  "description": "\"Interesting account of the novel experiments relating to the phenomena of alternating currents of very high frequency.\" - Electrical Engineer (1891) \"Tesla referred to the physiological effects of high-frequency currents.\" - The Journal of Advanced Therapeutics (1904)  Nikola Tesla (1856 â€“1943) was a genius who revolutionized how the world views electricity. In 1891, in his first publication Nikola Tesla dazzled readers with his keen insight and an array of experiments relating to alternating current in an 18-page work titled \"Phenomena of Alternating Currents of Very High Frequency\" (Electrical World, Feb. 21, 1891), republished here.  In introducing his work, Tesla writes:  \"Professor Crookes has revived the interest in his beautiful and skillfully performed experiments, the effect observed on the Ferranti mains has elicited the expressions of opinion of some of the leading English electricians, and Mr. Swinburne has brought out some interesting points in connection with condensers and dynamo excitation. The writer's own experiences have induced him to venture a few remarks in regard to these and other matters, hoping that they will afford some useful information or suggestion to the reader.\"",
