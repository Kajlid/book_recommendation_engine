  "description": "Murderer?Vigilante?Or seeker of justice?The choice is yours.I’m Minka Mayet, Copeland City’s newly appointed chief medical examiner.My position demands I bring justice to those who can no longer fight, but my true calling is to honor the dead.Though forced to play by the rules, I was gifted the knack for deciphering what the dead have to say, which keeps my success rate high and my unsolved cases nonexistent.Archer Malone searches for justice too, but he comes with secrets deeper than the ocean, and an incessant need to claim me as his own.We’re strangers. We’ve only just met.But my first day on the job sees a particularly cruel case land on my desk that demands we work together.Archer’s arrogant streak makes it impossible to remain objective when we’re within touching distance, but we need to work fast to find our killer, or the famed Copeland City vigilante may step in on our behalf.Sinful Justice is the first book in a brand new standalone series by Emilia Finn. This book is intended for an 18+ audience and contains graphic scenes that may be disturbing to some readers.",
