  "description": "Why do bad things happen in such an amazing world? Sixteen-year-old Lily Mason knows the answer to that question...and much more. Once friendless and unpopular, Lily endured more than any teenager should have to. However, her world completely changed when she met the beautilful Elementals.The Elementals are ancient guardians of the Earth. Two of these guardians are sent to Heppner, Oregon after an ageless Native American, called the Creator, issued a prophecy that identified Lily as the one who will bring balance back to the world. Michael Rowe and Mira Grace are sent to protect Lily from Collin, an evil being called a Soul Searcher. Complications arise when the unnaturally handsome guardian, Michael, finds that there is a rare scent bond that exists between him and the beautilful girl he is sent to protect. So what does it mean when Lily recognizes that the same type of bond exists with Collin and how can Michael ultimately protect her from the evil that she is connected with?",
