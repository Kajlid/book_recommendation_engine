  "description": "Charlie:They say time heals all wounds, but it's been five years since my boyfriend died, and I haven't dated since. I threw myself into architecture and thankfully there's just no time to wallow or look for love. My friends push me to get back out there, but I'm not ready to be vulnerable again.Then I meet Kev. He dresses like a catalog model, but he talks like he's got an old soul. He shows me what I'm missing, but holds his own heart just out of reach. I can't stop falling for him, and he might be worth taking a risk for. Can I believe in myself enough to win his trust and his heart?Kev:My parents kicked me out for being gay when I was only sixteen. You grow up fast when that happens. You do things you regret just to stay alive. All that's behind me now. I'm 23, moved to Brooklyn, got an annoying roommate, and all I have to do is stay safe and pay the rent.Sounds easy? Yeah, my options are closing in fast. I don't want to stand on street corners again, but everyone in this city just wants to fix their own loneliness, not mine. And then there's Charlie, who sees the best in me when others only see their own reflection. Can we bare our hearts to each other and build a future together?Electric Sunshine is book one in the Brooklyn Boys series, where good men find their happily ever afters in a hectic metropolis. It has an HEA and no cliffhanger. There will be naughty bits doing naughty things, grumpy roomies, opposites attracting, retail hell, hangover specials, and cracked hearts made better-than-new.",
