  "title": "Flight to the Misty Planet",
  "description": "This is right before the first chapter starts, copied directly from the book:As readers of Space Captives of the Golden Men know, in the year 1975 a great rocket, designed to carry men to the Moon, was launched. Before that rocker landed two boys, Jim and Bob Steel, became the first Earthmen to set foot on the Moon. In the next quarter-century other Earthmen followed them to the Moon and went even further, to the red planet Mars. Now, in the year 1999, other young men take up the challenge, continuing to push back the frontiers of space...Uncommon juvenile title by prolific and popular author of the 50s, of good repute for her meticulous checking of known scientific information, in this book with the British Interplanetary Society. A clever adventure story with young astronauts-in-training, crashed on an exploratory mission to Venus. The hazards and dangers of survival alone and unsupported on the planet's surface are interesting and inventive and graphically described.",
