  "description": "Not all men with a six-pack and a killer smile are man whores... Not all men with panty dropping charm and full lips know how to bed a woman, and not all men with broad shoulders and straight teeth can promise wild, multiple orgasming sex.Jesse O'Ryan was everything I could have wanted...When he walked into the bar, my hunt for a crazy one-night stand had come to an end. I wanted himâ€” all of him, but when I got him, it wasn't at all what I expected.Novels describe men like Jesse to be dripping with sex. He was supposed to know where to put his hands, his mouth his tongue and...everything else. It was then I realized my life wasn't a novel, sadly, not every hero was good in bed...To be good in bed you need to practice. After all, Rome wasn't built in a day. To get the happy ending I needed (pun intended) Jesse O'Ryan was about to become my naughtiest little project.",
