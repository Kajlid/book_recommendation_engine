  "description": "The famous success produced by Lindsay and Crouse; a smash hit in New York and on the road. We meet the charming and innocent ladies who populate their cellar with the remains of socially and religiously \"acceptable\" roomers; the antics of their brother who thinks he is Teddy Roosevelt; and the activities of the other brother â€“ these require no further description or amplification here. ARSENIC AND OLD LACE is a must for all nonprofessionals, a ready-made comedy hit.",
