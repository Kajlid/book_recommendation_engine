  "title": "A Noble Calling",
  "description": "A rookie FBI agent battles through adversity and danger to rediscover his true identity in this story of intrigue and suspense. Special Agent Win Tyler never had the chance to visit Yellowstone as a kid, but he’d always imagined buffalo, wolves, and bears. Heavily armed bad guys didn’t fit into his expectations. But when Win arrives in the park during a spring snowstorm, danger is already at hand. His expectations of a dead-end duty station couldn’t have been more wrong, as he finds himself fighting right-wing extremists, a determined assassin, and an anti-Semitic prophet who’s twisted the faith that Win holds dear.  A Noble Calling is a heartfelt debut that plunges the reader deep into Win Tyler’s world of Yellowstone National Park…a world of wonder and majesty, invaded by forces that would divide and destroy.",
