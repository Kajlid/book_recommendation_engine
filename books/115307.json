To him, blessed as he considers himself, his life is blissfully ordinary. He is a bright young history professor who has two great parents and the love of his life.So when Alan does begin to question his past, he quickly becomes captivated by the search for answers in the unsolved murder of his young sister, Sarah. As the mysteries begin to compound, he brushes aside his responsibilities as a history professor and goes against his parents' wishes to discover the truth.His search soon turns to obsession, and before he knows it, he is in a foreign country and trapped inside of labyrinth of more confusing questions. Now he only knows one thing for sure, Sarah's death was only a small part of a centuries old puzzle that is equal parts incredible and terrifying.Alan will soon be transformed in ways he never thought possible, and the line between history and memory will begin to disappear.‘The Forgotten Hero’ will leave readers guessing until the final chapter, and then returning to the “beginning” to fully understand the true story.",
