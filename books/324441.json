  "description": "Helen Hawthorne's latest dead-end job is in Miguel Angel's Fort Lauderdale hair salon, where a trim can cost as much as a car payment and a blowout can wipe you out. But when one of the salon's most famous clients, gossip blogger and cable-TV show host Kingman \"King\" Oden is murdered at his own wedding, things get a little hairy and King becomes the prime suspect. To save her boss-and her job- Helen is determined to find the murderer. When she finds herself the target of threatening notes, it's more imperative than ever that she figure out who at the wedding was dressed to kill.",
