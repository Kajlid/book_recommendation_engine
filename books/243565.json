  "description": "Let's get realâ€”the English language is bizarre. A might be for apple, but it's also for aisle and aeons. Why does the word \"gnat\" start with a G but the word \"knot\" doesn't start with an N? It doesn't always make sense, but don't let these rule-breaking silent letters defeat you!This whimsical, funky book from Raj Haldar (aka rapper Lushlife) turns the traditional idea of an alphabet book on its head, poking fun at the most mischievous words in the English language and demonstrating how to pronounce them. Fun and informative for word nerds of all ages!",
