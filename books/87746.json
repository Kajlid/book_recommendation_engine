Not only are her husband and baby acting strangely, so is everyone else. Toddlers able to perform unthinkable physical acts, schoolchildren with disturbing intellectual abilities, robotic adults studying her with an intensity that is frightening. It’s as if all of Cedar Island has gone mad... or maybe it’s just her. With a mental breakdown in the past, Gillian recognizes the symptoms.10- year-old Stacy Kennedy has plenty of experience evading difficult situations, but what’s happening on Cedar Island is beyond her capabilities. Not only is her drunken mother and current live-in boyfriend acting weirder than normal, so are her classmates. They want something from Stacy – but she’s too afraid to find out what.As the few uninfected residents of Cedar Island try to escape, their only avenue is abruptly cut off. Hunted by their families and friends, they must band together to uncover what horrors really lie at the center of Cedar Island. They must choose if the path to eternity is evil or simply another technological breakthrough.",
