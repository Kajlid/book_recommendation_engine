  "description": "From New York Times & USA Today bestselling author  Vivian Arend, the next book in the bestselling Six Pack Ranch series!  **  Innocence and passion are an addictive mix…  The dark-haired stranger next door triggers every protective instinct Trevor Coleman never knew he had. From the moment Becky Hall literally falls into his arms, the last man standing of the Moonshine clan doesn't even attempt to resist sweet temptation. Becky is beautiful, mysterious and heartbreakingly vulnerable…and he's a goner.  To escape the hell she was trapped in, Becky left everything behind but her courage. And for once in her life, good people step up to make a difference. A helping hand, a new job…a very attentive and libido–stroking neighbour. Now a new future awaits, one that shockingly includes sexual pleasure instead of icy pain, and a sexy cowboy who’s more than eager to show her the ropes.  Becky’s sweet smiles and seductive innocence draw him in like nectar, and Trevor knows one taste will never be enough. But with secrets thicker than a bumper crop, changing a life will take more than a new ID and a cowboy’s good intentions.  It's gonna take sacrifice to break these chains.   boy meets girl, boy falls in love with girl—all hell breaks loose. We’ve got a hero whose hands are tied in more ways than one. A heroine who wants to experience everything she's ever missed, and a family that needs to discover if its roots go deep enough to weather any storm.",
