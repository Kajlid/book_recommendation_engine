  "description": "Meet Barry Ween, the smartest living human. What does a ten-year-old boy do with a 350 I.Q.? Any thing he wants. Cranky, egotistical, arrogant and foul-mouthed, Barry in general wants to conduct his experiments and be left alone, but it never seems to work out. Hurdles that Barry must outmaneuver range from time warps, to art thieves, to accidentally turning his best friend into a dinosaur.",
