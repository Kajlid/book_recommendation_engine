  "description": "In the summer of 1936, Agee and Evans set out on assignment for \"Fortune\" magazine to explore the daily lives of sharecroppers in the South. Their journey would prove an extraordinary collaboration and a watershed literary event when in 1941 \"Let Us Now Praise Famous Men\" was first published to enormous critical acclaim. This unsparing record of place, of the people who shaped the land, and of the rhythm of their lives today stands as one of the most influential books of the twentieth century.",
