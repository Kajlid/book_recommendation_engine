  "description": "Loving Cassie was effortless. She was a thirst I couldn’t quench.  She was everything I needed, but nothing I deserved. I failed her more times than I could count.  I lied relentlessly. And she always forgave me.  Until she couldn’t.  Maybe I deserved to be left behind.  * * *  Jax swept me off my feet with his disheveled hair and his easy smile. I loved him fiercely. He made me believe in the fairytale.  Then the walls crumbled around me. The lies never ended. I left him behind. I had no choice. I mourned the loss of him.  But I moved on. I created a new life, Now, I was marrying someone else.  Where do we go now that he’s back?",
