  "description": "Doña Constanza Enríquez de Castilla may be the daughter of a claimant to the throne, but she will never be a princess. The product of her father's dalliance with a young French girl, she has never been welcome in the eyes of his wife and legitimate heirs, who see her as a threat to the safety of their inheritance and a thief of their father's love. Lonely and kept on hand as a servant, Constanza grows up right in the middle of one of the most turbulent times of a monarchy: the beginning of a dynasty. While she worries for her beloved father's physical and emotional health and tries in vain to avoid the wrath of his queen, she finds herself making friends and falling in love, but how will she deal with the highs and lows that come with such relationships - and how will she come to terms with the greatest betrayal she could have never imagined? In the royal court, the games of Fate mean anyone can rise or fall at the royal will; does Constanza really want to play, or is she content to simply remain LA BASTARDA?",
