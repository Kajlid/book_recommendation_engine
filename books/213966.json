  "description": "Billion Dollar Distraction\n\n~ A Contemporary Billionaire Romance ~\n\n-Vincent Pierce, III-\n What do you do when you have all the money in the world, own half of the real estate in the nation, and none if it can help you get what you really want? She’s as stubborn and proud as she is intelligent and honest and beautiful. She won’t accept my gifts, or my charity, or my help. She calls me a distraction, but she’s the one that’s making my life a mess. I can’t work, I can’t sleep, and I can’t focus. Not until I have her. Not until she’s mine.\n-Sophia Sway-\n I live my life by one rule - no distractions. That means no boys, no dating, and definitely no sex. Not until I fulfill my promise to build a house so beautiful that it makes the angels in heaven weep, because that’s where my mother is. Growing up poor, every day I promised to build her a house, and every day I studied and worked hard. I earned my scholarship to UCLA’s school of architecture, and after I graduate I will work hard to earn my career. Now that she’s gone, I still intend to fulfill my promise. Vincent Pierce’s mesmerizing green eyes and addictive kisses be damned. Billion Dollar Distraction is a contemporary romance with adult themes and explicit sexual content for the adult reader.",
