  "title": "Because Your Daddy Loves You",
  "description": "This spot-on pairing of words and images is a warm, reassuring, and humorous tribute to dads everywhere. A day spent with a young child at the beach is filled with many minor dramas—a lost shoe, a ball that floats too far out into the water, a drippy ice-cream cone. These can be frustrating events for both child and parent, but the daddy in this book finds a way to fix each problem, lovingly and patiently. Why? Because he loves his little girl, of course! The classic Because Your Daddy Loves You  makes the perfect gift—whether you're celebrating Father's Day, a new dad, or just the special bond between a father and child . . . any day of the year.",
