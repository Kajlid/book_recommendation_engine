  "description": "When Maleen arrives in Dranneth, she hopes to find loyal Ardeners and restore Arden. To do this, she’ll continue to hide behind the safety of the Dragon Fever veil and remain dead to Crown Prince Jared of Dranneth. Dranneth has promised to protect Arden already; she doesn’t want to obligate them further, particularly Jared.But the promise of Arden’s restoration proves difficult, and alarming events cause Maleen to wonder if she really came through Dragon Fever unscathed and whether she is as safe from Melanor as she thinks. It doesn’t help that Jared, the man she rejected in favor of exile in the tower, seems to be the one person who truly understands her, even as she tries to hide.",
