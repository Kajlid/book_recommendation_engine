  "description": "Capstone is the fourth and final book in the completed, Young Adult, Cornerstone Series. The reading order for this paranormal romance adventure Cornerstone, Keystone, Jamb and Capstone. It's supposed to stink. That's what Cusps do. The Ianua, Nalena and Garrett's own community, have welcomed them back and by charging them as traitors and chucking them into the Hotel Celare's slammer. And outside the fortress walls, it's no better. The Cusp is at full-boil as the world finally surrenders to The Fury's lifestyle. Looting, riots, murders—every kind of crime has become the norm—and The Fury want to make it all permanent. They might even succeed, now that they've nabbed all thirteen of the Ianua's Cornerstones. To preserve mankind, the only chance the Ianua have left is to beat The Fury to the Earth's Core and somehow trigger the Reset. Like that's easy. There's no manual on how to activate a Reset. Nobody even knows if there’s an actual Core to the Earth. Shoot, it could be one big myth; an epic waste of effort. But the Addo thinks there is one last hope. Maybe. So long as someone is willing to sacrifice everything to be mankind's long shot.",
