  "description": "Dragons and danger and magic collide... And it's only Monday.In the second book of USA Today Bestselling Desert Cursed series, Zamira must once again test her mettle against a world bent on breaking her, proving she is more than she seems.We survived the land of the Witch’s Reign, that much is true. But our arrival home is far from welcome.My idiot brother has taken it upon himself to ride off in search of a mythical healer, someone who might help him walk again. Assuming she doesn’t eat him first. Because said healer is a dragon and happens to reside in the deepest reaches of the Dragon’s Ground. Like I said, idiot.I’d go after him myself, but his leave-taking is not the only problem I face. My mentor has yet again forbidden me to leave the safety of the Stockyards. Her reasoning?That I am too weak to weather the coming storms.With my pride wounded in more ways than one, I must gather the few allies’ I have left. My ex-husband's new girlfriend at the top of the list and a goat bleating, oversexed Satyr.FML.If I’m lucky I’ll find a small dragon and a Jinn whose blue eyes still haunt my dreams along the way.Buckle up, buttercup, this ride is about to take a seriously unforeseen twist.If you like KF Breene, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Faith Hunter, Jaymin Eve, Kelley Armstrong, Kim Harrison, or Shayne Silvers, you won’t want to miss Mayer’s books!",
