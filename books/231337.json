  "title": "The Victorious Score",
  "description": "Tom Tyler, sidekick to Morning Light, fights crime as the hero Score in Sail City, the largest city in (an alternative New Zealand known as) New Cloud. Down on his luck and a little drained by it all, Tom is increasingly resigned to the fact that his work makes a normal life impossible. It's hard enough finding a boyfriend, but finding one as a gay superhero? Things are just too dangerous for him to dream of a normal life. When Tom meets Jacob, though, a series of events are set in motion that will change his life forever. Maybe Tom really can get what he wants - but maybe there's a lot more danger out there than he could have expected. With best friend Chrissy Cole at his side, the pair are young, gay and ready to fight. Out but not down, their pride is on the rise. Collects three novellas ('On My Shoulders', 'On My Own Again' and 'On My Way Ahead') plus bonus content.",
