  "description": "The fourteen chilling tales in this collection were written while A. N. L. ('Tim') Munby was a prisoner in Germany during World War II.Munby's spectres haunt locations as diverse as a Bristol bookshop, a Tudor Hall, the Snowdonian mountains, the peaceful Herefordshire countryside, a Book of Hours, and the remote Cuillin mountain range of the Isle of Skye.Munby skilfully brings his own specialised knowledge to each of the stories in this, his own tribute to the great M. R. James. THE ALABASTER HAND is recognised as a genuine cornerstone of supernatural literature.Michael Cox's Introduction provides much helpful background about a man who was for many years Librarian of King's College, Cambridge.",
