  "description": "Jill Richards finds a plane ticket with her name on it, destination: FAT. This code represents the Fresno airport, gateway to Wellspring Academy, a weight loss boarding school. Her mother, worried that Jill’s health is in jeopardy after years of failed diets, wants her to attend. Jill doesn’t want to go. While visiting the academy they learn Wellspring also offers summer camps. Determined to complete grade ten from home, Jill makes a deal with her mom. If Jill learns to be healthy and loses weight at the Wellspring La Jolla summer camp, then maintains these changes at home, boarding school is off the table. Jill and her mom travel from Fresno to San Diego where Jill’s journey to gain confidence and fitness begins. Will the Wellspring program work for Jill when all other weight loss plans have failed? Is this more than an ordinary “fat camp”?",
