  "description": "CAUTION: THE NAMES HAVE NOT BEEN CHANGED TO PROTECT THE GUILTY The Starlight Club was jumping... \"They looked like mob guys. They had that arrogance exuded by those who liked to intimidate - those who were the proud purveyors of fear.\" Amidst the nightly gaiety was the back room, where business deals were made, hits were ordered, and territories were divided. Trenchie, not being a \"rat\" is just released from his ten-year prison sentence. A new life is waiting - complete with envelopes of money and a steak house to call his own. He finds the woman of his dreams who brings along ex-husband baggage. Hit man Jimmy The Hat finds unexpected fame and fortune in Hollywood, yet always stays true to the \"boys\", especially Trenchie. His loyalty costs him his life. \"Crazy Joey Gallo\" and his brothers break away from the Profaci family and go \"rogue, on their own now. They split their gang into several small groups and spread them out over the five boroughs.\" Harsh punishment awaits those who talk. \"The colt 45 caliber bullet did its deed, taking with it a sizable portion of Rag's brain, forming a pink mist, mixed with bone and grey matter that puffed in front of Rag's head like a small mushroom, deflating when it met the chilly evening air. The current would soon carry his body at least a mile away.\"",
