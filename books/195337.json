  "description": "Iron has always known the difference between holding a woman and screwing one. Rosalind, ‘his Roz’, was the only woman he ever wanted to hold. When she died, a piece of him died with her. So imagine his surprise when she falls off a truck of kidnapped women right into his arms, alive and well. Now, he just wants an explanation because the pain he's suffered at her loss was all for nothing.  Roz has been chasing after the love she felt as a young woman for most of her life. Having found the man you’re meant to be with so young is both a blessing and a curse. After she was forced to fake her death, she tried to find him. After years of searching, she had given up thinking it was hopeless. Kidnapped by the Headhunter MC, she knows her death is coming. When the door to her prison opens, the last thing she expects to discover is the man she thought was lost to her forever.  Can they rediscover the passion that led them both to love or will they find that passion has been erased by time and the life they found without each other?",
