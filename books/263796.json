  "description": "When my mother decided to pull me out of school I didn’t say anything.  When she homeschooled me, isolated me, kept me fearful of my peers, I followed along.  When she packed me up and sent me across the country to live with my grandmother in the one-stoplight town of Lee Vines, I did as she said.  But now that she’s left me here I’m on my own. I can make my own decisions.  Make my own mistakes.  And that includes if I let in the four boys that live next door.  Starlee’s Heart, Book 1 of the Wayward Son’s is a #whychoose contemporary young adult romance. Why fall in love once when you can do it over and over again?",
