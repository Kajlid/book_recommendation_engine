He quickly has his hands full looking out for his young friends Lefty and Georgio, while also trying to score some easy coin with his old ally Melegal the thief. Along the way, Venir faces threats from the Royal houses of Bone, man-urchins, Shadow Sentries, and two dark figures that he’d left for dead once before.Finally, though, Venir leaves Bone behind, only to run into Jarla, Queen of the Brigands—an old flame who wants him dead. And soon after that, the real horror begins, as Catten and Verbard emerge and unleash their worst in the hopes of finally killing the Darkslayer. The mighty Venir soon finds himself in a fight that might just be more than even the Darkslayer can handle.",
