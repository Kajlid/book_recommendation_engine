  "title": "Joshua In The Holy Land",
  "description": "Joshua has come home.But home is no more peaceful than it was during the \"time long ago\" remembered by Joshua. Violent, seemingly intractable disputes poison the very air. It falls to Joshua, retracing the path taken two millennia ago, to lead his followers to peace in this world as well as in the next. Joshua in the Holy Land will carry every reader back to where it all began.Back to Nazareth and Bethlehem.Back to Capernaum and Bethany.Back to Jerusalem.Full of resonances with the Gospels, Joshua in the Holy Land is a profoundly satisfying addition to the Joshua phenomenon.",
