  "description": "A Twist of Fate pulled us effortlessly into the world of Lexi Reed - the feisty, smart, sexy and career driven PR manager whose world was turned upside down when she met and began representing her favourite rock band, Power Station. This opportunity of a lifetime not only capitulated Lexi into a new and exciting world but onto a hot and steamy path with Alex Stone, the band's lead guitarist. Their passion simmered as they tired to maintain their secret relationship, leaving both Alex and Lexi wanting more than the \"no strings, sex only\" agreement they had negotiated. Hearts and rules were broken as Lexi learned the hard way, you can't negotiate with emotions, least of all love.  In this companion novella, we get to examine what has happened behind the scenes from different perspectives, told to us by the characters themselves. Through the eyes of Alex and others we get a clearer view of how Lexi's arrival affects not only dynamics of the band but their personal relationships with her and each other.  We get to know the main players more intimately as we are given access to interviews and personal accounts, learning not only about them and what makes them tick but how their world has changed since Lexi's arrival.",
