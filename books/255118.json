He’s just broken every single one. She’s forbidden, a temptation he should resist, but she’s just become his very reason for living. Lucia Deen is used to being bullied, alone, with no one to turn to until he enters her life. He cares, showing that her safety matters, that she matters. But he’s her teacher. It’s wrong. It’s dangerous—and she’s already addicted. Secrets are made to be kept, but theirs are about to be blown apart. Can their forbidden love survive the fallout?",
