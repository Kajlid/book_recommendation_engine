  "description": "From David Feherty, the notorious  ex-pro and golf commentator at CBS Sports, comes a hilarious new collection of rants sure to surprise and crack up hackers everywhere.In The Power of Positive Idiocy , readers will be treated to Feherty’s distinctive commentary on aging, Texas, women on the golf course, the Irish, parenting, addiction, Charles Barkley, and, of course, every pro golfer and golfing situation you’d ever want to read about. He also graciously (or in some instances unforgivingly) answers his fans’ questions and passes on his unique and demented perspective. Don’t say you haven’t been warned . . .Have you ever wondered where the weaknesses are in Tiger’s game? Or what would happen if there were PGA Tour cheerleaders? Or how Old Tom Morris would play if he came back from the dead? Or how you can raise the next Phil Mickelson? (Actually, Feherty acknowledges he could give a small dog’s trousers about your kids; he has trouble enough with his own.) Feherty explains how one can position oneself to caddie for a living. ( The answer involves drugs, gambling, divorce, and a three-strike felony record.) And, of course, he dispenses the best advice for anyone new to the game of golf. ( Proceed with caution here since this calls for a gun, $55,000, and a toothless, tattooed woman.)Hilarious, perverse as ever, and totally uncensored, Feherty’s new collection is sure to put a smile on the grouchiest guy in your family.",
