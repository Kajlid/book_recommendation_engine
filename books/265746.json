  "description": "Thirst Incubus Tamed, Book 1  A succubus is in my territory without permission, and I am tasked to find her. Once she reveals why she’s on the run, I realize there is an insane demon among us. Ashera Andrews doesn’t want my help, but she needs it to keep from being tortured by her maker.  Cassius Snow does everything in his power to protect me, but when he and his incubus friends are attacked because of my presence in their area, I make the decision to return to the place of my rebirth to send my maker to Hades…where he belongs.  A mating between an incubus and succubus is rare but not unheard of. When Ashera and I use each other for energy, the threads of a mating bind us together. When she returns to her maker, and I am left without her, I fear insanity before she can be saved.  I will not let the man who made her destroy what is fated to be mine.  I will risk eternity in Hades to bring her home.  ***This is a novella and will be the first book in the Incubus Tamed trilogy.",
