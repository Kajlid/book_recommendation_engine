  "description": "The Haole Substitute takes you on a raucous ride with a 23-year-old surfer who shoots through the squalor of Hawaii's roughest high schools to tackle social and personal problems. Marriage and fatherhood have turned a champion surfer into a sorry excuse for a substitute teacher. Hungry sharks and heavy surf pose no problem, but Paul Kodak is out of his element when it comes to cat fights, school politics, and knife-wielding, jive-talking hoodlums-in-training.",
