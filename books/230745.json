  "title": "When the Sky Falls",
  "description": "An in-depth look at fake news, yellow journalism, fictional broadcasts and the psychology behind them, wrapped in a twisted thriller.  In 1938 the War of the Worlds hoax panicked millions of Americans, then in 1988 another fictional media broadcast convinced nearly half of Portugal that sea monsters had risen from the ocean to destroy their cities. A team of CIA agents was sent to study the aftermath of this 6th Skyfall Event in the hope that they could turn it into a weapon of war. When the team consultant turns up dead, everyone scrambles to be the last man standing: the one who will decide if or when the sky falls.",
