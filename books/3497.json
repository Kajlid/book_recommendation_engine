  "title": "The Meaning of Children",
  "description": "Organized into three sections--titled \"Beginning,\" \"Middle,\" and \"End\"--the 14 stories in this collection approach the complexities of being human during those three distinct but interdependent stages of life. The author combines emotional depth and literary appeal to view the world through the eyes of children, the sorrow and satisfactions of the child-bearing years, and the culmination of life in old age. Skillfully woven together, the narratives follow a medley of well-drawn characters that include a girl who discovers a fear of heights as her parents' marriage unravels, a 30-something venture fund manager at odds with his daughter's paternity, an orphan accused of homophobia whose hands kill whatever they touch, and a mother of two who can only bear to consider abortion in the second person. Through an eclectic array of tales, this provocative anthology speaks to all who--though aware the world can be a very dark place--can't help but long for redemption.",
