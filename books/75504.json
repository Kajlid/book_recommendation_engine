  "description": "\"Excuse me as I disappear into nothingness. My hollow bones sing wild songs of freedom while the tempered hearts of wanting take leave of me.\"Annalise Grey uses free-verse poetry for two voices in this semi-autobiographical account of eating disorders and the inner turmoil which walks hand-in-hand with self-abuse. Annalise's battle with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder coupled with Bulimia began in childhood. Like the moon, both wax and wane in intensity yet never fully disappear. With brutal honesty and stark imagery, she weaves a tale of struggling with who you are and who you should be.",
