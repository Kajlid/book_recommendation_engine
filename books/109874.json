  "title": "Six Seconds of Moonlight",
  "description": "Anyone can be a god beneath the moonlight, but who can be a hero?With magic tearing the world apart, Britain crumbling and new monsters arising at the zenith of the moon, WOLVES (the witchcraft and occult law enforcement squad) is the country’s only line of defence. Every zenith, for six seconds under the moonlight anyone can wield the powers of a god and everyone is a daemon in waiting in a world where the supernatural can no longer be confined to the shadows.Lieutenant Karen Maynard, former solider and WOLVES officer, suffers a freak magical accident that shows her the dark side of humanity’s final hope and the depths WOLVES will sink to in their attempts to save the people from themselves. Covered with mysterious runes, tempted by a wild spirit and lost amongst those tainted by magic, Maynard finds herself the only person who will stand up against tyranny. It’s a quest that will claim a heavy price; mind, body and even soul.",
