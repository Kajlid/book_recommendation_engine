  "description": "Toran looked upon the other Elves in Xanti with wonder. They all had at least one Gift, they all had a trade, and they all knew their path in life. Why did he have to be so different? Toran's only claim to fame had been the attention the queen had given him on his Naming Day. She had called him a harbinger â€¦ but of what? And now that he was entrusted with a delivery to the Human village of Kipra, he hoped great things finally lay in store - but feared his history of mistakes might spell disaster.",
