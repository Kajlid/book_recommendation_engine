  "description": "This book might be about women's lib. This SF series presents many issues to ponder and suggests some inventions needed for space travel. The series starts in todays world and through forced invention gets mankind into space colonization to save the human race. Most of the science presented is in some stage of development now. If you want to travel for months in space and then create a colony on an empty planet, you need more women than men. On a spaceship, or in a scientific laboratory, women can do what a man would do. The man may be better at leadership because women tend not to want to lead, but in reading this series you might agree with the author about the makeup of the crew. There are a number of morale issues. This is the 3rd book in the Ancient Destiny saga. Book 1 describes the threat to Earth and the SHIP that has taught the great scientists of Earth. Book 2 is the escape from Earth with many scientific concepts for space travel, explorations for new earthlike planets, the escape and journey to new planets, establishing colonies on new planets. Book 3 adds new crewmembers as replacements, new science concepts, searches for knowledge on other planets, visiting Earth years after its destruction, encountering an enemy, finding who built SHIP and the so called, Library of Atlantis, more Martian history and first contact with the Galactic Alliance.",
