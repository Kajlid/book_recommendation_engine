Legend tells of a sacred land shrouded by the obscure, where the barrier between worlds is thin, and strange things happen without rhyme or reason. Mila, a budding violinist, is unaware of these myths when she accepts a job at a remote inn called the Dawn.Awed by the atmospheric location, Mila begins work, only to discover nothing is as it seems. Haunted by unsettling vestiges, mysterious disappearances, and the lure of a magical song, Mila takes it upon herself to unravel the secrets of the inn. And its handsome innkeeper. Mila knows she should stay away from him, but every time he appears, her resolve weakens. Fate may have brought them together but just as romance blooms, she discover his ghastly secret. He’s the harbinger of darkness, and standing by his side is a dangerous choice between life and something much worse than death. . .",
