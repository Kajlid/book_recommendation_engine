  "title": "Winning Cait",
  "description": "After more than a decade, Cait has returned home to St. Augustin and the Dom she left behind. A pampered sub, now widowed, Cait has adjusted to making decisions for herself for the first time in years. With some help from her friends, she's begun a new life.  Then Jackson walks into her studio it's as if their years apart never happened - as if she hadn't left him for his best friend. He never stopped loving her and he's not going to give up this time. He's determined to win her back, not only as his sub but as his wife.   (Reader Advisory: Grab a glass of wine, and put the kids to bed. This story has one hot Dom and a sub willing to make up for lost time. Graphic sexual language and scenes are to be expected.)",
