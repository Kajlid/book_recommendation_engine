  "description": "A dying king makes his son his heir — on one condition: the vain Prince Raphael must marry a woman who is his equal in beauty, intelligence, and wealth. A search throughout the kingdom appears to be fruitless until the lovely Rosamund appears at the palace. She is intelligent and wealthy, as well as beautiful — certainly his equal, Raphael thinks. But what does the mysterious Rosamund think?",
