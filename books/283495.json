  "description": "As one of Raleigh's hottest young entrepreneurs, Eva Perry spends her days planning lavish events and helping affluent brides-to-be plan their dream weddings. She keeps her margins, her reviews, and her designer stilettos high. Unfortunately, her success has come with sacrifice. When it's time to close her office door for the day and head upstairs to her apartment, the only romance she has energy for is in the books she reads from the local public library.  When she pictures the person she'll end up with, it's always the same: a goateed book nerd in flannel and Converse sneakers, carrying around a beaten up copy of her favorite novel in his messenger bag. When Eva meets Taylor on the library's web chat and gets invited to an off-site book club after they exchange witty banter, she quickly gets caught up in daydreams where she walks into the meeting to find the living embodiment of her dream guy.  Instead, she finds a gorgeous brunette that shares all of the more important qualities Eva hasn't managed to find in anyone else. In the weeks that follow, Eva finds that it's not Taylor's gender, but her past, that proves to be the biggest surprise. Can Eva maintain her reputation among the southern elite while courting someone with a criminal record?",
