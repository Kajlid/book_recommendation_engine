  "description": "Nicole Claveloux s short stories originally published in the late 1970s and never before collected in English are among the most beautiful comics ever created: whimsical, intoxicating, with the freshness and splendor of dreams. In hallucinatory color or elegant black-and-white, she brings us into lands that are very different from our own but oddly recognizable. They are lands filled with murderous grandmothers and lonely city dwellers, bad-tempered vegetables and walls that are surprisingly easy to fall through, lands in which the very air seems alive and capable of telling you a dirty joke (or the meaning of life). In the title story, a new houseplant becomes the first step in an epic journey of self-discovery and a witty fable of modern romance complete with talking shrubbery, infantile gourmands, a wised-up genie, and one very depressed bird. This new selection is the perfect introduction to the work of an unforgettable, unjustly neglected master of French comics.\"",
