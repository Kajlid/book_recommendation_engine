  "title": "Angel Food",
  "description": "In this wild romp of a road trip tale, angel food is not a dessert, but what the characters hope to avoid becoming. Siblings Anson, River, and Isidore have spent their lives traveling the country in an Airstream, on the run from the angels who have been trying to kill Isidore since the day she was born. When an old secret comes to light, the Camper siblings set out to find the truth about their family, dodging foot-fetish stalkers, state troopers, accusations of polygamy--and yes, angels--along their way. Angel Food is a riveting tale that spins between laugh-out-loud humor and nearly Greek tragedy. Fans of road trip Americana will love the Route 66 motifs, and the book should delight anyone who likes their family dysfunction with a good dose of humor, a sprinkle of fantasy, and a life-and-death edge. (1st ed)",
