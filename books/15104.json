  "description": "Do you know that God favors you? Is it easy to remember that when trouble strikes? No, but when author Brandy Bullock had to have emergency surgery for an ectopic pregnancy, she saw God's favor in her physical, spiritual, emotional, and even financial life firsthand. God shows his favor to his children daily by blessing us abundantly and keeping us safe. When we walk by faith, we as believers should expect favor because we are children of the most high God. God's Unspeakable Favor is one woman's encounter with God's goodness, his mercy, and of course, his favor. Brandy's testimony is an encouragement for those facing trouble today.",
