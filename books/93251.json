With little complaint, I abandoned my pursuit of kink, content to be married to a beautiful, intelligent woman who's a great mother to our twins. Out of the blue, Mia confesses she misses the intimacy in our marriage, misses the sex. After this enticing revelation, my plan to reconnect with her unfolds.In our secret, kinky, Friday afternoon meetings I'm going to give her everything she wants and take everything I need. Will this be the answer to fixing our marriage?30,828 Words",
