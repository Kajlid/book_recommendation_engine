Then a handsome stranger challenges her convictions and changes her mind. Headed for Texas, chased by the demons of his past...Seth Emerson knows exactly what he wants. Working to save for a cattle ranch of his own keeps him busy and keeps his pain buried.

Making greater sacrifices than either of them could foresee...Seth and Rebecca set off on a risky journey and a quest for truth, each healing the other’s love-starved soul along the way. Will they give in to their growing attraction? Or will they honor their commitments when Seth returns Rebecca to civilization... and her betrothed?Note about Although the moral context of the story is old fashioned, Come Back contains violence, adult themes, and descriptions of physical intimacy. It is intended for mature readers.",
