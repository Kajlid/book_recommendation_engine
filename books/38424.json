  "description": "Most folks in the town of Evergreen believe that the Landing’s sole function is as a homeless shelter, and although the homeless—who are lovingly called guests—see strange happenings around the Landing, they still have no idea that it is actually the home and training grounds of an elite group called the ‘League of Ascenders.’ This group of six women and six men—each with unique supernatural powers—make up just one division of a worldwide alliance in which the members are called to protect humanity from evil harm. It’s time for new members to take the place of old, but the new members must first make the same long and perilous journey as the Ascenders before them. And even though they only expect to discover who they are, they are surprised to also discover who they were meant to love. As the fledglings grow in skill into full-fledged Ascenders, they learn that the things you can’t see are often more real than the things you can; that love comes even when you try to fight it; and that God really does work in mysterious ways. Friends become enemies and enemies become friends in this supernatural adventure of battle between good and evil, and the promise of love.",
