  "description": "Jake Barton, an Air Force veteran, is on a mission of a completely different kind from his days of deployments and training. In order to protect the ones he loves from the threat of twisted powers from beyond the veil of reality, he must undertake an incredible journey across the face of the United States, performing rites of alchemy to help him consolidate and focus his power.  Fox Foster, a handsome, red-headed young man living and working in Moorcroft, Wyoming, is dealing with the fallout of insecurities and indecision plaguing his life. Abandonment, a short list of bad apples, and a good heart that only wants to make his father proud has Fox at odds with himself.  A chance encounter has Fox serving Jake as a guest at his family's hotel lodge. The strangely charged meeting has Jake considering just how massive his undertaking is--protecting the friends and son he holds dear, and bringing new love into his life after years of literal solitude.  How does one man face off against the threat of the enemy's shifters in the dark? Against the odds of scores of mages in the world versus the rarely discovered alchemists? Against a son who believed he was abandoned by his well-meaning father? How does he come to terms with the forces in the world that pushed him and Fox together?  A Touch of Lightning is the first novel in the Beyond the Pale series. Elements of alchemy, magic, and adventure in the present-day world exist side by side. Touch is a modern fantasy fiction blended with steamy, inventive, M/M romance. Pick up the book and let the journey begin!",
