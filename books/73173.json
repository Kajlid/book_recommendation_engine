  "description": "An inspiring, devilishly funny tale of hope, secrets—and hard-knock faith that can make the most impossible situations right…For Sister Betty, the marriage proposal from trustee Freddie Noel is a once-in-a-lifetime surprise blessing. Unfortunately, she knows the chances of having a peaceful ceremony in their beloved Crossing Over Sanctuary Church are slim to none. But she’s armed with enough sense and scripture to keep contentious church busybodies Bea Blister and Sasha Pray Onn from sowing even more chaos amid the congregation—until a rehearsal disaster and an unexpected secret causes Freddie to break off the engagement without explanation…While this no-nonsense prayer warrior needs all the holy backup she can get, her pastor, Reverend Leotis Tom, is desperately dodging temptation as Mother Pray Onn’s wild-child niece and Betty’s young cousin compete to become his First Lady. With her happiness, the church’s future, and Tom’s sanity on the line, Sister Betty will need to kick some spiritual butt, take names—and fight for some major soul-saving miracles.",
