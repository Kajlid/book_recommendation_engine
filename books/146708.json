  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Sasha Douglas appears to be like most other teenagers, at least on the surface. Those around her would say she's quiet and keeps to herself, but there's nothing extraordinary about her. They certainly wouldn't know anything of the pain she carries inside and the burden it's placed on her young shoulders. A chance of fate brings 24-year-old Eve Walton into her life as her new English teacher. Eve notices straightaway that something is wrong with Sasha, something dark buried beneath her carefully constructed exterior, and she makes an effort to get to know her troubled pupil, hoping that she might be able to help in some way to alleviate the girl's suffering. The friendship that blossoms between them goes beyond what either could have hoped for or expected, but will it end in peril when they realize their feelings go deeper than they should? Will Eve be able to maintain a professional distance and still help Sasha on the way to healing?",
