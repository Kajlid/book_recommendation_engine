  "title": "The Questions of Jesus",
  "description": "Questions have a surprisingly big place in the Gospels. Jesus often asked them to engage His listeners or to challenge their thinking. Various people asked Him questions. His followers often wanted to understand Him but sometimes to use Him; His opponents sharpened them as weapons against Him. A few of Jesus’ questions seem stupid, even rude—they’re not! As always with Jesus, there’s more to everything He said than at first appears. The interactions have lasting value too—for us. What lies behind the questions we sometimes ask God? What do His questions teach us about ourselves?This collection of 52 short pieces takes a variety of approaches to explore the most interesting questions in people’s interactions with Jesus. But they also examine us and encourage us to think and live more like Jesus.",
