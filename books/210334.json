Grosso, at the Nagali's behest, has begun to corrupt the Emperor of Argoth, fomenting war amongst the normally peaceful Argosians. If the Fleet is mobilized to attack, there will be none to stand in the way of its military might. A return visit to the skycontinent of Argoth has unprecedented repercussions, not just for Kalla, but for her entire pack.Finding the Fang will be no easy task either. They must brave the tropics of Su Ramerides and the dragons that live among the dense jungle and volcanic mountains. New friends will be found and new enemies made. Redemption and forgiveness abound for those who choose to look. And the most unexpected is yet to come.",
