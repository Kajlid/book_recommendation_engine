  "description": "Pagan-Fighting. F@cking. F@cking things up. That was my life. That was how I got out of the world I had been raised in. And it was how I intended to keep living my life. That was, of course, until I came across her. The game changer. Kennedy-Hard work. That was pretty much all you could say my life consisted of. It was what got me out of a rough childhood. It was what made me get my first taste of success. Before things went to hell, that is. But it was what was going to get me back on my feet too. So I didn’t need any distractions. Certainly not one that came covered in scars, blood, leather, and in a cloud of cigarette smoke. Yet, there he was. And I was thinking maybe a distraction wouldn’t be that bad, right?* For possible triggers, please visit my website and find the \"triggers\" link on the main navigation bar.",
