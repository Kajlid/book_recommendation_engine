  "description": "Summer 2011. Berlin. Adolf Hitler wakes up in a vacant lot, alive and well.But the world as he once knew it has changed - no Eva Braun, no Nazi party, no war. Hitler barely recognises his beloved Fatherland, now filled with immigrants and run by a woman.People certainly recognise him, albeit as a brilliant, satirical impersonator who refuses to break character. The unthinkable, the inevitable, happens, and the ranting Hitler takes off, goes viral, becomes a YouTube star, gets his own TV show, becomes someone who people listen to. Before long, his greatest challenge becomes convincing people that yes, it really is him, and yes, he really means it.\"Look Who's Back\" is a black satire of modern media-bloated society, seen through the eyes of the FÃ¼hrer himself. Adolf is by turns repellent, sympathetic and hilarious, but always fascinating.",
