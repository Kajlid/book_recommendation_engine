  "description": "IT all began with a vision. It was in the last months of 2003 in the midst of Hwange National Park when Kat the Lioness got a vision at midnight. A huge light dazzled her eyes and in the light appeared an angel in the form of a lion that said:\"Blessed are you Kat, for God has chosen you to be great among lionesses. All generations of lions will consider you blessed.\"Kat was terrified and cleaned her eyes with the back of her hand. She thought she was dreaming but checked herself and found she was awake, she even saw her sisters and her husband Muzi at her side asleep and snoring. She looked again in front of her and found the lion-shaped angel still standing there. Radiant in his glory.",
