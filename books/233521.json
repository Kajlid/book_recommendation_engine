  "description": "See inside Geoffrey's mind in this one of a kind collection of shorts spanning Horror, Science Fiction, Fantasy, Comedy, Friendship, and more. Over twenty stories, in total a novel length collection. All but about six of the stories in the collection aren't available anywhere. More fun than a security inspection! Blazes more entertaining than a root canal. Way cooler than being eaten by a lion.",
