  "description": "Seducer or savior? He came to a small American town - and suddenly nothing was the same. Meek and mild men discovered the raw power of lust. Sensually starved women learned the ecstasy of fulfillment. Icy hearts were melted by the warmth of aroused flesh, and the spirit blossomed in a lush garden of desire that this stranger planted and nurtured.Was he good or evil? Should he be worshipped or destroyed? You will find the extraordinary answer in this, the boldest triumph of Theodore Sturgeon, one of the great ground-breaking writers of our time.",
