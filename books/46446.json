  "description": "(Kirkus Best of 2012 Indie Books List,Independent Publisher [IPPY] 2013 Gold Medal, Best Adult Fiction Ebook) Compressed between the Greatest Generation and the Baby Boom, was the \"Silent Generation.\" Their members were born too late to share in the triumph of the great victory, too early to know only the privilege of the American empire and in too few numbers to assure themselves a proper identity and proper legacy. Despite those attributes, they invented rock and roll, filled the streets in the struggle for racial equality, bled in the heated precipitates of the cold war and opened the doors to the sexual revolution and feminism. Their triumph lay not in their completion of these transitions, but in their survival through them.The Duke Don't Dance follows the adult lives of men and women who made that journey. Their triumph lay not in their completion of these transitions, but in their survival through them. The Duke Don't Dance follows the adult lives of men and women who made that journey.The title refers to a line of graffiti encountered by the protagonists. At first speculating that \"the Duke\"written on the wall refers to John Wayne, Duke Ellington, Duke Snyder or other Dukes of the day, they finally agree to consider it prophetic. No duke, such as used biblically to represent a lord of good or evil, will save their generation. No, they must dance for themselves.",
