  "title": "Of One Heart: Being Single In The LDS World",
  "description": "In the LDS world (or the world of The Church Of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) most adults are married with children. It has only been in the last ten years that being single in the church has become much more common. Unfortunately, marriages are failing everywhere and there are now one third of the adults at church who are single. Whether by divorce, death of a spouse or never married at all, there are challenges to being single in a predominately married world. Challenges Valerie Steimle had never realized until she became single herself when her husband of 25 years suddenly passed away leaving her with nine children at her charge. A daunting task to say the least. This book was written to help all those who are single, all those who have single friends and all those priesthood leaders with single members under their jurisdiction. The book was written to help others understand what it is like to be single and includes writings from other singles on how they feel about being single.",
