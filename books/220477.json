  "description": "There’s bodies. A whole family this time. Trouble is while world-weary and foul-mouthed Superintendent Aaron of the Australian Federal Police would have preferred it was simply some deranged serial killer to be hunted down and dealt with by the local blue, he’s fast realised it’s the feds who’ve been called in because it’s suddenly far more complicated. Terrorism has arrived on Australian shores, and Aaron’s convinced it’s the monster within. A religious coup in Indonesia and a spate of horrific attacks across Australia somehow seem connected as Aaron and rookie partner Sergeant Bram Heijkers uncover a widespread and deeply-rooted conspiracy that stabs at the very heart of a nation and its values. Setting off across the country, Aaron chases the elusive Bryson Raesler and his cohorts, who with help from shadowy agents within senior ranks has stolen a terrible secret the Australian government would only ever bring out in time of national peril. Fighting growing isolation as essential support structures are infiltrated and sabotaged by Raesler’s co-conspirators, it’s a race against the odds to prevent Raesler escaping with Australia’s dread secret and creating havoc and terror on the world stage. A fast-paced, electrifying thriller delving into a murky world of intrigue and suspense.",
