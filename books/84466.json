  "description": "Love. Loyalty. Dope smuggling. At sixty-two, all Christian White wants is a quiet life. But between the Feds trying to close his business and the challenges posed by his open marriage to Carol—his hot, younger, bi wife—peace isn’t remotely on the cards. And when Christian receives a letter from Billy, his old mate and sometime guardian angel from their hippie days, asking him to come to London and help him to collect on a forty-year-old IOU, Christian’s other problems start to look insignifificant. Because the IOU is for two hundred and fifty kilos of charas, high-grade hashish. The hash is in Afghanistan. And Christian owes Billy enough that he’s going to find it very hard to refuse.A smart, sexy, hi-tech thriller loaded with memorable characters and suspenseful scenes, Sutherland’s Rules is one wild ride!“Sutherland’s Rules is an exciting adventure that will keep you turning the pages: fun, fast, fabulously plotted.”—Ken Liu, 2012 Nebula and Hugo Award winner",
