  "description": "Everyone in Manhattan thinks they know everything there is to know about Lucian Prescott. In his mid-forties, he’s a successful businessman, the founder and CEO of one of Manhattan’s largest hospitality companies, the Prescott Group. He’s sexy, rich, and one of the most eligible bachelors in the city. Very few people know just how dangerous he is. Because he’s also the head of the Kings of Hell’s Kitchen, a small, elite group of former mob members who are the lynchpin in Manhattan’s underground organized crime scene. But Lucian has more secrets than just his criminal ties—like the fact that he’s been in love with Olivia Walsh for the past five years. Olivia, who is eighteen years younger than him and happens to be the daughter of Prescott Group’s biggest, most important investor. She’s completely off-limits, but that doesn’t stop him from wanting her. In his arms. His bed. His life. He knows he needs to stay away from her, no matter how he feels about her—or how she feels about him. But staying away becomes impossible when Olivia’s ex—a man almost as dangerous as Lucian—begins stalking her, and he’ll do whatever it takes to keep her safe. He’ll burn down the entire city to protect the only woman he’s ever loved.",
