  "title": "Delta the Dancing Elephant: A Memoir",
  "description": "Delta’s story is told in the first person narrative coercing the reader to anthropomorphize, to empathize, and to put themselves in her shoes, so to speak. An Asian elephant whose family was killed in the late 1920’s, she takes you through seven decades in the life of an individual who is normally not thought of twice: a performing elephant.  Throughout the account are hints of time and history sugar coated by music. Character names are hybrids of real-life noted elephants and elephant-noted people, presenting the reader with a challenge to see and think beyond mere words. From the same children’s book author who was compelled to pen Tyke and the Elephant Angel, this fictitious memoir is designed for young adults and up. It may seem like 'Black Beauty' (Anna Sewell) meets 'Forrest Gump' (Winston Groom) with a twist of 'love story within a bigger story' formula.",
