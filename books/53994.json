  "description": "Cherrye S. Vasquez, Ph.D. designed this Diversity Daybook Journal as a tool to assist children with learning about the similarities and differences of others. Vasquez asserts that when children learn from one another they also learn others are unique, beautiful, and just as important as anyone else.Children will become more diversified in their communities and schools while learning and engaging in constructively productive activities in their own lives.Cherrye S. Vasquez, Ph.D. is hopeful adults (educators and parents) can and will promote diversity awareness among children by role-modeling and creating an atmosphere of respect and care for others. Educators are encouraged to implement appropriate culturally relevant curricula activities in the classroom setting. Parents are encouraged to familiarize and introduce their children to various cultures, and artifacts of diverse groups.Cherrye S. Vasquez, Ph.D. believes diversity awareness can occur in orderly, consistent and systematic practices in our classroom settings. If we look toward this hope, perhaps bullying in our nationâ€™s schools will become a record low.",
