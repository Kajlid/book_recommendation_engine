Years of suppressed heartbreak and disappointment overwhelm her and the fine thread of sanity finally snaps. Consequently, having thrown the entire contents of her house onto the street, she's found by the police, lying on her back under a Christmas tree with an empty bottle of Port and a half-eaten lump of Stilton. Charlotte needs to claw her way back from the brink and start again. But can she build a bigger, brighter, and better existence this time around \"The Defrosting of Charlotte Small\" is wonderfully observed and genuinely funny, mining the glorious seam of black humour that is fast becoming Annabel Giles' trademark.",
