  "title": "Crown Of Darkness",
  "description": "Two young enthusiastic historians Philip and Hannah studying ancient history at University quite by accident stumble on unquestionable evidence that a crown exists which was once owned by a very influential nobleman in Egypt. It is not until after they have stirred the interest in others that had set off to look for the crown that they discovered it also held a curse of unprecedented magnitude, place on it by Satan himself.They try to stop the search but itâ€™s too late, it has been found and the curse has started to work with horrific devastating consequences. At the end it leaves one thinking that the power of evil emulating from the crown is going to be forever with us. It is a force that will never go away and that it would have been best to have left the past undisturbed for all time. One will look at gold in a very different light when they close this book and try to sleep.",
