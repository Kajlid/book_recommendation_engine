If only they knew where to start looking. And if only their future didn’t rest in the shaking hands of Emma Shaw. Blood ties Emma to the fate of the Tréaltha, but she knows she doesn’t have the strength to wield them. With the final battle looming before her, Emma must decide if she can be the Warden the Group needs. Lock and Key is the explosive conclusion to M.A. Nichols’ Tréaltha Series.",
