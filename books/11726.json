  "description": "As a police detective in Bombay, Inspector George Sansi is used to struggling for order in one of the world's most exuberantly chaotic cities. But the mutilated corpse discovered in Bollywood taxes even Sansi's formidable skills. Could the murder have been a cult initiation gone hideously wrong? Was it the work of a serial killer? Was the victim killed as part of a political cover-up? Answering these questions will take Sansi from Bombay's teeming slums to the film community's palaces of excess and the menacing haunts of India's underworld.",
