  "description": "The Draeger brothers are a unique breed for one simple reason. They are identical twins. It is something never happens in the shifter world. But where they might look alike in appearance their personalities differ. Brock is funny, laid back and easygoing, and Drake is hard and dark. They balance each other out perfectly, but the balance gets tipped when Drake gives in to his vengeful side. Together the brothers are a force to be reckoned with. They will do anything and everything to keep their family safe, but when they mate, a choice is laid before them. Give in to the hate, or give in to their hearts.",
