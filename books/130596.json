  "description": "The Fates are missing and all the gods are running amok.  Existential Investigator Valentine Ryan wants nothing more than to be left alone with his scotch, but as a roster of friends, enemies, frenemies, and wilding gods make clear, he really has no choice but to go looking for the errant immortals.  Hired by master-of-the-universe, Michelin Zagat, Ryan embarks on a bizarre journey to uncover the fate of the missing Fates. The fair maidens, Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos, daughters of the night goddess, Nyx, have vanished. No one is left In their absence to spin the thread of each human life, apportion it to render the length, and cut it to determine the manner of death.With the Fates gone, the gods are no longer constrained to follow their own mythology. One-by-one they begin leaving the realm of the gods and seek to wreak havoc among the humans, a cruel fate that only the Fates had prevented. Each encounter with the gods leaves Ryan beaten as he tries to get them to return to their rightful places. And each god tells Ryan the same thing: the Fates are dead.With a cocktail in hand and a quip on his lips, Ryan wrangles gods, battles gangsters, woos a goddess, fights his demons, and maybe saves the world. The story ends with death, but it starts with a dame.  Because it always starts with a dame.-----------------------------------------Read the first 3 chapters here: www.rollingbonesnovel.com",
