  "description": "Duck wants a job. All his friends work in big city banks, and they never stop going on about how much they love it. Duck doesn't think a job in a big city bank sounds very exciting, but he picks one out of the paper, gets an interview, and gets the job. It's not long before he realises that the job is NOT for him. He needs to follow his heart and his dream of being an artist. He quits his job at the bank and makes a decision. He is going to be an artist! He puts all the pictures he has drawn into a portfolio and goes off for another interview. He gets the job! He loves the job!",
