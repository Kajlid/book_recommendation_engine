  "description": "If the Kazak Guardians had a recruiting poster, it would have A select few insane men to fight professional Assassins with super-human abilities. Good medical plan provided.  Because surviving the training program to graduation was dangerous, even the first challenge to gain entrance could get you killed. But training was the easy part. Staying alive afterward was the hard part. Kazaks guarded individuals whose lives were deemed critical to the security of the United States. These individuals attracted fanatics and the best professional Assassins money could buy-Liars who could tell lies you believed, Ghosts who could become nearly invisible, and Illusionists who could appear to be anyone, among others.  But Lynn wanted no other life-the Kazak Guardians gave her life purpose. She had grown up in the foster care system, neglected and abused, at the mercy of people who didn't care. Even when she finally ran away, her freedom wasn't the renewal she had hoped. So when a friend told her about a unique organization that trained individuals to protect VIPs, she knew it was the life for her.  She survived years of training and five deadly challenges to become a Kazak Guardian, and entered a world of extremists and assassins, where each assignment became a deadly contest between Kazak and assassin, with the prize the life of the VIP.  In spite of the danger, she enjoyed every assignment with its interesting people, new environments, challenges, and best of all, the occasional opportunity to pretend to be someone other than a Kazak-a tiger in tabby garb.",
