  "description": "Through the corridors of the Windy City’s criminal courts, single mother Libby Tucker knows exactly how far she’ll go to save her cancer-stricken son’s life. The undefeated defense attorney is prepared to fight, but the cost of this victory requires revisiting old heartache.  Seven years ago, Libby had a one night stand with Aidan Palowski that ended in a pregnancy and him deserting her at their college graduation. Libby has worked her backside bare for everything she’s attained, while Aidan has been indulged since he landed in a pile of Gold Coast money. Libby fears asking Aidan to live up to his biological duty could jeopardize the only thing the jock worships: his celebrity baseball career. But when Aidan learns about his son’s desperate need, it pricks open the wound he’s carried since he abandoned Libby and the child.  All Libby needs is a little anonymous DNA, but Aidan wants to recapture all he lost the day he walked away from her. There’s more to settle between Aidan and Libby than heartache, redemption, and forgiveness because Libby might not be able to save her son without sacrificing her own heart.",
