  "title": "The Aha! Moment: The Guide to Creating a Game Changer",
  "description": "Really, why aren't people more successful? If you've ever had that idea that made you go 'Aha!' or made that proverbial light bulb go off in your head, you've probably had an idea that was a game-changer: the type of idea that makes life better, easier or more enjoyable for all who use it, and makes you rich and successful by implementing it. We all have great ideas at one point in time or another, but few of us have confidence and know-how to follow through with the idea to completion. In each chapter, I lay out the process of preparing yourself to be a game-changer, and show you how to take an idea from concept to its complete manifest form.",
