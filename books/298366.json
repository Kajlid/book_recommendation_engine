  "title": "Stories from the Underground: Our Sexual Adventures as a Married Couple",
  "description": "Is sex really so important for a happy marriage?This book follows a real couple’s story along nine years of sexual exploration in their attempt to answer this one simple question. From almost completely losing any sexual intimacy, to unveiling new aspects of their sexuality and up to putting into reality their wildest fantasies, John and Jane go through a series of self-discoveries, indecent proposals and unconventional erotic encounters.By no means intended to be a guide on how to revolutionize your sex life, this book is rather a genuine recollection of clumsy, funny, surprising sexual stories and the colorful characters who made them possible. It’s full of truths that no erotic movie or “professional” would ever reveal.It is a read you’ll greatly enjoy whether you’re seriously considering getting into the swingers /alternative sex lifestyle, you’re just curious to find out more about those who’ve tried it or you simply cannot resist an unconventional memoir. The two voices - John’s and Jane’s – are beautifully intertwined making this book uniquely entertaining.",
