  "description": "Paranormal HistoricalA mail order bride, Mariana comes to America with little more than determination and her pretty face. But the man who bought her doesn't seem to want her—until he sees her naked. She can't resist his passion, but will he throw her out when he's done with her?John asked Mariana's parents to return his money; he never expected a beauty like Mariana to appear on his doorstep. The passion she shows him in the dark of night can't possibly be for real. Yet the more he pushes her into outrageous, perverse acts, the more she encourages him to go one step further. He does things to Mariana that he's never even dared to try with a prostitute, and she begs for still more.Their lovemaking is amazing, but Mariana wants more than passion—she wants the love hidden beneath John's bitter scars. When a ghostly presence in the house tries to drive her away, she has to fight for her right to stay in John's home...and to continue bedding the beast.Publisher’s Bedding the Beast was previously released under the title A Valentine’s Bride, but has been substantially revised and expanded for this edition. It contains graphic language, sexual content, and situations that may be objectionable to some readers.",
