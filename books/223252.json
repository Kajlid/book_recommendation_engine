  "description": "Controversy and Inconsistencies are thieves of holiday joy for Keri...is there any hope for a happy holiday season?For as long as she can remember, Keri Jackson has despised the hype and commercialism around Christmas-especially with the controversy over the time of Jesus's birth. Will she get her wish and be free of the angst to truly enjoy Christmas this year?Jeremy Hinton thinks Keri is a highly intelligent, deeply emotional, and intensely complex woman and he's as fascinated by her aversion to Christmas as he is of the woman herself. A devout Christian at heart, he's studied all of the world's religions and homeopathic healing modalities. But when a rare bacterial infection threatens her life, will all of his faith and training be for naught?Fans of near death experiences will enjoy this woman's mystical journey into spiritual Truth.",
