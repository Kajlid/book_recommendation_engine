  "description": "Thumbwars is a fictional story about Richard, a young American adult who, believing himself responsible for his brother's shooting, flees to Ghana, his parents' native African country. Before leaving home, Richard ends his relationship with his girlfriend, Sheila. Through the interplay of dreams and flashbacks, he confronts not only his problematic family dynamics, but also a life-altering romantic liaison with his white female English teacher. Believing himself to be James Dean, Richard finds false comfort in a fleeting view of himself. He, in turn, projects an image of his English teacher upon Sheila, preventing him from “seeing” and loving her. In Africa, Richard abandons the mythical perceptions he holds of both himself and Sheila. Empowered with both a new conception of his self-image and his own definition of love, Richard returns home with the hope he and Sheila will be able to reconcile their differences.",
