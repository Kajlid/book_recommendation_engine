  "description": "In the modern retelling of Edgar Allan Poe's 'William Wilson' by the author of 'The Old drift,' a young black man's paranoia escalates as he is followed, challenged, and terrorized by a doppelgänger bent on sabotaging his life.Ever since high school, somebody's been playing the echo game on Will Williams. A look-alike with the same tattoos and the same name has been following him. Starting by implicating Will in petty crimes, and escalating to offenses with serious prison terms, he's undermined every attempt Will has made to get his life on track. Now, drifting from city to city, Will's doing everything in his power to outrun his shadow.Will Williams is part of Disorder, a collection of six short stories of living nightmares, chilling visions, and uncanny imagination that explore a world losing its balance in terrifying ways. Each piece can be read or listened to in a single disorienting sitting.©2019 Namwali Serpell (P)2019 Brilliance Publishing, Inc., all rights reserved.",
