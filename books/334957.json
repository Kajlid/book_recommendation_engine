  "description": "It all started with a letter. An editor of a local newspaper in California receives a mysterious diagram for a nuclear bomb in an envelope with no return address. On the opposite coast, a reporter for The Washington Post thinks there’s something more to the apparent suicide of a high-ranking White House official. Both newspapermen end up involved with scandals that bring into focus issues of freedom of speech and the press versus national security in a high-stakes race to uncover who is really pulling the strings in the government—and soon find out the dangerous lengths such figures will go to in order to keep their machinations from the eyes of the public.Tetsuo Takashima was born in 1949.
