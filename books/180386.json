  "description": "The O. Henry Prize Stories 2015 gathers twenty of the best short stories of the year, selected from thousands published in literary magazines. The winning stories span the globe—from the glamorous Riviera to an Eastern European shtetl, from a Native American reservation to a tiny village in Thailand. But their characters are universally recognizable and utterly compelling, whether they are ex-pats in Africa, migrant workers crossing the Mexican border, Armenian immigrants on the rough streets of East Hollywood, or pioneers in nineteenth-century Idaho. Accompanying the stories are the editor’s introduction, essays from the eminent jurors on their favorite stories, observations from the winning writers on what inspired them, and an extensive resource list of magazines. Finding Billy White FeatherPERCIVAL EVERETT The SealsLYDIA DAVIS Kilifi CreekLIONEL SHRIVER The Happiest Girl in the Whole USAMANUEL MUÑOZ A Permanent Member of the FamilyRUSSELL BANKS A Ride out of PhraoDINA NAYERI OwlEMILY RUSKOVICH           The Upside-Down WorldBECKY HAGENSTON The Way Things Are GoingLYNN FREED The History of HappinessBRENDA PEYNADO The Kingsley Drive ChorusNAIRA KUZMICH Word of MouthEMMA TÖRZS CabinsCHRISTOPHER MERKNER My Grandmother Tells Me This StoryMOLLY ANTOPOL The Golden RuleLYNNE SHARON SCHWARTZ About My AuntJOAN SILBER Ba BaboonTHOMAS PIERCE Snow BlindELIZABETH STROUT I, BuffaloVAUHINI VARA Birdsong from the RadioELIZABETH MCCRACKEN For author interviews, photos, and more, go to www.ohenryprizestories.com",
