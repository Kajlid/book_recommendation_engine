  "title": "Murder in Mind",
  "description": "Harry Sinton is a murderer. He knows it. There can be no doubt about it. His mind is filled with fearful knowledge, his trembling hands fouled by invisible blood, his soul reeks of murder.And yet - though murder is the most vivid of crimes - he cannot recall any of the details of the crime he is sure he committed. His killing of a drunken poet is blanketed in a fog of amnesia.Frantically - but with desperate cunning - he seeks to discover the facts surrounding his disastrous act in order to establish an appropriate alibi. His heady investigations take him on a feverish chase through the literary and Bohemian circles of London. With every step he takes, he comes closer to the dreadful truth that lies in wait.As he did in The Second Curtain, Roy Fuller is able to weave enormous suspense out of human fears and emotions. His characters are extraordinarily real, moving in that sinister borderland between the psychological novel and the thriller.",
