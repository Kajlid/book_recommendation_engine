  "description": "''Studio Thinking [is] a vision not only of learning in the arts but what could be learning most anywhere.'' -- From the Foreword by David N. Perkins, Professor of Education, Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Senior Co-Director of Harvard Project Zero''Hetland and her colleagues reveal dozens of practical measures that could be adopted by any arts program, inside or outside of the school.This is a bold new step in arts education.'' -- David R. Olson, Professor Emeritus, University of Toronto''Will be at the top of the list of essential texts in arts education. I know of no other work in art education with this combination of authenticity and insight.'' -- Lars Lindstram, Stockholm Institute of EducationMany people believe that art education is important, but few can say exactly why. Here, at last, are the results of the first in-depth research on the habits of mind that are instilled by studying art-habits the authors argue have positive impacts on student learning across the curriculum. Studio Thinking provides art teachers with a research-based language for describing what they intend to teach and what students learn. This language will help advocates explain arts education to policymakers, help art teachers develop and refine their teaching practices, and help educators in other disciplines learn from existing practices in arts education.",
