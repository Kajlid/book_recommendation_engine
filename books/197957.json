  "description": "Matthew  My brother and sister found their calling and people to share it with for the rest of their lives. Our parents haven’t said a thing, but I can read it on their faces. What are you doing with your life, Matthew? I’ve always been a songwriter but can no longer find the words. Everyone around me thinks I’m where I am in life because of my parents. I’m at a crossroads in my life and I don’t know which way to turn. I don’t define my sexuality, I do what feels right. Love? Well, that is one melody I have yet to find the right notes to. Until them…  Thea  My childhood glittered with the lights of Hollywood while my adult life has been filled with the darkness of my ghosts and addictions. But all that is behind me and I am working on spinning the pain of my past into the promise of my future. Love? Well, that’s one addiction I have not yet dared to fool with. Until them…  Tristan  I’m running from a life where my future was decided for me. What to wear. Which company to manage. Who to marry. One day, I snapped, and I haven’t been back since. Now I manage my own businesses and I am who I want to be. But behind closed doors, I am still alone and I still long for things that I’ve been taught to hate. Love? Well, that’s one merger I’ve never braved. Until them…  Warning: This book contains two sexy hunks and is not recommended for the faint of heart. This is a long, thought-provoking read which will work through the angst of finding love amidst past hurts and the pain associated with not belonging, not fitting in.",
