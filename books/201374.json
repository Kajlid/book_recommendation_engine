  "description": "I, Denis Cooke, take thee, Redford DeMoss, to be my lawful husband... No, wait...I did that already -- three years ago in a Vegas chapel after one too many Long Island Iced Teas. I married a hunky U.S. Marine I'd met only hours before. (The uniform did it.)The wedding night -- week -- was spectacular. Then Redford went back to the Gulf. And I went back to my real life as a New York City financial planner...and filed for an annulment.I'm dating Barry the TV producer these days, but I think about Redford...a lot. And now, thanks to an upcoming IRS audit, I'm about to see ex-husband again. So why am I flustered? He's probably married, and I have -- um, what's his name. It's not as if Redford plans to take me back...or take me -- gulp -- to bed.Besides, I'd never make the same mistake twice. Not even my favorite one...",
