  "description": "For once those Renegade Souls boys and their old ladies are going to have a peaceful Christmas. Or so the plan goes.  Join Rider and Zara while they host the first Renegade Souls MC holiday party amid her pregnancy aches and Rider’s stress to rid his town of the bratva once and for all. All he wants is to make his girl happy with the help of family and some dirty shenanigans. Maybe this was the year she’d say yes to his proposal.  Preacher and Ruby are learning how to be parents while dealing with someone from Ruby’s past. Is it a seasonal time of goodwill and forgiveness? One thing’s for sure; Preacher is always what his festive angel needs.  Grinder discovers the hard way what it means to get on the wrong side of his explosive wife. There’s nothing quite like the holidays for love and a volatile temper as Luxe is more than happy to show her boy.  Hawk and Gia are awaiting the pitter patter of tiny sociopath feet. Is happiness about to be ripped out of his hands just when he’d finally got it? Christmas brings surprises to the VP’s household from unpredicted sources.  Who said Christmas time can’t be dirty?   This novella is intended as a catch-up for the first four couples so far featured in the Renegade Souls MC series and not a standalone. It’s meant to be read as an add-on and runs along the same timeline as Finally Winter.   Can you handle the outlaw festive mush?",
