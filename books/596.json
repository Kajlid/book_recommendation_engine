  "description": "Book two in the Neo's Realm Series For over four hundred years, werewolf mates, Kern and Haig fought and loved side by side. Although they've had a few rocky moments along the way, their love for each other has never wavered. That is, until Kern is kidnapped and forced to mate with the outsider, Audric. Hurt and confused, Haig runs from Neo's Realm and, most especially, Kern. How is Haig supposed to accept another man in his marriage, especially when that man isn't a werewolf at all but a vampire? Centuries spent as the whipping boy to the other vampires in his coven have left Audric hungry for affection. His goal isn't to come between the mated pair of werewolves, but to become part of their family. Unfortunately, his yearning for love and companionship soon threatens to damage that which he desired. Kern hates that his unwilling actions have hurt the only person he's ever loved, but with Haig gone, he's left alone to introduce Audric to a new life on the vineyard. Kern didn't expect to like the puny vampire, but Audric begins to ease his way under Kern's skin. When Haig returns after a two month absence, Kern is afraid his newfound love for Audric might tear apart his marriage with Haig. Three men, two species, one bed. Is it possible to put aside jealousies and establish a new kind of family or will this forced union destroy everything?",
