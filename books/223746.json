  "title": "Degranon: A Science Fiction Adventure",
  "description": "This revised version of Duane Simolke's science fiction adventure Degranon features more gay characters and a sharper focus on diversity themes. On the planet Valchondria, no illness exists, gay marriage is legal, and everyone is a person of color. However, a group called \"the Maintainers\" carefully monitors everyone's speech, actions, and weight; the Maintainers also force so-called \"colorsighted\" people to hide their ability to see in color. The brilliant scientist Taldra loves her twin gay sons and thinks of them as the hope for Valchondria's future, but one of them becomes entangled in the cult of Degranon, while the other becomes stranded on the other side of a doorway through time. Can they find their way home and help Taldra save their world?  “A must read.” –Joe Wright, for StoneWall Society“It's a very good story.” –HomoMojo“In Degranon, author Duane Simolke establishes his voice in gay genre writing.” –X-Factor“A reminder of the danger of fanaticism.” –Mark Kendrick, author of Stealing Some Time “A fascinating scifi excursion.” –Ronald L. Donaghe, author of Cinátis“DEGRANON is sci-fi that warrants the attention of any serious aficionado, gay or straight, fascinated by alien worlds that mirror our own world.” –William Maltese, author of Beyond Machu",
