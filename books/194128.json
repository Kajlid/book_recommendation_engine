Kila claims her politically powerful brother has sexually abused her, and Cor has always been a sucker for helping the helpless.The plan doesn't include Cor falling in love with Kila, but as the pair struggles to reach Kila's homeworld, pursued by assassins from the Guild, Cor finds her inexplicable attraction to Kila growing stronger. There's a job to do, and personal involvement with her employer is an unwelcome distraction. Then again, so is sexual frustration.",
