  "description": "The veil between the worlds has been torn, and terrible powers are coming through...A magician has caused a rift in the fabric of the universe, and platonic ideals are now roaming the English countryside, taking the form of giant animals and generally wreaking havoc on the small town of Smetham. While others flee, a young student named Anthony Durrant realizes that it is up to him to face the monstrous powers before they destroy the world.The Place of the Lion is one of Charles Williams' most beloved novels. C.S. Lewis called reading it \"one of the major literary events of my life\". Along with Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien, Williams was member of the Inklings, an informal group of writers in Oxford, England, who changed the world with their mythopoetic vision.",
