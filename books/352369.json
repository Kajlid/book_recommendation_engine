It's enough to make fairy very cranky. Eventually he learns to control his curse. Kind of. He can put the book that calls him in the right hands, and heâ€™s getting a lot more action out of it! But when Danu catches wind of it, she conspires to keep him downtrodden. Can Fionn find a way to survive, and have time to fall in love?Compilation of the Chaser series Fionn 'o the Fae.",
