  "title": "The High House",
  "description": "Evenmere, the High House, a Victorian mansion of infinite size, is the mechanism that runs the universe; the lamps must be lit or the stars fail; the clocks must be wound lest Time cease; the Balance between Order and Chaos must be preserved of Existence crumbles. When Carter Anderson finds himself Steward of Evenmere, he must learn, before it is too late, the strange rules of the house; he must travel its winding corridors and secret passages to the myriad countries lying within its walls. He has little time to act; the Anarchists are seizing control of the house; the Gnawlings are massing; the Black River is rising; the Eternity Clock is running down. His actions will determine the fate of Reality. But his enemies are strong, and the Room of Horrors is never far from him.  Winner of the Compton Crook/Stephen Tall award, nominated as Best Fantasy of the Year by the International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts, and a finalist for the Mythopoeic (Aslan) Award.",
