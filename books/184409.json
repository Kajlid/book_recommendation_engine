  "title": "The Story of Crass",
  "description": "This is the b format edition of the critically acclaimed biography. It is an amazing account of the subversive band that took punk to the limit! Crass were the anarcho-punk face of a revolutioary movement founded by radical left-wingers, Penny Rimbaud and Gee Vaucher. Not just another iconoclastic band, Crass was a musical, social and political phenomenon. Teetotal health freaks who were never photographed and remained contemptuous of conventional pop stardom, their members explored and finally exhausted the possibilities of punk-led anarchy. Here, members have collaborated on telling the whole Crass story giving access to many never-before seen photos and interviews. They tell the stories of putting out their own records, films and magazines and setting up a series of hoaxes that were dutifully covered by the world's press.",
