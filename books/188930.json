  "description": "In this book you will be under the spell of imagination that is truly impressive. But, more than that: you will fall in love with Barbara Goldberg's syntax. The way her sentence works against her line-breaks, creating Fireworks, is a fairy tale in and of itself. Her poems are magical, not because they contain princesses and ravens and thieves of eggs. They are magical because their music grabs us and won't let us be. The secret to true music cannot be understood. It can only be applauded. - Ilya Kaminsky",
