  "description": "Uncovering a wealth of lore from cultures around the world, Shahrukh Husain has amassed a collection that will delight and entice. Through subtle reworking, these erotic tales are given new expression while remaining faithful to the original texts. From the rapturous sexual awakening of Inanna and the bittersweet passion of Krishna and Radha, to Hera√¢ s betrayal of Zeus and the adulterous passion of Lancelot and Guenevere, this anthology of sexual encounters ranges from the holy, passionate, and dutiful to the forbidden, earthy, and humorous. Shahrukh Husain was born and brought up in Pakistan and is a practicing psychotherapist; among her previous books are The Goddess, Handsome Heroines, Daughters of the Moon, and The Virago Book of Witches.",
