  "description": "And just like that, Calan lost his powers and his heart.   Calan lives and breathes the law of the Order of Luxis, never distracted by the modern world or its temptations. That is until his mission to destroy an unholy dark entity brings him to Emma, a beautiful store clerk with penetrating eyes. With one look, she makes Calan question everything which may lead to, not only his undoing, it may be the worlds.  Now Emma is entangled in a Prophecy that could unleash hell on earth and she refuses to sit on the sidelines or keep her hands off Calan. In between fighting his new and all-consuming desire for Emma, Calan must protect her from his enemies, blood-thirsty creatures from a hell dimension, but above all he must save her from himself. If Emma ever discovered Calan was the true monster, she would never have so readily stayed by his side and she certainly wouldnâ€™t continue to look at him like she wanted to eat him alive.",
