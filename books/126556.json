  "description": "Jerry thought he had an easy score to make some cash. Too bad for him, he failed to factor in the resolve of the guys he burgled . They weren't the sort of fellas the average thief would ever think twice about stealing from, but that was about to change. After the LVPD produced zero results, these fellas took matters into their own hands. A private detective, road trip, and duct tape seemed like the best course of action, and boy howdy, the action ensued. Ol' Jerry never stood a chance. What happened after that was a comedy of errors that will keep you wondering what next? If you've ever craved revenge, this story will strike a chord that will have you singing along, and laughing your guts out!",
