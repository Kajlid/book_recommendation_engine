  "description": "Kyran Harbor is everything I’m not. Rich. Popular. A superstar football player who’s awfully broody for someone who has it all. Basically, he’s a preppy jock who hates me. Oh, and he’s also my stepbrother. That’s right. We’re stuck together, sharing a school, a house… A bathroom. Honestly, I wouldn’t care… If he wasn’t such an uptight control-freak who messes with me just because we’re different. I had every intention of avoiding him when we got to college… Until abrupt misfortune forces us both into a compromising position. Now the grouchy jerk I was hoping to evade might be the only person who can help me out of it. Avi Vega is everything I despise.A dreamer. A flake. An artist who smokes too much weed and thinks aliens exist. And by some sick cosmic joke, he’s now my stepbrother, following me on what should’ve been my escape plan. It was already a disaster. Add a sudden financial disruption to the mix, and let’s just say my options are heavily limited. If I want to stay an all-star quarterback on the way to the NFL, I’ll need to do something drastic. Unfortunately for me, and my desperate desire for control, the perpetually smiling stoner has a plan. Maybe we can stop hating each other just enough to pull this off. As long as we remember we’re only doing it… for the fans. ** For The Fans is a full-length standalone MM forbidden romance with an HEA. This book contains sensitive subject matter that could make some readers uncomfortable. Please heed foreword warnings and proceed with caution.",
