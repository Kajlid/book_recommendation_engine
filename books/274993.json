  "title": "Horse Country: A Celebration of Country Music and The Love of Horses",
  "description": "This stunning book brings together two subjects that millions keep close to their country music and horses. With heartwarming stories set in a must-have four-color design, Horse Country visits the biggest stars from the Grand Ole Opry and beyond, inviting readers into the private world they share with their beloved horses.   Horses have always been the symbol of the cowboy, and many of the stars featured here—both legends and today’s hottest stars, from George Jones, Charlie Daniels, Lynn Anderson, Tanya Tucker, Brad Paisley, and Willie Nelson to Hal Ketchum, Chris Cagle, Eddie Montgomery, and Todd Fritsch—grew up dreaming of being cowboys (or cowgirls). Today, horses are their escape from the chaos of the world. Based on exclusive interviews, each story—funny, touching, and uplifting—is accompanied by personal photos, including some of each artist with his or her horse.",
