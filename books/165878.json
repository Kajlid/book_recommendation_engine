Ugly rumors, emotional temptation, and a violent death swirl around, poisoning the innocence of their relationship.As Mary struggles with her own mortality, she tries to decide what’s best for Jane. But Jane Jackson has a mind of her own. A mind that is going to lead her into some difficult places and hard choices before she finally discovers what’s best for herself.Bett Norris gets up every morning at five and writes.
