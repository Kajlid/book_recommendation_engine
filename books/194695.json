But when Hugh feels that the sea has betrayed him, his whole existence is thrown out of whack. Hell-bent on settling the score, Hugh takes his revenge to the extreme, jeopardizing not only himself, but his family in the process. Ultimately, That Salty Air is story about change, and learning the price for trifling with the natural progression of things.",
