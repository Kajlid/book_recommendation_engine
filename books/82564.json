  "description": "Levi Levy has no idea how powerful his thoughts are and that his life depends upon them. That’s because thought-sifting isn’t something that’s taught in schools in the Earth Dimension. But everything changes when Levi is invited to participate in a remarkable program in the 11th Dimension, and he begins to discover not only the secret to getting exactly what he wants from life, but the true meaning of magic. From the unexpected way he enters the dimension, to the thrilling curriculum and eccentric faculty at his unconventional school, Levi finds himself questioning everything he’s learned about life, and closer to unraveling his true identity.",
