  "description": "***NOTE TO READERS: If you read the reviews, it will spoil the plot twist*** Bought. Conditioned.  My name is Blaire. I'm head of security to a man who controls the Russian underworld in Europe. His name is Maksim and he's my master. He bought me ten years ago and conditioned me with brutality to worship and protect him. And I have protected him. I've slain everyone who has tried to do him harm. Everyone but a man he loans me to; a man who threatens to break me and everything I believe in.  You're going to need a strong stomach and a strong heart to follow my story, because take my word for it, it's no fairy tale.",
