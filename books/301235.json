  "title": "Burke and Hare: The Year of the Ghouls",
  "description": "One of the world's most gruesome and notorious criminal partnerships ran its horrific course in Edinburgh during the year 1828. Many myths surround the case of Burke and Hare, and several important questions remain unanswered. In this re-investigation the author seeks to set the record straight and present a complete and accurate account of the activities of the two ruthless serial killers and their culpable associates. What were the circumstances which allowed Burke and Hare to carry out their rupulsive trade undetected for so long and at the cost of so many innocent lives? What were the roles of their common-law wives and the medical students who aided and abetted them? Above all, what should be the final judgement on Dr. Robert Knox, the distinguished teacher of anatomy whose dissecting table was the final resting place of many victims. As the sordid tale unfolds, we discover the truth about a uniquely abhorrent climate of unprincipled arrogance in high society and fiendish predatoriness in low life, each dependent on the other.",
