  "description": "The TSA liked having fresh agents on the job with a clear mind and steady hand. Time travel wasn’t for the faint of heart. The pay was good enough, but as Agent Scrooby decided long ago, even if he didn’t get paid for it, the thrill alone was payment enough. Then again, the TSA realised they couldn’t afford to have disgruntled employees with the power of God at their fingertips, so the pay was very, very good. Things happen at a certain time in a certain way, which in a sense, is what it’s all about. If it didn’t, then things would be completely different. Johnathan Scrooby was extremely tense. His job at the Time Saving Agency was a tough one. Billions of lives depended on him not screwing up. Once, he screwed up in only a small way and people wore those little yellow smiley faces on t-shirts for decades afterwards. And that was just a small screw up.  A week ago, the American War of Independence was fought in Mexico. Yesterday Napoleon managed to dig a tunnel across the English Channel, invaded London and everybody at the Agency ended up speaking French for a while. Sorting that out had been… well, challenging. Mon dieu.Something smelled funny in the anals of History. Things were not as they were supposed to be. Someone somewhere was tinkering with the works. And it fell to him to go back and fix it or who knows what might happen this time.",
