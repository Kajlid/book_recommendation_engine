  "description": "Taking a road trip across country is something that Evan Pierce has always wanted to do. What he doesnâ€™t expect is to get involved in a gang shooting in Denver, or ending up in the hospital for the next three months. When he wakes up from his coma everything is different. His dreams are someone else's reality, visions of past events. When Evan teams up with private detective Chase Hansen, who's in charge of finding a missing girl, sparks fly between them. What started out as a road trip might have turned Evan's life into a mess, but it may also give him a sense of purpose, a new home, good friends, and a lover.",
