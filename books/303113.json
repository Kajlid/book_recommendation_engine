  "description": "Author Sheila McGraw is best known for her children's books, but she believes that life is too short to stick to just one genre. With her new mystery/thriller novel The Knife Thrower's Wife, she hops out of the kid-lit sandbox and into the grown-ups' hot tub. In McGraw's polished, lively, domestic-suspense novel, illustrator Julia Green believes she’s living the American dream in suburban Houston, until she begins having sleepwalking nightmares featuring her husband, Austin, as a knife thrower with scantily clad Julia strapped to his target. And Austin’s aim is regrettably poor.Julia paints scenes from her dreams, and in analyzing them, realizes that what her friend, Trix, said is true, that ‘she doesn’t see what is right in front of her’. Soon, as Julia questions her lifestyle and state of mind, her observations light the wick on an explosive cache of suspicions and repressed secrets.When an unexpected tragedy occurs, Julia becomes the focus of the media and police, and she must cast off her submissive persona, find inner strength, and navigate treacherous waters to her long-overdue awakening.",
