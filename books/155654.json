  "description": "How can a boy succeed where an army has failed? Tjaden, a young man who aspires to be an Elite soldier, blames himself when Elora’s beautiful face is disfigured by a bandersnatch. Elora hides behind her scars, feeling unlovable in a world that only confirms her doubts. Before Tjaden has a chance to convince her that scars don’t matter, an even more terrifying monster comes between them—the Jabberwock. Tjaden must risk his life not only to prove his love to Elora but to save her life. If the secrets of the vorpal sword fail, so will Tjaden. Completely revised, with interior illustration and 100 pages of new material, this is the novel version, released in 2014.",
