  "description": "The Detour is a story of Murder, Corruption and abuse of Power. The backdrop is 2014 America. A young man loses his job then takes a drive to clear his mind and regain his direction in life. A Detour and the hands of fate pit him against ruthless adversaries that are versed in misdirection and deception. These individuals are devoid of any moral compass. They will protect their wealth, beliefs and ideals by any means necessary.They are armed, dangerous and with considerable power and influence. They have an agenda and will not tolerate anyone interfering with this agenda. Dan Icor is the only person that stands between these men and their goal.Although the corruption extends to factions within the Federal Government, Dan Icor is intelligent and resourceful. He has an extremely dangerous and bold plan. Unarmed and outmanned Dan Icor is willing to sacrifice everything for his perception of moral justice.Dan Icor is one ordinary man drawn into a perilous situation. He must use all of his assets and mental faculties to challenge a stacked deck against adversaries willing to murder to further their agenda. The story takes place in an environment that discourages independent thought and American exceptionalism. One man can make a difference. Dan Icor is that one man.I have left this description vague because I did not want to include any spoilers. I think this story is a vision of America in 2014.As the Author, I have always enjoyed stories in which one person is reluctantly forced to face seemingly insurmountable odds. I hope that this story is true to that genre. But most of all I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it and presenting it to you.",
