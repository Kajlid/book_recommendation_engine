  "description": "“Outside a fall storm raged over the forgotten underground bunker that contained a forgotten young man.”What is a fourteen-year old boy to do when he is thrown out of his home for the “apparently unforgivable sin of kissing another boy?” Whatever it takes to survive. This is exactly what Robert has done for the past four years, despite the odds against him. Now eighteen and a master of survival on the streets, thanks to the teachings of the other street kids he has met over the years, Robert has decided he wants something more. He’s determined to get off the streets for good and actually live a normal life. But first he must find a way to live through the coming dangers of his fourth upper Midwest winter on the streets. His strong faith and strict, if sometimes at odds with the law, moral code show him through the most difficult of days and even points him toward an unexpected love he wasn’t even looking for. What Robert fears most, however, is losing this chance at life and love when he reveals the truth about his time on the streets. After all he is damaged goods, and he knows it.",
