  "description": "Jonathon Turner is going to be the death of me. Maybe not the death of me…but my panties for sure! They seem to disintegrate the moment he touches me. Looks at me. Smiles at me. Talks to me. It’s more than physical. He’s breaking through an impenetrable wall. There’s a problem though—he’s younger than me. Six. Years. Younger. Let’s not forget he’s also one of my brother’s best friends.Oh, the other problem I forgot to mention… I never wanted to fall in love again. But you know what they say….never say never. Love Again is Book four in the Cowboys and Angels Series",
