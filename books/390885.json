Carter’s SUV rolls, and Genesis finds herself injured, lying on the pavement. Just before she slips into the darkness an unfamiliar voice calls out to her, promising everything will be fine.His name is Seth, and he’s the Guardian assigned to protect her.When Genesis begins having bizarre visions, the Guardians believe she could be useful to them. To Seth, this means stepping into the middle of an epic battle between angels and demons. Even with supernatural protection, there’s no guarantee he can keep Genesis safe, something that's becoming more important to him by the day.The line between reality and the celestial becomes so blurred that Genesis can't decide who’s real and who’s otherworldly, and who's good and who's evil.",
