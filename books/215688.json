Private investigator Alynna Chase is drawn in to the world of werewolf shifter clans when she encounters charming and sexy Lycan, Alex Westbrooke.  For centuries, werewolf shifters have moved among human society undetected, hiding in plain sight. The New York clan, hiding behind the powerful Fenrir Corporation, has ruled the East Coast for over two centuries, holding great power and position in both human and Lycan hierarchy.  Alynna suddenly finds herself in the center of this secretive society world when her true heritage is revealed – a full-blooded Lycan, born of the fabled True Mate pairing between her human mother and powerful Alpha father. Drawn deeper into their world, she feels a magnetic pull towards Alex.  As Alynna takes her place in Lycan high society, Alex knows he could never have her. He's a newcomer to New York and a member of the current Alpha’s security team, making her beyond his reach. But the attraction between them is too powerful, and he risks everything to have her.  However, a threat to the clan and Alynna’s life draws them closer together, and Alex will do anything to protect her, even risk getting too close and defying Lycan hierarchy.  With so many things at stake, will their affair end in disaster or have these two lonely souls found what they’ve been looking for?",
