  "description": "What do you feed a trapeze family to keep them up in the air? A fire eater with a penchant for hot sauce? Or a lion with a gourmet palate? How do you satisfy a sweet-toothed human cannonball who's outgrowing his cannon?Find out what keeps these performers juggling, balancing, and entertainingâ€•meals prepared by their tireless chef! Poems from this jolly cook give a glimpse of his unusual perspective, from delightful to downright funny. Enjoy a front-row seat for this whimsical look at circus life that just might make you hungry! Kate Hosfords clever rhymes and unique characters shine in this collection of poems, giving a fresh, funny perspective on circus life: the chef's perspective. Through a variety of poetry forms, Hosford introduces a memorable lineup of circus performers and their dietary quirks--flaming hot sauce for the fire eater, a strict diet for the tightrope walker, ostrich a la mode for the gourmet lion, and more. Cosei Kawa's rich, offbeat illustrations bring each performer to life.",
