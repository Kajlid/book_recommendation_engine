  "description": "A MM MPREG romance I’ll never work for ornery, pigheaded Ace Donovan, even if he does titillate me like no alpha has before.  Cassidy O’Neil is an omega with style. He’s a fashion journalist waiting for his time to shine. When he walks out on his idea-stealing boss, he has no choice. He goes to The Keeper, a dying newspaper with nutty journalists run by a dinosaur; hot, dominant, stubborn alpha Ace Donovan.  Ace is The Keeper’s editor-in-chief. He’s old school. He writes real, hard-hitting news, not shallow fluff. That’s why he can’t stand Cassidy, with his model looks and shallow persona. Cass is a whirlwind. He’s trying to take over, but Ace will gladly show him who’s boss in The Keeper office. Between the sheets, too.  Can they join forces to keep The Keeper afloat, or will their chemistry blow a hole in the struggling ship? Can they stay sane through their lovable coworkers’ chaos? Will they end up in bed or in battle?  This is the first book in The Keeper Omega series. Get ready for red-hot chemistry and lots of laughs! This book is about 38,000 words and has a HEA. 18+ readers only please! This book contains occasional strong language, MPREG, and hot, spicy grownup stuff.
