  "description": "At seven Olivia Woodson had already learned she was a supernormal, someone with super powers who must protect normals. When she witnesses her supernormal mother die fighting a supervillian, fear and guilt over not saving her mother drive Olivia to cut off all contact with her mother’s family subsequently rejecting her destiny as a supernormal. At fourteen, all she wants is to live her life as a teenager with her normal father. And maybe grow up to be an environmental lawyer or a photojournalist. However, destiny has funny way of boomeranging. When Olivia accompanies her boyfriend, Jack, on an errand and gets caught in the middle of a bank robbery, she must choose between using her dormant supernormal powers or watching the robbers kill her boyfriend. Olivia’s powers awaken, saving the day, but she tells herself this is the only time she’ll ever use them. Once used, her powers refuse to be contained, forcing Olivia to do what she dreads most – connect with the supernormal side of her family. Though Olivia rejected them seven years earlier, the Brighthalls agree to help her.",
