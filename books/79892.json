Emotional involvement with clients is strictly forbidden. Only, he's never had a client like Winnie Bellamy. The waiflike heiress is a beguiling blend of innocence and sexuality. Larkin knows the dangers of getting too emotionally involved, but when Winnie obviously needs him—personally and professionally—how can he say no? The vulnerable beauty makes him long for what he can't have. And suddenly Larkin's ready to break all his own rules.",
