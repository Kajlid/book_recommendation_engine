  "description": "When dark jealousies surface on the French Riviera during a Rugby team reunion, Chief Inspector Daniel Jacquot suspects that someone is out for revenge. Marc Dombasle is a successful businessman and multi-millionaire. He was also the captain of the French Rugby team that beat England at Twickenham twenty years earlier. To mark the anniversary of this celebrated victory, Dombasle organises a reunion for the members of the winning team. When Chief Inspector Daniel Jacquot receives his invitation to attend the party he is reluctant to indulge in past victories, but an old friend persuades him and he makes his way to the millionaire's sumptuous Cote d'Azur home. But petty jealousies and past rivalries soon re-surface and when one of Jacquot's old team-mates commits suicide in a pool-side cabana, his suspicions are aroused. Of the original fifteen players, only eleven of the team now remain alive. Is there a killer amongst them?",
