  "description": "To the public, I was known as Camden Freeman, the bad boy of the race world. The one who had it all, including women.As a driver, I never liked to take things slow, and Lindsay was no exception. I’d agreed to one night as a favor. But from the moment I laid eyes on her, I knew I had to have her, but it wasn’t until the final draft that I knew it was forever. I was used to getting everything I wanted, but Lindsay was going to make me earn it every step of the way.",
