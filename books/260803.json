  "title": "Walt Whitman's Diary: A Summer in Canada, 1880",
  "description": "\"Buffalo, noon, Friday June 4th, 1880: All right, so far — had a good trip & a good sleeper & bed & accommodations — best RR track I ever travelled over — had good breakfast at 8 at Hornellsville — am now about 430 miles from Philadelphia: I believe — am feeling all right.\" Walt Whitman kept this rare, personal diary during a summer spent in Canada in 1880. Poignant, profound and uplifting, he records his impressions of all that he saw as he travelled from Philadelphia up into rural Quebec; the towns and villages he visited, the people and landscapes that he encounters. This excellent reading edition sets the diary within the context of Whitman's life and includes photographs and footnotes.",
