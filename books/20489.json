  "description": "Two centuries after an atomic war on earth, a silver-haired mutant sets out on a dangerous search for a lost city of the ruined civilization. The holocaust had ravaged the world 200 years before. Survivors were scattered across the frightening wastelands. Some struggled merely for life...others, like Fors, the Star Man's son, dared the terrifying unknown to recapture the knowledge...the knowledge that could once again destroy them...Fors, a mutant, was barred from the ranks of the Star Men of the Eyrie, an elite group of explorers dedicated to the recovery of ancient knowledge. Only some wondrous discovery might gain him acceptance. So Fors set out in search of one of the lost cities, where he hoped to find tools, books, and other marvels to increase the Star Men's store of information and riches. But his quest grew into a far greater test than ever he imagined. Hunted by the dreaded Beast Things, he fled through a radioactive wasteland, right into the hands of hostile humans. The Star Men would never see Fors' treasures, unless he could convince the warring human tribes to unite against a common, and unbelievable, enemy!Also published titled: Daybreak: 2250 A.D.",
