But with home resembling a war zone, a parish-wide curfew, and mysterious new faces lurking in the abandoned French Quarter, normal needs a new definition. As the city murder rate soars, Adele finds herself tangled in a web of magic that weaves back to her own ancestors. Caught in a hurricane of myths and monsters, who can she trust when everyone has a secret and keeping them can mean life or death? Unless . . . you’re immortal.★ “In this Southern Gothic love letter, Arden spins a moody tale of magic and mystery. A thoroughly satisfying page-turner. A strong debut.”–Publishers Weekly, starred review“A cathartic, uncompromising tribute to New Orleans.”–Kirkus Reviews“A slow-burning novel in the tradition of Anne Rice.”–Rue Morgue Magazine  “A smart story with a surprising amount of emotional depth . . . in the grand tradition of Buffy and The Lost Boys.”–IndieReader“It's as if Arden took her life experiences within the Vieux Carre, assembled a few Hogwarts students as Avengers, channeled Magneto into Wednesday Adams, drenched the process in Parisian detail, and penned the great American novel.” – Examiner.com",
