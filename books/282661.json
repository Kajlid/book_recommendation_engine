  "title": "Lokhi & I: The Unseen Journey Of A Domestic Worker",
  "description": "At age eight, Lokhi left her poverty-stricken village in the Sunderbans, and came to the bustling metropolitan of Delhi to begin her new life, as a full-time domestic worker. Like the estimated 4.2-10 million domestic workers currently working in India, Lokhi is unrecognized as an actual worker protected by the law. After silently putting up with unregulated work conditions and mercurial employers for over a decade as a domestic worker, Lokhi didn't think that her story was important.As a tie-in to “Crossing the River of Life”, a documentary about domestic workers in India, this book concentrates on the story of Lokhi. Through Lokhi's story—her struggles, her relationships and her hopes—this book shatters the silence and exposes the dark reality of what it means to be a domestic worker in India.",
