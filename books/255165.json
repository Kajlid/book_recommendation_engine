  "description": "Tall, dark and dangerous Rusty (Diablo to the rest of the world) could make you forget your own name when he turns those soulful brown eyes on you. But Autumn Simon has bigger concerns than the bad boy biker when she (along with Rusty and her ex-fiancé, Kendal) gets caught up in the middle of a robbery. With her life on the line, Autumn needs to make a choice. Can she trust the man who shattered her heart ten years ago, or should she put her faith in the tattooed biker who’s been warming her bed to save her?",
