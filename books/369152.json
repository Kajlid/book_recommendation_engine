  "description": "For the last five years, Detroit poet and national slam champ Blair has been examining the life, career, and influences of Michael Jackson, The King of Pop. Jackson is a peculiarly American icon. To discuss MJ is to discuss issues of race, gender, sexuality, stardom, poverty, wealth, self-abuse, child abuse, and justice. This book of poems is for anyone interested in the aforementioned subjects. This book is about America. \"From the moment I heard the music and poetry of Blair, I was in love with it and believed in it.\" —Zac Posen, State of the Re:Union, NPR\"Raw, uncompromising emotion.\" —Performing Songwriter Magazine\"Blair's is a powerful voice.\" —Mike Doughty, Soul Coughing\"No one mines their own life and turns it into poetry and song with quite the power and grace of Blair.

Over and over again.\" —Taylor Mali, four time National Poetry Slam Championship\"Urban folk, afro-punk, singer-songwriter, poetry slammer, gay activist, Blair is our kinda dude . . .
