Book seven in the bestselling Dungeon Crawler Carl series is here!They call it Faction Wars.The ninth floor.Nine armies, each led by rich and powerful aliens from across the galaxy. Each team has one objective: to capture and hold the castle at the very center of the battlefield. Strategy, alliances, pitched battles, and, of course, betrayal...

The NPCs, who are normally used as nothing but cannon fodder, have become fully self-aware and formed a team of their own.For Donut and Katia, the stakes are even higher. Only one of them will be allowed to leave this level.If they all want to survive, they’re going to need a little help from a veteran or two.This is it.This is what they’ve been fighting toward.This is war.This inevitable ruin.",
