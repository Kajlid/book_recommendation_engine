  "title": "Married with Luggage: What We Learned About Love by Traveling the World",
  "description": "This is not your typical love story. Take an inside peek at an unconventional lifestyle and its impact on a conventional marriage. Warren and Betsy Talbot were heading for divorce when they had an idea that changed everything: Put the relationship first. That small but revolutionary act paved the way for an even bigger idea: Sell everything and travel the world. \"When we left on this journey, we thought our biggest discoveries would be in the world around us. But it turns out we had a lot to explore in our own relationship,\" said coauthor Betsy Talbot. Find out what dodging an erupting volcano, riding out a Force-12 storm in the icy Drake Passage, and herding goats in the Gobi Desert have taught them about love and communication in this adventurous and revealing memoir. Married with Luggage is for those who want an inside peek at how another couple makes love work and people who live (or want to live) a less conventional life without sacrificing their relationships.",
