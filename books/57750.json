  "title": "Sweet Son of Pan",
  "description": "Sweet Son of Pan is a collection of erotic poems, born of crushes, love affairs, fantasies, dreams, and real experiences with men from around the world. These poems are written in a mood of devotion, a praise through language of the sweetest garden we enter as physical beings. They are a response to the sadness that is often a consequence of sex; the fear that so unnecessarily surrounds it; the disrespect that is visited upon it. They are wishes; elegies for our lost brothers--and for the parts of our selves that our lost; parts we rediscover. They are a reaffirmation of sexual freedom and the wisdom that can be gained from the journey along that path--glimpses of paradise, our oneness and timelessness--and if we are lucky, of a small horned creature with cloven hooves who reminds us we came here only to share, and to share joyfully.",
