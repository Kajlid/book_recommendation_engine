  "description": "There are many teenagers in the world whose biggest problems are friends, family and funds. Fourteen year-old Sam Kahu isn't one of them. For a 14-year-old who is newly orphaned he seems strangely self-contained. The Police want to know what's happened to the friends and family who used to live with him in the old mansion on remote Aotea Island before it burned to the ground.But Sam is the last guardian of an enormous secret he isn't going to tell it to anyone. It's only when he discovers that to help himself he needs to help broken-hearted lesbian detective, Sue Williams, that he invites her into his past - a past with five other teens just like him. All minorities pursued to the ends of the earth by politics or criminal gangs. All with the strange knack of knowing things they shouldn't. All able to see dead people.Sue's terrifying discovery as Sam shares his memories and the old mansion, however, is that Sam isn't mad, isn't lying and isn't safe. While he has amazing powers and fantastic technology his enemies are far more dangerous than she could possibly imagine, and his world is far stranger than she might have ever dreamt.510 print pages.
