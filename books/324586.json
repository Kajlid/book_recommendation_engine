  "description": "I have a crush… Well, two, really. One is a guy I met online, who I’ll never work up the guts to meet in real life. And the other? That’s a long story…My life feels like it’s falling apart at the seams—I’m broke, my restaurant is on the verge of failure, and my brother’s best friend just moved back to town. Okay, so maybe Brooks Callahan’s return isn’t a life-ending event, but it sure feels like it. Eight years ago, he told me he wanted me. He was just a kid, and honestly, so was I. When I tried to let him down gently, he lashed out, his awful words scarring me in ways they never should have.Now Brooks is the only one who can help me, and I have to find a way to put our issues to bed. Metaphorically, not literally. That would be ridiculous, right? Of course, it would.Maybe I’ll ask the guy I’ve crushed on for months…my online friend whose posts always seem to reverberate in my soul. Whose messages make me laugh. Think. Feel.The one who has his own crush…on someone else.What am I going to do?",
