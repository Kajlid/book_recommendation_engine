  "title": "Feminist on Fire: A Novel",
  "description": "Feminist on Fire tells the harrowing story of Pam Kearon, a founding member of the radical feminist group, The Feminists, active in New York City during the 1960s and 1970s. She wrote “Man Hating,” and co-wrote \" An Act of Terror.” Both essays were widely anthologized and translated. Pam was an abused child, later diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. For the last twenty-five years of her life, she lived in homes for adults with mental illness. Feminist on Fire, a novel is a mosaic of memories that travels freely back and forth through time, and is based on the author, her niece’s recollections and research. Although Pam was healthy at times, her illness was an ever-present impediment to her extraordinary potential.",
