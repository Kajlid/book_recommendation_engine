  "description": "Bad-boy heir to the Fleming Group empire, Jamie “Hawk” Fleming, at your service. Here’s the breakdown: my father has been thrown behind bars on murder charges, and my mother as accessory. That was three months ago, and since then, everything has been a downhill ride. The only thing keeping me sane right now is Hot Body. Her name is Layla, and all that matters is that she’s gorgeous, sexy, and great in bed. Until I wake up tied up and gagged, Layla standing over me. Sounds promising, huh? A pretty girl, maybe handcuffs and a whip? But that’s not our scene, and the pissed-off men who kidnapped me are lurking in the shadows, ensuring that this experience won’t be fun at all…  *Warning: this book contains graphic language, sex, and violence. Mature readers only. Not intended for young readers.*  HAWK is the second book in the bestselling Sex and Bulllets series. It is a full-length standalone New Adult Romantic Suspense novel by New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Jo Raven.
