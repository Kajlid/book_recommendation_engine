  "description": "(A Suncoast Society series book.)[Siren Sensations Erotic Alternative Consensual BDSM Romance, M/M, bondage, sex toys, spanking, HEA] Doyle Turner's a psychologist specializing in addiction recovery and is also a professional sober companion. He's also a recovering alcoholic with over twenty years of sobriety under his belt. And he's a Dom in his personal life, which he hasn't had much of lately. Mevi Maynard not only tests Doyle's infinite patience, the handsome rock star is testing his self-control, too. Mevi Maynard's rock-bottom crash follows the discovery that his manager stole his fortune. Now, Mevi's fresh out of rehab. But if he doesn't want to file bankruptcy, he has to stay sober for the new tour, or he's out of the band. But what he can't admit to Doyle--and has never admitted to anyone--is that he's gay. One patient Dom. One stubborn rock star. Both are really stupid men, according to their friend, Tilly. Can she help the men get out of their own way and see the light, and their love for each other, before it's too late? ** A Siren Erotic RomanceThe other books in the Suncoast Series are standalone works, but are best read in the following order to reduce  \n   Safe Harbor \n   Cardinal's Rule \n   Domme by Default \n   The Reluctant Dom \n   The Denim Dom \n   Pinch Me \n   Broken Toy \n   A Clean Sweep \n   A Roll of the Dice \n   His Canvas \n   A Lovely Shade of Ouch \n   Crafty Bastards \n   A Merry Little Kinkmas \n   Sapiosexual \n   A Very Kinky Valentine's Day \n   Things Made Right \n   Click \n   Spank or Treat  \n   A Turn of the Screwed \n   Chains \n   Kinko de Mayo \n   Broken Arrow \n   Out of the Spotlight \n   Friends Like These  \n   Vicious Carousel  \n   Hot Sauce \n   Open Doors \n   One Ring  \n   Vulnerable \n   The Strength of the Pack \n   Initiative \n   Impact \n   Liability \n   Switchy \n   Rhymes With Orange \n   Beware Falling Ice \n   Beware Falling Rocks \n   Dangerous Curves Ahead \n   Two Against Nature \n   Home at Last \n   A Kinkmas Carol \n   Ask DNA \n   Time Out of Mind \n   Happy Valenkink's Day \n   Splendid Isolation \n   Similar to Rain \n   Happy Spank Patrick's Day (Coming 3/20/2017) \n   Fire in the Hole (Coming 04/03/2017) \n   Pretzel Logic (Coming 04/17/2017) \n   This Moody Bastard (Coming 05/01/2017)",
