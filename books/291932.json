  "description": "Dr. Amani Giles is content with her quiet but hectic life even after she calls off her engagement with her college sweetheart. Helping others consumes her days, but she spends lonely nights in her condo nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Canton, GA. Raised by a single mom and her grandmother, everyone knows the Giles family, but Amani knows nothing of her family history. However, when she meets one of her charity’s biggest donors at her gala, the supernatural world collides with her otherwise routine life. Aleksandr Morozov is the CEO of the Kamenev Corporation, the owner of Tantric, a renowned BDSM club, and the country’s most eligible bachelor. Aleksandr also has a secret—while he is a successful businessman to most, he is also the Vampire King . . . although he stops following the traditions of his kind after his mother’s unsolved murder. He no longer believes in the lore surrounding the Prophecy of Old, but all that changes when he sees Amani and discovers the stories about True Mates are real.  A BWWM Paranormal Romance. For mature audiences.",
