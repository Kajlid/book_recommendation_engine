  "description": "With warmth, wit, and not a trace of self-pity\" ( Entertainment Weekly ), Betsy Lerner details her twenty-year struggle with depression and compulsive eating in Food and Loathing, a book that dares to expose the insidious nature of women's secret life with food.\"Alternating between hilarious and heartbreaking\" ( People ), Food and Loathing gives voice to one of the last taboo subjects and greatest stigmas of our being overweight. Lerner's revelations on the cult of thinness -- from the dreaded weigh-in at junior high gym class to the effects of inhaling Pepperidge Farm Goldfish at Olympic speeds -- are universally resonant, as is her belief that this is one battle no one should fight alone.Essential reading for anyone who has ever wielded a fork in despair or calculated her self-worth on the morning scale, \"Lerner's lament is a triumph\" ( Publishers Weekly ).",
