  "description": "Book 2 in Forbidden Secrets series. The books should be read in order for maximum pleasure.After nearly a month together, Leo wants Ursa to move in with him. The sex is scorching and the kink enthralling, but she is awed by this magnificent man and is unsure that she can hold her own in his world. Just before they head off to the November pleasure party in Tahoe, Ursa’s jealous friend shakes her confidence and undermines her belief that she can hold on to a man like Leo. Ominously, even the jaunty pony-play girls are not happy, and their cruel tricks are not the sort of pain-play anyone wants. And Leo’s ex-lover is there. She tries to reclaim what was hers with devastating consequences that leave Ursa and Leo reeling. Manipulation and jealousy might rip them apart unless they trust each other and the newfound love they share. Reader Advisory: This story has graphic sexual language and scenes—no closed bedroom doors (or other rooms) here!",
