  "description": "Indelible Love Series Book 7Nick Reid belongs to a legendary family known for their love, generosity, and commitment to one another. When a Reid finds true love, it's full of drama, but happily everlasting. Bee Taylor grew up alone and independent, but she believes that when she finds her ultimate love, it will have been worth the loneliness. As a twenty-five-year-old med student, Nick finds Bee to be the closest thing to true love, but doesn't desire to commit beyond the here and now. He feels he's too young, too unsettled, but ultimately, he's too afraid to take that last step. As a thirty-year-old designer, Bee is established in her career and ready to find the same kind of stability in her personal life. She wants a man who can profoundly love her and commit without reservation. If opposites attract, then Nick and Bee are the perfect pair. But, there are too many obstacles that keep these two from finding happiness. Written once again in a blog format like its preceding series, Indelible Lovin' - Max & Jane's Story, Nick and Bee's Story is full of drama, cliffhangers, and of course twists and turns. Originally published as a Monday / Thursday series on , Vol.1 has been compiled as a read-all-in-one-sitting version. This volume is only half the story. The rest is being unfolded on the website. If you don't like laughing, crying, feeling frustrated, and wanting to slap the hero upside his head, this isn't the book for you.",
