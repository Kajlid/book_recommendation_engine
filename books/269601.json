  "description": "TWO PLANETS AT WAR. ONE GIRL IN BETWEEN. HER CHOICE WILL SAVE A REVOLUTION. Avery Vey lives on Level 4 of New San Francisco, scraping by on whatever deals she can make in the rough markets of the ground level. But at least she is far removed from the war that rages on Echo, the sister planet just beyond the hypergate. She wants nothing to do with Earth's pointless crusade against the native race of that world. But soon after Avery undergoes a routine bioscan, the Earth Federation beats down her door and takes her into custody, along with her grandmother. As fellow prisoner Finn Lunitia helps her escape, they find that Avery has incredible powers--powers that no human should possess. As Finn drags her into the depths of this strange new world, Avery is labeled a savior for the people of Echo. To rescue her grandmother and decide her own fate, she must master her gifts, as well as the political games that govern both worlds. But with each step she takes, the planet of Echo--and Finn--begin to take hold of her heart. And she will do anything to save them.",
