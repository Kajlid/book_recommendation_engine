I decide to live out her one wish and visit the romantic Spanish island of Mallorca in her memory, but when a handsome, mysterious older man pulls me from the sea I realize this holiday might lead me to making the ultimate memory with my sexy Spaniard.  I wasn’t expecting a Spanish romance in the beautiful Balearic Sea, but that’s exactly what I get. And he’s going to get something else entirely when I realize I’ve fallen for him and it’s finally time for my first time… with him.  But all I can think about is how to make my first time turn into all the time, as in live in Spain permanently with him as we start our own family together.  *****  As a Spanish prince I’m always on the lookout for people with an agenda.

But I need to know she’s as obsessed with me as I am with her, and when I do I’m going to make her my princess for life.  But when the king finds out what I’m up to will this possessive prince’s royal romance be a welcome addition to the palace, or will they send the both of us packing… forever?  But there’s only one forever that matters to this prince… making her mine and starting a family… together forever with my perfect princess.  *Possessive Prince is an insta-everything standalone instalove romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
