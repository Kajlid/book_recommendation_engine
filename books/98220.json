  "description": "Critically acclaimed screenwriter debuts the first in the Liza Radley Housewife Detective Chronicles \"Mattison’s writing is crisp, snappy, witty, and deeply entertaining—I was hooked right on the first page\" \"It crackles with funny one-liners and wry humor. \" New York Book Pundit \"Mattison writes with a quirky, funny style that kept me engaged through the entire story.\" Beckstar Reviews When Liza Radley realizes it’s cheatin’ season and no self-respecting detective’s gonna spy on her husband for the $800 and change she has hidden in a plastic soap dish, she does what any normal transplanted Georgia Peach would do--she becomes a private eye. While downing her fourth maple-glazed curbside, Liza discovers “Eye Spy”, a shop for the self-motivated sleuth in the heart of Boston. Inspiration strikes and she enters the world of Jack Parella, the owner/operator who talks like Humphrey Bogart but with a Southie accent and is more than willing to train Liza in the ways of amateur sleuthing, while simultaneously infuriating and titillating her. Though Liza starts the journey intending to rebuild her crumbling suburban life, she finds herself thrust into a fiery mystery as head of \"Crimes of the Heart Detective Agency\" with Parella by her side. Thus our dynamic duo is primed for their next adventure.",
