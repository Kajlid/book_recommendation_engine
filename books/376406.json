  "description": "Okay, let's clear up some myths about vampires. First of all, you won't see me using the V-word much. In the Night Watch, we prefer the term parasite-positives, or peeps, for short.The main thing to remember is that there's no magic involved. No flying. No transforming into bats or rats either . . .After a chance encounter with a mysterious woman one night, Cal's life is changed forever. He's been infected with an insidious parasite. The good news: he's only a carrier. The bad news: he's infected all his former girlfriends â€“ and now they've turned into what Cal calls 'Peeps'. The rest of us know them as vampires. And it's Cal's job to hunt them down, before they create even more of their own kind . . .",
