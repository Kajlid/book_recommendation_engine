  "title": "Anna's Shattered Faith",
  "description": "The day Anna Hampton's husband, Zach, was killed was the day she lost her faith. Ranger Daniel Cochran represents everything she doesn't like. Not only is he a lawman, but he's a God-fearing man like Zach. His faith might work for him, but the only thing Anna saw it do was get her husband killed. The Rangerâ€™s presence grows more and more welcome, especially when danger lurks around every corner, and Anna is caught in the middle.",
