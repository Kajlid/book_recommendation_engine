  "description": "In a world where knowledge is power, the library is the greatest weapon of them all.My necromancy-practising murderers never expected me to rise again.I was just the latest in a long line of gullible sacrifices to ensure their continued control over the Arcanaeum, so it shocked everyone when I woke up as a ghost and kicked them out.For centuries now, I’ve faithfully carried out my self-appointed duties as the Librarian. I keep the vast halls of magical knowledge organised, fight the mad whims of the sentient—and interfering—building, and deal with the incessant demands of our patrons.I have all the books and solitude I could ever want, the ability to redecorate whenever I get bored, and I can banish arcanists who refuse to follow my rules.But the Arcanaeum has started acting out, especially when it comes to six particular patrons, all of whom want something from me.Jasper and Dakari need my protection, but Pierce isn’t above threatening me ensure I give them both up. There’s no rule Galileo and North won’t break to get into the secret vault. And then there’s Lambert, who seems to exist for no reason other than to vex me with his smiles and... hugging.Inconvenient, given that every time they touch me, my ghostly body cracks and breaks like glass.To keep the Arcanaeum safe, I might just have to put my trust in all of them, but what if the cost of the building’s safety is my destruction?Liminal is the first book in a new paranormal why choose/ reverse harem series intended for readers aged 18 years and over. There is no MM or FF in this series.Inside the book you'll find:A grumpy ghostly librarianA meddling magical libraryOne golden retrieverSteamy slow-burn tension",
