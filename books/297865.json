  "description": "Two lives, together, then apart, then together again, as a brother and a sister discover the riches of life. Rich Brother, Rich Sister combines the inspirational true life stories of Robert Kiyosaki and his sister Emi into one book that will reaffirm your belief in the power of purpose, the importance of action, and the ability to overcome all obstacles in a quest for wealth, both financial and spiritual. In 1962, the United States detonated a nuclear bomb ten miles off the coast of Christmas Island in the South Pacific. From that moment two people, born of the same parents, and with the same childhood experiences, found themselves on different life journeys to find truth, happiness, purpose, and ultimately financial success. Robert became a world-famous entrepreneur, author, and teacher of all things financial, and Emi a highly devout Buddhist nun, author, and teacher of all things spiritual. This book will inspire you along your own life’s journey to find your own truth and purpose, your own path to prosperity—both financial and spiritual—all the riches of life that were meant for you...and us all.",
