  "description": "Sizzling sex is one thing. Moving in together and figuring out how to be a couple is another. Ryan Van Alstyn has learned a couple of things in the last two years, mainly that great chemistry isn’t always the answer, and good communication and trust are the keys to making things work. But try telling that to Jamie MacPherson.Rough-around-the-edges Jamie still can’t believe his luck in hooking up with someone as sexy as Ryan, and he’s determined not to do anything to rock this particular love boat. Unable to bring himself to tell Ryan about the dream he’s been hiding, he’ll do whatever it takes to keep Ryan happy, regardless of what, or who, he must sacrifice.",
