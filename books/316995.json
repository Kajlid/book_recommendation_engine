  "description": "Douglas Niles pens a thrilling climax to The Maztica Trilogy, the exotic location set within the Forgotten Realms.  The greatest city in Maztica lies in ruins as a plague of hideous monsters descends across the land. From the ashes of destruction, a tenuous alliance forms. Legionnaires and native warriors fight side by side, desperate to stem the onslaught of chaos. Their only hope of victory requires aid from beyond Faerunâ€”the prophecy given to Erixitl of Palul: Quotal, immortal Plumed Serpent, will return to Maztica for a final battle against the forces of evil. But already the Feathered Dragon may be too late.",
