  "description": "Listening time 5 hours 12 minutes\nNo women.No sex.No hooking up.This is the oath I took in solidarity with my best friend after a particularly heinous breakup left him shattered.No problem, right?Wrong.Because lately, I've begun developing big, messy feelings for our best female friend who we both swore was off-limits since we were sixteen years old.I shouldn't notice the way her hair turns golden when it catches the light, I shouldn't make it a goal to see her dimples when she laughs, I shouldn't find her knowledge on current affairs so sexy. I'm pretty sure she's oblivious, which is a good thing, I try to convince myself. Until one night after too many cocktails when we fall into bed together.I'm left with an awkward morning-after, and one of the hardest choices I've ever had to make.Confess how I feel, and potentially lose both of my best friends in the process, or bury my feelings and watch her move on?How can something so wrong feel so right?",
