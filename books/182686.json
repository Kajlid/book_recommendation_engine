  "title": "The Old Peabody Pew: A Christmas Romance of a Country Church",
  "description": "1905. Another heartwarming tale from the American educator and writer, famous for her children's works including Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. The story Edgewood, like all the other villages along the banks of the Saco, is full of sunny slopes and leafy hollows. There are little, rounded, green-clad hillocks that might, like their scriptural sisters, skip with joy; and there are grand, rocky hills tufted with gaunt pine trees-these leading the eye to the splendid heights of a neighbor State, where snow-crowned peaks tower in the blue distance, sweeping the horizon in a long line of majesty.
