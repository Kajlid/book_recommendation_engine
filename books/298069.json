  "description": "He’s a beast in the spreadsheets and a boss in the bedsheets\n\nMr. Santillian,Despite the fact I'm currently living out of your guest room and sleeping with you most nights, I am writing to announce my resignation effective two weeks from today. In other words, I'll locate someone who is both obscenely overqualified and willing to devote their days to the handful of tasks you are able to wrench from your perfectionist, micromanaging grip. It may be difficult to find a Nobel laureate genius looking for basic filing work on such short notice, but I'll do my best. Don't worry about your sister's wedding this weekend. I still plan to attend as your date, assuming you've finished hating me by then. Thank you in advance for your understanding. ZeldaMs. Besh, Resignation not accepted. I'll see you at home. Ash",
