Problem… Damian got where he is today by going after what he wants.Lydia Simmons has her goals lined out and a brighter future on the horizon. For years she’s fought to build her reputation in the kinky, BDSM world and make a place for herself. Her plan is in jeopardy when a rich playboy thinks he has a right to steer her destiny in his direction. To make it worse, Damian researched Lydia and discovered her weaknesses. After Lydia loses a bet to the megalomaniac, she becomes Damian’s employee for one month at Club El Diablo and enters the forbidden world of the ultra-spoiled rich and egotistical.Could Lydia be wrong in her assessment of the people who find a home in Damian’s club? Do they have their own problems and needs no matter that they’re born with silver spoons up their collective butts? She knows she’s not wrong about Damian—he’s wealthy, gorgeous, and dominating to the extreme and NOT booked into her life’s schedule. It doesn’t matter that he seems to know what makes her tick even when she thinks she’s very good at hiding her greatest desire.Damian has secrets. Lydia has ambition. Can the two find middle ground and share their hearts? There’s only one way to find out but you must pay the price of admission, obtain your golden heart bracelet that proves you belong, and let your kinky side loose. Can you?",
