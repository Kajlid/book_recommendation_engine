And for the Grimm sisters, danger will be all around them, along with the stuff that fairy tales are made of. Monsters will attack. Dreams will come true. Some will not. And happily-ever-after will become possible in a land filled with werewolves, vampires, trolls, grave-robbers (not Frankensteins) and other paranormal creatures of the night-that bite.
