Let's go away for the weekend, said Megan, and leave our phones behind and turn off the computers and television and stop time because time is moving too fast and soon we'll all be saying where the hell did our lives go? We'll cook some food and drink some wine and each tell a story. IT IS THE MIDDLE OF WINTER. Seven friends leave their ordinary lives behind to travel to a remote coastal beach house off the Great Ocean Road. The stories they tell, turn by turn, are the beginning of a puzzle, each exposing the foibles of humankind.But what to these disturbing tales reveal - or conceal - about each of them? Where does fact finish and fiction begin?As a storm rolls in and torrential rain cuts the party off from the outside world, it becomes clear that some secrets are best kept hidden. Brilliantly exploring the line between life and art, truth and lies, Demons is a mesmerising novel from one of Australia's most inventive writers.",
