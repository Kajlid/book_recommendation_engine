  "title": "Sam and Ben",
  "description": "Sam and Ben are twins, which means they were once squished together inside their mama's belly. But that doesn't mean they are like two peas in a pod. They look different, they act differently and when they see the same object their imaginations take off in different directions! A beautifully illustrated book about twin boys that celebrates their differences and similarities.",
