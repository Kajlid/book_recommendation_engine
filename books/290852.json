  "description": "Holly has had a year to deal with the family-sized portion of Old Magic she has inherited. Her focus is on the future, but when both the Coven and the past come calling, the future she has imagined seems to be slipping form her grasp.If the past is truly a different country, it turns out it is a dark and bloody one that shares a border with the present â€“ a border that is frequently crossed.Holly needs to right a past wrong and lay some old ghosts, without becoming one herself, if she is to come to terms with her present and claim her future.",
