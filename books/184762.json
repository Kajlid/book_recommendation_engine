  "description": "Prolific novelist Jason Born comes out swinging with the first tale in his new series, Lions & Devils. He brings a large cast of loved and loathed characters vividly to life as greed, deceit, loyalty, and betrayal take center stage against a backdrop of roiling action.It is 711 A.D., Duke Eudo of Aquitaine needs an alliance to counteract the growing menace of the northern Franks. The only potential ally of consequence lies across the Pyrenees in Hispania. However, Hispania has a new king with his own troubles. Berber pirates from North Africa have renewed their savage raids on his coasts. From within his fragile kingdom, the king must placate militant Visigoth nobles who are intrigued by the tenacity of this new, violent faith, Islam, and see the pirates as a means to their own ends. It is into this pit of vipers that Eudo dispatches his sons, the battle-hardened Hunoald and the peevishly bitter Remistanius, to secure a beneficial accord.Hell Shall Stir is a brilliant yarn that transports the reader to the very dawn of a struggle that still rages today. Born has begun a magnificent epic which lays bare the deadly plots and bitter violence that led to massive conflict in Hispania. Can the ferocious Muslim Caliphate ever be stopped?",
