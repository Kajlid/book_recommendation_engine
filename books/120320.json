  "description": "1924. The English Shires, after the Great War - all crumbling country houses and no men. When her jazzing flapper of an aunt dies, Gerardina Mary Chiledexter inherits some silver-topped scent bottles, a wardrobe of love-affair clothes, and astonishingly, a half-share in a million-acre ranch in south-west Texas. Haunted by a psychic cat and the ghost voice of her aunt, Leonie, Gerry feels driven to travel thousands of miles to see the ranch for herself. Against a backdrop of big sky, cattle barons and oil wells, she is soon engaged in a game of power, pride and ultimately, love - with the Texan who owns the other half.",
