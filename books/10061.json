  "title": "The Twelve Days of Christmas [Correspondence]",
  "description": "Everyone knows 'The Twelve Days of Christmas', but not as rewritten by John Julius Norwich in this delightful correspondence, which records the daily thank-you letters from one increasingly bemused young lady to her unseen admirer. And who but Quentin Blake could exploit the full comic possibilities of this hilarious debacle as first birds, then maids and finally the full percussion section of the Liverpoool Philharmonic create mayhem in the calm of an English country Christmas?",
