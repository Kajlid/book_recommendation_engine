  "description": "THE STUNNING CONCLUSION TO THE MIND-BENDING SERIES Shuos Jedao is awake... …and nothing is as he remembers. He’s a teenager, a cadet—a nobody—in the body of an old man; a general in command of an elite force. And he’s the most feared, and reviled, man in the galaxy. Jedao carries orders from Hexarch Nirai Kujen to re‑conquer the fractured pieces of the hexarchate. But he has no memory of ever being a soldier, let alone a general, and the Kel soldiers under his command hate him for a massacre he can’t remember committing. Kujen’s friendliness can’t hide the fact that he’s a tyrant. And what’s worse, Jedao and Kujen are being hunted—by an enemy who knows more about Jedao than he does himself...  ‘Breathtakingly original space opera.’ N. K. Jemisin, New York Times  ‘I love Yoon’s work! Full of battles and political intrigue, in a beautifully built far-future that manages to be human and alien at the same time.’ Ann Leckie",
