  "description": "Abraham Lincoln once said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Senator Nick Bennett believes that it should not stand. Disgusted with partisan politics, Nick calls for America to be split up by political ideology. The idea of living in separate utopias is wildly popular with Americans. The blue states form the Progressive States of America and the red states create the United States of Ronald Reagan. The two new governments are free to address foreign relations, economic policies and social laws without the interference of an opposition party.While the P.S.A. thrives, the U.S.R.R. is crippled by the inanity of its conservative ideology. A generation of its citizens receives a terrible education and loses the right to privacy. Many are killed either by an abhorrent health care system or the preemptive wars their government starts. The dreadful conditions inside the U.S.R.R. enrage the conservative citizens. Revolution seems inevitable, and the conflict threatens to engulf the liberal country as well.Abraham Lincoln's Lie contains political and social satire and is intended for a liberal audience. The novel takes a humorous look at how fiercely debated ideas could actually be implemented by the two ideologies.",
