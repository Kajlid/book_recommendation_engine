  "title": "Everywhere Babies",
  "description": "With an irresistible rhyming text and delightfully endearing illustrations, here is an exuberant celebration of playing, sleeping, crawling, and of course, very noisy babies doing all the wonderful things babies do best. Every day, everywhere, babies are born. They're kissed and dressed and rocked and fedâ€”and completely adored by the families who love them. New York magazine's The Strategist chose Everywhere Babies as one of the \"Best (Nonobvious) Baby Books to Bring to a Shower.\" As The Strategist \" Babies love looking at other babies, and this book is filled with all kinds of adorable ones.\" Plus the book's art is \"really layered and thoughtful in representing all kinds of babies and parents.\" The Strategist's kids loved the \"really pleasing cadence and rhyme structure.\" Marla Frazee's popular books include two Caldecott Honor winners, the Clementine series, and The Boss Baby, among many others.",
