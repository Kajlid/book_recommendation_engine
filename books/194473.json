  "description": "VioletSome may say I'm quiet and unassuming. It would shock most that my nights are filled with dark elaborate fantasies. I never thought they’d come to life until I opened the door to Adam Stone, the Master of the Boardroom and the Bedroom. My tantalizing new reality with Adam scares the hell out of me. I know I should run like hell, but I can’t. He makes me want more, much more.” Adam I have been deemed the Master of Mergers. I have what it takes to bind the largest and most competitive companies when no else can. But, Violet... she's milk and honey, untainted, a clean slate. When she walked through the door, I knew I had to have her. I wanted her more than any other woman, and I always get what I want.Can Violet and Adam's passion ignite an everlasting fire? Or will their differences make their romance go up in flames?",
