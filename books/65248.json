He’s assigned to the squad of the meanest, nastiest commander in the whole fleet, LCDR Marik Korelesk. Steven’s overprotective mom is having a little trouble adjusting to his absence and Steven himself is just not sure where he fits in. Add to that Steven’s new friends including Sam, the nephew of the famous pilot Zem, who discovers that unlike his uncle, he’s afraid to fly and Randy, who lives in the bowels of the ship in the top secret hacker lab. There’s also a princess laying traps to ensnare a prince. The adventures are quirky and fun and a planet or two is saved along the way.",
