  "description": "Tom Adams is confused. Alison lived with him like a sister for several years, but the feelings he has for her are not the kind of feelings he ought to have for a sister. And that’s not the only problem when he goes to New York to live with Ali, because it turns out she likes women rather than men.Being around the most beautiful woman he knows is tough for Tom, even tougher when Ali brings girlfriends home, way tougher when she asks him to pose so she can sketch him. To pose naked.Tom might have coped with that as well if his body hadn’t let him down. What was a guy supposed to do, lying naked on a couch in front of a hot babe?For a while Tom and Ali cope with the growing attraction between them, fighting a mutual desire neither wants to admit. Tom seeks an outlet to his arousal with other women, and Ali too. The business they set up to sell the drawings they produce takes off and other people become involved.When Tom’s Mom gets married and asks them to housesit while she’s on honeymoon the tension breaks and Ali flees back to New York, seeking a respite from the emotional turmoil. When Tom follows he finds her she is gone and he must follow her trail across the Atlantic to Italy where finally they are forced to acknowledge their true feelings.",
