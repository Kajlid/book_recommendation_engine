  "description": "One-on-one instruction never felt so rightâ€”or so wrong.There's nothing unusual about Mia Page's attraction to the young science teacher at the middle school. After all, she's not the only one who finds him enticing. But when he pulls her son aside to ask for her phone number, she knows she's in serious trouble. Since her divorce four years earlier, she's been out of circulation, choosing to focus on parenting instead, and she's not entirely sure she can handle an entanglement with the sexy Mr. Walden.There are also other reasons why getting involved with Curt would be a bad idea. He's two years shy of thirty, and she's on the downside of that unmentionable number. He's adamant about never having kids, and she has a son. Even the guy's romantic gifts are suspect. Energy saving light bulbs? He has to be kidding.On the other hand, he's fun, sweet, and smart. He stimulates her intellectually, emotionally, and Lord help her, physically, opening her eyes to life outside her comfortable world. Yet their differences quietly gnaw at Mia even while she succumbs to their undeniable chemistry.As their romance deepens, so do Mia's fears that Curt will eventually hurt her. On edge, all it takes is an innocent comment to provoke her into drawing first blood. Mia recklessly wounds Curt, learning only too late that this blade cuts both ways.
