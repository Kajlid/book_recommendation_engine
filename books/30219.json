  "description": "Vallanie Sharp is an ordinary genetically designed girl who has always dreamed of being a perceiver. After her sixteenth birthday, she is finally given a chance. Leaving home and her over-protective mother for the first time, Vallanie follows her mentor, Scia, to the city, where she learns to conduct mental evaluations on the disorderly. While struggling with the pressure of her prestigious mentor, hoping to avoid the mean taunts of a former classmate, and trying to gain the attention of the cute valedictorian, she is reunited with an old friend and his mentor who may be more than they appear. When the tables start to turn and Vallanie finds her friends in the patient’s gowns, she begins to question her job and her surroundings. What dark secrets are embedded at the root of her society and—more importantly—does she want to know?",
