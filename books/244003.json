  "title": "The Sacred Balance",
  "description": "The world of Impartia is falling into chaos. The tyrannical ruler of Magmorrah Queen Cera now seeks to destroy the only light left within it, a holy spirit known only to a chosen few as - Alaskia. Cera hopes that in fulfilling this sordid act she will become ever-more powerful and immortal, though believes only by using her current possession over Kufiah - the spirit of darkness to cruelly enact her will could this be truly achieved. The one threat that stands in Cera's way now is in that of her exiled sister – Cara, who along with her young daughter Sophilia find themselves unwillingly forced into the ruthless monarch's personal war against Alaskia. Cara soon finds aid in the protective elemental guardians, who themselves longingly wish for the return of Cerebrante - the spirit of balance, held in the firm belief that they may put an end to the sorrow sweeping over Impartia under the Queen's abhorrent rule. Cerebrante alone can put an end to Cera’s malice once and for all though along this perilous journey to search for Alaskia, Cara may have to choose between saving the world as she knows it or… her only child. The quest that Cara must undertake in 'The Sacred Balance' is faced with numerous trials of both courage and despair, as she bravely confronts the demons of her past and even more present threats when travelling across Impartia in search of the lost spirit of light - Alaskia. Many friendships are made and lost along the way, with the foreboding presence of Kufiah and Queen Cera's loyal agents continuing to linger over Cara and her companions throughout. Unless the spiritual balance of Cerebrante is made then Impartia would only fall into an eternal darkness, that is, unless Cara succeeds in preventing this from happening.",
