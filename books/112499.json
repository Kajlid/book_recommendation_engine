  "description": "Carmen always had a wild streak about her while growing up in this small town. Everyone use to say her only saving grace in this world was her best friend Walker, who tried to keep the flighty girl grounded. But life was too big for her to live in this one stop light kind of town; she had dreams, and wants, that could take her anywhere but staying there. Anything was better than being stuck in the perpetuating cycle of being born, and dying, in this hell hole she called the reality of a small town girl. Walker was the only anchor that could hold her home, she lived for that boy. So how do you explain to someone that staying there would only suffocate the possibilities of making a better life for oneself? Running away was the only option, and leaving a piece of her heart with him, would keep her strong out in the real world; at least she hoped it would. After years of trying to make it on her own, struggling through life, and trying to stay clean, the only reality she sees at surviving now is going back to the place she tried so hard to break free from. Unsure if her old life is willing to accept the choices she has made, the lone thought that matters to her is hoping she still has the only man she has counted on her entire life in her corner. You can always go home, but will they be willing to take you back?",
