  "description": "Love's Body, Dancing in Time offers five love stories by the critically acclaimed L. Timmel Duchamp, stories only she could tell. Carnal and queer, intricate and involved, they range from the heart-breaking Sturgeon Award finalist \"Dance at the Edge\" to the historically authentic, Tiptree short-listed \"The Apprenticeship of Isabetta di Pietro Cavazzi,\" to the subtle, original \"The Heloise Archive,\" in which the rewriting of the eleventh-century abbess's life story dramatically alters the course of European history. Like all of Duchamp's work, this fiction is passionate, feminist, and intelligent.",
