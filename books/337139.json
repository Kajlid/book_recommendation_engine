  "description": "The star of Roberto Bolaño's hair-raising novel Distant Star is Alberto Ruiz-Tagle, an air force pilot who exploits the 1973 coup to launch his own version of the New Chilean Poetry, a multimedia enterprise involving sky-writing, poetry, torture, and photo exhibitions.For our unnamed narrator, who first encounters this \"star\" in a college poetry workshop, Ruiz-Tagle becomes the silent hand behind every evil act in the darkness of Pinochet's regime. The narrator, unable to stop himself, tries to track Ruiz-Tagle down, and sees signs of his activity over and over again. A corrosive, mocking humor sparkles within Bolaño's darkest visions of Chile under Pinochet. In Bolaño's world there's a big graveyard and there's a big graveyard laugh. (He once described his novel By Night in Chile as \"a tale of terror, a situation comedy, and a combination pastoral-gothic novel.\")Many Chilean authors have written about the \"bloody events of the early Pinochet years, the abductions and murders,\" Richard Eder commented in the The New York Times: \"None has done it in such a dark and glittering fashion as Roberto Bolaño.\"",
