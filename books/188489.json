  "description": "Fans of suspense by Marty Stuart or Mary Higgins Clark will devour Pursued by the Past.  From the creator of the award-winning Ruby, Between the Cracks comes a wonderful, intense, edge-of-your-seat story about just that; being pursued by the past. In this moving new novel, P.D. Workman reveals a haunting and provocative story of jealousy and obsession underscoring the importance of trusting your instincts and just what can happen if you don't.  Vanna had a good life. She had her challenges—like her mother’s high expectations of her—but all in all, she had a job she enjoyed, a fun hobby and friends. She didn’t need any complications.  But that all changed shortly after trying to break things off with Tino. The phone calls with no one on the other end. Anonymous gifts. Someone moving things around in her bedroom.  A restraining order changed nothing. If anything, it caused things to escalate. If Vanna wants her life back, she will have to take things into her own hands.  Pursued by the Past is a gripping psychological thriller in which the villain is not a vampire or monster, but a dark shadow from the past. It is a nightmare that could happen to you. How would you adapt and survive?",
