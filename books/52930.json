  "description": "Ram has cheated death - four times. Who is so desperate to kill him? And why? On the run, Ram finds himself on desolate moorland. He knows he is being stalked, but this time by something less than human ...Ram is rescued by the seemingly generous and kind William and Mary. But his relief fades to suspicion and fear when, on learning he has no memory, they insist on calling him Noel. Ram is full of doubt. He has no memory of who he is, but he knows he is not Noel - doesn't he? And odd memories start to surface. Memories of guns, rifles, explosions. Strange phrases seem to ring bells. Why does Ram feel in his gut that his secret past is not just vitally important to him, but could have even global significance? Macphail brilliantly sets the clues and racks up the tension in the second of this four-part instalment about Ram and his deadly opponent, the Dark Man. As the series evolves it will be revealed that there is a global terrorist coup being plotted and Ram - unknowingly - holds the secret and the ability to prevent it. Will he realise in time - or will the Dark Man get to him first?",
