  "description": "The oldest residents of an abandoned manor were spiders. Many generations had laced the walls with cobwebs of intricate beauty, yet even they lay in dusty rags now. Through the rain, looms this dwelling, casting a shadow against the tree line. It shuddered on top a hill in Crimson Peak, wishing the morning light would come all the sooner to warm its weary walls. It felt so alone, so empty. Soon even that will be swallowed by the blackness. How long had it been since it felt the coolness of fresh paint? It had been two decades to be exact since a footstep had echoed within those walls since the dust had been disturbed so awakened a malevolent spirit. One known as Black Rose of Ravenwood Manor.",
