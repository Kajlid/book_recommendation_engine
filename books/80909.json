  "title": "Ain't No Sanity Clause: A Twisted Christmas Anthology",
  "description": "It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas . . . so what better way to celebrate the season than to read an anthology of twisted Christmas tales? Part horror, part thriller, part comedy, this collection features thirteen stories from some of the best writers in the business, including Mike Chinn, Joel Lane and Jonathan Green (Pax Britannia). There is a whole host of psychopathic adventures to enjoy; an encounter with monstrous mistletoe in the Deep South, Satanic rituals in the 17th Century, a kidnap caper involving light elves and dark elves and seasonally sinister goings on in deepest, darkest Birmingham. And that’s just for starters. Either way, this collection of stories revels in subverting the traditional Christmas. It will thrill you, scare you and even make you laugh. Enter if you dare . . . the winter wonderland of Ain’t No Sanity Clause",
