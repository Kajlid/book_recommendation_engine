She enjoys her private rebellion against the town that shuns her — until her partner in crime goes missing, and suddenly it’s not about her anymore.Now, with her partner either enslaved as a living blood bank or already dead, Rory’s illicit blood brokering contacts are her only hope of making things right. Assuming they allow her to leave...or even to live.",
