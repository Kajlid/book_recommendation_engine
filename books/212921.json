  "description": "A Great and dedicated teacher's success at one of the most challenging educational assignments of our times forms the basis of this inspiring educational autobiography. It is the story of Leonard Covello, who, starting life as an Italian immigrant in the 1890s, became a beloved teacher and later principal in the teeming poverty-ridden melting pot of New York's East Harlem. The Heart Is the Teacher shows the impact of one life on thousands of boys helped to healthy belief in themselves and in others. For Leonard Covello proved, through half a century of teaching and encouraging boys, that even seemingly incorrigible delinquents can be turned into useful and productive citizens, given affection, attention and guidance.The boys who came under Dr. Covello's influence were frequently wild and rebelious, mostly from impoverished homes, many without any comprehension of English. In touching and exciting anecdotes, Dr. Covello tells how he handled the \"bad boys\" he refused to believe were bad. His work took him from the classroom into the homes of his students, into the alleys and streets which were their playgrounds. He taught evening language classes at the YMCA; he organized \"store front\" schools to carry education to adults as well as the children. The best schools, Dr. Covello believes, are those that are deeply rooted in their communities and that give their pupils a sense of place and responsibility in the neighborhood and the world at large.Through dramatic episodes drawn from his own experience, Leonard Covello re-creates the struggles, the triumphs, the heartbreaks of an extraordinary teaching career. His colorful and inspiring story will give the reader new faith in the creative powers of the human heart.",
