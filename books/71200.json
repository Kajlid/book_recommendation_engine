  "description": "Mark Delaney is a high profile movie star who wants nothing more than to visit his sister for the Christmas holiday before his big movie premiere. When he goes back to Colorado against his agent’s wishes, of course a snowstorm comes that lands his Maserati in a ditch. Stranded on a quiet road, he knocks on the door of the first house he sees—the same house that his former math tutor grew up in. Expecting to find an elderly couple donned in robes and hair curlers, he’s knocked off his feet when Lacey Robertson herself opens the door. She’s all grown up now…and Mark can’t help but notice.When Lacey opens the door to find a tuxedo-clad man staring back at her, she can’t believe that the very same boy she pined after throughout childhood is on her porch. Having the famous star all to herself is intoxicating to say the least, but she resolves to resist the temptation of a blissful night in his arms. After all, he’s probably used to women throwing themselves at him on a nightly basis…and she won’t be one of the faceless crowd begging for his attention.But when she finds out that he hasn't stopped thinking about her, despite his A-list life, will she fall into his arms for a single night of pleasure? Or will she dare to hope for more?Captivated by You is Book 1 in the Superstars in Love Series.",
