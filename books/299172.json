  "description": "Now in paperback, this remarkable book invites us to explore the inevitable process of aging and death by examining the many \"little deaths\" that occur in life, such as divorce, the unexpected loss of a job, or the onset of a sudden illness. We see the powerful independent women who make up the Sisterhood of the Shields as they gain strength, wisdom, and respect during transition into \"elderhood,\" and we learn how to apply these lessons in our own lives.",
