  "description": "Remember Madeleine Mccann? She's the little British girl who disappeared 10 years ago from her family's vacation apartment in Portugal.Her parents say she was abducted. Many think her parents were involved in her death. But might it be something else?Why was critical evidence of possible abuse and pedophilia suppressed? Why was other evidence manufactured? Why did a near life-long pedophile, Sir Clement Freud (Sigmund's grandson) ingratiate himself with Madeleine's parents soon after she disappeared? Why did a reference to Madeleine occur in the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign?\"Finding Madeleine\" provides the shocking answer to these questions. It readily dispenses with the absurd abduction story and \"the parents killed her\" story. She wasn't abducted and she wasn't killed. Rather, \"Finding Madeleine\" reveals an unforgivable act of betrayal shrouded in a web of secrecy and deceit behind Madeleine's disappearance.To get your copy of Finding Madeleine visit - https://www.thepizzagatechronicles.co...",
