  "title": "The Last American Martyr",
  "description": "In this me-me twenty-first century, fifty-nine-year-old Thomas Soles may very well be the last American martyr. This self-described “simple man” writes a simple book that resuscitates the all-but-dead international labor movement. The response to his thoughts and perceptions are astounding. All around the globe, from pole to pole, from America to Zimbabwe, the marching footsteps of workers, young and old, tremor the earth. But not everyone is pleased. There’s a tight-knit, elitist clique that is absolutely livid over the thoughts and ideals that fill the pages of his book. And the moment Tom and his wife Elaina return home from Sweden, they realize just how angry this profit hungry mob really is. Mortified by the horrid scene that awaits them inside their New York tenement, the Soles’ have no choice but to flee their longtime home. Hoping to find peace and anonymity, they bounce all over America in an RV. But in their travels they find nothing close to tranquility. Instead they become moving targets. And everywhere they go they’re followed by a succession of life-threatening events.",
