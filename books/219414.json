  "description": "A compelling contemporary fantasy with a vampire hero, torn between light and dark and an outsider in both worlds, who seeks to discover the truth about his origins and find where he belongs.To avoid the summer sun, the Nocturnes head for vacation at Isla Necrata, a resort whose location always changes, putting it near a geologic calamity- most often a volcanic eruption. As a bonus, Oliver is allowed to bring Dean along, the only catch being that he has to pretend to be Oliver's servant. Before they get there, the Nocturnes must endure a particularly uncomfortable visit with Oliver's extended, Old World vampire family, who live in Morosia, a vampire city underneath Rome.",
