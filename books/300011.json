Now, at last, de Lint tells Jilly's own story...for behind the painter's fey charm lies a dark secret and a past she's labored to forget. And that past is coming to claim her now.\"I'm the onion girl,\" Jilly Coppercorn says. \"Pull back the layers of my life, and you won't find anything at the core. Just a broken child. A hollow girl.\" She's very, very good at running. But life has just forced Jilly to stop.",
