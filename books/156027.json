  "description": "Sweet Mungo...'Mungo', An unusual name for an unusual boy. Growing up in England, at a time when homosexuality was illegal and rarely discussed. Mungo's looks are so arresting that sometimes his beauty spells danger. Abused by his father; seduced by a teacher; sodomised by a gang of roughs... Not the best upbringing. But there is hope, close friends like Amy and Tom who are willing to be there for him. Hilary, who starts as an enemy and then becomes a friend and who is maybe destined to be something much more...Mungo loves music and singing in a choir. He eventually decides to join the theatre, becoming an accomplished actor. But his sexuality remains confused, even the prospect of marriage and parenthood offers him no solace. Will he find himself or is he destined to live a life of lies?The story of Mungo is perhaps the story of every young child who ever grew up with troubles and nightmares. Or perhaps it’s the story of every young adolescent who ever questioned their sexuality. Or perhaps it’s the story of every man and woman who has ever questioned whether they will find success, their place in the world, and most importantly of all... contentment.To read Sweet Mungo is to be transported to a world of both harshness and hope, a world of pain and pleasure, and most importantly, a world that allows you to get to know and to care for Sweet Mungo.",
