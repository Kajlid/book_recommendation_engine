Reporters like her have made my life a living hell. And when she shows up again in Copenhagen again?

And my teeth are set on edge by her endless barrage of questions and snapping photos.I don’t want to find her attractive. I want to be repulsed. But...Now that we’re forced together, my resolve starts to crumble. Every time our hands brush, every damn time she bites her lip... Eventually, even my strong will can’t overcome temptation. Though it’s wrong, even though I might lose everything, I can't resist her.",
