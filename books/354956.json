  "description": "Aurelia is on the run. Stowing away on an interstellar cargo ship seems the perfect solution. Except for the fact it-s crewed by three very large, scary and extremely sexy men. Ursine traders Dov, Tarlo and Ardal are a bonded family. That means they share everything. When the golden-haired beauty reveals herself, they fully intend to share her. Far from being repelled at seeing the three men love each other, Aurelia finds the physical intimacy and passion they share together-and with her-an aphrodisiac she could easily become addicted to. But the four-way physical sharing turns into much more and, as strong emotions come into play, that sharing could come at a price none are willing to pay.",
