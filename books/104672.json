  "description": "\"In the frozen wastes of the distant future, a killer known as Harrow prepares for his final battle. Technocratic elites have poisoned his world, enslaved his neighbors, and left his entire people destitute and depraved. Now this lone guided missile of a man is willing to shed the last tatters of his humanity to exact his vengeance.In this first volume of the Next Man Saga, J.M. Salyards presents a novel that sweeps from the apocalyptic Outlands to the palatial luxury of the corridors of power, and finds Harrow about to begin a war of annihilation. Before he can, he discovers allies who might bring him back from the brink. A psycho-spiritualist teenage boy and a disgraced princess of the elites may give Harrow a final tether to life, and as wills and fists collide, the unwilling hero must choose between a future beyond his victory, or death as his only chance for peace.\"",
