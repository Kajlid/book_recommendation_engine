  "title": "A Merman Owned by Two Wolves",
  "description": "When Jordan was born, his parents feared he'd go to the sea. So, they made a request to the sea witch to have him stripped of his merman abilities, leaving him with just his DNA, their last name, and a magical pendant known as Mermother's Tear. Now at twenty-two and a recent college graduate, Jordan longs to live life underwater. Sure, he's had memorable experiences as a human, but he yearns to return to his destiny.He’s not alone in being a nonhuman creature trapped in human form. He connected online with twin wolves Rowdy and Roar, and tonight is the night to finally meet in person. Though both twins are attractive, something about Roar captivates him more than Rowdy, and Roar seems to feel the same way. But little does Jordan know what they have planned, particularly Rowdy who's the Alpha of his pack.Roar gives Jordan so much hope for something special he's never had before. Equally so when Jordan later meets Rumbly, another wolf like no other. These two wolves aren't just hot, sexy, and loving, but they could become the start of a foreign journey for Jordan. After all, not all wolves are evil. Some just want what Jordan wants: true love.Others want something else entirely, such as Jordan’s Mermother's Tear.But all Jordan wants is to return to the sea. And that's the problem. He's been stripped of his abilities, so he can never do so.Or could he?Author's Note: This book has been removed from bookstores and is no longer available.
