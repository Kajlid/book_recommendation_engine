  "description": "The Conclusion to Caged.  I had once thought that when I found the light I had been searching for in that long, dark tunnel that it would finally give me the gift I had been holding on for. I had scoured the joyless night sky for peace, a peace that only the brightness of the stars could grant. And I had endeavoured to catch that single magic snowflake in the middle of a howling snowstorm. I had been looking. Forever.  But little did I know that it WAS the sinister darkness in the tunnel that was the gift. It WAS the black reservoir of the deepest, darkest night that would be the very thing to give my chaotic soul peace. And it WAS the heaving rush of the bleakest blizzard that was filled with magic.  Anderson Cain WAS the darkness. He WAS the black peace in my soul. And within the raging pool of his wild green eyes WAS the magic. The magic that saw me. The real me. He made sure I saw me too. All of me. He’d told me he would make me accept who I really was.  I was Kloe Grant. And now – now I am the epitome of what he wanted me to be.  But when I finally let go, and I allowed that darkness to find me, neither of us was prepared for who I really was.  Death itself.  This book contains extreme violence, strong adult language and scenes of dark sex, including M/F/M.",
