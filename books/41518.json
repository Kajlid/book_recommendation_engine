  "description": "Sports writer JT Lovejoy has a chance that’s too good for a middle-aged, divorced guy to pass up—bedding a hot young intern. Of course, there might never be a bed involved, since all the steamy action goes down in the press box. Not that JT’s complaining. How can he, when a beautiful woman offers herself with no commitment? If he’s smart, he won’t question his luck. And JT is a smart man.",
