  "description": "Revolutionary War veteran Captain Isaac Ross was like his counterparts in many ways, his wealth and prominence having been built on the backs of his slaves. Unlike his counterparts, however, upon his death he left his estate for the benefit of his slaves. His will made provisions for their passage to Liberia and their establishment once there. But for years, his daughter Jane Ross and his grandson Isaac Wade fought his will in the courts. Nine years after the death of Captain Ross, his home is burned to the ground, resulting in the death of a young child. The consequences are lives lost, hearts broken, and troublesome unanswered questions.",
