  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07BCNDXWT.) Holden sees things. Lots of things. Things we would call ugly, but he believes are beautiful.  He paints sad pictures. And strums lonely guitars. He drowns out the taunting voices while shunning the expected norms.  I let them hurt him. I wasn’t strong enough to speak out. I hurt him, too, only to prove I wasn’t just like him.  But then I saw him. I heard him. I learned why Holden wasn’t CRAZY like they said.  I loved him MADLY. I fell for him DEEPLY. And alone, I decided to save a man who was the most beautiful of us all.",
