  "description": "I almost didn't publish Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It .  I was terrified.  Here I was, a CEO who'd fallen apart after his company failed, writing a book about how loving himself saved him.  I thought I'd be a laughing stock and my career would be finished.  But I stepped through the fears and shared my truth with the world.  What happened next changed my life. The book went viral.  Amazing people all over shared it online and on social media.  They bought copies for friends and family.  They wrote heartfelt reviews.  For some, this book literally saved their lives.  For others, it was the first time they ever loved themselves.  To think how close I was to giving into my fears.  An important life lesson. Many readers reached out and showed me how they'd applied it.  They asked questions.  This taught me that, despite its success, what I'd shared wasn't enough.  To create lasting impact, I had to go deeper and share a lot more.  I owed it to this book.  I owed it to everyone who would read it.  So, seven years after I first put it out, here it is.  All the questions I received, resolved.  My intention is that by the time you finish, not only will you be committed to loving yourself, you'll know exactly how to do it.  And most importantly, how to make it last. This version, although it contains the original, is significantly expanded - over four times as big.  And from all the feedback I've received, much more helpful in a practical way.  I hope it serves you well. Thank you, Kamal",
