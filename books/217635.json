  "description": "They'll do whatever it takes to save their team. But can two best friends survive a fake relationship? Luke Trent is desperate to bring his team back together. If the Tigers can't get over their slump, he'll never make it to the pros. With the LGBT-inclusive 'Rainbow Tigers' mania dying down, it'll take a crazy scheme to restore their former glory, and Luke has the perfect one in mind: Dating his best friend. Brandon Tucker has secretly been in love with Luke for years. He knows he's going to get hurt if he agrees to a pretend relationship with his very straight friend, but he can't help it. This is as close as he'll ever get to the real thing. The strength of their friendship makes their lie an easy sell, and things are looking up for the Tigers. But when Luke kisses him in front of the whole team, Brandon can't help but wonder if the only man he's ever wanted might actually want him back. With the fire of their fake romance beginning to burn true, a teammateâ€™s devastating betrayal forces them to make a difficult choice: Sacrifice their relationship to save their career, or give up everything else for the chance at a once-in-a-lifetime love.",
