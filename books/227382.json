I know in my heart that we would all still be together. But then I would have never met him.

There's no way someone like him could exist in real life, at least not in mine, but there he was. With his dark eyes smirking down at me, I felt bare. Like he saw me. He really saw me.With him, I felt untouchable. I was on top of the world. But the thing is...when you finally reach the peak it's hard not to fall. Especially when you're pushed right off the edge.Author's Note: This book contains mature situations and language intended for readers 18+. This book is a new adult & college genre .",
