Wanda was used as one of the camps guinea pigs and became a victim of cruel medical experimentation by Nazi doctors. Many of her friends died or were left with horrific physical and psychological injuries as a result of these experiments. Wanda bravely faced each day and pledged to become a doctor if she ever got out alive.
