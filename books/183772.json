  "description": "In the final chapter of the Tucker series, David Johnson introduces us to a new family – a family in need of the kind of help that only Tucker and her family can give. Benjamin Trevathan, who has Asperger’s Syndrome, and a speech impediment, is a boy saddled with adult responsibilities in the midst of his dysfunctional home. He provides the majority of care for his younger siblings and for his mother who is sick with cancer. His stepfather stays gone for days and weeks on drinking binges, only to come home to take out his anger and frustration on his family. This family’s nomadic life brings them to the house that Ella used to live in beside Tucker. Tucker sets her sites on the evil stepfather, while April, who has returned home with her own complications to live with Tucker, identifies with Benjamin’s struggles with being teased and bullied and decides she can help save him from self-destructing. This is a story of simple people engaged in heroic acts, the kinds of acts that change people’s lives.",
