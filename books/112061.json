  "description": "At only eighteen-years-old, Amber Ashborne is sole heir to the throne of Ashborne, the most powerful kingdom in Everrathe. In an attempt to earn the love and approval her emotionally abusive father has never given, the future queen raised herself to be the son he could never have; forgoing the ease and luxury of a princess's life for that of the sword and steel of a knight's. However, the King's disdain would not be overcome, and under the weight of the Ashborne crown, the young princess resigned herself to a loveless life of battle, guilt and torment. Until fate crosses her path with a mysterious young man named Emoren. Amber is caught off guard as the young commoner effortlessly breaks through the walls surrounding her, bringing an unfamiliar light to her dark, battle-ridden world. And despite being preserved for royal engagement, the future queen can't deny the feelings that quickly seize her heart. Little does she know, these forbidden feelings will not only shape her future, but that of an entire kingdom.",
