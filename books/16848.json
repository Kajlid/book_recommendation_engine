  "description": "It's the party from hell - literally - at Death's door.Everyone's favourite Goth girl, Death, practically gets pushed out of her own realm when sisters Delirium and Despair throw a wild party for the dead. It all starts when Lucifer Morningstar abdicates his throne - leaving the Key to Hell with Death's brother, Dream. As the reluctant Sandman contemplates what to do, hell's nastiest denizens are free to evacuate the premises. Unfortunately for Death, they end up in her apartment. It's up to Death to save the day and the afterlife - not to mention the carpet. Written and illustrated by Eisner Award winner and Sandman fan-favorite artist Jill Thompson, this digest also features a special sketchbook section and an introduction to the character and the ten-volume Sandman library.",
