  "title": "Memories Of Love",
  "description": "In a style reminiscent of Robyn Carr, an intensely emotional story about taking chances and risking your heart. When her family home burns down, it's the final heartbreak for Rita Jorden who has already lost her parents. Her boss, former SAS captain and head of Tamerlane Security, Ivan Novak, steps in, offering her his home and his help. But Ivan has his own demons, and although he's interested in Rita, there's darkness in his past that could cause her harm. Thrown together into a situation that's too close for comfort, this story can only end in one of two ways: in the destruction of Rita's dreams of love â€“ or the gift of healing and hope to two damaged survivors.",
