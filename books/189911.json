By stealth and cunning, the daughter of the Lord High Executioner has undone her father's cruel work, compelled to save the innocent man with her. There is no turning back -- for they are bound as one in his iron chains. Consumed by mortal fear, driven by passion, they disappear into the night...A single raven follows them. Is it an omen? Or only the first of those who would capture them? They must ride on. If captured, they will face death together. But if they reach the Highlands, he will claim her for his own...forever.",
