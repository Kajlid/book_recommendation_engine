  "description": "\"Brilliant in its discretions in dealing with the 10,000 things of the world. The poems are like narrative written in haikuistic epiphanies. Depths throughout, exemplified by my favorite, 'Twilight Post.' An excellent book of poetry. -- Jack Hirschman, author of The Blue Xul Arcane\"Precise and condensed as haikus, as tasty as pomegranates, these poems turn on a dime to reveal insights luminous as street lights on an urban night.\" -- Alejandro Murguía, Poet Laureate of San Francisco, author of Native Tongue",
