  "description": "Richard \"Vegas\" Beltran is an underachiever. That's bad for any student, but it's especially bad when you go to a magic school. Black magic needs to be taken very seriously, but Vegas has been caught smoking \"eye of newt\" in the boys' bathroom and all of his bubbling cauldrons contain ice and alcohol...His foster brother, Seth, is a bit more studious of a student. Aside from the occasional suicide attempt and girl stalking, he’s doing pretty well. Seth is worried about Vegas’ performance at this exclusive dark arts private school. Vegas is, after all, flunking out of his voodoo studies class and most of his spells backfire horrifically. He has to do something to save Vegas from failing, over dosing or getting killed, but he has no idea how to help.What Seth doesn't understand is that Vegas is in this mixed-up magic school for one reason and one reason only; to find a spell that will bring his girlfriend, Portia, back from the dead! And Vegas isn't going to let anyone stand in his way.In this \"Alice in Wonderland\" style fairy tale, we meet Seth and Vegas, two teens struggling to make the grade in this demented dystopian high school. Because there’s very few ways to get an “A” in a black magic school and none of them are good. Seth and Vegas are going to get to see if they have what it takes to make the grade, or lose their souls trying...",
