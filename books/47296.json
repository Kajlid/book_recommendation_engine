  "description": "In New York the Jazz Age of the 1920s is in a mad fever of illegal booze and fast money when Scott Longmartin arrives from the Midwest to be a journalist at a famous Manhattan gossip tabloid. Scott believes that New York will take him up and transform him into a great novelist. It will make him into someone new. Someone cosmopolitan. Someone who has never been poor.  Soon Scott meets a world famous jazz musician and his infamously wild flapper sister Lolly, and he is welcomed into their fast crowd of wealthy jazz babies. The bootleg gin flows, the hot jazz horns wail and the loose girls shimmy madly. The booming world of Manhattan glows with promise. It is everything that Scott has ever dreamed. And so is Lolly.. The blue skies of the Jazz Age seem limitless. It is a world of sheer becoming. Nothing can prevent Scott from grasping his perfect dream..   According to Lee  This is an authentic dramatization of the Jazz Age of the 1920s and the city of New York at its peak of wealth and greatness. An exploration of the real world out of which F.
