  "description": "There’s a phrase: Still waters run deep.But there’s more to it than that.Because \"still\" doesn’t denote peace. Nor calm. Nor happiness.It’s an illusion. It's chaos.The only way to handle chaos is to become it.That’s what Lucy did. She created stillness out of the chaos tumbling inside her and called the most chaotic motorcycle club in the United States her family.The Sons of Templar gave her chaos, friendship, family, danger and death.But she wouldn't want it any other way.Then he came. The one who showed her that her handle on chaos was tumultuous at best.Showed her how to stand still.And how good it could be.And how drowning in those waters comes as easy as breathing.",
