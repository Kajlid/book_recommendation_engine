  "description": "Dear Author,It was supposed to be basic find and retrieve job even if the planet was little known and in the edge of the territories. Nothing went right with that job. My ship got damaged on the landing, there is nothing but jungle out here and I have no idea where the thing I’m looking for could even be and now I have apparently found the natives too. I so don’t need any more distractions but he sure knows how to get persuasive with those hairs of his.Photo Description: In the background there are cryogenic-containers with shadowy figures inside. In the forefront is a large, muscular blue male with a headful of very long, slender tentacles ending in cockheads. He is holding a brown-haired, sculpted human man whom he’s having sex with. The man’s shirt is torn, the remnants held in place by a shoulder holster. A firearm is in his right hand, as if he’s expecting someone to walk in on them.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.
