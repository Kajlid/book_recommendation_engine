  "title": "Dear Writer, You Need to Quit",
  "description": "I know, I know, you don’t want to quit writing, and I’m not going to convince you to quit writing. (I’m really not trying to do that…) But what if you could quit other things? Things that weren’t moving the needle? Things that weren’t bringing you the outcome you want? And there are *so* many things you do need to quit, if you want to be a career author.How do I know this? Because I’ve coached thousands of writers. Six- and seven-figure authors, major award winners, midlisters, and new authors alike. And there are very important patterns to what writers need to quit, what we need to keep, and what we need to question.Those patterns are why I’m here, writing to you.Anyone can tell you what worked for them, and of course they can say, \"it might not work for you,\" but they can't tell you why. I can tell you why. - Becca",
