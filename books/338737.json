Like gods, they reigned supreme. But even gods have laws, and those laws, when broken, destroy.Zoufalství. Epätoivo. Asa.  Three words in three very different languages, and yet Soria understands. Like all members of Dirk & Steele, she has a gift, and hers is communication: That was why she was chosen to address the stranger. Strong as a lion, quick as a serpent, Karr is his name, and in his day he was King. But he is a son of strife; a creature of tragedy.

But Soria knows the words for love.",
