  "description": "Motivated by the dream of becoming the next big thing, Dever, a Brooklyn-based metal band, storm their way through New York’s nightclubs, making themselves known as a force to be reckoned with. Their intense live shows, coupled with their prowess of combining classic and contemporary elements of rock attract an ever-growing fan base with each concert. On stage and in the public eye, the band is larger than life due to front man Scott Ferrara’s passion and powerful presence. Away from the limelight and manic-depressive, Ferrara senses there is more to life than just the mind-expanding evenings of sex, drugs, and rock n’ roll and desperately seeks ways to change his complacent routine. It is only after he falls for fellow singer Amanda Campbell that he realizes the magnitude of the challenge he's taken on.",
