  "description": "Callie Lane is your typical all-American teenager, struggling with issues of love and jealousy, boys, schoolwork, picking out the right clothes, right vs. wrong, good vs. evil and navigating her way through the straits of “growing up.” The only difference is that Callie is dead. And her world is now ABOVE.When 17 year-old Callie’s life is suddenly cut short, she “wakes up” ABOVE, and soon discovers it’s not exactly what she expected. Still reeling from the fact that she is, in fact, no longer living, Callie learns that she’s also part of a select group of recently-passed teens fated to become Guardians. Not only does Callie have to go to Guardian school, her dead grandmother happens to be the headmistress and the curriculum includes revisiting every mistake she’s ever made. And since no one seems to want to give her a straight answer about anything -- including the mysterious empty room next to hers -- Callie comes to realize that life ABOVE is even more confusing than the life she just left behind.Callie must come to terms with her Watched resisting her guidance, her feelings for Logan, a boy she’s drawn to but who withholds from her, and the knowledge that she is a target for the evil that exists ABOVE. But her hardest lesson will be to understand that she has as much to give as she has to learn. Callie must choose to acknowledge and accept her gifts, embrace her fate, and become a Guardian who can make a difference that will impact the worlds below, ABOVE and beyond.",
