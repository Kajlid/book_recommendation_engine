A man named David Braun will contact the London School of Antiquities and ask for her help. He's on the trail of some unusual stolen property and Susan is the closest thing to an expert on its history - a blood-soaked history that goes back thousands of years.David will need all the help he can get as he finds himself working for a sinister client he does not trust and chasing a thief no one seems able to catch. Together they make a good team - both smart, capable and able to keep their heads in a crisis - which is just as well because the pair are about to find themselves in serious danger and out of their depth. Caught between the thief and the secretive organisation he stole from, they will need to discover the truth about the thief's mission if they are to stay alive - a truth that neither of them is prepared for.",
