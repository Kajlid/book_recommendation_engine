Sadly, he never saw the Christmas drawing she had made for him that year.Suzanna grew up to be a famous artist, but to her family, that last painting she made for her big brother was her most important work.This is the story of that gift, and how it inspired the Pullman family to keep alive the spirit of love, imagination, and hope for generations to come.",
