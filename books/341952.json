  "description": "God is the Cure, Love is the Answer is the story of Aimee Cabo's growth in spirituality and perseverance to find true love and form a family that could withstand anything. Between 1989 and 1994, her life was called \"The Case from Hell\" in the Miami media and was a tragic story of sexual and physical abuse that pitted Aimee and her sister against their parents, who denied all culpability. Throughout her life, Aimee has defied all odds to rise above legal challenges, custody battles, poverty, sexual abuse, and addiction. God is the Cure, Love is the Answer is Aimee's testimony that sainthood and sanctity may be achieved by always turning to God, love, constant prayer, and devotion.",
