  "title": "Between the Shores: Erotica with Consent",
  "description": "A volume of literary erotica centered around the possibilities of sexual negotiation.  Twenty complex, surprising, intense, and relatable stories from a spectrum of new and established writers explore something unusual in erotic someone saying no. Submissives—and dominants—safeword out of a BDSM scene. Couples (and one threesome!) discover the possibilities and boundaries of their new relationships. Past trauma rears its head. Personal preferences clash.  Between the Shores shows respect for the boundaries people set as an integral part of sex, and highlights trust, communication—and mutual pleasure.  Some call a halt to the action. Some proceed with care and caution. Some bare secrets to their partners that they’ve never before shared. And some find exciting alternatives. Through negotiation—whether serious or accompanied by laughter—they move beyond their “no” to reach what they truly healing, growth, and fulfillment both sexual and otherwise.",
