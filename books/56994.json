  "title": "To Lose a Battle: France 1940",
  "description": "During six weeks in 1940, Hitler's blitzkrieg shattered the redoubtable Maginot Line and, shortly thereafter, the French army. No historian has written a more definitive chronicle of that disaster than Alistair Horne, or one so emotionally gripping. Moving with cinematic swiftness from the battlefield to the Reichstag and the Palais de l'...lys√©e, To Lose a Battle overspills the confines of traditional military history to become a portrait of the French national soul in its darkest night.",
