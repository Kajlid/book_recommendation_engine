  "description": "Sequel to the award-winning More Ketchup than Salsa: Confessions of a Tenerife Barman.If the first six months of running the Smugglers Tavern had been a baptism of fire, the subsequent years were about as much fun as bobbing for apples in a vat of acid.Having swapped the tin roof of a cold British fish market for the sunny skies of a Spanish holiday island, Joe and Joy succeeded in thwarting the first wave of attacks from bungling bureaucrats, bewildered holidaymakers and their own spectacular ineptitude. What they didnâ€™t realise was that their enemies were regrouping. Not only that, but those enemies had made camp a lot closer to home, enemies that would make their encounters with the exploding gas bottles, East European squatters and big-time Charlies featured in More Ketchup than Salsa seem like chapters from Enid Blyton.The trials and tribulations of attempting to make a better life abroad continue... with disastrous consequences.A must-read reality check for anybody who has ever pondered a move to sunnier climes.",
