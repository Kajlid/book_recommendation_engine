  "description": "\"F.B. Meyer's devotional studies on biblical characters reflect a rare depth of spiritual experience. These great figures were not so different from ourselves--sometimes weak, indifferent, willful. Yet they had their moments of faith, humility, and courage, and God was able to use these for His greater purposes. God's faithfulness, which not only accepts but transforms such inconsistency, calls us to more effective Christian living.",
