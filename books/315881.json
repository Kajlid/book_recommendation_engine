In the end, will being Alessia Hastings be enough?Twelve months in Hell with Lucifer has given new meaning to the term helicopter parent.But when the heavenly realm decides to squash this dimension like a bug, Lucifer becomes the lesser of two celestial evils.My search for Lucifer’s blade leads me back to the Academy. Sadly, my homecoming is accompanied by three necromancers hell bent on making the supernaturals their subjects.I’m no stranger to being ostracised for my blood. The snide remarks and death threats just roll off my back these days. What I can’t ignore is the thrumming of darkness between me and a certain Nephilim who just won’t take no for an answer.Kai and I have never been a fairy tale couple. Cheating death has left scars on both of us that might never heal. And the path I’m on could break us irrevocably.The fate of this dimension is a game played by immortal deities. But if I’m going down, then I’m taking everybody with me. And I will win even if it means sacrificing everything.My life started with a prophecy. With any luck, it will end with death.Dear Reader: As the characters in Bloodline age, it felt right to increase the maturity level of some of the scenes in the story. Please note that Bloodline Prophecy is recommended for upper YA readers due to their steamy nature.Bloodline Prophecy is book 7 and the final book in this arc of the Bloodline Academy series. It is an Australian Young Adult Urban Fantasy series filled with pulse-pounding action, snarky dialogue, and slow burn romance. Think Buffy meets Supernatural Academy.",
