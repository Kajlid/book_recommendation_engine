  "description": "Esme Pederson's life needs a makeover. She dreams of quitting her library job at a small Minnesota college to become a full-time weaver, but it's a risky thing to do, and her ailing father needs her. She also longs for a lover like the alpha hero in her favorite romance novel, but when a lightning strike sends her on a wild ride to eleventh-century Norway, the fierce Viking warrior who buys her as a bed slave turns out to be a sexist tyrant.\nStein Magnuson has his own issues to contend with. Although embittered by his dead wife's infidelity and longing for vengeance against her former lover, he can't risk a clan blood feud. The last thing he needs is another woman, especially one who thinks females have rights! Irresistibly drawn to each other, however, their passion flares hotter than a volcano, but can love grow when neither is willing to compromise and all they ever do is argue?",
