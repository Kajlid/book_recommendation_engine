  "description": "Having walked more than 3,000 miles from Trafalgar Square to Morocco, Paula Constant finds herself at the westernmost edge of the Sahara Desertand the brink of sanity. Sahara is the story of Paula's struggle to overcome her innermost demons and take control of her journey, her camels, and the men she hires to guide her through one of planet's most extreme regions. Illness, landmines, and political red tape stand between Paula and the realization of a life's dream. Though the wheels have fallen off her marriage on the course of her journey and her funds are quickly drying up, she is determined to complete the walk through the romantic Big Empty of Northern Africa to Cairo. Both a thrilling adventure and a story of joy, heartache, inspiration, and despair, Sahara isabove alla celebration of the greatness of human spirit in all its guises.",
