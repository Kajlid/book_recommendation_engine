  "title": "Taming The Invisible Dragon: Healing, Happiness & Self-Realization",
  "description": "There is an ever-increasing number of people who find themselves in transition. They are moving from one level of consciousness to another, and the processes involved in their personal and spiritual transformation can be simultaneously frightening and awe-inspiring. They need guidance and inspiration from others who have traveled the path of healing, happiness, and self-realization. In this heart-felt and inspirational book, author Sloan Rawlins shares the insights and hard-earned wisdom she obtained during her own personal journey. Having survived severe child abuse, a near death experience, and incapacitating illness, Sloan reconnected with her spirit and learned to create authentic happiness, peace, and joy in her own life. She blends elements of spiritual philosophy, depth psychology, and personal experience into an easy to read guide for personal and spiritual transformation. It is a must read for those who have the desire and determination to heal their wounds, to change their thoughts, and to create better tomorrows.",
