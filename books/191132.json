  "description": "Oops is an understatement. Chase Banter thought her life couldn't get any weirder. Her mother has taken up private investigating, her writer's group's helpful suggestions have led to severe writer's block, and her girlfriend's family is nuts. Growing up isn't high on her list of priorities. What grip Chase has on her life is severely challenged when her girlfriend tells her about the little oops at the gynocologist. Seems the doctor mixed up the rooms and now Gitana is pregnant. The reality of Gitana's radiant glow—and growing waistline—finally convinces Chase to accept that she's about to become a parent. There's only one thing to do: Chase embarks on a nine-month plan to grow up, once and for all.  2nd edition",
