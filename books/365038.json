  "title": "Sleepover at Gramma's House",
  "description": "Going to Gramma?s takes plenty of preparation. Granddaughter packs her overnighty trunk and says goodbye to Mom, Dad, little fish and baby in the bed. She can?t wait to see her silly millie gramma! Together at last, the two spend a day full of dancing, painting each other and partying with a razzle and a dazzle before, finally, resting together in a ricky rocky swing. What a day! Barbara Joosse?s spirited text combined with Jan Jutte?s lively illustrations create this delightful story. Full of engaging, bouncy language that zips right along, this is an original picture book that captures the loving relationship between a young-hearted gramma and her enthusiastic granddaughter.",
