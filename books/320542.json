  "description": "The Challenge!Knowing his parents would object, Chris had made the raft in secret. He would lie on it for hours, dreaming of all the distant towns and cities he wanted to see. But late one fall afternoon, it slipped out of the shallows where he kept it hidden and into the dark, powerful current of the river.All through the night Chris clung to his raft as it swept past the empty miles of wilderness to the South. When he finally swam ashore, he faced a long, nightmare journey home. Barefoot and equipped with nothing but a broken-bladed pocket-knife, Chris had to find food, make his own fire, stave off wild animals- and reach safety before the first snow fell.",
