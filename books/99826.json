  "description": "Alexandria belongs to the Hunters of the Harvest Moon, the most feared group of vampire hunters in the country. One reason for this is that Alex is a dampyr, the hybrid offspring of a human and a vampire, the only one known to exist in the world. Taught by her uncle since birth, she hates the vampires and has devoted her life to their eradication. There is only one thing that distracts her from this mission, a fellow hunter and werewolf named Jayson, the love of her life. When everyone in her life is tragically taken away, Alex finds herself not only alone, but also pregnant. For the sake of her baby, she must seek out Kyros, her father and the vampire responsible for her motherâ€™s death. She learns from him that her child is part of an ancient prophecy. He is destined to be the link that will unite the Children of Lilith with the Children of Eve and end a war that has raged for centuries. Not all want to see this child bring peace, though. There are some that would use him and the prophecy to enslave mankind and control the world. In order to save him, Alex will have to call on all her skills as a hunter, as well as, embrace the vampires she once considered her enemies.",
