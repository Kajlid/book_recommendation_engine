  "description": "When Sam Howard's best friend gets him a part-time job at Bianchi Bytes, he's in heaven. That is until he's reassigned. Working for Jace Rawlings is pure torture. Although Sam has a crush on the gorgeous vice-President, Jace won't give him the time of day, in or out of the office. Trying to settle into his new position as vice-President, the last thing Jace needs is temptation a few floors down. When a moment of passion erupts on a forced business trip, old wounds are reopened. Who can blame him for trying to get the object of his attraction to quit, even if the only way to do it is to act like a jerk?",
