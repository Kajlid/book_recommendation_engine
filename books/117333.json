  "description": "“Fans of Scottish lore or bookstore mysteries like Lorna Barrett’s and Carolyn Hart’s will enjoy this one.”—Booklist    Thanks to the Western Maine Highland Games, Moosetookalook, Maine, has never seen so many bare legs walking its streets. But instead of wondering who’ll win the hammer throw, everyone’s asking who got kilt. Especially Liss MacCrimmon, purveyor of the town’s Scottish Emporium, since it’s also her wedding weekend. And nothing scotches up nuptial bliss like a dead body.   But who’d go medieval on a professor, no matter how nutty? As much as Liss tries to keep her fingers out of the sleuthing cake, she finds herself again dead center of a Moosetookalook murder mystery. If Liss doesn’t solve this one, and quick, she might never say “I do,” let alone “’til death do us part”… “Filled with gems of Scottish history and culture, this intelligent entry will appeal to newcomers and established fans alike.”—Publishers Weekly",
