Besides the fact she was just the maid, there were far too many reason besides the obvious that they could not be together. Still she found herself throwing caution to the wind and knew she would pay whatever the cost for the chance at one more kiss.Forbidden fruit was always sweeter. The saying rang true for Jordan and a flame long thought extinguished was awakened inside him whenever Amelia was near. Time and again he sought her out against his better judgment and his hardened hearts wishes. Denying his desire for her was no longer becoming and option.",
