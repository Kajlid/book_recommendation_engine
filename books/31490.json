  "title": "You're a Hero, Daley B!",
  "description": "Daley B's life is full of questions. What is he? Where should he live? What should he eat? But the question he finds most perplexing of all is why his feet are so big. Jazzy D, the weasel, pays him a visit and puts him straight as to his identity, before pouncing for the kill. Quick as a flash Daley B turns his back and kicks the weasel up in the air and back to where he came from. The other rabbits jump and cheer. \"You're a hero Daley B!\" they cry. \"That's funny,\" says Daley B. \"I thought I was a rabbit\". Jon Blake has also written \"Impo\", \"The Hell Hound of Hooley Street\", \"The King of Rock and Roll\", \"Geoffrey's First\" and \"Holiday in Happy Street\". Axel Scheffler has also illustrated \"Sam Who Was Swallowed By a Shark\".",
