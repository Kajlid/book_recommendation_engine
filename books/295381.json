  "title": "It Works: How and Why: The Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous",
  "description": "This book is a discussion of the Twelve Steps and Twelve Traditions of Narcotics Anonymous. It is meant to help the reader determine his own interpretation of the principles contained in Narcotics Anonymous' steps and traditions. The authors hope the reader will find personal growth, understanding, and empathy in the following pages. The book's primary purpose is to carry the message to the still-suffering addict. The reasons the program works, the how and why of recovery, are found in many places, in each other, in one's relationship with a Higher Power, in everyone's hearts and minds, and finally, in the collective wisdom of the members. The principal endeavor in the development of this book has been to capture that collective wisdom in written form. The authors pray that this book truly represents the therapeutic value of one addict helping another.",
