Her boyfriend Damien should be a comfort but he is far from it. Instead, it is Aiden she increasingly comes to rely on. In grief they understand each other.Unable to forget her encounter with the ‘perfect stranger’, Isabella heads to Cornwall to track him down but, as three worlds collide, tragedy threatens to strike again…Set in North Cornwall and featuring members from the popular Runaway series – Joseph, Layla, Hannah, Jim and Mick – The Return can be read as a standalone novel or as the third and final book in the trilogy.",
