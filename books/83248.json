  "description": "Thor has faded. Odin has faded. The two most powerful gods in the nine realm are gone, this has thrown Asgard into a short chaos. The royal blood line seems to disappear slowly everyday. As the remaining descendants of the bloodline scatter for an heir, a servant and friend of Thor, Derek Long has other plans. Orion, the first mortal son of Thor walks on Midgard. Other children of the gods also reside on Middle Earth. Under the leadership of Derek Long they will prepare for Ragnarok, the end of the world. The forces they face are far more powerful and ancient than they could possibly realize. Behind the leadership of Orion, the son of Thor, they will with possibly no help at all from the gods prepare for the end of the world. Surely they are doomed... Or are they?",
