  "description": "It was such a shame that she was in the wrong place, at the wrong time. She knew that we would come for her.We had seen her delicate face that night, hidden in the shadows, and she had seen what we did, her gasp of horror giving her away. She was perfection, beauty, and oozed goodness but that wasn’t going to save her from us. No one could ever find out our secret, which meant we needed to get rid of her. Killing her wasn’t an option and scaring her into silence wasn’t as easy of a task as we expected. She was strong, resilient, and smart doing whatever she could to evade us. Without even knowing it she turned it into a game, and so we became blood thirty wolves. Run and we’ll find you. Keep our secret and you might live. That is until someone else finds out what we did…**This is a standalone DARK bully romance. This book contains scenes that may be triggering to some readers.
