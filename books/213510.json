Or your future. Known in small town Munising, Michigan as the local witch, Lily cared not at all what others thougth of her, including her brother's best friend - until Will, after a ten year absence running from ghosts of his own, returns home to open a business building log homes.Past, present and future collide as Will and Lily are thrown together in events not of their making, but in the end are ones they must overcome in order to save each other from getting singed by the fire blazing between them, as well as the one being built by others that could burn them alive.",
