  "title": "The Billionaire Who Boned Me",
  "description": "When billionaire pharmaceutical heir Tristan comes into Lisa's life, she can't seem to say no to his demands. He's rough and he's tough, but he's good looking and generous, as well. Will she take him home for Thanksgiving, or just take her punishment and his money and walk away? A man like Tristan makes walking away nearly impossible.First installment of the seven-part twisting, dirty series adventurous readers are hooked on. Short story, approximately 2000 words. Explicit sex! Adults only!Warning: This is not a love story. Romantic events may set the stage for parts of the tale, but make no mistake: Diary of a Fuckdoll is rude, explicit, dirty erotica. Non-con, dub-con, gangbang, cloning, sleep sex and forced breeding...who knows where this series will end? Will there be a Happily Ever After in the final installment? Only A. Violet End knows.\"...an erotic adventure that is completely, delightfully bonkers - exploding any attempt at suspension of disbelief and throwing our heroine into a totally unbelievable drug-fueled romp that combines a \"50 Shades\" pastiche with ridiculous sci-fi overtones. As a result, it's fantastic. A. Violet End has a truly unique voice and vision and as a result her writing stands head and shoulders above what is fast becoming a crowded market of repetitive, unoriginal female-targeted erotica.\" ~Amazon reader review from \"Militant Ginger\"Up for it?
