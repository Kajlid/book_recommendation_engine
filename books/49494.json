Agnes makes it her personal mission to find out, and she's not letting the fact she's seventy-two get in the way.

Life for Agnes and Eleanor is shaken up when Agnes' former boss and secret crush comes to Tadium. Before long, the lady sleuths have more on their hands to contend with as goons roll into town and bullets begin to fly. Adult content.",
