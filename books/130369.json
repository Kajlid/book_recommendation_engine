  "description": "Confessions 10, 11, and 12 (London Brown)Confessions of a Politician (London Brown #10)The shattered reality of the truth I sought. I'm Caden Jacob Carrington (V) the Fifth. The truth is most men's salvation, but not for men like me. Politics is my chosen affliction. I lie for a living, or massage the truth to suit me. The one constant about truth is that it's identical to the theory of relativity: neither uniform nor absolute in the minds of men.So why is it so important for me to uncover the truth about Desniah Williams, a.k.a. London Brown, when neither will willingly provide facts…Confessions of a Philanthropist (London Brown #11)The delicate balance between protection, control, and depravity begins to unravel. I’m Rhys Christos Edward Stowell, a philanthropist on the verge of exile from a suffocating state of corruption. My lack of conformity to perceived norms has earned me a reputation of being difficult. I rather like it that way.Beguiled by a woman who uses the oldest profession to torture herself and punish those that love her, I’m ever her dutiful friend. But I want much more…After years of being neatly boxed in the friend category, she offers me surrender. Or the semblance of it….Confessions of a Daughter (London Brown #12)She who dwells beneath the surface.I’m Desniah Williams, the daughter of an influential member of the British Parliament. The devil incarnate got his hooks in me. For the attention and praise he lavished on me, I gave him every last shred of my soul. I was a cheap whore. London commands her weight in gold. Two men one a politician on the verge of greatness and the other a philanthropist on the cusp of corruption, each own a piece of me.",
