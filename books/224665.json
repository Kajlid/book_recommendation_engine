  "description": "Librarian's note: There is an Alternate Cover Edition for this edition of this book here.As Alpha, Dimitris Volkov is accustomed to making decisions. Whether it concerns professional matters at his investment firm or the personal affairs of his friends, he does not hesitate to follow his instincts. His pack expects and even welcomes his counsel, but a certain sexy chef is not so keen to accept his assistance.  Having broken free from a disastrous marriage to an egotistical man, culinary instructor, Cate Darling, values her newly-found independence above all else. When she stumbles upon a tall, muscular, and oh-so-naked Dimitris swimming in the pool, she is instantly and inexorably drawn to him. Cate cannot deny that the two have chemistry, but can she maintain her hard-won autonomy when she finds herself up to her crÃªpes in dominant Alpha behavior?  Naked Wolves is a brand new series featuring the sexy leaders of the Volkov shifter pack. WARNING: These books contain adult language, explicit love scenes, and super sexy, super naked shifters. Intended for mature audiences only.",
