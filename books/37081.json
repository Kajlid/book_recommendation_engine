  "description": "Clear, strong lines and radiant colors that seem to smile at the reader characterize Mies van Hout’s drawings.  In Happy, Mies shows all the emotions a young child encounters. Each double page spread is devoted to one fish, showing a particular emotion with its name in lettering that expresses the same feeling.  Swim into Happy where the dazzling fish sparkle against the dark background and let the images spark laughter and empathy.",
