  "description": "Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found hereThere's only one thing Bianca Cruz wants: to get her sorority house back. Well, that and to punch Harrison Wagner in his unmentionables. He's the sexy jerk who orchestrated her sorority's demise and stole their abandoned house for his frat. To get revenge, Bianca makes it her mission to unearth the secret Harrison desperately wants to keep hidden. But as she grows closer to him in order to crack his carefully manicured facade, their witty banter and chemistry crackles to a crescendo. Which was definitely NOT in the plan. Just as Bianca gives in to her escalating feelings, she discovers the scandalous secret Harrison has been hiding. Exposing it would get Harrison's frat expelled and hers reinstated, but how can she turn him in when she's falling for him?",
