Or is she?Asher continues to accept his destiny, though he suffers. Gwyn will do anything to protect him, including treachery. And Derek, a demon with no past and only mocking charm as his guise, is planning the biggest coup of all. And he knows exactly how to begin… Macy. A battle of wills, a fight between love and evil and a wish to be noble all intertwine in Book 2 of the Dark Souls Series, but it may come as a surprise to discover what makes a true villain, and who--despite all obstacles--will be the one to fall in love first.DISCLAIMER: As the characters grow into their roles, they will find themselves in more mature situations. Please keep in mind that Entwined includes some profanity, minor sexual situations, and violence.",
