  "description": "It is 1961, and thirteen year old Katie is facing a summer full of conflict. First, instead of letting her find her own work for the season, Katie's father has arranged for two less than satisfactory baby-sitting jobs. Worse, Katie has been forcibly inducted into the 'loser' Girl Scout troop organised by her only friend Cynthia's controlling and clueless mother. A much anticipated visit to her former home in Texas and ex-best friend Cherylanne proves disappointing. And then comes an act of betrayal that leaves Katie questioning her views on friendship, on her ability not to take those she loves for granted, and most important, on herself.",
