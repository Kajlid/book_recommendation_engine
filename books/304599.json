  "title": "F*ck Her: Term Three",
  "description": "As Amelie navigates the secret world of The Order, she must contend with school, new responsibilities, even more mysteries, and balancing her four relationships.How much can a girl handle before she bends?Quite a lot it would seem.But when old threats resurface out of the woodwork, Amelie may have no choice but to bendâ€¦otherwise this time, she may just break.***This book carries an 18+ warning. F*ck Her is the finale to the series and you need to have read F*ck Yeah (Book 2.5) to understand the resolution of the cliffhanger at the end of F*ck Off. As always the book contains hot guys, foul language, sexy scenes and references to past trauma and bullying.",
