  "description": "Eighteen-year-old student teachers Katie, Aoife and Naomi, all seek love inside and outside of the classroom. The story follows their first year as they each face the challenge of the transition from school girl to school teacher.‘The boy sitting in the front row of the first class Katie had ever taught looked very familiar. This is because, only two nights earlier, her lips had been glued to his on the dance floor of Plug on Matilda Street.’‘She was too busy being transfixed by the fact that her fantasy figure now had an outline; Aoife had a stencil with which to imagine and create whatever she liked.’‘Naomi’s first kiss at eighteen-years of age and she couldn’t be sure how or why it happened, if it happened at all.’",
