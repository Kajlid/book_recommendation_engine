  "title": "Naked in Dangerous Places: The Chronicles of a Hungry, Scared, Lost, Homesick, but Otherwise Perfectly Happy Traveler",
  "description": "Finally, after years as a struggling radio host, Cash Peters has been given his own TV adventure show on a big-time travel network. The idea is “Let’s dump him in an unfamiliar culture in a faraway land with no money and no place to stay, and see what happens.”Unfortunately, there is one major Cash doesn’t want to go. Not only is he NOT the adventurous type, he is afraid of nearly everything and horribly allergic to the rest.Bottom they’ve given the show to the wrong guy.Naked in Dangerous Places is the story of one man’s efforts to remain sane in an insane world. Told with wit and shameless honesty, it documents a yearlong journey through exotic lands, from Kenya to Cambodia, Morocco to Dubai, as Cash drops in on fascinating cultures, eating, drinking, even sleeping in cow-dung huts with the locals, and eventually proving the truth of the old saying “What doesn’t kill you makes you stronger.” Though, to be honest, killing you is more likely.",
