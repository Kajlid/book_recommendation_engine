  "description": "Christmas is coming, and there's a lot to be done â€“ from baking cookies to sending out cards to decorating the tree. Ma, Pa, and their seven cubs take their preparations most seriously, for on Christmas Eve, Pa has a very important job to do. He loads the toys from his workshop into a sleigh and takes off to deliver them all over the world! And delightful endpapers show where the family's friends, such as the spectacled bear, snowy owl, and reindeer, live throughout the world.With a simple, joyful rhyming text and her signature warm, detailed illustrations, Chris Conover celebrates the happy anticipation of Christmas that makes the season so wonderful.",
