  "description": "You’d think that it would be pretty cool finding out that you’re a Celtic witch in the 21st century, wouldn’t you? Well, not for Morrigan \"Mo\" Reilly. After the death of her adoptive parents in a tragic car accident, she finds her powers steadily growing in the turmoil of guilt and grief. She’s fallen out with friends and family, and her relationship with Aidan—Calliaghstown's adorable young police officer—is hanging in the balance. Mo wants nothing more than to be a normal teenage girl once more. Yet fate has other things in store for her. Violently thrown into a fantastical realm of faeries and mythological creatures, Mo is desperate to find her way back home. But first she must face her demons, and above all the shadowy presence she has been trying to outrun for months—her father.",
