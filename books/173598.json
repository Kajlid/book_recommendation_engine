  "description": "Four carefree twenty-somethings. A desolate desert in Chile. An ancient Incan curse. The Atacama Desert, the driest place on earth, is home to many exotic customs and primitive traditions—as well as deadly curses. When reckless Dai removes an ancient tomahawk from an Incan burial chamber in the desert, he and his friends are overcome with a sudden unease. Soon, they find they are leaving unthinkable violence and death in their wake. Something is after them. Is it a demented and dangerous person pursuing them? Or is it an ageless evil—the curse of the Incas? Will Dai and his friends make it out of the Atacama with their lives? Atacama is an intelligent blend of fantasy and horror that will have you on the edge of your seat.",
