These are true tales and are meant as encouragement and support to anyone thinking about adopting a new dog into their life. While we have found happiness with our choices, and giving these dogs a new lease on life, it has not come without its challenges and frustration. Our Hang in there! The rewards will come if you are willing to love and open your heart and allow your new friend to take a spot in it... Just make sure to tell him to \"stay!\"",
