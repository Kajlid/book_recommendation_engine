  "description": "From USA Today and Wall Street Journal bestselling author Meagan Brandy comes an all-new forbidden romance featuring a possessive hero … who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. I fell for a man I'm not allowed to have…He’s rough, rugged, and utterly unpredictable. He’s not cautious or contemplative. He’s a volcano. Silent and steady one second, and a complete nightmare in the next. But that’s not the worst of it. This guy? He’s an outsider and in my world outsiders don’t belong. They’re unwanted, unwelcome and known to disappear without a trace, yet he doesn’t seem to care. After one night of reckless rebellion, the tattooed tyrant keeps coming back, sneaking into my world without permission, and causing trouble I can’t allow. I should end this now before my father discovers his existence and does it for me, but he won’t allow it. He says, like it or not, I’m his now, that nothing and no one will stand in his way. Not even me…",
