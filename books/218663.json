  "description": "I’m Kai Watson, and I have a secret. Each night, my spirit leaves my body and travels to a new location. Thanks to my gift, I’m now the sole witness to the brutal murder of upperclassman Darla Baxter. I wish I could tell someone, but I never saw the murderer’s face. When my travels are replaced by nightmares, there’s only one way to get them back. I have to catch the killer myself.On my search for answers, I continue to bump into Darla’s brother, Collin, who’s as dreamy as he is sweet. If we don’t catch the killer, I might never learn to open my heart to him—and I may lose my gift forever.",
