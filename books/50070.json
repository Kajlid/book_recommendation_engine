  "description": "The Ghost Wars is a literary science fiction work focused on identity, diversity and the spiritual underpinnings of the nature of good and evil. Set in Vancouver, Canada; our protagonist RCN Captain Billington sees the world from a higher vantage point of a world in which money is no longer man’s ruler, where the health of the planet and the body politic trump all.Alternating between three interconnecting lives, Jason Bowen, Cole Billington and Cecil Smith each have their own individual experiences of being the outlier in their world. Jason’s autistic neurology has found creative expression through the development of an intricately layered inner world. Cole’s bicultural heritage as a despised alien species with a lifespan of five centuries gives him an inherent sense of how autistics view the world. Cole’s war torn childhood on Garconer Colony has left him with his own dislocated inner aspects. Sucked up by a spatial-temporal gravity well; Cole was torn out of his own time and has been working with the Commonwealth Protection Bureau since its inception in nineteen ten. Born in nineteen hundred; Cecelia Smith began working at the CPB in nineteen twenty eight, going by the name Cecil. Cecil’s life as a transgender man parallels Jason’s own gender queer one.The Ghost Wars aims to bring readers a new understanding of the issues surrounding gender variation, atypical neurology and spirituality with a futuristic twist. By utilizing a narrative dialogue reminiscent of Plato’s ‘Republic’, characters discuss issues of gender identity, autistic neurology and the legitimacy of emerging Gnostic cults.Edition 2 has an added time line of the Ghost Wars.",
