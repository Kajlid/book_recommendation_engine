  "description": "A psychological thriller by a mistress of suspense at the top of her form and 1956 winner of the Edgar Allan Poe Award. What starts with a crank call from an old school chum sets the lonely, aloof, financially comfortable Miss Helen Clarvoe on a path as predictable only as madness. Lured from her rooms in a second-rate residential Hollywood hotel, she finds herself stranded in the more perilous terrain of extortion, pornography, vengeance, and ultimately murder.",
