  "description": "He is trained and ready for war. Instead of leading Marines into combat, a Marine Captain is given the mission of advising an Iraqi Army battalion in one of the most violent cities in Iraq. The collected stories span seven months of nearly constant combat in 2006 and 2007, at the height of the insurgency in Iraq. This book is the raw, visceral story of a combat adviser with a lot more combat than advising.",
