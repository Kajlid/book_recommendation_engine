  "title": "Never Let Go",
  "description": "Inspired by true events...The first day of college gives every girl a chance to reinvent herself. I go and screw mine up by meeting the most gorgeous guy I've seen in five years while talking to my cat. But Andrew Crowner is far from judgmental. By the end of our interaction, he has me smitten by his easy manner and kind smile. And from the way his eyes linger on me before he leaves, I start to think that maybe Iâ€™ve caught his attention, too. I let myself believe that luck may finally be on my side. That is, until I stumble on my roommate, and her overnight guest: Spencer Ashford. Lean, tattooed, and sexy as sin, Spencer is exactly the type I need to avoid. I would have no trouble with that... were it not for his swift and inexplicable interest in me. Suddenly, I go from a girl with next-to-no experience with boys to one caught in the crosshairs of two completely different men. Andrew's interest is wholesome and sweet. Spencer's is edgy and raw. My choice should be easy. But there are always complications, and sometimes, matters of the heart take the least expected turns.",
