Unknowingly, she'd embroiled herself in a deadly game from which there seemed no way out. Now she was home. Would they welcome her back? What if trouble followed? Most importantly, did Cal still work the ranch?Brian Calhoun, Cal to his friends, hated Leah when she'd left, but hated himself even more for not going after her. Now she was back and more lovely than ever. Would his adolescent love for her return, develop into something more, or die a slow death at the hands of this new Leah?Trouble does follow Leah home, and her ex will stop at nothing—even murder—to silence her. Will the terror draw Leah and Cal closer together or drive them apart forever?",
