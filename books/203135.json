  "title": "Destroyer of Light",
  "description": "The marriage of Hades and Persephone blossoms and their mysterious grove in the world below thrives... ...while the sunlit world withers. Demeter holds out in Eleusis, pushing both mankind and the gods to frozen starvation in order to reclaim her daughter. The newly married rulers of the dead must reach an accord with Persephone's mother to stay her deadly course- and come face to face with sacrifice, responsibility, and the balance of power among the gods. Destroyer of Light concludes the erotic romance begun in Receiver of Many: a battle of wills among the gods is writ large across the dying earth, a cruel sorcerer-king faces his trial, and the King and Queen of the Underworld realize a destiny that the Fates alone could have foreseen.",
