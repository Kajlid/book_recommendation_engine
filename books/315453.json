  "description": "A rookie cop. A team of supernatural detectives. A vigilante kitty shifter breaking bad. My name is Cat McKenzie, and despite what people might think, I don’t enjoy being chased down darkened streets at night by a ten-foot shadow man who can literally make me die of fright.Of course, that’s how all this started—the discovery of an underground fight club stocked completely with supernatural slaves. The plot thickens when seemingly unlinked murders start to form a pattern I begin to recognize. A supernatural fight club, possessed berserkers and an accidental enslavement, I’m pretty sure I’m getting Punk’d by life right now and I’d like to call cut on this scene.",
