  "description": "\"Will Eno is an original, a maverick wordsmith whose weird, wry dramas gurgle with the grim humor and pain of life.\"—GuardianAs a friendship develops between longtime resident John Dodge and new arrival Mary Swanson, the lives of the inhabitants of Middletown intersect in strange and poignant ways in a journey that takes them from the local library to outer space and points between. Will Eno has been called \"a Samuel Beckett for the John Stewart generation\" (New York Times); Middletown features a wide array of characters—Cop, Mechanic, Librarian, to name just a few—who together populate the play with his trademark subversive style.Will Eno is the author of Thom Pain (based on nothing), which ran for a year Off-Broadway and was a 2005 Pulitzer Prize finalist. Other works include Oh, the Humanity and other good intentions, The Flu Season, Tragedy: a tragedy, and Intermission.",
