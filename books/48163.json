  "description": "When the American dream fails to materialize for Steve Byrne he asks what the hell is he doing here? A true story of how the American dream never seemed to exist, where super heroes were just for the big screen and real life is mush! Forget prosperity and success. The “promise” that anyone through hard work, and determination could achieve anything they set their mind to in the United States is literally a dream turned into a nightmare.Steve Byrne’s world has collapsed! Who do you turn to when there is nobody else? This is his story, a story he may regret! Perhaps what is within this book is too metaphoric to be readily understood fully. To fail in life means to give up, there are times when all answers, all explanations fail. A true emotional journey that anyone can relate to … a story of misery! Is he an asswhole? You decide!WHAT THE CRITICS ARE SAYING“What A Loser” - Central High School Student Weekly Newspaper“He has a nice head of hair, but a damaged brain” - Hair Club for Men“Painful to read. Steve is a sound example for the Catholic Church’s consideration of reversing itself for late term or post birth abortion.” - Catholic Cremation Society of America“After reading, use the pages as rolling papers and smoke the book.” - Thompson Cigar Club“This person is sick and disturbing. We hope to have a cover story on him in the future.” - Behavioral Health Magazine“Steve is a nitwit.” - Superintendant of Mankato Area Public Schools“Knowing how poorly Steve types and spells, the sheer length of the book is a literary accomplishment.” - School Office Co-Worker",
