  "description": "(Burst) Now—escaped form the juvenile catalog and running wild with adults!It’s funny, it’s fun—an irrestible “spoof”!With tongue planted firmly in cheek, this “dino owner’s manual” amusingly explains what every human must know before adopting a new saurus. Find out what should go into the basic toolkit (a stout shovel is helpful and so are reinforced gauntlets); which species thrive in household life and which will cause BIG problems; and what dinosaurs are just right for circuses and zoos, in security, and for giving eggs and meat. For every dinosaur covered, there’s information on feeding, breeding, housing, and availability; maps of where they lived; details on weight and size; as well as other pertinent facts. The illustrations cleverly mix photography and art to bring humans and dinos together for the first time.",
