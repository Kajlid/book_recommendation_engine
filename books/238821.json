  "description": "When bigfoot researcher Professor Berton Sorel goes missing in the temperate rainforest of Roanoke Ridge, Oregon, help is summoned in the form of his former star pupil: Laura Reagan, online science populist and avowed skeptic. But what begins as a simple search-and-rescue operation takes a drastic turn when a body is discovered - and the body isn't the professor. Caught in the fallout of the suspicious death, perplexed by a sudden wave of Bigfoot sightings, and still desperately searching for Professor Sorel, Reagan reluctantly admits two things: one, that her old mentor was right about there being secrets hidden in Roanoke Ridge; and two, that it's up to her to uncover them.",
