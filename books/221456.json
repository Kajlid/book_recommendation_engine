  "description": "In deserted, snowbound towns and along empty roads, the frozen dead hunt for the living. But death in winter takes many forms...

Cut off from her friends in the Bay Area, grieving for the man she loved and lost, she has linked up with a team of Army Rangers. Fearing attachment, Skye keeps her distance, but there is a greater fear; the Omega Virus isn't finished with her, and she may well be changing into the thing she fears most...  ARMY CAPTAIN LEE SALLINGER lost men in California during a failed rescue mission. He's on foot, low on supplies and ammo, and his only mission now is to keep his remaining squad alive and get them home to Reno. He must attempt the impossible; lead his Rangers across the Sierra Nevada in the deep of winter, into the heart of a killer storm and into the teeth of a merciless enemy...  PEPPER DAVIS, country music superstar, had the world at her feet. Now she's starving, trapped on her tour bus in Donner's Pass and slowly freezing to death. Alone and afraid, she watches the dead close in through the deepening snow. She wants to survive, but that will mean summoning a courage she knows she doesn't have...  Risen from the legions of the walking dead, a cluster of fearsome Hobgoblins has formed a pack, and is stalking the small band of survivors. Led by a massive and terrifying Alpha, they will stop at nothing to bring down their prey...",
