  "description": "More than simply a modern love story, Leaving Green Island is a poignant yet lighthearted tale of friendship, family, and the search for a place to belong in the complex world of today's twenty-something women. With a new job at a prestigious Chicago law firm and an engagement ring on her finger, everything seems to be falling into place for Brecken Pereira these days. However, all this perfection quickly unravels when Reed Whalen, Breckenâ€™s first love, unexpectedly resurfaces. Despite the years that have passed since Brecken and Reed met as teenagers on exclusive Green Island in northern Michigan, Brecken has never been able to fully escape her lingering heartache over the unresolved end of their relationship. After Reed's return, Brecken is torn between her longing for the past and the world she has carefully built for herself since Reed vanished from her life years before. Her relatable and complex relationships with her two best friends provide the backbone that supports Brecken, both as the life she knows quickly dissolves around her and as she struggles to pick up the pieces. {This book contains underage drinking and a bit of explicit language and sexual content.}",
