  "description": "GianCarlo, son of a powerful dignitary, at twenty-three is already tired of living. Battling addiction, isolation, and the trauma of his impossibly strict upbringing, Gian was only living to die. That is until he met his Mate. Finally, Gian had found something to live for, yet having her could cost him everything. During the peak of a quarter-life crisis Delia Camden falls for a dark, brooding vampire who brings danger to her front door. When her life is suddenly on the line and she must decide between the comfortable, stifling life she knows or a life of love, romance, blood and danger. When GianCarlo and Delia’s love interrupts the strict plans Gian’s father has set forth for him, he threatens to take it all away. Can their love stand against the schemes of the most powerful vampire on the Eastern shore, or will they both perish at its mercy?
