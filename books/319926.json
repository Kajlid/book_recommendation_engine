  "description": "From the author of Zel, Stones in Water, and The Prince of the Pond.Deep in the woods lives the old witch called Ugly One. All she wants is to forget—that she was once a loving mother and a healer, blessed and powerful within her magic circle, and not a witch, claimed by the devils. Then one day she hears the footsteps she dreads. Then real voices—children's voices. The Ugly One longs to take care of sturdy, sensible Gretel and her young brother Hansel. They are such good children, such delicious, beautiful children. But demons' voices scream in her head: \"Eat them!\" How can she? . . . How can she not?",
