  "description": "If she follows her rules, Chloe is guaranteed a win—but now she’s not sure what she’s playing for.Chloe Carpenter has developed a system. After a life that has been anything but easy, she has a plan to get what she wants, and what she wants is justice. She’s on offense to make up for the wrongs done to her and punish those responsible.They’re going down.So she worked hard, very hard, and maybe she lied a little (and maybe she didn’t), but it’ll be worth it in the end. She has a set of Rules to live by, like #6 (don’t give them a chance to say no) and #10 (know when to cut your losses). It’s #12 (ignore your ruthlessness is key) that starts giving her some trouble, and that happens right around the time that she runs into #77.No, that’s not a rule—that’s the jersey number of pro-football player Ray Bishop, and he’s a muscular, talented, tall, gorgeous…a-hole. Everyone knows it (even him). But there is something about Ray, something beyond the way he irritates people by parking his car on a sidewalk, beyond the way he fights with his coaches, beyond the way he seems to see through Chloe and all her carefully laid plans.Those plans are falling by the wayside and Chloe’s trying to hold it together, but she’s also falling. The woman who lives by the Rule to be ruthless is falling in love, and suddenly?There’s no defense at all.",
