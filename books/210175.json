  "title": "Off-Worlders",
  "description": "Dark, humorous, suspenseful, adventurous, captivating. A collection of 13 Sci-Fi and Fantasy short stories, both from and beyond the worlds, characters and concepts of the edgy, sci-fi thriller, “Rise Siren Five.”Included here are: “Outpost,” “Queen,” “Izabel,” “Minx Fae,” “Haven,” “Epiphany,” “Lighthouse,” “Earth,” “Scream,” “Sprite,” “Night,” “Origin,” and “Left Behind.”\tPraise for Off-Worlders:“I am crazy for this author and you will be too. This is intelligent fiction, perfect for those of us who like a story to live beyond the pages. While Off-worlders is a superb standalone, it is intended as a companionette to the author's Disclosure Series. After you devour these shorts, you will want to dive right into the first full length novel from the series, Rise Siren Five. Highly, Highly Recommended!”\"Even if you've never read the series before, these are short sci-fi stories. That's always a nice time-spender. The stories alternate from funny to suspenseful to dramatic to meaningful. You're getting a full meal out of this thing.\"\"This writer delivers her tales of adventure with a unique, cryptic writing style that readers will either love or hate. Myself, I find it addictive, and plan to read the next full length novel.\"",
