  "title": "The Ghost of Colby Drive",
  "description": "When one door closes, another opens... or so they say. But what happens if that door is stuck? Some choices you are forced to confront, no matter how ugly or dangerous. Such is the doorstep of Alyson Bell, a tenacious teenage girl new to the rural town of Hollow Creek; a town rumored to be haunted by a ghostly spirit and a cat with more than the usual nine lives. Alyson tests her own strengths and weaknesses as she transitions into her new life, facing everyday teenage obstacles (bosoms and boyfriends), and hurdling over supernatural mysteries only she is predestined to encounter. Does one girl have what it takes to piece together the myriad of clues left behind in her century-old house to end a cat-astrophic curse, vanquish an evil soul-stealing vampire and still have time for a relationship with her new boyfriend, all before the next full moon?",
