  "title": "The Inner Reaches of Outer Space: Metaphor as Myth and as Religion",
  "description": "Developed from a memorable series of lectures delivered in San Francisco, which included a legendary symposium at the Palace of Fine Arts with astronaut Rusty Schweickart, Joseph Campbellâ€™s last book explores the space age. Campbell posits that the newly discovered laws of outer space are actually at work within human beings as well and that a new mythology is implicit in this realization. He examines the new mythology and other questions in these essays which he described as \"a broadly shared spiritual adventure.\"",
