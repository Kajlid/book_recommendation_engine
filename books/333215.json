  "description": "It was meant to be the perfect break-up…Just because it’s over between us, doesn’t mean we can’t be friends. My ex-husband and I still care for each other a lot, and we are determined to put our sweet little boy, Toby first.Now we’ve moved into houses right next door to each other, with each of our new partners and their children. We’ve even knocked down the garden fence, so Toby can easily run between our homes.But it seems not everyone is happy about this big, blended stepfamily. I try to ignore the viciously-worded note in the ‘new home’ card, the red pen scrawled through my divorce paperwork, and the day I find myself locked into my house, all the keys suddenly missing…But I can’t pretend it’s all in my head when a false accusation is made against me that could destroy my life – and Toby’s – forever.Someone doesn’t like what’s happening under these two neighbouring roofs.What they don’t know is that they’re messing with the wrong person. And that hell hath no fury like the wife next door…A completely unputdownable, jaw-on-the-floor psychological thriller for fans of Girl on the Train, Gone Girl and The Couple at No.9.",
