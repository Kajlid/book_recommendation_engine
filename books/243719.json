Now nothing's simple, and she's losing control. Two hot, hard men who live together, work together and love together, and the woman they want is her. Getting them out of her head, her bed, or her life isn't working. Choosing between them isn't an option.A vengeful enemy has forced Dack and Logan to live a life spent watching each other's backs, 24/7. That includes in the bedroom. Nowhere is safe. Love affairs are brief. But Cambria is a lady neither of them can resist. With her sassy attitude and passionate nature, she touches some part of them they'd thought dead.Stormy passion and tender touches tempt the two battle-scarred warriors with a taste of the forbidden, but how to keep the woman they both want safe, and in their bed?This is a sequel to Outside Protocol, although it can be read as a stand-alone.",
