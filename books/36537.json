  "description": "Ben Johnston is forced to spend a summer away from his friends, state-of- the-art technology and sailing club in the UK when his parents relocate to a remote island in the North Caribbean. There, he meets local youngsters, adopts a beach dog and forms an awkward relationship with a recluse the ancestor of an authentic pirate who closely guards his own secrets. Ben s father understands the importance of freedom in a thirteen-year-old s life and the restrictions that are often by-products of Western civilization. Hoping to provide this liberty for his son in an area of the globe virtually free from violence and crime, Frank Johnston has taken a post within his law firm in an offshore banking territory. With no choice but to be an island boy, Ben discovers a fascinating underwater marine world, ancient ruins and an abandoned sailing sloop ultimately taking his new friends on a voyage that could end in disaster when Caribbean seas rapidly transform from tranquil, crystal clear waters to dark, dangerous, wild surf. These things, combined with a mysterious descendent of a real French buccaneer and Hurricane Dolly, create a holiday to remember. Reading it made me want to learn how to swim. And sail, too!
