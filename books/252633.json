  "description": "I’ve never been so afraid and confused in my life. They’re telling me I’ve been dragged back in time, to a different time, and I have to fight aliens. In Iowa. I’m not sure who’s more delusional, these doctors and nurses spouting off about how little time is left, or me, for listening to them. And these men who have me now, they’re soldiers, scary-efficient troops who claim I’m who they’ve been waiting for. They’re always with me, taking care of me, talking to me, all while we make our way through a dangerous and infested city. I’m somehow supposed to detect these killer creatures nesting underground. Aliens who apparently exist only to eat people and make more aliens. Find them—sniff them out!—so these men can kill them with machine guns and grenades, just like people are trying to do all over this decimated world. As out of my depth as I am, I do know one thing. I need these men as much as they need me.",
