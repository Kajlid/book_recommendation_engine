  "description": "The house had always scared Gemma when she visited; there was an invisible energy that lingered there and something just seemed off. There was something different about Brenner as well, as if he weren’t human either but she never dared ask. He was human, just not entirely or he was involved with something inhuman. This didn’t matter to Gemma as Brenner was someone she still felt she could trust. She climbed the old steps to the front door, closed her eyes, and prepared to knock.",
