  "description": "Dear Author,I work as a bartender at a bar south of the border. Came over on vacation with my lover, to celebrate our first year together, and ended up staying. Alone. See, the day after our arrival at the all-inclusive resort, I had to stay in our hotel room because I got the \"curse of Moctezuma\". By the time I felt better a couple of days later, he had found someone else with whom to enjoy his time off. Found them making out on the beach, sans bathing suits.So I make a living, enjoy myself, it's all sex, no feelings. Won't let myself fall into that crap again.Right now? There's a very cute someone crouching below the bar, having a body shot off of what I'm pouring, drinking it off of a very interested part of my body. He's a new co-worker and I like him, a lot, but I won't let it get beyond that.Dear author, can you give this gorgeous guy back his belief in love and an HEA?PHOTO DESCRIPTION: Good looking young guy in a baseball cap drizzling a drink down his chest.
