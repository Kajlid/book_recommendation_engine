  "description": "Angel and the Ivory Tower is the adventure tale of the outgoing Alice Howard (Angel) Burke who has lived life to the fullest as a pioneer aviator, a barnstormer, and even a war hero. Her life is intertwined with the greats of history, Hollywood and everyday life. People who read this work can't wait to see what Alice will do next. On the other hand, Great Nephew (The Ivory Tower) has never lived his life outside the world of his books. After losing his job with the University Great Nephew comes to Great Aunt Alice's farm to learn how to paint the farmhouse, record her history, and maybe even learn about the world beyond his shell. Great Nephew, while comical, is also the sum total of all of our fears and one can't help but cheer him on. This story is fun to read. The colorful characters are so real that you will think you know them. You will share their tragedies and triumphs, and will love them, cheer them on, and sometimes mourn their loss. To be quite old-fashioned this story has a lot of heart. You too will enjoy the lively story of Angel and the Ivory Tower.",
