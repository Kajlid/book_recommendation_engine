But Nic is the one that has to bear the weight of her loyalty.Nic- Smooth, charismatic, and charming but inside his heart is broken and his mind is shattered.Excerpt:“It’s late. We still need to pick up the wedding gown.” She says.Wow. Maybe what we just did and how it felt was all in my imagination.I blink my eyes and yep, we are still naked with her body draped over me like a weighted blanket.

We could pick up the dress tomorrow.” Her lids are heavy as she’s tilting forward into me.While she invades my personal space, I tip her chin, “I’m not due at the airport until tomorrow night.” The small muscles around our mouths curl upward before landing in another kiss.“Do you still want to get dressed?”Answering her question with my lips, they mosey from her shoulder to her decollate’, “Never.”",
