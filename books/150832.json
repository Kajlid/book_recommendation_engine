  "description": "A mother and daughter see the news reports that a senator has been assassinated in the lobby of Boston's venerable Parker House. They hear that his killer, Robert Drummond, has escaped, prompting a nationwide manhunt. And yet Robert, wounded and suffering, has not gone far. He has, in fact, found refuge in the garage of another senator's Beacon Hill home, a place where the obvious options are death and discovery. But the unexpected happens in the form of the senator's daughter and wife. Despite the media frenzy, mother and daughter find themselves faced with a dying man whose desperate straits-both before and after the crime-they cannot ignore, and the two women become intimately involved with a man whose intelligence and physical presence weave a mesmerizing spell.",
