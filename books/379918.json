  "description": "Remo Who?He still did not know all the duties of a union delegate, or all the essential provisions of the Landrum-Griffin Bill, but \"upstairs\" had said he should be ready very shortly for something big. They even said to ignore the hit on Thurgood if it would take too much time away from his studies of the union movement.\"I might as well do the hit,\" Remo said. \"It'll be a good break.\"So here he was standing at the door of the Thurgood residence, ringing the doorbell. A large man in a white houseboy coat stood in the doorway like a surprise wall. A small pistol, almost but not quite hidden - probably a .25 caliber Beretta - was strapped underneath his armpit.\"Good morning,\" said Remo sweetly. \"I've come to kill Mr. Thurgood, is he in?\"",
