  "description": "Penny Caspian again. Nine months pregnant. Big as a house. And there’s another serial killer loose in Sea City. This guy uses compulsion to kill his victims, forces them to do it themselves, and makes it look like a suicide. But my boyfriend Detective Lachlan Flint and I have uncovered his gruesome methods and are on his trail. As the bodies pile up, we know we have to stop him. What else? Oh, my cousin showed up, pregnant as well, disowned by my grandparents. An old flame of Felicity’s is driving a wedge between her and Jensen. And Lachlan and I are struggling with our vow not to share blood. We know that if we do, we’ll rekindle blood bond, and we aren’t going back to that darkness. But every time we touch, it tempts us. So… we’re not touching so much these days. And I miss touching him. I miss kissing him. I miss all of him.",
