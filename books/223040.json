  "description": "Life subjects us to different challenges, but the most intriguing part is counter-challenging the deterrent to unleash the greatness within. The situations encountered with our relationship with the world exposes a lot of hidden secrets. It releases the power of the strength in you, these direct or indirect confrontations leaves you with no other option than to give yourself a break. I was once on this path; lost, confused, procrastinated, lived life without purpose, and discouraged. I had a successful career which gave me no pleasure; I was on the verge of depression. I became a pessimist because I lacked self-knowledge; I knew deep inside of me that there was something unique nudging at me to be pulled out, but when I got to the edge of my breakthrough, I discovered my power. It took a long time but I eventually did. I made peace with myself.",
