  "description": "My name is Stella, and for the first time in my life, I am whole. My killers keep me grounded, keep me sane, make me feel things I never imagined I would. They pick up the pieces of my black, twisted soul and hold me together. I would be nothing without them. But the past has a way of creeping up on you, and I’m about to find out that my past just might be the worst of them all. What I did…how could anyone forgive that? I don’t deserve forgiveness, but it's okay. My men aren’t the forgiving type. With the FBI inching in, with my killers and my Angel Maker by my side, time is ticking. Tick, tick, tick. When the gig is up and the curtain is drawn, when all of our mistakes are known, will there be anything left—or will we die in the same darkness we survived in for so long? This is it. The finale of our bloody, explosive story. ***TW: This is a dark, psychologically twisted tale involving graphic scenes of violence, stalking, and other topics some readers might find triggering. 18+ Be warned.***",
