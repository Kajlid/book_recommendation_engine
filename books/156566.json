  "description": "From the author of Neil Must Die comes a collection of short stories, Whiff of Tempest. It's a delicious spread containing stories for all genres... Once you’ll be reading about a bird, once about a lesbian relationship; then you may read about a slum drug lord’s compassion, and the next moment you’ll read about a thief.From extra-marital affairs to facing death to illicit relationships, to finer emotions between a husband and wife or long-lost lovers... the collection needs you to breathe very deeply between each story; since each story takes you to a different world and you need time to get back to reality.Sharp as a sword, her pen spares no one in this collection... not even ghost stories and gory accidents. Some of the stories are true and bear resemblance to real-life people and incidents.",
