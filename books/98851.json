  "description": "A dilemma, a deal…a date! Charmer Nate Mackenzie is in the middle of a plus-one dilemma for his friend's wedding. Any of his recent dates would start dreaming of a solitaire for their own left hand. Worse, going stag will leave him at the mercy of a setup by his ever-hopeful sisters. Discovering that Saskia Bloom is doing online-dating research for a website, he strikes a deal. She'll take the research rather than a relationship and he'll get a fake date. There might be no shortage of sexual attraction between them�but as complete opposites, will they be at all convincing as a \"happy couple\"?",
