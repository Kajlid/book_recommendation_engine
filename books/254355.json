  "description": "Sometimes you need to let yourself fall…Recently divorced Sienna Porter has the life she’s supposed to. A house, career, even a hot young contractor working upstairs to distract her. At thirty-eight, she’s entitled to a little fun (according to her best friend, anyway).Pain, though— it’s so clever in the way it infects hope and poisons happiness. Jace Beckett should be flying high. Talented, driven, and disciplined, he’s far beyond his twenty-three years. He’s used to the game, the attention his looks and highly trained body get from women. Doesn’t mean he likes to play.Doesn’t mean his own secrets aren’t intent on tearing him down.It’s just a fling. Sexy. Temporary. It’s not supposed to last. It’s not supposed to transform into love. It’s certainly not supposed to become the air you breathe and everything worth fighting for.**This is a new STANDALONE**",
