  "description": "I didn’t expect to fall off the stage and land in the powerful arms of this gorgeous man.He’s a brutal warrior on the rugby field and a delicate artist with the cello, and the combination is irresistible. His music seduces. It inspires my dancing and demands my surrender.I gave up on my dream once, and I’ll need his help to resume the chase.And when we take the stage together, I’m willing to give him everything. My submission. The dark secret I’ve been keeping. Even my tenuous heart.But will he want any of it once he knows the truth?",
