  "description": "\"You make your own choices. The choices you make will impact your life – positively or negatively, depending on the choice. Choose to live your life with no regrets from this day forward. You choose where to live and how to live. If you don’t like any part of your life, choose to change it – and start todayImagine reflecting on your past, from any point in your long, happy life, and having no regrets. How did you get here? Maybe it’s too late for you to live a life of no regrets, but what about your future life? What would have to happen from this point going forward for you to live a life of no regrets?Regrets are a waste of time anyway, as you can’t change the past. So, let go of the past and decide to choose to live your life with no regrets from this day forward.Living a life of no regrets doesn’t mean perfection. It means that we choose to make decisions with a little more thought. When we look back on the choices we have made, will we regret any of the choices?Is a successful and happy life with few or no regrets a choice….? Is success a choice or a chance collision of various uncontrollable factors?In studying self-improvement, we learn that we can’t change others, nor can we single-handedly change the world. However, we do have the power to change our own lives. This is the single most important message in self-improvement. You do not have to settle for what you think is life’s role for you. You are not doomed to live a life you are unhappy living. You are not enslaved to other people. Any and all of these self-limiting beliefs can be overcome.If what you are currently doing doesn’t serve you, you can choose to change it right now. You can choose to start by taking ‘baby’ steps. Start by having a day without regrets. How about a business trip where you don’t have any regrets? What would a vacation without regrets look like and feel like? What would have to happen to have an argument or ‘touchy’ conversation with your spouse or child without regrets? How would you have a conversation with a client you don’t enjoy and not have any regrets? How would you communicate with employees who may not be working to your expectations and not have any regrets? Could you have a day of making everyday business decisions and personal choices without any regrets?What would a day without regrets look like and feel like? What would a week of no regrets look like and feel like? What would a month of no regrets look like and feel like? Invest in this program today and start life with no regrets tomorrow.\"",
