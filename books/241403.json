  "description": "There’s a legend amongst members of the Wicked Throttle MC. Something that’s rooted deep into their DNA. The younger generation is starting to believe it when first the VP, and now the Prez, falls. Once a soul finds its other half, there is no going back. Only one option; Love and claim at first sight.  Maci has been keeping a family secret for years, protecting her brothers while carrying the weight of everything on her own. This weight is shifted when a biker doesn’t take no for an answer.  As the President of Wicked Throttle MC, Xerox has always stood up for what’s right. He’s a man that takes action, and that’s exactly what he did when he saw Maci, and her brothers, needed help. With his mind set to clear the town of a drug dealer, who’s after the woman he wants to claim as his own, he’s bound to face complications. Like all things in life; the collision will be harder when confrontation strikes. The question is…will it clear a path for a future, or will the future cease to exist?  For a greater reading experience, recommended reading order: \"Corban\" Wicked Throttle MC #0.5 \"Xerox\" Wicked Throttle MC #1",
