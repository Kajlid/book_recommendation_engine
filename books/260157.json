  "description": "He's caught only a glimpse of her from the window of his carriage, but the young Russian prince knew he had to have her. Within minutes, Lady Katherine St. John was dragged from the London street like a common waif and carries off to a sumptuous town house…for the pleasure of her noble admirer. But it was a captive tigress Prince Dimitri found in his bed—consumed with a fierce rage toward the Russian “barbarian” who had kidnapped her—even as she found herself desiring this tawny-maned Adonis with a hunger beyond her understanding…From the tempestuous passion of that first encounter, across stormy seas, to the golden splendor of palaces in Moscow, she was his prisoner. But even as her fury defied his bold claim of ownership, an all-consuming need made her his slave. For theirs was a fever that fed upon itself, carrying them irrevocably toward a final surrender to the power of undeniable love.",
