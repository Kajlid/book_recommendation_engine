  "title": "The Last American Martyr",
  "description": "Just how far would Corporate America go for revenge if somebody wrote a book telling the world how Big Business's insatiable greed had brought America's middle class to its knees? A quiet, unassuming man named Thomas Soles did write such a book. And not only did it quickly become an international bestseller, but he was also awarded the Nobel Prize for it. But not everybody is happy. When he and his wife return home with the coveted Swedish prize, the shock of their lives awaits them inside their modest New York apartment. It's a grisly scene, with not only death threats written in blood on the walls, but something equally disturbing inside their refrigerator. Knowing for sure now that there's a corporate lynch mob out to get him, Thomas and his wife have no choice but to flee their lifelong home. They set out across America in an RV, hoping to find a safe haven somewhere. But finding such a place isn't all that easy. Everywhere they go there's danger hot on their trail,. Sometimes it's right smack in front of them.",
