  "description": "Have you ever questioned where you fit, what’s your purpose, or why you are the way you are? That’s exactly what Jamal wonders about every day; especially after the local pastor made outlandish claims during a sermon a few weeks ago. Now, everything’s changed. Living in a small town, Jamal finds himself having to come to terms with his feelings for his childhood best friend, Chelsea. Would God approve of their relationship?Throughout this story, Jamal and his sister, Tonya, deal with the residual affects of racism, bullying, and coming to terms with their identity. From small, almost unnoticeable incidents, to outwardly life-threatening situations, the teens struggle to stay positive when things feel so negative.Chelsea, Jamal, and Tonya each share their story as they make friends in unexpected places, learn to respond like their heroes, and realize that titles are just titles and they don’t equal character. ‘A Divided Love’ is a story full of emotional highs and lows and powerful, thought-provoking and heartwarming situations.",
