  "description": "Ballantine paperback, 4th printing (1975) with Karl Swanson. The novel was first serialized in Galaxy Magazine in 1956, and published in book form the following year. Pohl has a reputation of one of SF's master satirists; this novel is about a world in the throes of a low-intensity global war, which appears to be an amplified representation of the Vietnam War (in which the U.S. was just becoming involved).",
