  "description": "She had always wanted an adventure in the stars…\nAfter years of working for the Alien Immigration Office on Earth, Alyssa has finally been sent on her first assignment in space. But what’s supposed to be a nice little peace mission soon turns into a nightmare. One where pirates might abduct her at any moment and she's assigned a lethally scary - but oh, so sexy - bodyguard!\n\nIt doesn't help that the body he’s supposed to guard always heats up in his presence...\n\n\n\nHe was an abomination...\n\n\n\nA beast...\n\n\n\nTortured and trained to kill since the day he was made...\n\nXarq has had it with bodyguarding jobs. In fact, he wasn't supposed to have them anymore. But one last job gets between him and his future military career, and he gets a tiny Earth female to protect. To top it all off, she is on her first mission in space, and his bodyguarding assignment turns more into a babysitting duty. Just perfect. But somehow, her oddly pleasant scent lures him in and he can't seem to get enough of her...And that's dangerous. He needs to focus on his job!\n\nBecause that’s exactly when the pirates attack…",
