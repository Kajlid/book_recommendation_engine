  "description": "Hector and Hannah Crowe are no strangers to the bizarre. It sort of comes with the territory, being that their parents are the world's foremost paranormal investigators. The Crowes live at Strange Manor, a house haunted more than any other. They're surrounded by deep dark woods that crawl with mysterious, howling beasts. This supernatural lifestyle is anything but strange for them, but on this night -- the first night of summer vacation -- the Crowes face the most dangerous and terrifying night of their young lives. An ancient evil has come to their home, something dark and powerful... something that knows who they are.",
