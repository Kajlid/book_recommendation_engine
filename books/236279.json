  "description": "A Tidewater Short Story. Contemporary, Stand alone, HEA.  Elias lives for the waves. He's been surfing off the Tidewater coast since he could crawl, and the connection he's forged with the ocean is fundamental. Every morning he shares a ritual swim with the local pod of dolphins. Elias is desperate to find a way to express what the sand and the sea mean to him, and local artist Theo could be just what he needs.  Theo's art has helped him move mountains. It granted him freedom from abusive family and supports his quiet lifestyle. He's ready for more. So when muscle-bound Elias commissions him for a mural on his bedroom wall, Theo has more than one reason to take the job. It's time to reach with his heart, an easy thing when Elias is so eager to share what's in his.  Water is essential when painting, and color is what brings the ocean to life. Elias and Theo were made for each other. It's only a matter of time before Tidewater brings them together.",
