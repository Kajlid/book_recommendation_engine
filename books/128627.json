  "description": "Zombies, zeppelins, mad scientists -- oh my! Breathtaking adventure by New York Times bestselling author Jack Conner. Young thief Katya Ivreski is in trouble. She's just ripped off the wrong guy, a sadistic murderer addicted to alchemical drugs. If he catches her, death will be a mercy. Her life could be cut short just when she's about to make good. Her only hope is the powerful mob boss Ravic. In a city filled with mad scientists, zombies and sinister cults, he's feared far and wide. However, he'll only help her if she infiltrates the operation of his deadly rival Loqrin, the man (if he is a man) who might be responsible for the wave of murders and disappearances that's been gripping the city. Carried out by nightmarish creatures, dozens of people have been killed in gruesome ways, and that may just be the start. Katya may be the world's only hope. No pressure, Kat. Nightmare City is a standalone tale set in the world of the Atomic Sea, but you don't need to have read any of the others to enjoy it. It's a tale of adventure and horror by USA Today and New York Times bestselling author Jack Conner. If you like action-packed storytelling, Lovecraftian terrors, and unique twists and turns you won't see coming, then you'll love Jack Conner's incredible mix of atmosphere and action.
