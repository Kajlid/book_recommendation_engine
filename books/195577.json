  "title": "Single Stroke Seven",
  "description": "In an attention-deficit society still crippled by the aftereffects of the recession, Lilith, a percussive virtuoso-or maybe just a garage band drummer-fights to break into the indie rock scene. With a band of misguided lost boys, an ego-slaughtering day job at a bottling plant, and the Silicon Valley's inflated cost of living to contend with, Lilith flounders at keeping herself and her friends from dissolving into obsolescence and numbing consumerism. A sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll tale too impoverished to afford any sex, drugs, or rock 'n' roll, Single Stroke Seven sheds light on the independent artists of a shipwrecked generation coming of age in perilous economic conditions.",
