  "title": "Never on a Broomstick",
  "description": "Covers the topic of the evolution of witchcraft, from prehistoric rituals, through the Middle Ages, the witch hunt period, and modern practices. It gives detailed description about the contemporary beliefs we hold against witches. Donovan is very negative toward Christianity and Judaism. Donovan criticizes the Church by saying that it was the churchs fault that people turned to witchcraf, because it was too boring for and distant from the people. So the nocturnal meetings of the witches Sabbat appealed more. In describing methods of torture used during the witch hunts, Donovan gets very graphic. The book also covers topics including possession and the control of natural phenomenon and weather. Annotation by Joseph Zubko.",
