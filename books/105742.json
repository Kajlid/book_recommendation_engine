  "description": "Discover The Secret of Vic Challenger's Lack of Fear. Learn about her amazing past and the derivation of her name. Then travel with her to exotic locales, encroach on dangerous domains and live the secret headlines of the past you thought were fiction. Vic Challenger will take you into the haunts of creatures you don't believe in, things she wouldn't write about because the public wasn't ready, couldn't handle it. Are you ready, can you handle it?  Time Doesn't Matter is the beginning of the on-going series about the 1920's adventuress, who works as an adventure travel writer while pursuing her own, secret, goal. Her determination and past allow her, or perhaps force her, into situations that would make strong men weep for their mother. Vic's motto covers it all: You don't need to be brave - you just need to do what needs done. In this first novel of the action packed series, Vic begins in Africa, faces death again and again, travels to her dim past, faces death again and again, then travels to Mexico where she faces death again and again. Adventurous action is non-stop. Vic faces evil men, prehistoric beasts and things without a name but she has a goal and nothing will stop her. Vic isn't a gin guzzling, foul mouthed hard nose as you might expect. She's a farm girl from the early twentieth century, highly principled, educated as a mathematician and astronomer, who loves pink dresses and candy, and who has a secret past, an unfilled desire and a will-do-it attitude.",
