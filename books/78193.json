  "description": "Trouble has come to Clarke County, trouble in the delectable shape of Macy Westmoreland, gangster's moll on the run from the Mafia. Then there's the Golem, the ultimate killing machine, and Macy's his latest contract.More than enough problems for John Bighorn. Sheriff by day, shaman by night, he knew better than to mess with Jenny Schoor, wife of the leader of the 'New Ark' cult. So why did he?Add to that a ghost in the machine that thinks it's Bob Dylan, not to mention a reincarnation of Elvis Presley, and you could be in New York on atypical day.Except that Clarke County is 200,000 miles from Earth and someone's just launched a nuclear missile at it.",
