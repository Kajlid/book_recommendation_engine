While researching a report on pain for my college course, I never imagined that my life experiences would soon reflect the depth and breadth of my discovery and writing. It all happened so fast. I never imagined that in interviewing a successful artist and entrepreneur for my report, His promise of \"the most intense love in the universe\" would catapult me and the one I adore into a gantlet of dreams and nightmares. I am Anastasia, and this is my journey through womanhood, my search for true love and my pathway to redemption. Many of the details I am sharing for the first time. I want to break the silence.  LMF, know that I love you. I've always loved you and I will keep loving you, forever and ever and ever",
