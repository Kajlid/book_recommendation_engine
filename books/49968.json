  "description": "Alternate Cover/Title for Trial & Error.Victoria Lord...for the prosecution.Steve Solomon...for the defense.And an ecoterrorist charged with murder.The love-hate relationship of Solomon & Lord continues. Sure, opposites attract, but they argue, too!This time, it all starts with the kidnaping of a pair of trained dolphins from Miami’s Cetacean Park. When one of the ecoterrorists behind the raid turns up dead, his partner in eco-crime is charged with homicide, even though he didn't pull the trigger. It’s called “felony murder,” and Solomon thinks it's a bum rap. What he doesn’t count on is his lover and law partner Victoria Lord being named a special prosecutor.Conflicts-of-interest abound, and Steve is up to his old tricks. At least, the mismatched legal duo agree on something...each one vows to win the case!",
