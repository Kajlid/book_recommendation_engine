Along with a vampire and a princess, helping the young rogue take advantage of the opportunity is an enchanted longsword he finds deep within a mountain, whose power links to that of an ancient dragon. If Mercer hopes to achieve retribution against his formidable foes, the corrupted boy must become the kind of warrior not seen in centuries—a dragon knight.",
