  "description": "Jane has a problem. She can see angels, and not just any angels, but archangels. There’s Michael, tough, gorgeous, and smarter than Sherlock Holmes. Lucifer, the bad boy you love to, well, love. And Gabriel? Well, he’s like the best friend she always wanted, only with washboard abs. Together they make an awesome team when they aren’t trying to figure out a way to screw like bunnies. Or, at least, they will when a girl goes missing. Now it’s up to Jane and her angels to crack the case, bring the girl home, and save the day. …and this time, she might find that helping gets her what she’s really wanted all along.",
