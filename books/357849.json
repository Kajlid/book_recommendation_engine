  "description": "MEAN GIRLS MEETS BLUE CRUSH!Tallulah Jones makes a huge splash at her new high school when the popular It Girl invites her to go surfing. The only problem? Tallulah can't surf. After a humiliating near-death experience, her little lie backfires completely and the in-crowd labels her a poser. Only a miracle can save her from outcast hell--one that arrives in the form of a frizzy-haired, nearsighted, completely unhip surfing phenom who takes Tallulah under her wing and teaches her to surf. When an enticing phone call tempts Tallulah to risk her new best friend's trust, Tallulah must prove once and for all that she's no poser; she's the real deal--- as a surfer and, more importantly, as a friend. Full of authentic surfing situations from an author who's caught a wave or two, readers will be hooked by the surf, sun, and teen drama.",
