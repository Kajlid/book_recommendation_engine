  "title": "Gabe and Ian",
  "description": "Gabriel Cross has spent his entire life keeping a secret from his older brother. The tattoo artist all but inked the two words on his flesh, and yet Abe still hasn’t figured it out. Terrified of losing the only family he has left, Gabriel keeps his mouth shut, even though he hates himself for being a coward.  Ian Long loves women. After being locked up for five miserable years, he can’t wait to make up for lost time, all while trying to forget about a certain someone who took care of his needs during weekly visitations. He’s convinced himself that being with Gabriel was a matter of convenience and nothing more.  Gabriel foolishly assumed that his secret affair with Ian would continue once he became a free man. However, Ian doesn’t waste any time hooking up with the first woman he sees at his homecoming party, even doing so right in front of Gabe’s face to prove just how little he meant to him.  Jealous and hurt, Gabe knows it’s time for him to move on. He has to quit waiting for the impossible to happen with Ian and find someone who will give him the unconditional love he craves without having to hide who he is anymore.  But what neither Gabe nor Ian realize is that the woman who comes between them may turn out to be the one who finally brings them together.  This story is for mature readers only and it contains MFM and MM scenes.",
