  "description": "When Ellyn Dashwood’s family moves to Bloomfield, NM, she’s not sure she’ll fit in as easily as her wildly popular twin sister, Maralyn, will. Though they’re identical, since the day they were born, the two sisters were exact opposites. Maralyn attracted people to her like bees to a hive. However, with Ellyn’s autism, she’s positive she’ll never be considered more than awkward. That is, until she meets the totally hot Zane Ferrars. Zane is the tall, smart, hot, athletic, kind—did we mention hot?—neighbor who has made it his mission to uncover Ellyn's secrets. She's a puzzle he's eager to solve. However, she soon finds out he’s got a few secrets of his own—secrets that will break her cautious heart if she’s not sensible enough to be careful. This eagerly awaited new installment of the Jane Austen Diaries is a contemporary retelling of the classic novel Sense and Sensibility.",
