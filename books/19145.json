As the only remaining qualified pilot, Hammer has to fly the ship, but someone has to solve the murder. And as the only other person on board with a cast iron alibi (because Hammer was busy chatting her up at the critical time) the task therefore falls to Mysior.She muddles her way through the investigation, thwarted by the colourful cast of characters and constantly distracted by her attraction to Hammer.
