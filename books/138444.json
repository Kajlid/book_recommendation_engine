  "title": "The Day Aunt Gina Came to Town",
  "description": "Reality and delusion collide in this hilariously tragic story about one family's absurd secrets and the dreams they hide. The Day Aunt Gina Came to Town is a literary black comedy that puts a playful spin on the idea that 'we are what we pretend to be.' Taking its cue from surrealist notions of a reality substantially conjured by the unconscious, this novel examines the private and separate ways we construct and experience our lives among those closest to us.",
