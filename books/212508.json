  "title": "NoNonsense Feminism: Alive and Kicking",
  "description": "Far from being in a \"post-feminist\" age we've seen recently a resurgence of feminist campaigning among women (and some men). There's a new brand of young, social-media savvy, militant. But there's a new kind of backlash, driven by so-called fundamentalists and by increasingly overt misogyny.This book gives a unique international perspective to the advances and challenges worldwide. Nikki van der Gaag is an independent consultant and writer who works primarily on gender. She is the author of The No-Nonsense Guide to Women's Rights, Feminism and Men, and the State of the World's Girls reports published by Plan International.",
