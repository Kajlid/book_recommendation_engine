  "title": "The Pirate City: An Algerine Tale",
  "description": "The Pirate City is a story about the Algerian pirates who were the scourge of the Mediterranean sea during the early to mid-1800s. They would plunder the ships of other sovereign nations, and as a result were a wealthy little city-state until their demise in the Barbary War. In this tale, set during the heyday of the pirates, a merchant and his sons Mariano and Lucien are captured aboard their trading vessel and taken as prisoners to the pirate capital of Algiers. Follow their adventures as they rescue other prisoners, experience life in the pirate city, and attempt to escape from their captors. Forced to endure slavery as Christian dogs before their Muslim captors, the heroes rely on Providence to bring their deliverance. R.M. Ballantyne spent time in Algiers and dressed himself as an Arabian while researching material for his book so that he might portray his characters and the story's setting with the greatest accuracy possible.",
