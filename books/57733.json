His wife, Amber, has divorced him and is remarrying a rich wall street hedge fund manager. His boss hates him, his partner tolerates him, and he likes to stand on the ledge ten stories up, bottle in hand. Four years ago his infant son passed away in his crib sending his life into a tail spin. All he has left is saving lives, and saving them on his terms. That's not enough. Enter Brooklyn, a fiery red headed stringer, who works the overnight selling video and stills to the New York media and she's had a long standing crush on Brian. She's out to prove that a paramedic isn't the only one who can save a life.",
