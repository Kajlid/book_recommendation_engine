  "description": "“Of all the fairy rings, in all the worlds, she walks into mine.”When gritty detectives meet shapeshifters and dragons, when the gorgeous dame is an elf and the grifter is a selkie, that's when you know you're in deeper than you thought possible. In the shadowy streets of these stories, the dangers are more than just shooters and muggers. Here the bouncer might be an orc, the mark might be a centaur. Venture in at your own risk. Walk soft, carry a big gun, and keep a stone with a hole in it in your pocket.Cover design by Lisa Emmanuel",
