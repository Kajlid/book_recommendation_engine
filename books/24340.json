  "title": "The Flowering Spirit: Classic Teachings on the Art of No",
  "description": "The Flowering Spirit is a new translation of Fushikaden, the 15thcentury classic text by Zeami, founder of the No theater. Written sometime between 1400 and 1418, Fushikaden became a secret, sought-after guide to life for Zeamis acting troupe. Not until the latter part of the 19th century didFushikaden gradually begin to make its way into the hands of the general public. Although Fushikaden is about No drama, Zeami incorporated into his text his philosophical outlook on the art of lifethe wayand how one goes about living according to these principles, providing invaluable teachings onthe aesthetics and spiritual culture of Japan. No was the art form of choice for the samurai class; and many of its principles echo those of the martial arts. Zeami brought his wide-ranging education in Zen Buddhism, his knowledge of classical Japanese poetry, and his exposure to the aristocraticlifestyle to his writing of this classic work. In addition to his impeccable translation, William Scott Wilson has contributed several important adjunct pieces to Zeamis classic workan introduction about the history of No drama, copious notes explaining the background of the book, an appendixcontaining a translation of one of Zeamis greatest plays, Atsumori, and an afterword that connects No drama with the warrior class.",
