  "description": "First loves, dark pasts, and fast cars collide in this high-octane adventure.The life he has now was hard won. He went from nothing to running his own high-end Euro auto shop and being part owner in more than one club in town living the playboy lifestyle, yet Nathaniel Vellanova forgets it all when his ex-girl walks back into his life—the the only woman he'd ever let himself love. It's the same day his biological father, the man who murdered his mother, is released from prison reminding him how much he has needed her. Nate's ex-girl, Eva, is back from her stint at a high-glamour life in Manhattan to help her father who's battling cancer. Yet, as luck would have it, the car she relies on everyday for her magazine gig in downtown Portland, Oregon goes on the fritz pushing her back into the capable hands of her mechanic ex-boyfriend Nate.Thrown together once more, Nate and Eva have to sort out their fetishes for fast cars and adrenaline addiction with nothing but their bare hands—and maybe a little bit of duct tape. As the language—and the sparks—fly, their demons return, haunting and hunting them down until nothing but love can pull them from the edge.",
