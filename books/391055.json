  "description": "\"Do not expect easy answers or simple solutions here on these pages. . . but then \"that is the fun, the excitement, the joy of involvement in the warrior arts of accomplishment. . . . It pleases me no end to see the world at large now welcoming the knowledge of ninjutsu's ages in the form of these books by the art's grandmaster .\" -- From the Foreword by Stephen K. Hayes In an uninhibited dialogue from a recent meeting with his top instructors from around the world, Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi discusses his personal journey through the mysteries of the ancient art of the phantom warrior. His topics cover the nutritional needs of a ninja, the changing physical attributes of the \"new\" ninja, details on training for the novice as well as the advanced student, and the spiritual aspects of ninja training and how it applies to the modern world. With numerous photos, Dr. Hatsumi demonstrates the extemporaneous techniques that flow from his form of training and how some of his top students have developed their own styles of ninjutsu. Dr. Masaaki Hatsumi, the grandmaster of the nine ninjutsu schools that comprise the ninja tradition, is an artist with brush and ink, a medical practitioner of seikotsu, and a prolific writer .",
