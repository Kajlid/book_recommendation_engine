  "description": "Midsummer Days is a paperback compilation of Midsummer's Moon, Midsummer Curse, and Midsummer Law by Megan Derr. Midsummer's Moon | Excerpt | 26,000 A homeless werewolf travels to the town of Midsummer's Night, following a rumor that a doctor there has developed a cure for the lycanthropy that has always been the bane of his existence. But the cure he discovers is the very thing he ever expected to find... Midsummer Curse | Midsummer Curse | 25,000 Brayton is a jack of all trades. He travels from one end of the country to the other, fixing problems of all shapes and sizes for the many supernaturals who call him for help. Then a friend calls in a favor, and Brayton finds himself in the town of Midsummer to figure out who and why someone cursed a gremlin. But the town of Midsummer is the strangest place he's ever been, and the only thing stranger is his own reaction to the gremlin he's come to save. Midsummer Law | Excerpt | 20,600 Being Sheriff is a hard job, even in a town like Midsummer. The law is the law, and when magic is thrown into the mix, everything gets more complicated. Kirby is lonely and worn out, and his latest unpleasant duty is contacting the brother of a recent suicide. Given the complications surrounding the tragedy, and just how loathed the deceased man was in Midsummer, meeting his brother is not something Kirby is any hurry to do. But when he arrives, Merry is nothing like his deceased brotherâ€”nothing like anything Kirby has seen in a long time, and quite possibly a reason to feel things Kirby thought he'd never feel again.",
