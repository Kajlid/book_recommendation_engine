  "description": "Julie wants only one gift this holiday season, but it’s going to take a Christmas miracle to make her wish come true.  Julie Hamilton loves Christmas. It’s her favorite time of year, from the cinnamon smell of freshly baked mince-pies to the excitement of buying gifts for family and friends, decorating the tree, and hanging stockings for Santa Claus on the mantelpiece. This Christmas promises to be extra special because she’s expecting the perfect gift--her first baby--on Christmas Eve. However, a chance encounter turns her world upside down, and soon, she’s praying for her very own Christmas miracle. Can the spirit of the Christmas season and the kindness of strangers find a way to make her wish come true?  Praise for Joanne Clancy I love this author's unique way of storytelling.\nRobin Lee, Amazon Top 500 Reviewer\n  I thoroughly enjoyed this read which was at times Christmassy and festive and then tense and dramatic. Highly recommended. \nElaine G., Amazon Top 50 Reviewer\n  A sign of a gifted author is the ability to transport her readers, place them right in the middle of the storyline and allow them to feel the range of emotions that the characters in the book are going through. Joanne Clancy is that type of author. \n~Erin Brady\n  Joanne Clancy draws you in from the first sentence and doesn’t let go! She has a way with words that keeps you begging for more! Having read previous works by this author, I know there is a great deal of suspense, heartache, joy, and a virtual maelstrom of emotions in my future! \n~ Deb. A, Amazon Customer",
