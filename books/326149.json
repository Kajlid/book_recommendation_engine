  "description": "Sacrifice, the destruction or surrender of one thing for another — or in my case, one person for another.With every sacrifice there is a price, a debt that needs to be paid.For him, he chose his country, and lost him his life.For me and my family, I became another’s wife.One decision, and the life I always dreamed of became a nightmare I couldn’t escape.Until one day, fate intervened and everything I thought I’d lost, and the past I believed I’d buried, came rushing back, knocking me off my feet.Can the scars of our past heal, or will we be stuck paying for the sacrifices we made?",
