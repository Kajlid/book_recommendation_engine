  "description": "For David Jordan life was close to perfect.His band, Embrace the Fear, were living the rock ‘n roll dream as an up-and-coming band under Masterson Management. They weren’t rolling in the dough like the guys from Social and Maiden were, but things were good.Outside of his love life that was.David wasn’t a player, unless you count video games. He grew up in a middle-class family. Both his parents worked and were supportive of him in every way. To this day they were still head over heels in love with each other.The one thing missing from David’s life was the same kind of connection his parents had.But David’s needs were a bit unorthodox and not always welcome with guys closer to his age. Would an older man look past the number and trust David to take care of them—body and soul?Jordan Wright has a thriving business thanks to being awarded the contract to manage the catering for Rocktoberfest for a second year.He’s thrilled to be back at the venue again—maybe this is the year something special will happen, although he’s not counting on it.Since Jordan’s last failed attempt at a relationship, he’s sworn only to engage in meaningless hook-ups.But Jordan longs for a daddy of his own.Will he ever be able to open his mind, and his heart, again? Enough to trust another man, not only with his body, but to catch him when he falls.David's Disaster is part of the multi-author The Road to Rocktoberfest 2022 series. Each book can be read as a standalone, but why not read them all and see who hits the stage next? Hot rockstars and the men who love them, what more could you ask for? Kick back, load up your kindle and enjoy the men of Rocktoberfest!",
