  "description": "A slow-burn, friends-to-lovers standalone holiday romanceThe bad guy never gets the girl.  In the eyes of the law, I’ve paid for my youthful mistakes but I know I can never undo the damage I’ve caused. When I stepped out of my cell, I vowed to live a good life, make the right choices, and avoid temptation at all costs. Until her.  She’s not a choice, she’s a compulsion. A craving. A beautiful, brave heroine who walked straight off the pages of the comic books I create and into my life with the superpower of making me believe I could be the man she deserves.  But I’m not.  She wants to tell the world about us this Christmas, including her father—my boss. But before she does, I need to tell her the truth.  \nCan I possibly stay her hero when she finds out that I used to be the villain?",
