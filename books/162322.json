There is one she-wolf who will be his touchstone. Together, they are stronger. Together, they might just survive. As the darkness swallows him whole, she will be his saviour. There's only one problem -- he's not interested in being saved.A choice lies before him -- revenge or love -- but with his heart closed to emotion, his choice may already be made. Hatred is what drives him. But will his vengeance keep him warm at night?",
