  "description": "I BET YOU I WON’T.  He was too good for me. Too damn young and too smart and I couldn’t say no.  Mack Hennessy came into my life like one of those Tasmanian devils. A hot, beautiful whirlwind. Entirely broke my control, shook up my existence. Made me fall in love. Until the real reason for his pursuit was revealed.   I BET YOU I WILL.  I fell in love with a celebrity. The world-famous Tom Cohen, international model with his pouty mouth and aloof nature. And I screwed up. I didn’t know what we’d become. How vital he’d be to my life.  Life lesson: NEVER MAKE A BET about anyone you want to spend your life with. He says I’m too young. But I bet I can win him back…  Disclaimer: Are you ready for a lot of boys kissing? This has lots of boy mush and celeb-model brooding. **The From Manhattan Series is completely standalone and can be read in any order**",
