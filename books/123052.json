  "title": "The Life of Muhammad",
  "description": "In THE LIFE OF MUHAMMAD, Haykal achieves two objectives admirably: first, a biography which reveals the career of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) in the full light of historic reality; second, bringing out the essence of Islam, as exemplified in the life of the greatest Muslim. It includes complete coverage of the Prophet's life, a detailed analysis of pre-Islamic Arabia, the situational context of revelation, and a comparative study of the basics of Islamic and Western civilizations. It is based upon a scholarly examination of all of the extant Sirah and Hadith literature (the Prophet's life, his sayings and narrations of his teachings by his comtemporaries) with the eye of an objective, scientific, and critical scholar who is well versed in modern historical critical methodology. THE LIFE OF MUHAMMAD is an essential book for all English-speaking Muslims, as well as non-Muslims. This English version has been approved by the Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, Cairo",
