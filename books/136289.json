The Mafia, the Teamsters Union, an unhappy sheriff and some very rough characters are all looking for his friend, and Carson is in the middle of this mess.An apparently senseless murder only complicates Carson’s problems, which makes getting to the truth more difficult.Things are not what they seem in Carson Reno’s adventure at ‘Reelfoot’",
