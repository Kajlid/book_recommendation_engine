  "description": "Greg Chennault has been a golf fanatic since he was a kid. When he was twelve, he managed to sneak onto a local golf course in search of a job -- there he met Trevor Johns, who taught him the sport. Greg caddied for Mr. Johns all throughout his high school years, and still recalls his time with his former employer fondly. His memories of Mr. Johns' young son Junior, four years younger than Greg, aren't quite as rosy. The boy annoyed Greg, and once he stopped caddying for the father, he promptly forgot about the son.Ten years later, Greg works at the Hermitage Country Club, which hosts an annual Mid-Atlantic Gold Tournament each Memorial Day weekend. When Greg notices Mr. Johns' name on the roster of registered guests, he thinks it'd be nice to see the old man again. But the young golfer who takes the JOHNS nametag is hot, sexy, and not at all who Greg expects.Trey Johns was once \"Junior,\" and is now all grown up. His first crush was on Greg, his father's caddy, and when they meet again, he's quick to inform Greg that he's still as smitten as he was before. But Greg has reservations -- he finds it difficult to resolve the memory of a gawky teenage Junior with the confident man Trey has become.Greg's conflicting emotions almost blow the first chance he has with Trey. Will he get another?",
