  "description": "Tough and driven, Kit Kendall replaced frills and dresses with no-nonsense haircuts and wranglers years ago. As owner of Sage Brush, the once-thriving West Texas bed and breakfast ranch, she now struggles daily to keep her business afloat. Since McCabe Lodge reopened next door as a multi-million-dollar resort, her financial difficulties compound, as she suffers one cancellation after another. Just when she thought things couldn’t get any worse, Kit’s former neighbor and childhood nemesis returns as the new owner of the resort that’s now putting her out of business. Sam Dawson, cowboy turned entrepreneur, has returned to Sugar Creek after six years of exile with a secret that could destroy Kit’s happiness. He left town because of it and for the past two years has secretly tried to make it right. Having failed, he now returns to make one last attempt to undo the tangled web created by his father. Set in motion by his father’s will and with the clock ticking, Sam has only weeks to convince Kit to sell him her ranch or reveal the truth that will break her heart.",
