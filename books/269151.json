  "title": "Comix: A History of Comic Books in America",
  "description": "Publisher's \"Covers the whole history of comic books in America to 1970--the major creations, the major creators, the major comic book lines, the major comic book enemies. Co-authors Les Daniels and The Mad Peck tell the story of how comic books captured the imagination of millions and became an American institution, and whether or not they deserved to. Adjoining the text, providing an illustrated history of their own, is a large selection of complete comic book stories. No selected snippets. Full stories. \"It seems safe to say,\" the authors write, \"that no book to date has contained such a wide range of comic book tales Where else can one find in the same volume such divergent personalities as the Old Witch and Donald Duck, or Captain America and Those Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers?\"",
