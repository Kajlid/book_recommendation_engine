Now he's crossed the river and entered the heart of the empire: the city of Elantra. When Severn is spotted tailing some lawmen of the Hawks--a not insignificant feat to go otherwise undetected--the recruiter for the Imperial Wolves thinks he should join their ranks. The Wolves are a small, select group that work within the Halls of Law, reporting directly to the Eternal Emperor. Severn hopes to avoid the law--he certainly had no intention of joining it.In order to become a wolf--even on probation--Severn must face the investigators most dreaded throughout the Empire: The Tha'alani, readers of minds. No secret is safe from their prying, no knowledge can remain buried. But Severn's secret, never shared before, is not enough to prevent the Wolves from adopting him as one of their own. All men have secrets, after all. Severn's first job will be joining a hunt, but between the treacherous politics of the High Court, the almost unnatural interest of one of the Lords, and those who wish long-held secrets to remain buried forever, the trick will be surviving it.",
