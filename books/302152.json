  "description": "Early morning feedings, barn clean up, and chasing goats are Knox Bishop’s everyday routine. That changes when a bachelor auction brings him face to face with the world’s most forbidden fruit—his twin brother’s crush.He shouldn’t tempt her, but the way her body reacts to his makes it too damn easy.Hadleigh has known the Bishop twins all her life and they’ve never crossed the lines. That is until she fools around with Knox and learns he has a piercing south of the border. A piercing she very much enjoys licking.She knows his main hobby consists of random weekend hookups, but she can’t get the taste of him off her mind.Admitting what she feels wouldn’t be so difficult if Kane Bishop hadn’t just confessed his feelings for her too. Now she finds herself wedged between two brothers—one she could break and one who could break her.**Claiming the Cowboy is a complete stand-alone and can be read without reading any of the other books or spin-off series, but if you prefer to read in order, start with Hitching the Cowboy as the characters and families do interconnect.**",
