  "title": "Virtual Reality: The Revolutionary Technology of Computer-Generated Artificial Worlds - and How It Promises to Transform Society",
  "description": "Imagine being able to \"walk\" into your computer and interact with any program you create. It sounds like science fiction, but it's science fact. Surgeons now rehearse operations on computer-generated \"virtual\" patients, and architects \"walk through\" virtual buildings while the actual structures are still in blueprints. In Virtual Reality , Howard Rheingold takes us to the front lines of this revolutionary new technology that creates computer-generated worlds complete with the sensations of touch and motion, and explores its impact on everything from entertainment to particle physics.",
