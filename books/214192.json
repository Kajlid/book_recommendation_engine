One long, angst-filled year we’ve circled each other, keeping things strictly professional.But I’ve also got shit in my past that complicates relationships. And I should know better than to hope secrets can stay buried.Hugh:A year? Try ten. A decade ago, I let Lachlan walk away because deep down, I knew he needed something else.As soon as I laid eyes on her, I understood what I was up against: he loves Beth. Looks at her in a way he’d never look at me.I get it.Curvy, smart, and bossy? I just might love her, too.Beth:Two men. Two first dates.Two first kisses…But this doesn’t feel like a love triangle.Oh no. It’s much more complicated than that. I’m not complaining. I’m game for anything. I just have one rule: never at work.SECURITY BRIEFING:* Warning: there are no limits to these Mounties’ willingness to please* Never underestimate the strength of a woman* Sometimes the past can come back and bite you...if you're lucky* Top-secret clearance means three doesn’t need to be a crowd",
