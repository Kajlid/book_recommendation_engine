  "description": "Blush: This is a suggestive romance (love scenes are not graphic) Born to a father who was the town drunkard and an Apache mother, Mitch Garrett grew up among people who refused to accept him—all, that is, save for one skinny little girl, the preacher’s daughter, Alisha Faraday. As time passes, Mitch and Alisha’s friendship grows into something far stronger, until the town’s hatred drives Mitch away. But miles and years can’t change the feelings of his heart, feelings that he stubbornly refuses to acknowledge. Haunted by memories of what might have been, Mitch returns home to find that his love for Alisha and hers for him are as strong as ever, until a secret from the past threatens to destroy their future.
