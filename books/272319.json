  "description": "Everyone knows appearances can be deceiving, and in my case, even Iâ€™ve been fooled. The last thing I need is immature man-child, Alexander Bennet, trying to smile his way into my pants. I hate everything about him; his stupid smirk, his rumbling chuckle, and the way butterflies riot in my stomach when he aims them at me. Our sparring matches go from maddening to stimulating and suddenly my mind and body are at war.Unfortunately for me, my life is nothing but lies. Twisted secrets keep throwing us together then pulling us apart as we try to unravel it. Will the one person I want nothing to do with, be my salvation? Or are we doomed to tear each other apart?*if you have triggers, please proceed with caution*",
