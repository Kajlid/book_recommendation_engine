  "description": "Many people have tried whisky but are not sure what's a malt and what's a blend - Many people buy whisky as a present, unconfident about what to give. Others know what they like, and are keen to try more, but the range and choice is confusing, and the advice can be subjective, especially in supermarkets. This book, based on Wallace Milroy's bestselling original Malt Whisky Almanac*, co-written with whisky writer Neil Wilson, describes regional styles and individual distillery characteristics which will enable you to make a more informed choice about which whiskies to try and buy. Whisky in Your Pocket details the malt whisky industry in Scotland, and Bushmills in Northern Ireland, (Islay's most southerly distillery) and also gives a brief overview of other distilleries. There are over 120 distilleries in the UK, with a growing number of countries making whisky today - England, Wales, Japan, Taiwan, India, USA, Canada, Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, Ireland, Korea to name but a few. With this book you will have a good understanding of the industry and what to buy. (*over 300,000 copies sold)",
