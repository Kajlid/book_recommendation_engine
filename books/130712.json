  "description": "Thirteen years ago, Elena Hart was known as the evil stepsister in Bisbee. An incident changed the course of Elena’s life, bringing her away from Bisbee to New York. Thirteen years later, Elena had transformed into Special Agent Samantha Levette. She was a shining star in the bureau and had since shed everything from her past, proving to herself that she wasn’t the evil stepsister … or has she? A face from her past, Ethan Evans, resurfaces in her life, forcing her to return to Bisbee and come face-to-face with the demons she thought she’d long conquered. Forgotten memories, well hidden insecurities, and both new and old challenges await as she returns to Bisbee. Even as she works at solving Ethan’s problem, even with a blossoming romance, Samantha still doubts herself. Has she truly rid herself of the evilness? Or is evilness her true identity?",
