  "description": "Hey! Nietzsche! Leave them Kids Alone! Why do goths wear black? Why do rock singers make that 'jesus' shape on stage? Why do songs about death and despair make us feel good? And why can't you get no satisfaction? According to Craig Schuftan, it all began about two hundred years ago. HEY, NIETZSCHE! is the first book to uncover the hidden roots of rock and roll in the romantic movement. Schuftan picks up a clue in My Chemical Romance's 'Welcome the Black Parade', and follows it into a world where Keats meets the Cure, Wordsworth hangs with Weezer, and Byron exchanges haughty glances with Bowie. From Schopenhauer's darkest days to Queen's greatest hits, HEY, NIEtZSCHE! is a wild ride through the nineteenth century with the best mix-tape in the world on the car stereo.",
