  "description": "Rape, pornography, and a barbershop quartet: Iowa 1985. Small town Dunleith, Iowa, along the Mississippi River, will provide locations for a music video. Introverted victim Ann Lambert (11) hides her assault from her mother, Tammany, who has championed the town to West Coast video producers. Dreamy Allen May (15) and his fledgling quartet stir local interest and land a cameo in the production. But Ann's and Allen's lives unravel during this time when America was beginning its fully digital age. Can small town values provide cover?",
