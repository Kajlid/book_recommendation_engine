  "title": "All It Takes Is Guts: A Minority View",
  "description": "Praised by Thomas Sowell, these columns are both entertaining and enlightening. This is a collection of Walter Williams' essays, drawn from his syndicated column. Williams writes with brilliant clarity--and he doesn't mince words. He destroys a number of prevailing myths, such as economic and social disparities being the result of racism and economic sanctions punishing the South African blacks more that the whites. Williams explains why the nature of congressmen is not to act in the national interest and shows how government regulations hinder rather than help the disadvantaged.",
