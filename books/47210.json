  "description": "Two brothers-one woman-unforgettable passion. Years before, Nikki fell in love with Mitch and Connor, only to ultimately betray them both. Now she's back and in need of their help. Powerful and commanding, Mitch has never stopped craving Nikki. Connor hungers for her just as badly, but isn't ready to forgive. If she needs some fast cash by working at their gentlemen's club, she'll have to audition-by stripping for them. Aroused by their shameless scrutiny, Nikki's willing to do whatever it takes to be near them again...even if that means being punished in the BDSM room or starring in one of Connor's erotic films. Mitch won't have it, however, unless he and Connor are the ones enjoying her body. On a sultry weekend, Nikki surrenders to their lust, reawakening a timeless bond and the beginnings of forgiveness.",
