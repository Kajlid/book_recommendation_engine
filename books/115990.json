  "description": "All three books in the Anniversary of the Veil epic fantasy series are now available in one convenient boxed set! This 3-book bundle contains: PROTECTOR DECISION MAKER FOREVER HUSBAND Kae always wanted to be a fighter. Now that he's made it into the ranks of the elite Protectors of the Realm, he discovers he isn't meant to protect his homeland but something far greater: the Veil. The Veil is a barrier created 1000 years ago and it separates the world in two. On one side lie untold stores of magic. On the other--Kae's side--magic is all but gone, eradicated by the priests over centuries, and he's one of only a few who can wield it. The priests, who secretly rule the Realm, see Kae's magical abilities as both a threat and a tool, and will do everything they can to control him. It's a price Kae's willing to pay to be the Protector he's always dreamed of being, even though it comes between him and Issa, the girl he loves. But the Veil has weakened over the last thousand years, and powers on both sides will do anything to prevent it from failing. Strangers have kidnapped Issa and intend to sacrifice her to strengthen the Veil. Kae is the only one who can save her before it's too late. But if he goes after her, he will lose everything heâ€™s worked so hard to attain. Yet if Kae chooses duty over love, Issa will die.",
