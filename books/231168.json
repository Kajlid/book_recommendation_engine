  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, shape-shifters, vampires, M/M, HEA] Alistair Costanova never thought he'd have a second chance at love until Sam Hayes blows into town and turns his world upside down. Shock sends him running away from the man wearing the face of his dead lover from several centuries ago, but circumstances and attractions keep drawing them closer. Sam Hayes is a very complicated man. Impulsive and a total slut, but he has some measure of depth to him. He's a man with several layers and a deeply buried secret only a select few in his family line know about. A born wizard, Sam had no choice but to keep that part of himself separate from his public life among humans, even his best friend Dorian. Moving to Melrose Town was supposed to be an adventure and a new start for Sam. Nothing had prepared him to be surrounded by a town full of vampires, but a quick adjustment was in order, especially since witches stayed neutral from every other species. Meeting Alistair sparks his interest and the aloof man brings out emotions he'd never felt before. For Alistair, staying away from Sam is more work than he thought possible, even if he needed to stay away for the man's own good. But with the increasing problem of made vampires and these two fighting the emotions they feel for each other, who will succumb first? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
