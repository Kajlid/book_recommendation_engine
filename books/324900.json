  "description": "There are enemies everywhere… But none as deadly as the one lurking inside me.Vampire gangs, Lucifer rising, hellhounds on the loose, and an unruly shadow creature hell-bent on taking control… And no, that’s not the beginning of a bad joke. It’s a nightmare.And it’s my life.To get to Hell and stop the coming war, we need to find the last three relics and open the gates. But the greatest threat isn’t Lucifer. It’s the creature who shares my soul.Hell will freeze over before my demons let me go, but with Sayah’s powers and influence growing, I’m not sure anyone can stop my greatest fear from coming true.I’m losing myself to the darkness.And scariest of all… I like it.",
