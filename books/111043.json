Though he may not have had the most pleasant life living at the coven, he still loved being there. But the steadiness of his world came to a halt all within one day's events. A man he never saw coming has pushed the boundaries of what little normalcy he has, and learning of a secret love is just confusing him even more. Zane has never felt more torn on what he should be feeling…and for whom.

Sorting out what he has to do, what he wants, and what's right for him will be the biggest challenge he's ever been faced with. Will he follow his heart or will he take the easy path…or is the easy path the right path to begin with?Reader Advisory: This book contains scenes of violence.Reader Advisory: This book is best read in sequence as it is part of a series.",
