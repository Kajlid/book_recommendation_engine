  "description": "Author/Illustrator April Chloe Terrazas continues with Book 5 of the Super Smart Science Series, sharing an in depth look at bones and muscles for kids. Candy colored illustrations are combined with simplified text and pronunciation guides in this upbeat, textbook-like guide. Beginning with the skeleton, continuing with bone anatomy (compact bone KOM-PAKT BONE, periosteum PER-EE-OS-TEE-UM, osteon OS-TEE-ON, spongy bone SPUN-JEE BONE, marrow MER-OH), the reader is brought face to face with the intriguing way our bodies are made. After a thorough look at bones and a review to reinforce the material, skeletal, cardiac and smooth muscles are explored, beginning with their physical appearance (striated or not), to where they are found in the body. Terrazas takes you even further into understanding how the body moves, combining the previously learned material on bones, muscles, tendons and ligaments and fusing it with the active role of the neuron in the neuromuscular junction!",
