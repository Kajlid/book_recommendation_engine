  "description": "Sasha:He’s a player. End of story.I’m not interested.Tate:Something about her lights me up inside. Makes me reckless.So what if she doesn’t like me?I like her—a lot.And once I turn on the charm, she doesn’t stand a chance.Sasha:Fine. Maybe we can use each other for sex.And the occasional late night conversation that nobody else will understand. That doesn’t mean anything…THE PLAY-BY-PLAY:* They don’t like each other, but they both like sex—and watching* They have more in common with each other than they want to admit* Sometimes the best fuck buddies are friends, tooTHE SCORE:* This is a hockey romance that takes place between seasons. Heavy on body-checking and double entendres, light on ice-time, let’s call it hockey-adjacent. We make up for that with angsty fighting, happy screwing, and a love story so secret even the main characters don’t see it coming.",
