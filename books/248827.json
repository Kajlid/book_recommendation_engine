  "description": "Imagine if you would. A nearly thirty year old woman-girl on her couch, wrapped in an over-sized comforter from her bed, the blanket over her head like a hood. No makeup. Bad hair. Stained night shirt.Next to her on said couch, numerous candy wrappers, a few slices of two day old pizza in a box, but will probably still get eaten, even though it might be beyond edible.Oh, and let’s not forget about the four wine bottles on the coffee table in front of her, but no glasses, because she just drank them straight from the bottle. Not a pretty picture huh? Well, I don’t feel pretty about it and why am I here like this now? Shall I rewind for you? Okay, thought so. Here is the story about how a girl (that’s me) and how I had the job and the guy of my dreams… Or so I thought.",
