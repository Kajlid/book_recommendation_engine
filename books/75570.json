  "description": "WANTED: Nanny who will put up with an infuriatingly grumpy Irish billionaire.If you throw Declan Bryne out of a plane at 40,000 feet, would he fly?That's the question I ask myself after he told me that it’d be “grand\" if I could stop talking.I can’t help it. I’m a nervous flyer.But that should've been my sign to hit EJECT!Because this hate-hate relationship is doomed to fail.He’s a total grump.He obviously doesn’t like me.He's too distractingly gorgeous to be around for any length of time.And he’s made it clear that as soon as he can find another nanny, I’m gone.But this Minnesota girl is made of tough stuff. I know I can make it through one Irish summer with one sexy Irish curmudgeon.At least I thought I could, until he became that much harder to resist.The more I work for Declan the more I, unfortunately, realize the truth...Declan hides an actual, beating heart behind his stormy, gruff demeanor.The way he is around his adorable niece, Catie, is Hallmark-worthy.And that accent.That suave Irish brogue makes my insides melt.The cardinal rule of being a nanny is to not get involved with the family.To maintain a professional distance.Kissing Declan would definitely cross that line.Sleeping with him?Put me in nanny jail and throw away the key.Some rules are meant to be kept.Others are meant to be shattered.",
