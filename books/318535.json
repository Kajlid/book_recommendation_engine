Everyone is blaming me for what happened to Micah, but nothing is as it seems. People are after me, and debts have to be repaid. That’s not the hardest pill to swallow, though. Watching Celeste change feels as if I’m losing my sister all over again. Elijah is convinced that I’ll destroy them all. Maybe he’s right. What I do know with absolute certainty is that this year, someone is going to Fall.Fall is the second book in Stratham Knights, a new adult/college age dark romance with enemies to lovers/hate to love themes that cannot be read as a standalone.
