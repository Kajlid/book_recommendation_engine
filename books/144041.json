  "title": "A Family Secret A Rabble Rouser and the Unmarked Grave: Three compelling reasons to preserve your family history",
  "description": "Three compelling reasons to preserve your family history. A short introduction to the benefits of having documented histories for families, communities and multi-generational businesses. It tells a story from the era of forced adoptions, where a family history document was able to determine the truth (or not) of an unexpected claim. In another example the famed Eureka Stockade on the Australian Goldfields had political and social ramifications for a family 150 years after the event. Again, the preservation of personal documents saved the day. Discover, as Bev Prideaux did, how the saving of your family's memories could be vitally important for you.",
