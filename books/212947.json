  "title": "Jester",
  "description": "A drifting comedian gets approached by an enticing as much as insane young woman and her imposing bodyguard with an interesting offer. He'll get to impersonate someone else, something he has successfully done in the past and help avert a rebellion from spreading out of control, something he's far from interested in but forced to agree. He gets drawn in an adventure worthy of the past's gutsiest heroes, which is unfortunate, when all you got to work with is a rather infamous but gutless Jester. The story is set in the Living Sword Chronicles expanded universe. The titular character first appeared in the King of Blades series of novels.",
