  "description": "The pandemic of fear continues to grip our world long past the clinical effects of COVID-19. Many people cannot let go of the fear fueling the Mass Delusional Psychosis which has plagued millions since early 2020. In his latest book, Freedom from Fear, Dr. Mark McDonald applies his well-honed psychiatric acuity to the undiagnosed epidemic of fear addiction. Just like a drug, fear becomes an unhealthy mental and emotional dependency that must be broken. In Freedom from Fear, Dr. McDonald presents the essential twelve-step guide to personal and worldwide recovery. His precepts include simple but practical steps like “Face the Mirror,” “Don’t be a Sheep,” “Choose Reality,” “Reject Narcissism,” “Think for Yourself,” “Embrace Adulthood,” “Pay Attention,” and “Embrace Fearless Leadership.” Bold and straightforward, Dr. McDonald once again draws on his experience as a psychiatrist and physician to diagnose this worldwide affliction. In this companion book to United States of Fear, he prescribes the consummate treatment plan for eradicating this Mass Delusional Psychosis once and for all.",
