  "description": "Lacey was pretty happy with her current leisure existence despite the few complaints here and there. Living on her own rocked her socks. However, while coming home from work one night and based on sheer awful luck, she witnessed a disturbing attack on a young and rather eye-catching youth. Thinking the worse was over she continued to go about her daily business. That is, until the boy she saw sprawled out on the bloody street shows up pressed against her balcony window. Obviously something is wrong. This boy should be dead. He is dead. So why then is he stalking her, in the nude? Does he want to start his own army of creatures of the night or does he feel some kind of enticement to her that is unexplainable? Lacey will soon come to ï¬�nd that not all legendary stories are true, when it comes to being involved with a Vampire.",
