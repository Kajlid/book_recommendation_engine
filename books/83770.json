After a decade of lies, hurt, and severe abuse by her brother Lucas, Sabra Valentine is able to breathe.

Now, seven years later, life is moving forward, and Sabra is starting to heal, live, and love again with her friends and Trevor Collins by her side. He’s tall, dark, and sexy, and he doesn’t fall for Sabra’s games. The future is finally looking bright—until one phone call shatters everything. \nUsed is a romantic suspense with domestic thriller elements. Please be aware that there are topics that may be triggers for some readers, and this work is meant for mature readers.",
