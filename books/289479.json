  "description": "Alison Green, desperate valedictorian-wannabe, agrees to produce her school's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. That's her first big mistake. The second is accidentally saying Yes to a date with her oldest friend, Jack, even though she's crushing on Charlotte. Alison manages to stay positive, even when her best friend starts referring to the play as \"Ye Olde Shakespearean Disaster.\" Alison must cope with the misadventures that befall the play if she's going to survive the year. She'll also have to grapple with what it means to be \"out\" and what she might be willing to give up for love.",
