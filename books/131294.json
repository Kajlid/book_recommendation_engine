  "description": "\"The heart isn’t like the liver. It doesn’t regenerate, no matter how much time passes. Once it’s gone, it’s gone for good. I’d left mine with Sebastian when I walked away that day, and I hadn’t seen it in the seven years since.\" — Lux Kincaid  At eighteen, Lux is forced to make a choice. One that nearly destroys her.  She breaks a boy’s heart.  She breaks her own, too.  Seven years later, Lux never expects to see Sebastian again — especially not when her career as a journalist is hanging by a thread and she’s stumbled onto the story of a lifetime. As she chases down leads and explores the dark underbelly of Manhattan, Lux will put her life on the line. But after crossing paths with a still-unforgiving Sebastian, it’s her heart she’s most worried about.  Amidst the blame and the betrayal, the hurt and the heartbreak… can two lost lovers ever find their way back to one another?  Lines will be blurred. The past will be unearthed. And Lux will find out that some secrets aren’t meant to be kept…   **SAY THE WORD is a sassy, sexy, suspenseful contemporary romance intended for readers ages 17 and up.**",
