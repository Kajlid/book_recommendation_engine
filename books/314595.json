  "description": "Some people go to Hollywood to chase their dream.My Hollywood dream is in seat 4A.After the stunt my ex pulled, no one would blame me if I swore off men forever, especially one like Mr Jay Anderson, Hollywood’s sexiest heartthrob. Maybe undressing me with his striking blue eyes as I perform the safety demonstration on a flight to LA is normal behaviour for him.Maybe not.But I know one thing for sure, he should come with a warning label. Because once you meet a man like Jay Anderson, there is no going back.With his dirty blonde hair and those eyes; he’s a beautiful, X-rated fairy-tale. But beauty is a magnificent smokescreen. And a fairy-tale is just that… a tale.It’s never as simple as happily ever after,not when you’re meeting Mr Anderson.",
