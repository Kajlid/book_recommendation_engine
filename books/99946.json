  "description": "In the fifth installment of Brea Brownâ€™s much-beloved series, the lovably flawed \"secret keeper,\" Peyton Northam, suspects the people closest to her are keeping some pretty big things from her. Once the center of her circle of friends, she's now no longer the go-to confidante. She'd always thought this would be a welcome relief, but instead finds it frustrating and hurtful to always be the last to know everything. And that's what seems to be happening more and more often. She wants to know as much as she doesn't want to know, and it's starting to make her nuts. Or is that just the hormones taking over for the perpetually pregnant pastor's wife? At the same time, Peyton's ever-developing drive to do the right thing is hampering her ability to keep certain secrets. Now, she may have to let go of a confidence that has been nagging at her conscience for years. But is it really her secret to tell?",
