  "title": "A Renegade History of the United States: How Drunks, Delinquents, and Other Outcasts Made America",
  "description": "Popular historian Thaddeus Russell offers a highly provocative and absorbing new perspective on America's history that will turn convention on its head and is sure to elicit as much controversy as it does support. Russell shows that drunkards, laggards, prostitutes, and pirates were the real heroes of the American Revolution. Slaves worked less and had more fun than free men. Prostitutes, not feminists, won women's liberation. White people lost their rhythm when they became good Americans. Without organized crime, we might not have Hollywood, Las Vegas, labour unions, legal alcohol, birth control, or gay rights. Zoot-suiters and rock-and-rollers, not Ronald Reagan or the peace movement, brought down the Soviet Union. And Britney Spears will win the war on terror. The more that 'bad' people existed, resisted, and won, the greater was our common good. In A RENEGADE HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES, Russell introduces us to the origins of America's identity as we have never seen it before.",
