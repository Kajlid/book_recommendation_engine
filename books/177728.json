  "title": "That Night with My Boss",
  "description": "Can one passionate night change everything?  \"Scott Taylor is a Sex God.\" That's what Elizabeth Jeffries told her best friend Lacey, the moment after she laid eyes on him. It wasn't just because his azure blue eyes seemed to pierce her soul, or the fact that his dark silky hair drew her fingers in like a magnet. It wasn't even that he smelled like sex on the beach on a cool balmy night or the fact that when he grabbed her around the waist and drew her to him, she lost her breath. No, those weren't the only reasons why Elizabeth called Scott a sex god. They weren't even the reasons why she decided to spend the night with him. Or the reasons why she decided to accept the one job that would change her life and complicate everything they had.  No, the fact that Scott Taylor was a Sex God was the reason she was drawn to him, but the reason why she stayed was a whole lot more complicated.  NOTE: This novella is a free steamy prequel to the full-length standalone novel Falling For My Boss, that will be released on May 16th. It will also be included Falling For My Boss when it is released, so you can read it first as a free download or you can read it as part of the novel on release day.",
