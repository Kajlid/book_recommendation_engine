  "description": "Imagine, if you will, a different world; one of free-love and pirates; burglary and Noahâ€™s ark. A world that takes you anywhere and everywhere; the bedroom of a murderous couple; two men fighting for a dumpster in the midst of a recession; the ultimate showdown between Socialism and Capitalism; all to end with the actors from the Wizard of Oz reunited in heaven. Take the escalator or the stairs on this unforgettable journey of ten minute plays.",
