  "description": "New Orleans PI Micky Knight just had to get into a butch pissing contest with the journalist partner of a famous doctor working with her lover, Cordelia James. Micky's insistence that the skills of a reporter are of no use to a PI backfires, and now she's stuck with a drop-dead gorgeous assistant and the case of a dying gay man looking for a child he might have fathered. These chains of events—and an act of nature—will tear Micky's life apart in ways that may never be put back together.",
