  "description": "Tyler can Cross into parallel realities.  Employed by the Alternate Worlds Organisation, he collects data about differences encountered. Except theyâ€™ve apprehended and accused him of a crime he can't recollect.  They must have the wrong seventeen-year old?  Nope - even Tyler's friends have evidence against him.  There are rules to being an Alternate Worlds Viewer: DO NOT interact with the environment. DO NOT interfere with events. DO NOT reveal the ability to Cross.  Tyler has broken the rules. But which? All of them?  Chased by the organisation, he will Cross through worlds to uncover the true traitor or risk the lives of zillions.  Tyler Nitbone must interfere to undo the interference.",
