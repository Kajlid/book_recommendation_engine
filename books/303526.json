  "description": "William “Beefy” Goodness and Jerome “Leafy” Green are about as different as two Los Angeles Police Departmentdetectives can be. Although both served in the United States military and happen to be effective crime solvers, they are opposites in most other ways. Whether it’s their opinions on politics or fast food or the fact that Beefy is from Chicago and Leafy hails from Oakland, they manage to put aside their differences to form a cohesive team. Their current focus is the bizarre murder of a model on the famous Hollywood sign in LA. The woman was gunned down in broad daylight, but figuring out why and by whom is no simple matter. The two detectives may have their share of resources yet the further they get on the case, the stranger it becomes. Not every foul thing that transpires in LA can be blamed on the Santa Ana winds. Something beyond the usual “California crazy” is afoot, and Beefy and Leafy need to figure it out before it’s too late.",
