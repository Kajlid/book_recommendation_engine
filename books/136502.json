  "description": "Brianna is lost for the fourth time in her life. The first life-altering event occurred when her mother died. The second was when she was kidnapped at the age of seventeen and forced to be a slave. She would never forget those ten months. Everything changed again the day Stephan steamrolled into her life. That first month with him was, in some ways, more confusing than the prior ten. As a slave, she’d known her place. With Stephan everything was new and different. He’d given her freedom and so much more. Five months after Stephan rescued her, Brianna once again finds her life flipped upside down. In this fourth, and final, installment of Finding Anna, Brianna must unearth strength she never knew she possessed. She must learn to trust herself, embrace who she is, and discover who she wants to be. Only by facing her demons can Brianna find true happiness and peace.",
