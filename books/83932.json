  "title": "A Volcano Beneath the Snow: John Brown's War Against Slavery",
  "description": "John Brown is a man of many legacies, from hero, freedom fighter, and martyr, to liar, fanatic, and \"the father of American terrorism.\" Some have said that it was his seizure of the arsenal at Harper's Ferry that rendered the Civil War inevitable.Deeply religious, Brown believed that God had chosen him to right the wrong of slavery. He was willing to kill and die for something modern Americans unanimously agree was a just cause. And yet he was a religious fanatic and a staunch believer in \"righteous violence,\" an unapologetic committer of domestic terrorism. Marrin brings 19th-century issues into the modern arena with ease and grace in a book that is sure to spark discussion.",
