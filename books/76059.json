  "description": "Seven long years of war have reshaped the once peaceful island of New Eden. While Rain has matured in the care of the Keepers, Ana’Lira led the islanders in holding the Moon King’s vast armies at bay. Battles were fought and won with little cost to the clans, but now something comes from across the El’Varion that will likely leave the island and her people in ruins. Suddenly, the ever victorious Queen is nowhere to be found, leaving her children to face their greatest threat alone. But whether dead or captured, Ana’Lira’s fate lie with a hopeful child, who must seek and save the only mother she has ever known. Will the magic come when Rain calls? Only time will tell, and the one thing the Heartstones do not have is time.  The legend continues . . .",
