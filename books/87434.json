  "description": "Five hundred years ago, the vampires and humans waged a war of survival and supremacy. Eventually, a human mage stepped forward and offered to turn the mighty river that divided their lands into a never-ending flow of blood, from which the vampires could sate their savage yet vital need, without having to feed on the humans. Both sides being desperate to end the war, the vampires agreed and thus peace and harmony reigned for centuries between the races.Now, a mysterious being has cursed the river, which is slowly reverting back to its watery state. If the curse succeeds, war will erupt again, a fate neither race wishes to see occur.Rayna and Bram, two vampire youths, who are both childhood friends and on the verge of discovering their love for each other, have taken it upon themselves to solve the mystery of the nameless sorcerer—the only person who can undo the curse. Both the humans and vampires accuse the other of being responsible, either side making a valid argument against the other.Can Rayna and Bram determine the villain’s identity before the river returns to water? Will relations between them and their human companions endure or suffer through these trying times?",
