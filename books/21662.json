  "description": "The Duchess of Devonshire's second book, first published in 1778, chronicles the life of a young, newly married lady of high society not unlike its author. Written in epistolary format, the story follows Julia from her idyllic country life to her marriage to a rich aristocrat. She soon discovers her husband is nothing other than a rake, spending all his and her money on gambling and mistresses. Without the protection of a husband, soon others come on the scene, intent on taking advantage of young and naive Julia. An anonymous guardian, in the guise of The Sylph, writes to her, giving her guidance through her troubles...but will it be enough?",
