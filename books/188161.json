But I am ready to kill.\"\nWhen Captain Caleb Shepperd is released from prison, all he wants to do is keep his head down and earn a living smuggling illegal cargo through the nine systems. When a synth stows away on Shepperd's ship, bringing with her a crap-ton of problems, including guilt-ridden secrets the captain thought he’d escaped, he’d prefer to toss her out the airlock. The problem is, she’s priceless tech, and he’s fresh out of credit. #1001 is not meant to exist. Created for a single purpose, she has one simple order: to kill. But not everything is as it seems. Buried deep inside, she remembers... Remembers when she was human. And she remembers what Shepperd did to her. She’s not ready to die, but she is ready to kill. From the bestselling author of the Veil Series comes an action-packed story of redemption and revenge. WARNING: 18+ only. Contains graphic adult content, including sex, drug use, violence, and a plethora of curse words.",
