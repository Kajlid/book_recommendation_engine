  "description": "Matched to the wrong alien…\nGeorgia wanted a prince, not a massive brute. When a clerical error lands her on a backwater planet with only anti-social Talen for company, she knows there’s been a mistake. The agency says it will take months to fix, but the more time she spends with Talen learning about his surprising hidden depths and surrendering to his sensual embrace, the more she wonders if Celestial Mates was wrong after all.   Talen lives for his books… and his family… So when his brother’s latest scheme delivers a human female to his door he refuses to turn her away. She’s part of his pride now and her luscious form and biting wit are vital to his future. He’ll win her heart and convince her that no matter how they were brought together, she’s the only one for him.  Read Pulled by the Tail for a happily ever after that includes a flock of cat-peacocks, plenty of steam, babies, and more!",
