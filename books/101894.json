  "description": "After aspiring novelist Francis Scanlon is expelled from a prestigious creative writing program, he is forced to become a spin doctor at the Prock Chocolate Corporation while he awaits the publication of his masterpiece. But Francisâ€™s expectations of easy money and literary glory are thwarted by a paranoid boss, a charlatan writing coach, a snarky reporter, a sanctimonious public health crusader, an oily U.S. Senator, and a radical Muslim cleric with absolutely no sense of humor. As the story unfolds, Francis is swept up by market forces and transformed from Millennial hipster to globe-trotting corporate jet-setter. Corporate America is a smart, outrageously funny debut that deftly blends bone-dry satire, high ideals and bad taste without ever showing its seams.",
