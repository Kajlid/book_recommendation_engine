Secrets you don’t want to know or be involved in. How do you think they got this way in the first place? It’s best to follow your head and stay as far away from them as possible.

Yet as they spend time together, something about him—everything about him—feels so right.But when threats from her past make her question what little she does remember, Ivy must decide whether to run again or trust the one person she can’t live without.",
