  "description": "Andy McNab meets Buffy the Vampire the Slayer in this razor sharp fast moving supernatural thriller from an exciting new author.  \"My name is unimportant, but you can call me Jack. I'm a musician by choice, a magician by profession, and a bastard by disposition. I'd been doing the magic thing for about five years when they found me. They said I had a talent, that I was smart enough and fit enough and enough of a shit that I could serve my country in a way most people never even get to hear about. And I did want to serve my country, didn't I? I didn't really want to contemplate what might happen if I said no.\" And so Jack found himself on the front line of a secret war that most people simply wouldn't believe was possible. Working for a secret organization tasked with defending our country from whatever supernatural threat faces it. MI5 know nothing about and would laugh if they found out. Well at first they would. Whether wiping out a group of demon summoners, infiltrating a coven determined to assassinate the PM, or rooting out a neo-nazi sect who are trying to bring back Hitler from the dead Jack is a very modern sort of magician—trained in a variety of the dark arts but also a dab hand with a Heckler and Koch, skilled in unarmed combat and electronic surveillance. David Devereux has combined the action writing of McNab and Ryan with dark supernatural thrills and produced a blistering new breed of supernatural thriller. This is Dennis Wheatley for the 21st century.",
