  "description": "Gertrud Von Le Fort wrote \nThe Song at the Scaffold\n in 1931, five years after converting to the Catholic Faith. At that time she was considered Germany's most influential Catholic poet and novelist. The Song at the Scaffold is a novelette set in the time of the French Revolution, an epoch that vividly demonstrated man's capacity for both heroism and brutality. It is a very intense story dealing primarily with the Carmelite Convent at Compiegne but also encompassing the Paris mob, the Reign of Terror, Women Revolutionists, etc., climaxing in the martyrdom of sixteen Carmelite nuns. Excellent reading for both students and adults-",
