They have seen firsthand a real, loving, and powerful God Who is always true to His Word and Who longs to have a personal relationship with us all.Walking like a warrior? Simply means traveling on the trail God has set before us in the love, grace, and strength He has provided through Jesus, being purpose-minded, not provision-minded as we reach out to those on that trail.Enjoy the many photographs and travel the trail with them, living the adventure!",
