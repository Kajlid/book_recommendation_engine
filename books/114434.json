Magic does blow throughout the world, and Zip proves it!\" —Lauren Myracle, New York Times bestselling author of ttyl one girl + one scooter = journey of a lifetime When Lyssa’s mother died, so did the magic—that special something that always made the sunflowers grow taller and the strawberry jelly taste sweeter. So when Lyssa receives the alarming news that her childhood home in Texas is about to be bulldozed, she sets off on a two-wheeled cross-country journey to save her family home—and with it, the last remaining sparkle of her earlier life. On her odyssey, Lyssa meets some decidedly unusual people—from rowdy cowgirls to a chorus line of singing mermaids—and discovers adventure at every highway turn. But it’s the magic that she uncovers, little by little, along the way that will ultimately put a new zip in her step!",
