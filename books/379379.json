  "description": "Oh, what's a girl to do, when she finds a sexy, naked man in her back garden? When a naked guy turns up in Mae's back garden, she can't decide if he's crazy, or sent from heaven. He can't remember his name, or where he's from, but he seems to know one thing for certain - Mae is in need of some hot loving, and fast. However, the more he persuades her to let go and give in, the more she finds herself believing that she's met him before. But childhood games with a boy who she's sure had wings on his back are giving way to her deepest sexual fantasies, and dreams of another world entirely are not far behind",
