  "title": "Why Me? A Spiritual Guide to Growing Through Tests",
  "description": "This book explains in a simple, profound and often humorous way, why a kind and loving God will give us tests in order to help us develop our full spiritual potential. Starting with the metaphor of a gardener pruning a rose bush, it goes on to explain the four kinds of tests, the role of emotions in identifying tests, and the spiritual tools we can use to pass tests with flying colors. Personal tests can either draw us towards God, or push us away. If you are facing challenges that threaten to weaken your faith in God, this book will renew your faith and expand your vision of who you are and why you are here. It has already helped thousands of people discover the hidden gifts behind the tests they are facing. It offers a much more convincing explanation of why God allows us to face difficulties than the book \"Why Bad Things Happen to Good People.\" By the author of \"The Secret of Emotions.\"",
