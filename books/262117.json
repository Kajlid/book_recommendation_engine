  "description": "WHEN VENGEANCE STRIKES, LOVE IS THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME OF ALLAfter a Massachusetts court frees accused murderer Rob Townsend, the victim’s closest friend seeks bitter revenge. But Dylan Johnson may be no match for Townsend, a killer with a powerful reason of his own to double-down on homicide—his ex-girlfriend Heather Carter is now involved with Dylan.As brutal jealousy and violent revenge rage, a mysterious corporate recruiter from Tanzania contacts Dylan and Heather with an offer to leave behind the murder and mayhem for lucrative positions in Africa. Coffie Kuma tells them they’ll be working on “technology with a humanitarian heartbeat.” Kuma’s pitch is persuasive, his stately manner impressive. And since both Dylan and Heather are out of work, it’s an offer they can’t refuse.Dylan’s attempt to leave, though, could be cut short when detectives unearth incriminating evidence that ties him not only to the targeting of Townsend, but to the shooting and paralyzing of a beloved Boston policeman. Then, Townsend tries to thwart Heather’s escape by blackmailing her with humiliating evidence of her own bad behavior.Deeply troubling questions haunt both Dylan and Can they find real freedom under the African sun? Or will it be feeding time on the savannah?With Shadowed, Thomas Waite, the author of widely published and critically acclaimed thrillers, sweeps readers from Boston’s luxurious condos to the wildest, most remote reaches of Africa. That’s where his sharply-drawn characters discover that nature, “red in tooth and claw,” can scarcely compete with the violence of humans. And, in a unique twist, Waite offers a vivid and ingenious reinvention of Richard Cornell’s classic short story, The Most Dangerous Game.",
