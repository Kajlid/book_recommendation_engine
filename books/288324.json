  "description": "What does it take to make someone a Merlin?  A once noble land lies in ruins. A life of torment, starvation, and terror is all that awaits those who had survived. Though hope is not dead yet. Hidden away from the rest of the world, young Cedrick Custod is forbidden to use or study magic. One accidental spell will bring the fury of his father crashing down upon him. Yet, if he leverages the power inside of him, they could defeat Heklis: the evil sorcerer, who in a jealous rage killed off every last man, woman, and child of these divinely commissioned Custod and kingly Potentate lines. To save their world, Cedrick will have to choose between duty and family, between his own desires and those he loves most. Can he overcome his father’s fury and find the key to saving his world? Or will he be doomed to watch as his father allows his world fall into darkness?",
