  "description": "ASIN moved from less recent editionAn American musician with a broken heart meets a local farmer with a hidden past on a holiday house swap in Yorkshire. A charming romantic comedy that will fill your heart with holiday cheer A country cottage is the last place Paige expected to spend the holidays, but a year after her girlfriend dumped her, her life is in shambles. A last minute house swap sends her from California to Yorkshire to put her life back on track. She doesn't believe in forever anymore, but when she meets a raven haired beauty in the local pub, she seizes the chance for a night of fun.  On the brink of fame and fortune, Fiona suffered an unthinkable loss, and a year later she's given up on singing, and just about everything else. When the brother she relies on too much skips town “for her own good” and loans his cottage to a stranger for the holidays, her life is turned upside down. She knows she can't make a new relationship work, but when she meets a purple haired American at the local pub, she figures it wouldn't hurt to blow off some steam. They never meant to see each other again, yet from the very first morning when the vicar comes to call and Paige gets mowed down by a runaway llama, they just can't seem to escape their lives becoming increasingly, and hilariously, entwined. And when a series of calamities threatens Christmas in Holme village, the two must work together to save the day, and maybe find true love along the way. A year ago, their lives fell apart. Can a bit of Christmas magic help them build a new life together?",
