  "description": "In this paranormal romance, Felicity, a college student, travels to the Amazon rainforest for her cultural study abroad program. She doesn’t expect to find love; she expects to explore the influences of modern society on tribal cultures, and she hopes to interview the reticent Jebá, an attractive man who acts as interpreter between the remote tribes and the government programs that seek to understand them better.There’s more than hostile tribes in the jungle, though. A malevolent group of human and drug traffickers, the Selvagens Verdes, use the lush forest to cover up their violent crime. When Felicity accidentally crosses their path and is rescued by a jaguar, she must question why the jaguar dealt so ruthlessly with her attackers, and why she was spared.Readers will enjoy watching two very different worlds collide in this erotic shifter romance.",
