  "title": "Passing Notes",
  "description": "Mark has finally gotten the attention of the girl of his dreams. Only, his lame attempts at romance through texts and emails seem to be turning her off. When he gets put in the back of the room in an over-full class at school, he begins to discover old notes giving advice about how to write a great love letter. At first he thinks he’s stumbled on some long-forgotten notes passed in class ages ago, but every time he reads them they seem directed specifically to him. They also appear at the perfect moment each time he needs more advice. It’s like someone is haunting him.  How do the notes keep appearing? Who’s writing them? Why?  And if Mark follows the ghostly writer’s advice, will he win Bethany’s love?",
