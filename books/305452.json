  "description": "Her father made a deal. An agreement that Kasia Garska must now fulfill. Marriage to a man who would as easily toss her to the streets as he would take his next breath. While Dominik's father is in Poland, hiding from impending legal trouble in Chicago, Dominik must take control of the family and move forward with a long ago agreement. There is suspicion the Garska family is behind the charges, and Dominik firmly believes in the adage of keeping your enemies close. Kasia is not the enemy Dominik expected, and before long he wants more than to keep a watchful eye on her father. He wants her. To possess her, punish her, truly own her. And he will, because Kasia is his to take.",
