  "title": "Mockingbird: A Portrait of Harper Lee",
  "description": "\"To Kill a Mockingbird\" is the most widely read American novel ever. Yet its creator, Harper Lee, has become a mysterious figure who routinely turns away reporters. She has never been the subject of a book--until now. \"Mockingbird\" is a colorful portrait of this unconventional, high-spirited, and sometimes hardheaded woman who loved her Southern home and the craft of writing and who-from these undying affections--created a book whose power has never diminished.",
