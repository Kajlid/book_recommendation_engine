  "description": "I'm the King of Sin City. I run it with flare and I'm cocky as hell. I know how to make money and how to make it look easy.  I have one problem. Scratch that. I've got two problems. Dante Valentino of the Valentino Crime Family.  A punk boss but I know he is a joke, and im biding my time until I see him with problem #2, Raveena.  I left this woman for her safety long ago. This wasn't the life for her, and I didn't want her blood on my hands during the war that came. Now Dante's making waves and he has my woman on his arm, flaunting her.  I'm about to reclaim what's mine. I'm the King of Sin City for a reason, and I'm going to make this a Valentine's Day she never forgets.",
