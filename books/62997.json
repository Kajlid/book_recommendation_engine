  "description": "The early part of the 19th Century held a lot of promise for a young man born into the upper-crust of London society. Henry Stuart was such a man – educated, handsome, and headstrong - the only son of a prominent financier. The world was poised at Henry’s feet ready to give up its treasures - and pleasures - to one so seemingly deserving of such a gift. On the night of his graduation from university there began a series of events which would alter the course of his life forever, sending him down a dark and treacherous path. Along the journey are characters of all sorts with whom Henry must interact if he is going to find his way. Follow his journey from privileged gent to that of being one of the most feared vampires in all of London – if not the whole of England. Will the beast win out in the end? Or will Henry’s humanity triumph?",
