  "title": "Everything as It Should Be: Discovering Switzerland",
  "description": "Sent over to ZÃ¼rich for a year, the author finds herself confronted with a steady stream of visitors with diverse interests. In between entertaining these visitors, she struggles to keep everything in order, tries to cope with the sexual orientation of German words, uncovers such odd facts as when the first dog ascent of the Eiger was made, and goes in search of uncluttered views. In this highly amusing account, mountains appear out of nowhere, a lost valley is found, and a lake goes missing.",
