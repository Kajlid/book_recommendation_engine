  "description": "This edition is out of print.Anonymous sticky-notes, a scheming bully, and a ruined summer send fourteen-year-old Wendy down a trail of secrets and self-discovery. Wendy Robichaud doesn't care one bit about being popular like her good-looking classmates Tookie and the Sticks—until Brainiac bully John-Monster schemes against her, and someone leaves anonymous sticky-note messages all over school. Even the best friend she always counted on, Jennifer, is hiding something and pulling away. But the Spring Program, abandoned puppies, and high school track team tryouts don’t leave much time to play detective. When secrets and failed dreams kick off the summer after eighth grade, will Jennifer still be around to support her as high school starts in the fall? Using humor and offering hope, this story for tweens and young teens delicately addresses issues of bullying, eating disorders, imperfect families, and teen suicide.",
