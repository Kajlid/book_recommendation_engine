  "description": "I’ve always wanted a daddy to love me, even at my naughtiest. My reputation as a brat is one I’ve earned, but I wish it wouldn’t scare away all my potential partners before they get to know me. I am so much more than my lack of impulse control, if only someone would stick around for longer than a scene or two.Luke is the first person I’ve played with in a while who can handle me at my worst. He gets me in a way most doms don’t bother trying. The only problem is, he’s my best friend’s brother.With my track record, it’s only a matter of time before I scare Luke away. And when the inevitable happens, I don’t want to put Tate in the middle of my drama. Is it really worth risking my closest friendship for a chance at everything I’ve ever wanted?Knotty Boy is a kinky M/M romance between Monty, a pudgy brat with ADHD and Luke, a rope bondage expert and daddy dom who is used to taking charge. The book contains BDSM elements including spanking, rope bondage, suspension bondage, and daddy kink. It’s part of the series Summer of Adventures, but it can stand alone.",
