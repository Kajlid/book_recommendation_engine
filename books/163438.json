  "description": "The climax of the “fascinating”( Locus) alternate-history series— from the national bestselling author of Navigator, Conqueror, and Emperor. It is a war that has been fought throughout the centuries—with the fate of Rome to Christendom to modern America at stake. Now, during World War II, Germany launches a successful invasion of England. But in secret they are waging a war on an even larger scale. Trapped in the middle of it is Mary Wooler, an American historian caught in the Blitz and tangled up in strands of history; her son Gary, fighting a ruthless invader at civilization’s frontier; and Ben Kaman, a Jewish refugee whose very dreams place him at the heart of a conspiracy that threatens the very fabric of the tapestry of time.",
