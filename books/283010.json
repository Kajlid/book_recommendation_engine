  "description": "Manhattan is a stand-alone, small town, country romance in the Becker Brothers Series. \nKylie NelsonEveryone knows not to fall in love with your best friend.But when your best friend is Michael Becker, it’s impossible not to.He’s everything our town knows a Becker brother to be: devastatingly handsome, charming as a thief, and the icing on the cake — a sentimental musician who’s never without his guitar.And he was mine. At least, that’s what I’d convinced myself.Our bond was born in elementary school, strengthened by circumstance and the promise to always be there for each other, no matter what. And the best thing about my life was being friends with Michael Becker.Until it was the worst.I watched him fall in love with someone else, and helped patch him back up when she left him behind. But when he drops the bomb that he’s moving to New York, I realize it’s my last chance to tell him how I feel. And I ask him to make one more promise.One summer. One list of adventures to remind him that our small town has more to offer than memories of the girl who left him behind.One last chance to tell him I’m in love with him.And I’m just dumb enough to believe that maybe he could love me, too.",
