  "title": "Rocky: The World's Greatest Cookbook Salesman",
  "description": "Most dogs, especially cairn terriers, don't make their living selling cookbooks. But then Rocky is not like most dogs! Any animal lover understands that our pets can communicate with each other and with us. So it will come as no surprise that Rocky can talk and understand human speech, while it is only the humans he meets that can't speak dog! Rocky has a mission in mind as he sets off on his cookbook-selling adventures. His travels take him across the country and back as he risks tail, tooth and paw to help those in need. The beautiful illustrations will help younger readers understand the story. However the inspiring message of Rocky's tale will fill the heart and mind of any dog lover, young or old, especially those everyday heroes who live and work in the world of animal rescue. Deirdre Bailleu, who has been involved in dog rescue for ten years, lives in Iowa with her husband Kenneth and an ever changing cast of rescue dogs. Virginia Walker is an artist and muralist who has worked on many large commercial, governmental & private mural projects with her talented husband, Steve Pedersen, and lives in Baltimore, Maryland with two adorable terriers.",
