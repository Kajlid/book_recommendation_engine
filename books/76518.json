  "description": "P. G. Wodehouse's Very Good, Jeeves! is a collection of short stories starring Bertie Wooster in 11 alarming predicaments from which he has to be rescued by his peerless gentleman's gentleman. Whether Bertie is tangled with a red-headed ball of fire such as Roberta Wickham, dealing with an irate headmistress, placating a cabinet minister, puncturing the wrong hot water bottle, singing \"Sonny Boy,\" or simply trying to concentrate on his golf handicap, Jeeves is always there to help--though rarely in ways which his employer expects. These brilliantly plotted stories give the essence of Wodehousean comedy.",
