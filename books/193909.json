  "description": "Dell was once listed by Fortune as the most admired company in the world and held the #1 market share in personal computing. Between 1991 and 1999, Dell’s stock price outperformed that of its next closest competitor by a factor of 20 times - only to lose 70 percent of its value by 2009 as the company struggled with the pressures of Wall Street, missed product transitions, and deteriorating customer service. In this essential new innovation text, Dell insider Heather Simmons asks: How did Dell go from one of the most admired firms in the world to a company in a holding pattern for the better part of a decade? More importantly, how might it come back?Heather Simmons was a senior director at Dell from its early days in Austin, through the growth years of the 90s and the tumultuous mid-2000s. With exclusive, insightful interviews from former Dell employees, Simmons provides an insider’s perspective on declining innovation at the company. Simmons combines insights from former Dell employees and seminal innovation thinking, including principles and frameworks from Clayton Christensen (The Innovator’s Dilemma) and Linda Hill (Collective Genius) to analyze Dell’s culture. Reinventing Dell turns Dell’s rise, fall, and emergent return into cogent lessons that business leaders can’t do without. Revealing, funny, and incredibly useful, Heather Simmons’ Reinventing Dell is a must-read for leaders in the digital age.",
