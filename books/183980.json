  "description": "The Gemini Exception A strange phenomenon occurs out of nowhere. An omnipresent light that engulfs the entire planet. Humanity is forever changed by the light. NOAA and NASA are mystified. People soon face a new threat; even the smallest, most insignificant injury will no longer heal. Doctors cannot stop it. The sick do not die … they change. They are Scabs. As the survivors flee, it becomes clear there is no place to run and time is short. The topography of the planet begins to change. Devastation and destruction ensue on a massive scale. Scott and Warren Walsh are brothers. Over a thousand miles separate them from one another. Something about them is special, and places them in a category with only 0.2% of the world’s population. Only one thing gives Scott, Warren and others like them hope against the Scabs.
