As a group of radicals protest the plight of the workers and one of the judges brings in the military as a precaution, it seems the town of Woolbridge is headed for trouble. When Raif's young cousin comes to stay and gets involved, Raif will be forced to act to keep his family safe and his town intact. Soon enough a salesman lies dead in his bed and a radical is brutally murdered out on the hillsides.
