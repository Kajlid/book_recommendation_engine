  "description": "I was asked by a man that has befriended me on a popular social network site to write 40 Ways To Please A Good Woman right after I released my newest title June 10th 2013 titled 40 Ways To Please A Good Man. This was so interesting to me because it became my new niche of writing and I was excited just thinking about what I was going to write. 40 ways is not intended to be given to just anyone but a good woman likewise a good man. When we decide to give 40 ways to the wrong person that can hurt us beyond compare. The 40 ways is to put that spark, kindle, flame and passion right back into your relationships that may be a bit dry and sour so fasten your seat belts and enjoy the 40 Ways and remember marriage is pleasing to God always.",
