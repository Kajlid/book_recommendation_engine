  "description": "People have been born into families since people started getting born at all. Playwrights have been trying to write family plays for a long time, too.

Acclaimed playwright Will Eno brings his signature irreverence to this new comedy, which won the 2014 Obie and Lucille Lortel awards for Best New Play.",
