  "description": "Weird fiction with a darkly sensual twist. BLACK PROPAGANDA delves deep into the dark, twisted roots of human nature and human sexuality. Using desire to dissect the delusions and dilemmas of will, choice and identity, this collection challenges genre boundaries and social conventions. Transgressive, confrontational, passionate, poignant, these sinister stories touch on every shade of black, from noir to the Lovecraftian cosmic abyss. Readers may be horrified, touched, tempted â€“ never unmoved. This is the first short story collection from noted British poet and weird fiction writer Paul StJohn Mackintosh. Few British writers have dared trace the borderlines between lust, insanity and terror so graphically since Clive Barker and J.G. Ballard.",
