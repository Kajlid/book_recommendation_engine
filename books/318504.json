  "description": "Isaac Crawley has just returned home from London and is obsessed with the Jekyll and Hyde play, which has opened at Macaulay's Theater in Louisville, Kentucky. On the fourth night of the show, a body is found on the riverbank, butchered like Jack the Ripper's first victim, and the police think Isaac may be the Ripper himself. As more bodies are found, eerily linked to the Ripper, evidence points toward Isaac and the lead investigator is determined to prove his guilt. Isaac's former alienist, Dr. Blackwood, steps in, locking him away in the Lakeland Asylum in a desperate effort to keep him safe. When Dr. Blackwood discovers something lurking in Isaac's mind, he know he needs to be destroy it to save Isaac, but it also holds the key to finding the real killer.\"James Markert's THE STRANGE CASE OF ISAAC CRAWLEY is a vividly detailed and richly researched historical thriller that grabbed me the same way Caleb Carr's THE ALIENIST did. It brings a forgotten time and forgotten incidents to three-dimensional life and had me turning pages late into the night. Don't miss this smashing tale!\"-David Bell, Bestselling Author of KILL ALL YOUR DARLINGS",
