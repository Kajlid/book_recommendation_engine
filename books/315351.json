  "description": "What is birthed from a dead, despised, or abandoned culture? What leads to the death of tradition in a society? These are the questions The Embers of Tradition explores with a wide-sweeping look at the effects of colonization on the culture of the Igbo of South-Eastern Nigeria through the events that transpired in one family. Through Nweke, a respected, hot-tempered, and stubborn man, his relationship with his Ikenga, his family, his best friend, and his town, we see the many far-reaching consequences, some good, others devastating, of what rose from the embers of an interrupted cultural system.The Embers of Tradition illuminates the beauty and gore of foundational Igbo culture, and the changes through the ages, leaving one with a faint nostalgia for an uncolonized evolution. To remain relevant in a changing world, will Nweke do the unthinkable?",
