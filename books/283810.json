  "description": "Franz Kafka, Martha Graham, Michelangelo s David, Marian Anderson, and Bertrand Russell all play a role in this novella. Einstein s Rabbi: A Tale of Science and the Soul tells the story of a young man s search for transcendant meaning in his life. His guide is Rabbi Asher Ternfka, Einstein s rabbi. In a series of wonderfully crafted conversations, all based on actual quotations of Albert Einstein, the rabbi shares his experiences with Einstein s life and thoughts, and those glowing dialogues become a mirror for Joseph s own spiritual journey. The book is rich with insight on the human condition and a compelling model for all spiritual searchers no matter what their religious orientation.",
