New York Times bestselling author Beth Kery's blistering new novel of a man and woman bound by the scandalous secrets of the past--and by the sexual hunger that still fuels their uncontrollable desires...Restaurateur and self-exiled heir Lucien Lenault's first look at the breathtaking young chef trainee for his trendy Chicago restaurant is a shock. She's Elise Martin, daughter of a wealthy French fashion designer. She's also the holder of a secret that could explode his carefully laid plans.Notorious for her flagrant exhibitionism, and for flouting the respectable fa√ßade of her aristocratic background, the coquine's wild streak shocked most people. Not Lucien. He was tempted by it. It was a deliriously punishable offense as far as Lucien was concerned. But taking on Elise is more than a game. She's a catastrophe waiting to happen, an inferno that's burned many a lover. Lucien isn't most men, however, and he won't allow her to manipulate him. In order to control the defiant beauty--in order to see her submit--he's going to have to willingly walk in the flames...More to come.
