Arrietty isn’t your ordinary fourteen-year-old girl—she small enough to make her home under the floorboards of a typical house, “borrowing” what she and her family needs from the giants in whose shadows they live. A young boy named Sho befriends Arrietty, but when adults discover the Borrowers, Arrittey and Sho must work together to save her family. Based on the classic novel by Mary Norton, The Borrower Arrietty is a delight for all ages.",
