  "title": "Meeting of Two Seas: Where the heart leads the mind",
  "description": "“Eye-opening in terms of the parity between the Abrahamic faiths, this fine model of scriptural analysis merits study by mystics of any faith.” Kirkus Reviews This book is a follow-up to A perspective on the Signs of Through the Prism of the Heart. Here the heart leads the mind on a journey into the eighteenth chapter of the Holy Quran. This chapter, known as Surah Kahf, has captivated seekers across the ages for its living spiritual appeal. Meeting of two Seas is about a journey which Moses undertakes with Khidr. Though this journey is short, it continues to open doors to others, through our awakening to the meetings of many sets of two seas around The meeting of the manifested real and the hidden Real; the meeting of the temporal and the eternal; the meeting of the empirical with the spiritual; and the meeting of physical causes with the Spiritual Cause. Our consciousness too stands at the nexus of the seas of our very own inner and outer selves. When the heart and the mind come to a meld—the coming together of taddabur and taffakur—there is no turning back and no end to the joyous journey toward the shores and sea of the Arabic Quran. The i’jaz of the Quran is its unfathomable ability to lead us to a scent of the REAL and toward a sense of belonging to IT.",
