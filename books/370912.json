  "description": "A very hip, intelligent thriller set in London in the interweaving worlds of t.v., fashion, acting and the restaurant business. The narrator, Conrad, is telephoned by his ex-girlfriend Lily (a model/ actress), by whom he has been dumped six weeks before. He jumps at the chance to have dinner with her, after her original date has cancelled. As they sit talking at the restaurant, a bicycle courier enters, pulls out a very large gun, and shoots Lily dead. He then fires three shots at Conrad, leaving him for dead too. Six months later, Conrad leaves hospital. But the police won't tell him anything.",
