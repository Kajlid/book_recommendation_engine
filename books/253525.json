  "description": "HE WANTS AN HEIR. SHE BADLY NEEDS A HERO.  A standalone modern-day fairy tale Billionaire Jeffery Vandercourt wants an heir minus the emotional entanglements of a relationship, so he's getting it via in vitro fertilization. He already has an egg donor. He's looking for a suitable surrogate. He'll pay her a huge amount of money to carry his baby to full term. After she gives birth, he gets the child, she walks away with the money, and that would be the end of their association. That's the plan. It's a day's trip to the fertility clinic. Then he meets the applicant, and the trip to the clinic goes out of the window. Forget IVF. Why not get his money's worth while making his fondest wish come true? Mara Cortez is desperate. She's tired of being scared and hiding from the authorities. But she's even more terrified of being deported back to her country where peril awaits. An offer comes her way that could potentially solve her predicament. She bites the bullet. _____________________________________________________ NOTE: This is a stand-alone novel with a classic Cinderella plot, but with a new spin. Set in a glossy backdrop, this modern-day fairy tale is sugary-sweet, eye-rolling cheesy and unapologetically smutty in the most purple way. That's how this author wants it. There's definitely an HEA, and a lot of baby-making. If that floats your boat, welcome aboard!",
