  "title": "The Cask of Amontillado",
  "description": "\"The Cask of Amontillado\" (sometimes spelled \"The Casque ..\") is a short story written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in the November 1846 issue of \"Godey's Lady's Book.\" It is set in a nameless Italian city in an unspecified year (possibly during the eighteenth century) and concerns the revenge taken by the narrator on a friend who he claims has insulted him. Like several of Poe's stories, and in keeping with the 19th-century fascination with the subject, the narrative revolves around the possibility of a person being buried alive or enclosed in a small space with not possibility of escape (aka immurement).Librarian's note: this entry relates to the story \"The Cask of Amontillado.\" Collections of short stories by the author can be found elsewhere on Goodreads.",
