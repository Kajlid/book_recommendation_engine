  "description": "The Royal Enforcers protect the land of Saxony from pirates, vampires and the like. Their strict code of loyalty to the Crown includes executing any Night Children found within the empire. Lord Jarvis, a Royal Enforcer driven by justice, is grateful to the Crown and the Church for saving his life as a child. However, his years of service to both have left him with more blood on his hands than peace in his mind.Telos, a young feline shape shifter, is tossed on a Saxony beach by a warlock. As he hides in the cobblestone streets of the capital, he fears for his life, being what he is – a Night Child, a creature not entirely human. Discovered by Lord Jarvis, Telos is given a choice – a death to end his miserable existence or begging for mercy from a man known as a mass executioner.Faced with both Telos’s innocence of spirit and the Queen’s brutal command, Lord Jarvis must fight with more than his sword to maintain a remnant of his soul.",
