  "title": "Surgeon at War",
  "description": "The tremendous emphasis on saving the lives of the wounded in the second world war made the surgeon's life as dangerous as that of the front line soldier. Mobile operating theatres went close to the front line and surgeons took part in the glider-borne landings in Normandy. At one time in Normandy Colonel Watts was carrying out major operations within 400 yards of where the men were being wounded.Colonel Watts is the first British doctor to describe his work as an Army surgical specialist. His range of experience is enormous and he recalls his adventures in the Palestine Rebellion of 1938, Wavell's first desert campaign, the Syrian Campaign and the first advance into Tunisa. After the Salerno landing and his unique employment of skis in the Apennines, the author joined the 6th Airborne Division and took part in the Normandy Landings, the battle of the bulge against von Rundstedt and the Rhine crossing. Malaya, Java, Palestine and finally Korea complete an impressive and probably unrivaled list of frontline engangements.",
