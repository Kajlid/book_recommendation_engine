  "description": "Theodora Rudan woke severely injured, covered in blood, and missing ten years of her life. Just to complicate matters further, she was born under a prophecy, one that has rabid followers with three different interpretations, all of whom are willing to sacrifice her in order to fulfill it. Not knowing if she can trust the stranger she’s betrothed to, the warrior visiting her dreams, or even her own mother, Theo tries to piece together her past only to find that her present is far more dangerous. It’s the power of her own blood that scares her most of all. This is a responsibility Theo never wanted, and a destiny she cannot deny. ___________________ Spirit Binder is a stand alone fantasy novel set a thousand years after spirit (aka magic) rises to take back the world in an apocalyptic event. The young-adult novel Time Walker is set in the same universe, ten years after the events of Spirit Binder.",
