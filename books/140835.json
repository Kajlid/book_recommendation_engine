  "description": "When Garner Holt, a small-town attorney badly in need of an assistant to sort out his cluttered office, tries to hire a secretary from a résumé he receives in the mail, he doesn’t expect a super-secretary like Miss Angelina Brownwood, who has just moved to Arkansas from California. But she clearly understands computer technology and has no problem with applying a little elbow grease to marshal his dusty den of an office into order. He wonders what her real agenda is—especially when he suspects that she has never been a secretary before in her life.Still, he finds himself enchanted by her joyful approach to life and sets himself to get rid of the dark circles beneath her eyes by showing her how to jog and eat a healthy diet. He takes her to a party where he discovers she has a knack for making friends and hauls her home when she manages to drink too much. He decides to do an online search and discovers he is right: Angie Brownwood has never been a secretary. In fact, Garner is stunned to learn that she taught herself secretarial work from books. She had been a high-powered software executive until her father, who owned the company, went berserk and fired her. To his further amazement, he realizes she considers herself liberated from a life of drudgery and that she loves being a secretary. Powerfully attracted to her outlook, he wants to make her his, but her father needs help, and Angie is not going to welcome his interference in the wonderful new life she has built for herself.",
