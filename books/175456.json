  "title": "True Heroes: A Treasury of Modern-day Fairy Tales Written by Best-Selling Authors",
  "description": "This one-of-a-kind treasury brings together the talents of nearly two dozen bestselling middle-grade authors including Shannon Hale, Brandon Mull, Ally Condie and Jennifer A. Nielsen — who have created original short stories, modern-day fairy tales, based on the lives and dreams of children they have met who all have two things in common: they have very big hopes and dreams and they are all cancer patients. Each short story is prefaced by a brief introductory bio of the child and is accompanied by photographs of the child, fully costumed and digitally inserted into a background — a baker, a dancer, a superhero, a dragon fighter, a sports star, a princess and more — that makes them the hero of their own modern day fairy tale story written by one of their favorite authors.",
