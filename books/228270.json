  "description": "Were the two little princes in the Tower really murdered? Or was one of them alive and prepared to claim the coveted throne of England by both right and and overwhelming force of arms?These questions and their answers provide the drama in this powerful tale of one of the most controversial periods in England's history. The time is in the reign of the first Tudor King, Henry VII, whose personal status and the realm's security are both threatened by an ominous echo from the recent past in the person of Perkin Warbeck, who claimed to be the son of Edward the IV and the nephew of Richard the III.",
