  "description": "The third in the Meg Daniels Mystery series. Meg Daniels never had the displeasure of meeting Dallas Spencer, but when the body of the prosperous Brit washes up on Long Beach Island with a bullet in the back, it immediately derails her romantic vacation plans with P.I. Andy Beck. As Meg sets out to clear Andy (and protect him from the seductive widow) she soon learns that Dallas Spencer had more skeletons than his Loveladies mansion has closets. The ensuing adventure takes more twists and turns than a boardwalk roller coaster, and involves Meg with an unforgettable cast of characters.",
