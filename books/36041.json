  "description": "When lovelorn Lydia Swain prays to the angel she knows is up there, she isn't convinced that he will answer. The angel, Ebol, isn't sure either, being a bit lazy and something of a sleepyhead. But when he's persuaded--by an angelic kick in the rear end--he finds himself involved not only in a love story, but in a political brouhaha the likes of which the land of Korasan has never before seen. And once Lydia and Ebol join forces, nothing will ever be the same--not for Lydia, not for the handsome Aldersan Hale, not for the citizens of Korasan, and not even for Ebol himself.",
