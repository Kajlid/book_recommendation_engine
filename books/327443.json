  "description": "The Spanish Civil War is a major conflict often overlooked due to the other events that were occurring during the tumultuous decade of the 1930s. Europe was going through a transition period bridging World War I and World War II. There was the rise of Adolf Hitler in Germany, the exploits of Benito Mussolini in Italy, and the difficulties of the spread of Communism as a response to impending dictatorships. Spain was struggling not only with the recognition of its complex past with the Conquests in the Americas but also with the establishment of a new identity in the twentieth century.“On the Precipice of the Labyrinth” is the story of a young American, William Bennett, who has learned the Spanish language in his hometown of Charlottesville and had exposure to what is happening in Europe due to his father’s position as a professor at the University of Virginia. Bennet has learned enough that he is highly compelled to visit Spain and find out for himself what the situation is.Bennett sets out of his sojourn completely alone. He crosses the Atlantic working on a cargo ship, arrives in northern France, and manages to travel to the Spanish border doing odd jobs and hitchhiking. When he arrives in Spain he has a series of encounters with some people who provide some insights, and eventually establishes relationships with the other three key individuals in the novel. Bennett unwittingly becomes involved in a precarious journey that exposes him to the political, cultural and religious difficulties in Spain and that has life-altering consequences for all four.",
