  "title": "Saving Molly",
  "description": "When T found her on the side of the road, the last thing on his mind was love. As Sergeant at Arms of The Lost Brothers MC, it is his job to protect his brothers as well as those of the community outside the club too. Being a guardian is his nature and he’ll help someone who is in trouble without a second thought. Therefore, when he sees something fall on the highway there’s no doubt in his mind about stopping and checking it out. T isn’t one to believe in love but when she opens her big brown eyes, his world shifts and won’t be the same again.   Life has not been easy for Molly. When she was little, she got sick and never got better. She knew her life wasn’t like everyone else’s; after all, she dressed differently, didn’t go to school, and was still under her parent’s thumb at the age of 24. But on the side of a road in the cold of night, scared and alone for the first time, her whole life changes. Molly is no stranger to passing out, waking up in a room full of men, however, is a different situation all together. Looking around, she can’t help but be scared until her gaze meets the deep blue eyes above her. From that moment, she knew that, no matter what happened next, she would be okay.  The night T and Molly met; they were in very different places. One thought he’d lost the ability to love while the other never thought she would get the chance. Together can they prove themselves wrong? Can Molly escape from her protected world? Can T let go of the past and take down his walls? Due to strong language and sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
