  "description": "Both volumes now now combined into Volume 1, The Early Church to the Dawn of the Reformation and Volume 2, The Reformation to the Present Day. In Volume 1 \"Gonzalez skillfully weaves in relevant details from the lives of prominent figures from the Apostles to John Wycliffe, tracing out core theological issues and developments as reflected in the lives and struggles of leading thinkers within the various traditions of the church. The Story of Christianity demonstrates at each point what new challenges and opportunities faced the church and how Christians struggled with the various options open to them, thereby shaping the future direction of the church\".... In Volume 2 \"The interpretive overview of The Story of Christianity includes a thorough and timely analysis of the growth and maturation of Christianity, including events in Europe, the United States, and Latin America - the latter an area too often neglected in church histories, yet increasingly vital to an understanding of Christianity's historical development, present situation, and future options\" .
