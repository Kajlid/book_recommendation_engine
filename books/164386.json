But it's cheap, and there's no lease â€“ which is perfect for a student who's been kicked out by his ex-girlfriend.Well, nearly perfect.There's a mannequin hidden behind some old boxes that gives him the creeps. Sometimes it throws its dust cloth off. Sometimes he feels it watching him when his back is turned. And sometimes it moves while he's asleep...The Mannequin is a chilling half-hour story, perfect for a quick read late at night.",
