Dickson on the map adds a brand new cover and more than twice the words, vividly detailing the life and struggle of one of her most memorable characters, a timeworn veteran who thought he'd lived through the worst life could throw at him, until the dust came.Following a doomed Lunar mission, a terrifying substance has set upon the earth, consuming everything it touches and leaving behind drifts of colorless death. No life form stands a chance, but Clyde Jackson is tougher than most. He's seen war, and he's lost everyone he ever loved, but now he's living through the end of the world one day at a time, in a panic room that cost him nearly everything to build. It's only a matter of time before the ventilation fails, and it'll only take a single gray speck to bring about his demise. Read his chilling memoir, and look to the skies with caution.Originally featured in The Absent Willow Review e-zine, DUST is the haunting meditation of a man recalling the final days of a once mighty and hopeful planet now quickly eroding to nothing under drifts of gray.The original version of this story is still available along with eight others in Allison's collection, AT THE END OF THINGS.",
