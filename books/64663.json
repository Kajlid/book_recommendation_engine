Walter is instantly drawn to Barry and, despite the considerable risks, installs him in the Samson's three-storey house on the Upper East Side, where the two men try to keep their amorous relationship secret.Against a backdrop of McCarthy-era paranoia with its doleful consequences and society's pervasive homophobia, Walter manages to alter the direction and course of his life, losing much, gaining more.",
