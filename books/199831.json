  "description": "Rain Wilson thought she knew where she came from. A small farming town, forgotten and missed by everyone. After learning that her estranged mother is missing, she embarks on a daring journey to find her. Unfortunately, she uncovers a trail of lies and deceit that makes her wonder...how far will she really go to save her mother? Before long, Rain realizes that even motherly love has its limits when America is at stake.\"Plenty of action ensues, and Rain transforms into a “blonde bombshell” who fills out a sequined dress nicely, becomes well-versed in espionage and torture, and learns that she can trust no one. The plot is exaggerated, yet fun in a Scandal sort of way.\" - Kirkus Reviews\"A page-turning action and adventure novel with heart. Fans of high-octane action novels will enjoy the twists and turns of Girl Soldier. While there are plenty of heart-pumping scenes to keep diehard fans of thrillers engaged in the story, this is also a heartfelt novel. Rain isn’t unlike many teens, even if she has an unusual life. It’s her humanness that makes her a memorable character and transforms this novel into more than a spy thriller.\" Self-Publishing Review, 4½ Stars\"Tension, action and suspense spill out of these pages – a story that would translate to film well.\" Grady Harp, Top 100 Amazon Reviewer \"... a mystery suspense novel that takes you in from the beginning, the way it is written makes you want to keep reading until the end.\" - Amazon Reviewer",
