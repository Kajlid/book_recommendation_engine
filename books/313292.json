  "description": "Kristy's mom got remarried and their family moved to the ritzy neighborhood across town. The other members of The Baby-sitters Club think it's a good opportunity to get some new business, but the kids who live nearby aren't very friendly. They criticize Kristy's clothes and make fun of the BSC. And, worst of all, they laugh at Louie, Kristy's pet collie, who's getting old and not feeling well. These kids are total snobs! But if anyone can put them in their place, it's The Baby-sitters Club!",
