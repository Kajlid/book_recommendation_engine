  "description": "Freekin just wants to fit in and have a normal life. The good news is that he’s in love with class beauty queen, Lilly. The bad news? He’s dead. Not that Freekin’s going to let a little thing like mortality get in his way. As a matter of fact, he’s going to gather up his courage and ask Lilly out. Now if he can only stop his ears from falling off whenever she’s around (it’s the decay talking), then maybe he’ll be able to hear when she answers him.",
