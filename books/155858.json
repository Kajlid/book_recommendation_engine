  "description": "All literary enthusiasts will enjoy these poems -- many with deep philosophical messages. Middle school and high school students will enjoy the chronological journey of going through the young mind of someone their own age growing up in a different culture, writing poetry to master the English language -- while earning some pocket money at the same time. Teachers will enjoy sharing several poems from this book with their students. This is a preserved collection from 1968-1975 - the author's writings from 7th grade to just after high school - before entering college - and before coming to the United States. The historical or other context of some poems are provided as appropriate. The poems written during and after 1972 helped the author win Best Poet of the Year awards from a local newspaper in Dhaka, Bangladesh in 1973 and 1974. Some are poems, some songs, some just thoughts with a rhythmic pattern. Here is a segment written in 1974: Evening crept into the dayAnd mother’s eyes were wet.I saw her move her lips and say,“Isn’t it beautiful, to see the sun set?”Away from her, I turned my eyesAnd looked at the eastern sky,“Isn’t it better, to see it rise?”I said, and I heard her cry. -M. Hasib, Muses and Rhymes (2014), p. 103.",
