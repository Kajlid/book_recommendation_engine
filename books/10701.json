  "description": "The hardheaded Armstrong brothers are determined to rebuild their tornado-ravaged hometown in the Georgia mountains. They've got the means, they've got the manpower...what they need are women! So they place an ad in a Northern newspaper and wait for the ladies to arrive...Eldest brother Marcus Armstrong considers the estrogen-influx an irritating distraction. He's running a town, not a dating service!Reporter Alicia Randall thinks the Armstrong brothers are running a scam and she intends to prove it--even if it means seducing oh-so-sexy Marcus in the process. Sizzling sex and a hot story? Win-win!At least it is, until she falls for the guy. Will love trump betrayal when the truth comes out?",
