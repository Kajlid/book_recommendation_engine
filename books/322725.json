  "description": "Bro big or bro home.\nRobbieAs social chair of Sigma Beta Psi, I’m the life of the party. It’s what I’m known for, and if it’s not fun, I’m not interested, simple as that.I’m not someone who overthinks.So when one of my brothers hooks up with a dude from another frat house, it catches me off guard when I can’t stop thinking about them … together.There’s only one way for me to get this obsession out of my head and that’s by jumping in with both feet and putting it into practice.The problem is, the one guy who’s up for the ride, is the last one I’d expect.BrandonBeing risk manager of a frat house is nobody’s idea of a good time. My brothers get annoyed when I put a damper on their plans, and wrangling drunken frat brothers isn’t how I pictured my Saturday nights of senior year.I’m bored.In a rut.Study, frat duties, planning for the future.When is it my turn to let loose for a moment?So when my dumb-as-bricks frat bro is scoping out the house for a little experimenting fun, I throw out the offer like it isn’t the most nerve-wracking thing I’ve ever considered.I never imagined I’d actually enjoy it.",
