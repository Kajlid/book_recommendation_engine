  "title": "Noelle In His Heart",
  "description": "A Christmas romance with a Sci-Fi twist! Noelle has made the same wish for the past six years to the angel on top of Father Nathan's Christmas Tree. All she wants for Christmas is someone with warm arms to hold her and who can understand that she has commitments - commitments which include the twenty-six children at the foster center she volunteers for. Stranded on Earth six years ago, Steve and his crewmates have done a pretty good job of secretly finding a place in human society, but it doesn't erase the loneliness that hits hardest around the holidays. He longs for companionship and someone who will understand that his alien heart can love just as deeply.",
