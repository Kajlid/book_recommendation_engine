  "description": "Saving him was her first mistake…  Be a good angel, Amiah. Be patient, Amiah. Someone’s out there who’ll awaken and complete your soul bond. It’ll be beautiful. It’ll be… The worst possible thing that could happen.  Because a soul bond is no fairy tale, it’s a prison. Torture, should I wind up bonded to a complete stranger. Or worse, driven insane over a lost soul mate. It’s a ticking time bomb and I’ll do anything to get rid of it.  But before I can figure out how or if that’s even possible, Titus, the last dragon shifter, falls out of the sky and my healing magic accidentally leashes us together. If we’re separated, we both die.  Now we — along with Cassius, my best friend and a top JP agent, and Sebastian, a fae sorcerer who just won’t stop hitting on me even though I know he doesn’t really mean it — are being hunted by men who want to possess Titus’s unique dragon power. And if they can’t have him, they won’t hesitate to kill him… and take me down with him.  Fated Bonds is the first book in the Angel’s Fate series, an action-packed full-length paranormal romance with powerful sexy men and a heroine who doesn’t have to choose.  ** Angel’s Fate is a spinoff series from the Nephilim’s Destiny series. It’s not necessary to read the first series to enjoy this one.",
