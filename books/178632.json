  "description": "Murder most foul comes to the small town of Perry Hollow, Pa., in DEATH NOTICE, the debut thriller from Todd Ritter, hailed by bestselling author Lisa Unger as a “fresh new voice in fiction.”  On a frigid March morning, Perry Hollow Police Chief Kat Campbell finds the corpse of a local farmer in a homemade coffin on the side of the road. A gash on his neck has been sewn shut. So have his lips. Making matters even worse — the killer sent warning of the crime to Henry Goll, the reclusive obituary writer for the local newspaper.  Teaming up with State Police investigator Nick Donnelly, Kat and Henry find themselves racing to stop a serial killer before he can strike again. It’s a task that threatens their towns, their families and their very lives.  A blend of nail-biting suspense, heart-stopping action and instantly intriguing characters, Death Notice is a taut thriller that’s sure to be devoured by fans of Tess Gerritsen’s Rizzoli & Isles and Karin Slaughter’s Sarah Linton.",
