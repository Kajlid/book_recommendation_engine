  "description": "Take a journey into the strange and magical land known as the Mea Culpa Valley; an area with a long and proud history of profound weirdness and absolutely insanity. The residents of a small chunk of squalor known as Timbrook are visited by a precocious knight on a quest, and inadvertently become swept up in a hysterical adventure like none ever before witnessed. Magic, mystery, mayhem and intrigue abound as a powerful warlordâ€™s plot to take over the entire region is slowly uncovered, also revealing the ancient secrets of a powerful stone that may or may not actually be a piece of petrified dragon excrement. Full of laughs, adventure, intrigue, romance and hilarious characters, the Porridge King is a laugh-out loud good time!",
