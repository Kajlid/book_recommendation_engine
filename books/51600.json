  "description": "Louis certainly isn't perfect. He leaves his dirty towels on the floor. He doesn't wash dishes. But mostly he shuts Avery out, refusing to let his lover in to his most private thoughts. Avery wants a designer house, a sensitive man, and lots of open communication. Louis is just a rough working man with a good heart but gruff ways. So is it really any surprise that Avery leaves him to look for his perfect lover? Both Avery and Louis move on, getting their lives back together slow but sure. Avery finds the refined, educated man he always thought he needed, and Louis starts dating a sweet, slob of a college kid. Both of them go back to school, intent on moving on, and on bettering themselves. They're dealing with their friends, their families, and learning that the qualities they thought they really wanted in a lover might not be so great after all. Perfect is the tale of how these two hot headed, stubborn men come back together, learning to work at what they have. They start to see their differences as a strength, finally realizing that love doesn't have to be perfect to be good.",
