  "description": "Requiem. A forbidden word. The name of a kingdom lost to history. Of magic forgotten. Of a homeland for dragons. They say that years ago, Requiem was real. That men and women could grow wings, breathe fire, and fly as noble dragons. That marble halls rose in a birch forest. That Requiem was a kingdom of magic and light. But those days are long gone. Now the Cured Temple, a fanatical cult, rules a land called the Commonwealth. Now paladins patrol the realm, \"curing\" all newborn babes of \"reptilian magic.\" Now the marble halls are fallen, the old books burnt, the ancient songs lost. Now Requiem is all but forgotten. But there are some who remember. A baker's boy. A librarian safeguarding a forbidden book. A haunted soldier. An outcast warrior. They carry the magic inside them, a torch of dragonfire. They remember Requiem . . . and they will fight to see dragons fly again.",
