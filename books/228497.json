  "description": "After his time as a double agent, Cyrus is bored with his easy life in Kuragalu (in modern Iraq). He returns to Babylon to find his old friend Balik, who has fallen on hard times. They decide to head to Elam (in Southwest Iran) and take up their old profession of merchant/spies. They find more adventure than they bargained for during their trip. Both of them are sold into slavery. Cyrus frees himself, and with Balik is soon in command of a band of ex-slaves. After proving their worth in a battle against bandits, they are hired to transport the sister of a powerful General to her home further east. Arya has her own carriage and does not mix with the men. Cyrus soon finds out that the General stands to inherit a large amount of money if Arya dies. They will face extreme risk as they travel across the mountains. The situation becomes more serious when the caravan is caught up in a battle between the Prince of Lahore (in modern Pakistan) and the King of Cabol (in modern Afghanistan). Arya offers to become Cyrusâ€™s wife, thus giving him wealth, status, and security. However, Cyrus is determined to stop the siege of Cabul and the massive loss of life that will follow. Is it possible to bring the war to an end without paying the ultimate price?",
