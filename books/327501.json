  "description": "I have a reputation for being tight-lipped. You learn quick when you become a professional hockey player to be guarded with the media, so I’ve worked hard to cover up the mistakes of my youth.But when I’m traded to the Florida Fury, where my ex–best friend is the starting right wing, I’m forced to confront my past. Ford and I have a lot of history, especially when it comes to his little sister, Imogen.My heart still lurches in my chest when I see her.My hands want to reach out and touch her.My mouth wants to keep apologizing.She’s the only woman who ever made me want more. But she’s also the one who fell victim to my most regrettable decision.I’m not a believer in fate, but I must be back in her world for a reason. I’ve fought for everything I’ve gotten and I’m not backing down from what I know will be the best thing in my life.",
