  "title": "White Ivory",
  "description": "Africa, 1924. A place and time when slavery still existed; illegal and risky perhaps, but more than a few rich landowners kept female sex slaves, and regular slave markets still traded on the shores of the Gulf of Aden.Piet Van Gryf was one of those landowners, training and keeping a stable of slaves for his amusement, and for him Caroline Milton was “White Ivory”, a rare commodity indeed – the young English widow of a missionary who had finally succumbed to drink and fever. Rarer still, Mrs Milton had asked to be his slave, to be used and abused, held prisoner in restraints, and kept as his plaything.",
