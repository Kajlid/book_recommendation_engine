  "description": "Family is everything to Brielle, so when she learns about an opportunity to free her mother from Demon City, she takes it. No matter how dangerous, Brielle will do anything to unite her family in Angel City. All is going according to plan, until her brother's awakening ceremony. What he isâ€¦ it shocks everyone, and he's sent away until he can get his powers under control. Then Brielle loses someone precious to her and goes to great lengths to get them back, lengths Lincoln doesn't agree with. He thinks Brielle is too much of a risk taker, too wild, and all he can do is try his best to protect her. But with untold powers rising inside of her, Brielle might go to a place that no one can bring her back from. Not even Lincoln. Brielle needs to learn to fight the darkness that threatens to take her over, because little by little, she's losing her light.",
