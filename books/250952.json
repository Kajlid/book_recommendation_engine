  "description": "Loki is both loved and hated by various followers of the Northern Traditions. Despite his unpopularity with some heathens, the number of his worshipers grows every year. This collection of twenty-seven poems, written by a dedicated Lokiâ€™s-woman, portrays some common and uncommon aspects of his character, his relationships to other deities, and how a relationship with this most misunderstood Norse god may be as deeply fulfilling and meaningful as it may sometimes be nerve-wracking.",
