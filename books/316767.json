  "description": "“Your love for her is dangerous and unnatural.” I grin. “I’m dangerous and unnatural.” Bronson: Olive skin. Amber eyes. She has been mine since we were fourteen.She was my beautiful distraction from the chaos I was born into.From the disturbances in my own mind. From my legacy. So when everything we created together is ripped away, I burn the idea of a peaceful life. Widening my arms to my inevitable fate, I accept my duties.Without her, I embrace a single purpose. To protect my brothers. To protect my family. Shoshanna: Green-blue eyes. A dimpled grin. The world was a mere playground to my nutcase, Bronson Butcher. But I destroyed him. So he walked away from me, dragging behind him one half of my severed heart.Eleven years later, the crazy son of a bitch appears, bleeding out on my hospital table. A bullet wound. Of course. We have both changed so much. Bronson now lives by a deranged and bloody moral code. And he takes whatever he wants. . . Whomever he wants. Her Way is book three in the Kids of The District Series. It is best that you read The Duet - Our thing & Cosa Nostra before this book. Her Way has a HEA. And it features a possessive and dirty-talking hero who may be a little crazy, as well as a fiery and determined heroine. Both main characters are possessive, jealous, and fight for each other. It is a love story first. Word steam second. Violence, gore, and drama, third. Enjoy.",
