More than eight million people are dead or worse...infected.After their failed attempt to stop the spread of a virus that turns people into zombie-like, human-vampire hybrids, Reed Hennessy and his ragtag crew are scrambling to stay alive. To make matters worse, the human authorities are close to proving the existence of vampires and blaming them for the disaster in New York.Their storm of trouble is already spinning out of control when an old enemy reappears to issue a challenge—an ultimatum that will mean certain death for at least one member of Reed’s group.
