  "description": "“It is time, Father, that you stop the games and finally tell us what your decision is regarding your will and who gets what. I mean, let’s cut the polite garbage, we know you aren’t happy to see us here, and we are only here for one reason.” After billionaire Henry Woodruff loses several family members in a horrible accident, his grandchildren Rebecca, Noah, and Amber McNeil are now the official heirs. Although they never desired to be put into his will, Henry has every reason to believe that the tragic plane crash was not just an unfortunate accident but a planned murder. Feeling that his children were somehow involved, he has to develop a plan before his grandchildren get murdered. When Rebecca nearly dies after a vicious attack, Henry hires two Mounties to keep an eye on her and her siblings. As if the everyday fight against someone wanting to murder her isn’t enough, Rebecca battles her past demons. Not wanting to get hurt again, she fights the growing feelings towards one of her protectors and puts up a wall to guard her heart. Will she be able to let go of the past and find her happily ever after?",
