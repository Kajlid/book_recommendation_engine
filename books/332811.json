  "description": "He’s devious. Corrupted. And his brutal heart wants me.  Lazzaro Rosetti just locked eyes with fresh prey: the virginal, high-school girl from a rival family. Me, Mia Bianchi.He’s screwed his way through half the city’s female population and he’s running wild—until his family finds a way to curb his behavior by forcing him to wed.When he speaks his vows at the altar, he’s holding Mom’s hands, but his menacing green eyes are staring right at me.From the moment he crosses our threshold, Lazzaro makes my life hell. I’m Mom’s unprotected and despised youngest daughter and Lazzaro inhales my vulnerability like it’s the finest perfume.Someone’s going to pay dearly for his bachelor wings being clipped, and I’m his perfect victim.Author’s note: Brutal Intentions is a standalone MF romance with forbidden themes, breeding, an age gap, a possessive alphahole and a virgin. Laz is married, and not to the heroine. All characters are over eighteen. The story is dirty and delicious, so please read at your discretion.",
