  "description": "Keep one hand on your money and the other on your sword! Wings of Omen (original anthology 6) moves the town of Sanctuary into an open guerilla conflict on the street. The city of Sanctuary, located on Thieves' World at the edge of the Rankan Empire, is a city of outlaws and adventurers in a world of war and wizardry... a place where many are downtrodden and where the invading Rankan gods and the Ilsigi gods they had ousted struggle for primacy.Editorial Clarification essay by editorsThieves' World (map) interior artwork by James Odbert [as by Jim Odbert]Introduction (1979) (Wings of Omen) / short fiction by Robert AsprinWhat Women Do Best (1984) [The Sacred Band of Stepsons] / novelette by Chris Morris and Janet MorrisDaughter of the Sun (1984) / novelette by Robin W.
