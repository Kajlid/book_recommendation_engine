  "description": "“I have a rule.”  Rebecca returns to England, thinking that would put her encounter with Andrew Costner firmly in the past. Stunned when he follows her to make things right between them, Rebecca is initially hostile.  But as they spend the day together she begins to realise he’s a very different man from the stranger she had a fling with. And maybe she’s different too.  Andrew has a rule that means Rebecca is out of bounds. The trouble is, forbidden fruit always tastes much sweeter and sometimes a woman just has to take control.  They were meant to part as friends but this goodbye is going to get messy.  Followed by a Stranger is the third part in the Billionaire Behaving Badly Series, intended for 18+ readers who like sexy, alpha, uber-rich men with dirty mouths and a penchant for naughty bedroom antics! You've been warned in the best possible way!  PART 4 releasing end May 15.",
