  "description": "You can't keep a good man down. Life is good for hot wide receiver Zane Tinsbury. He’s playing stellar football on the field and having his dream home built out in the country. Still, all is not perfect for this gorgeous man. He’s been feeling kind of lonely lately, and now he suspects a furry intruder may have taken up residence at his soon-to-be home. Little does Zane know he’s about to get the surprise of his life. Morgan Delano is a woman on the run from her dangerous ex-husband. Hiding out in a pro football player’s under-construction house seems like a pretty great idea. Until it’s not. What happens when these two finally meet, under hilarious circumstances, leaves them both stunned. Neither Zane nor Morgan could have ever expected so many sparks would fly. But there’s one big problem—Morgan’s ex is hot on her trail and not about to give up. Can Zane keep her safe? Or will their perilous time together run out? Down by Contact is the fourth novel in the bestselling Men of Fall football romance series and can be read as a standalone.",
