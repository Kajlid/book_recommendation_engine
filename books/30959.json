He’s a hugely successful talk radio host, well known throughout the country, but he still feels that there’s something missing from his life. In his quest for deeper meaning, he gets involved in the church. His wife is a devout Catholic and Candon yearns to understand what exactly drives her faith. While in this frame of mind, he interviews expert remote viewer Martin Daly.Daly is on the run from the company he used to work for for disclosing remote viewing and remote influencing (mind control) secrets in a book he has just published which teaches people how to protect themselves from mind control.Candon becomes fascinated with remote viewing, a mind technology which allows the viewer to visit any location in time and space and bring back useful information. Whilst dabbling, Candon finds himself face to face with God.God knows Candon’s mind entirely and offers him the opportunity to do God’s work on earth and thus find the deeper meaning he has been searching for. Candon’s ego leads him to accept God’s offer and he is instantly possessed by God.In the moment of the possession, he sees the mind of God. What he learns shocks him to his core, and together with Daly he attempts of regain control of his soul, prevent losing his mind and save the universe from a dire fate.",
