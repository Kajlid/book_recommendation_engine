  "description": "Can a high school crush turn into something long-lasting ten years later when our lives have taken us in totally different directions?Toby I’ve wanted to be the one to kiss Cassia Phillips since I was sixteen years old. Her chestnut hair and graphite-colored eyes, along with her pouty lips and sexy curves, have been the highlight on my fantasy reel. I was my own worst enemy back then. Too shy and socially inept to have the courage to go after the girl. Ten years later, I’m successful beyond my wildest dreams, my self-confidence is stronger than ever, and I won’t let anything get in the way of my second chance to have something with the woman of my dreams. Cassia From the age of sixteen, I’ve crushed hard on Toby Summer. His denim-colored eyes and sexy voice reach into the deepest part of my body. I was my own worst enemy back then. Making the wrong choices with the wrong guy time and again. Ten years later, I’m a single mom and proud owner of a successful florist shop. My faith in men is at an all-time low, and it’s going to take a lot of convincing to open my heart to any man, let alone to a man as famous as Toby Summer. This is the second book in The Summer Twins series. While this is a stand-alone title, we first met Toby in Loving Summer.
