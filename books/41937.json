  "description": "A run through the woods turned anything but typical when Levi found the one thing he never expected to find-his mate.After a week spent in family reunion hell, Levi Travis is more than ready for a little break. But who knew shifting into a snow leopard and loping around in the woods could turn into such a steamy event?When Levi encounters a cougar shifter in the woods, the attraction is so hot it threatens to shoot off sparks. Levi has fantasised about having a stronger man than him want him, and he’s sure the cougar is just such a man. Which is why Levi lets himself get caught, and the intensity of their mating is only equaled by Levi’s confusion when the man shifts back into a cougar then turns tail and runs.Lyndon Hines has been running for months. Hunted, taunted, he didn’t know what else to do-until he met a man who made him realise that some things were worth fighting for. Two shifters, each a different breed, neither knowing much about their heritage, Levi and Lyndon come together and find the strength to take on the mad man who is out to end Lyndon’s life.Reader Advisory: This book is part of a series but can be read as a stand alone.",
