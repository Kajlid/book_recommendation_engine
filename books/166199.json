  "description": "What do you do when you are a lone American in Arabia during the War On Terror and you fall in love with an Arab woman? In the second of a three book series describing his life in the Middle East after the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, the author finds he is alone again in the remote regions of Arabia. To make matters worse, the U.S. is gearing up for an invasion of Iraq to the north and everyone is looking at the author, the only American in the region, with even greater suspicion. In the middle of it all he finds himself involved in a surrealistic, clandestine relationship. But is it real, or is it just a dream? It's up to you to decide.",
