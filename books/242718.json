I hold a power that I neither understand nor can barely control...\" The battle for Maioria has begun. Issa faces a deadly enemy as the Immortal Lord's attention turns fully in her direction. The hunt is on for the Raven Queen and nothing will stand in Baelthrom's way, he must destroy this new power that grows with the rising dark moon... or assimilate it. Only by embracing the warrior Raven Queen can Issa hope to face the darkness that threatens to consume her. Hameka, a cunning, ruthless and brilliant commander, takes his savage fleet of undead to the tranquil shores of Celene. Cirosa, her plans thwarted, hungers for revenge. Issa's enemies are many, and few seek to join her cause as she struggles to survive against those that would enslave and kill her. But a new hope is rising and it lies in the soul of a long forgotten king. Will the Cursed King and his Banished Legion awaken to remember his past? Can he find his knights before it is too late?
