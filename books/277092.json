  "description": "The Return of King Lillian is a new hero's journey for dreamers of all ages.When Lillian, the one and only heir to the throne, is cast out of her kingdom by malevolent forces, she accidentally wanders into the Forest of Forgetfullness, where she is rescued by wolves and raised by an eccentric old wise woman. When she comes of age, she is called by Destiny to return home. The trouble is, when Lillian steps out of the Forest, she has no memory of who she is or from whence she hails. Undaunted, the spirited, self-reliant young woman sets off into the unknown, determined to discover her long lost self and to reclaim her stolen birthright.Early readers and listeners have compared the story to \nThe Princess Bride,\n\nThe Once and Future King,\n\nGulliver's Travels\n and \nThe Alchemist\n. Weaving in themes of destiny and happenstance, deep memories and forgotten lives, \nThe Return of King Lillian\n is rich with vivid world-building, comedy, calamity, and a host of unforgettable characters.\"So, O Wondering Wanderer,  whatever cosmic happenstance has brought you here, know this:  You are most welcome and have been quite eagerly expected.\"",
