  "description": "He wasn't what destiny had in store for me. He was everything wrong in a man I was supposed to fall in love with. He was dangerous.His eyes told me so. The words he tempted me with were simply sweet little lies to lure me in. And now...I’m trapped in his web of desire and temptation.She only had herself to blame. Taunting the beast with the forbidden fruit. A man can only be tempted for so long, until he takes a bite. Devours his prey. Now she’s my pretty little toy.And I will stop at nothing to break her. Unless… She breaks me first.",
