Little does Wishes know, Ronan has a cacophony of secrets of his own…One widowed single-father + One divorced single-father = dad jokes, adorableness, steamy times, and a boatload of baggage.Content warnings:1) Canadian spelling. We love to mix and match US and UK spelling with a smattering of French words.2) This book, while funny and endearing, discusses heavy topics such as mental health (on-page panic attacks), death, addictions (historical), abuse (historical with flashbacks), suicide (flashbacks), and homophobia (historical and on page).3) Swearing. This book is no stranger to the f-bomb.",
