  "description": "Devoted. Loyal. Shameless. The Boys of Clermont Bay had been my protectors for as long as I could remember.And Olly Warner took the job to heart.He was intense and all-consuming, and I had been in love with him for years.Alarmingly handsome and recklessly charming, he attempted to deny there was ever anything between us.But we slipped over that invisible line, and the moment we gave in, something fractured.He was leaving regardless, and I couldn’t hang on tight enough for the both of us.Olly had always been the boy I could never have, but I couldn’t help losing myself in him.A searing affair, the guarantee of a broken heart, and the desperation of careless promises.Olly and I were never meant to be, and we had become nothing more than a pretty lie.",
