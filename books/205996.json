  "title": "Injured Love: They Met in Vietnam",
  "description": "It is 2002, and Ann is living a lonely isolated existence especially since the hospital forced her out with early retirement. All that changes when Karen bursts into her apartment altering the course of her life and unintentionally reconnecting her with the past. Annâ€™s time spent in Vietnam is something she has struggled to forget and suppress. Tragedy, heartache and wartime scars have colored her life despite her best efforts to put it behind her. Karen was not born when Ann served as a nurse in Vietnam, her curiosity and ignorance about that time anger Ann and motivates her to begin to talk about it. Karen wants to help, and she begins to look online for anything to do with nurses in Vietnam. She cannot relate to what Ann has gone through, but hopes to find someone who can help. Finding very little she stumbles onto something she finds exciting and presents it to Ann. She is not interested at first, and annoyed that someone she just met is prying into her life. That pushy, naive neighbor unwittingly sets Ann on a journey she never believed possible. Love she had given up on finding long ago makes its way out of the past.",
