  "description": "Garett goes to the Other Shelf bookstore the same time every week. He loves the ladies who run the place, and he loves the atmosphere. He likes the scenery, too, when he meets Nathan, who's also a regular at the store, but one Garett has never met before. After a little matchmaking from the bookstore ladies, Garett and Nathan decide to give each other a try. Garett's a cop and Nathan's a cook, so they're not sure how much they have in common, but both of them are willing to give it a go. Will they find something as enduring as the books they both love?",
