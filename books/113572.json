While the narrative propels us through Srulik’s gripping true story, the black-and-white art reveals his journey through the imagination of a child caught in a land of giants.The story opens with Srulik Ackerman enjoying a peaceful childhood in the Polish town of Nowosiolki, until the Nazi whirlwind blows in leaving ten-year-old Srulik suddenly and brutally alone. An eyewitness to the horrors of the Holocaust, Srulik narrowly escapes death several times, only to make a final desperate bid for freedom during a fiery revolt in the ghetto. Margareta Ackerman was astonished when she learned that her grandfather, Srulik, was a Holocaust survivor. How had he overcome the past with his cheerful attitude and timeless smile intact? In Running from Giants, she retells his amazing story, with its profound message about the incredible strength of the human spirit.",
