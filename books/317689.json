  "description": "From Greenwich, Connecticut...to Seoul, South Korea...then Hanyang, Joseon. ... and hopefully back again. Gwen Choi doesn’t need much to be happy. She just wants a simple spring break in Seoul doing touristy things as a little distraction from the PSATs, carrying her entire debate team for the last two years, and her on-again, off-again relationship she left on silent. But between intrusive relatives and her so-called “boyfriend” embarrassing her from a continent away, Gwen needs an escape—a vacation from her vacation. But her impromptu detour lands her in the waters of Hanyang, Joseon, a far cry from Seoul and a much farther escape than she had originally planned.​But this court isn’t just dresses and princes. There are sinister plots afoot, and she has fallen right in the middle of them. Dueling political parties, assassination attempts, and unexpected romances are just the beginning. Will this journey help Gwen embrace her family story and culture, or will she end up stuck in Joseon forever?​For fans of Never Have I Ever and XOXO by Axie Oh comes a Korean American in Joseon Court, a YA contemporary novel set in Joseon but filled with K-drama tropes, an enemies-to-lovers love triangle, and time travel.",
