  "description": "The citizens of Fortune, WA are shocked when former town bad boy Jace Stone buys the small town. Everyone wonders how Jace can come back, especially after getting Fortune’s golden girl Glory Moon pregnant, then leaving her alone to raise their autistic son. No one is more shocked than Jace when he discovers that Glory kept the baby she’d promised to give up for adoption ten years ago. Seriously in debt, Glory and her son are one step away from food stamps and welfare. When Jace suggests a business arrangement--marry him and he’ll pay off her debts and get their son the finest medical care and private school money can buy, Glory has no choice but to accept his proposal. But Jace’s proposal comes with a price, and love is never simple—especially when the heart is involved.",
