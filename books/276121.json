  "description": "At 107 years old, Abe Titterman is ready for an adventure, and boy is he about to get one when the mythical Key to the Universe lands in his antique shop on the Martian moon of Phobos. Long a purveyor of antiques, alien artifacts and oddities from around the universe, Abe and his great-grandson, Quinn, know the Key is something very specialâ€”not to mention in-demand.Before long, Abe and Quinn are being chased by the Martian Mafia, the Solar Government and a rival antique dealer, all of whom would go to any lengths to get their hands on an artifact that can potentially unlock the very meaning of existence.From the desert world of a long-dead intergalactic philosopher to a techno planet whose atmosphere is composed entirely of satellites, Abe and Quinn are about to see more of the universe than they ever expected as they race to discover the secrets of the Key.They might even survive the trip.",
