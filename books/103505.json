  "description": "Cole Mouzon exists to the outside world as a successful lawyer, loyal son and brother – all unaware of his private turmoil and the mental wall that holds him together. But, during a visit back home to Charleston, he receives a call from the FBI that a stranger has been found poisoned and mutilated. What Cole learns next threatens to bring down the wall and expose him to the sharp emotions behind it when he is told that there is more to his childhood nightmares than just dark places. Betrayed by his memory, the clue to his past and his ultimate survival rests in a stranger, Cash Calhoun, a man he has never met but has been tied to his entire life. Together, they embark on a hunt to find the truth held in the dark shadows of Cole’s mind and the marshy landscape of the Holy City before a hunter from Cole’s past destroys their newly discovered bond and their lives. Steeped in southern drawl and suspense, THE TREES BEYOND THE GRASS, the first in the Cole Mouzon thriller series, is a riveting story about the amazing, but sometimes destructive, power of our minds to protect us from the evils of life, while undermining our ability to discover true happiness. Look for book two of the Cole Mouzon series, WHEN ASPENS QUAKE, coming Spring 2014.",
