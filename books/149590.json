Little did they know, their lives were about to change.The boys and their father find themselves stranded in the desert when a military jet comes careening out of the sky and crashes directly into their car. Barely escaping the incident with their lives, and out of contact with the rest of the world, the trio must make the perilous journey back to civilization.  But, downed aircrafts, stalled out cars, and mysterious glowing blue orbs litter the desert landscape. Slowly they come to realize that the world is under attack and the civilization they once knew may no longer exist. Now the boys and their father are in a fight to survive across a barren landscapeâ€”a fight that not all will win.",
