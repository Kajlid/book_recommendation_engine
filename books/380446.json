  "description": "“Secrets of the Kharon” is a library of dark shadows, where we have indulged our deepest fascinations and fears. In its corridors are hidden vaults, shadowy stories and poems that may be read as and when you desire most. Life is a wondrous tapestry of lightness and dark. People throughout history have fought to comprehend that subtle interplay of darkness with light. This evocative collection of short stories and poems are set in that fantastical void between our physical lives and those unseen dimensions outside the predictable and mundane. Take heed! “Be entranced and beguiled. Be excited and defiled. Be tearful and reviled. Beware the Kharon’s icy claw, It grasps with intent at human thought. Dead fingers clutch at the darkness that lives herein. The Kharon relentlessly imbibes all mortal life-sparks, Transitioning human essence from life to death. They wander for eternity in empty fields, beyond the river of souls.”",
