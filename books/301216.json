  "description": "Show of hands, ladies--Who has time for the one who got away?Not me. I'm a busy woman. It's wedding season in Bliss River and my catering business is slammed.The last thing I need is a blast from the past, sweeping into my perfectly ordered life, talking sweet and acting even sweeter, making me think about kissing so often I start to wonder if there's something wrong with me.Spoiler alert: There is.It's been waaaay too long since I've made room for kissing on my To Do list.Easy fix: I'll play doctor with Mason Stewart until I get my ex out of my system. It shouldn't take long. I give him seven days--seven dates--and then we'll go our separate ways and I'll finally move on.The only problem?Turns out Mason is even dreamier, sexier, more intense and magnetic than he used to be, and the only place I want to move is into his bed. Full time.Maybe a second chance is exactly what the doctor ordered?Or do I need a second opinion?",
