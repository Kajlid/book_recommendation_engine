  "description": "In 1883, Jose Olano, a 16 year old Basque from the Iberian Peninsula, has lucked into a job as a sheepherder in southeastern portion of Idaho Territory. He is in bliss until the day that a raging grizzly bear attacks his sheep herd, and in trying to defend his charges he wounds the bear and is in turn horribly torn apart before he kills the beast, almost on accident. 38 year old, rugged mountaineer and sometimes outlaw Robert \"Gray Eagle\" McAllister is on foot after having his horse stolen from him. He, in turn, steals a beautiful palomino that belongs to one of the rich people he deplores. His flight is stalled when he knocks a young girl off her horse into the Bear River and must choose either to rescue her or to make his escape. Because he cares for young people and animals, he chooses the rescue. McAllister escapes on foot only to find the nearly dead Basque boy in the forest. He makes the choice to save a life once again and nurses Jose back to health, then sets out to train him to become a mountain man. Through many adventures throughout southeast Idaho the partners are a close team. It is only when Jose must finally choose between the life of an outlaw or to become a civilized man when they must part ways. But the parting is not as easy as they had believed . . .",
