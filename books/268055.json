  "description": "Savannah Orlando escaped horrendous abuse and torture at the hands of her father. As his trial approaches, she struggles to accept her newfound happiness with her husband, Damián, and to keep from falling back into old habits that once served her well, but no longer work. Nightmares and memories of the past threaten to destroy all she has gained since her escape. Damián Orlando knows her father will go to any lengths to destroy them, even from within custody. The need to protect Savannah wars with his need to prepare her to face again the monster who robbed her of her childhood innocence. If anything happens to Savannah, their daughter, or their unborn child, Damián will finish the job he started at the desert compound where he rescued her. READY TO GET RESCUED? In the ongoing Rescue Me Saga, the reader will be swept into a world of honor, heroism, and romance. The books in this series are not stand-alone stories and should be read in numerical order, beginning with the Masters at Arms in this combined volume. Readers will connect with each hero and heroine and be able to see them return in book after book as the saga continues. Happily Ever After is only the beginning and other people will be introduced as they choose to join this growing family.",
