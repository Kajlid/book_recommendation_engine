  "description": "Isaac Grey was born to be the main character, and he knows it.Though, were it up to him, that would not be the case. He wants a quiet, normal life.For seventeen years he's done everything he can to avoid the lead role. Supporting characters throw themselves at him as he tries to derail whatever pilot episode, prologue, or opening their \"chance meeting\" might result in. Born to be the hero, scorned by the role, and sworn to never be again. Isaac subverts the expectations of the main character at every turn in this witty, first person contemporary tale of one young mans struggle with letting go of the past. Cursed to be the protagonist of a story he wants nothing to do with, he struggles with his own ideals, and what his heart tells him is right. Isaac Grey may not be the bad guy, but he is certainlyNo One's Hero",
