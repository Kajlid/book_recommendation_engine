  "description": "A contemporary Erma Bombeck extols the highs and lows of parentingWhen Dallas Louis decided that all she wanted was to meet and marry her Prince Charming and become a mom, she had no idea what was in store for her. But she would soon find out. After only seven months of dating the love of her life, she married him, and within the course of twenty-six months, she gave birth to three children. Her husband knew her longer pregnant than not pregnant!In this hilarious book, Dallas shares highlights of what happened in her world once all her dreams came true. She would like readers to find comfort in knowing they aren’t the only ones suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome or buyer’s remorse. And, yes, it’s okay to admit that both of these conditions apply to parenting, though hopefully not all the time.With her irreverent humor and brash “tell it like it is” style, Dallas will help you laugh at everyday situations, easing the pressure of the toughest job in the world: being a mom.“Mothers seeking a bit of humor about their child-rearing experiences will find it in droves in [this book]. It’s especially important because without humor, surviving this stage of family life becomes questionable.”—Midwest Book Review",
