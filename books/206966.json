  "description": "In 2015, Dianna Liddell has it all: An apartment overlooking Sydney Harbour, a successful career, financial independence and a live-in fianc√© with an athletic build and \"the world's greatest smile\". She couldn't ask for more...until she learns she is pregnant to the man she no longer wants. Anna Endicott is the wife of a clergyman, who, in 1855, sets sail to Australia as a dutiful wife. Three years on, she has lost her country, loved ones, faith in her husband and their God, and all hope of finding happiness. When wishes flow, timelines are crossed and new futures are forged. Places, names, and partners alter, and the values of a foreign society will see celebrated principles questioned. Familiarity fades, expectations are changed, hearts falter, and someone will find themself falling in love.",
