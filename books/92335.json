  "description": "Scarlett barely escaped with her life the last time she ran in to The Venari; but she refuses to spend her days looking over her shoulder. Determined to be normal, she heads to Europe, only to learn that her wish to blend in is simply not meant to be. With Jake delayed in Salem, Scarlett is vulnerable and forced to rely on new found friends, The Collective; a band of people with gifts like her own. When her desire to bring an end to her torment leads her to the dark underbelly of Paris, she discovers what The Venari plan for her is not death, but in fact much worse. Scarlett realises to help herself and everyone else, she must surrender to the persecutors of thousands of witches before her; those desperate to lay claim to the powers she possesses.",
