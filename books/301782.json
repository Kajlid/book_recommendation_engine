If we are to discover the mind of Hitler, we must penetrate behind the thick curtains of superficial evidence which conceal it and the unreliable media intermediaries who have distorted it.Here is a startling expose' of the origin of Hitler's views on his enemies, his friends, his ambitions, his failures, and his goals.
