  "description": "Jorge Cordoba has schemed and cheated his way to the top of a criminal enterprise that stands on the threshold of becoming an international power. A Harvard-trained business genius, Cordoba has master-minded a plot to turn godfather Don Gallardo's Colombian drug cartel into an organization that will bring the industrialized nations of the world to their knees. La Estrella Latina, the freighter delivering the goods that will secure Cordoba - and the cartel's - future, is en route to its secret destination. To ensure absolute success, Cordoba has placed a special security guard aboard. He is called El Callado, the Silent One...a killer unlike any other. But La Estrella Latina never reaches port. And when the freighter is sighted floating listlessly in the steel-gray seas, another man enters the equation. He is Naval lieutenant Daniel Blake, and he could jeopardize Cordoba's entire operation. Blake wants only one thing from the U.S. Navy: his own command. Instead, he finds himself trapped on an obsolete destroyer on patrol off the coast of Peru. Now he's just been ordered to lead a boarding party onto an abandoned freighter. Struggling against a gale-force storm that cuts off communication with his own ship, Blake and the seven men and one woman under his command scramble over the rusty sides of La Estrella Latina.",
