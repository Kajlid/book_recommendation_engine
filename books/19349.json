There is no escaping the Midnight Matings. Fletcher Martin has spent the majority of his life alone. Changing into a common house cat doesn't exactly endear him to others who are looking for a mate, either. Everyone else might be upset at the elders' trickery, but Fletcher just hopes he won't be leaving alone. After centuries of hiding away from the rest of the paranormal world, Caspian Reyes just wants someone to call his own and ease the ache in his heart. The cute little kitty shifter and the gorgeous gargoyle may just be what the doctor ordered. Six thousand years of existing in the shadows has taken its toll on Shade Santiago. He doesn't know if he's worth it, but when Caspian and Fletcher decide to take a chance on him, Shade seizes the opportunity with both hands. The past has a way of holding on, though, and Shade's secrets could prove deadly for them all. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
