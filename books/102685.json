  "description": "I guess everyone can have their little fantasies. Me, I was just trying to fit in. “Act Normal,” is my mantra. Nobody I knew lived in another world while they slept, eighteenth century France to be exact, but again, who would admit it. So why the hell did my hot fantasy lover Michel have to show up on my first day of college as my Art History 101 professor. Worse yet, how did I end up as his teaching assistant?Surely it’s a quirk of genetics or a cruel joke from above, taunting me with his pale twin.But no, I was so very wrong. The campus crush, a mild mannered sexy professor by day, is actually my long lost love, turned vampire upon our deaths two hundred years ago. He’s still the same sexy, frustrating man—well, with a few added perks.He’s got secrets, slews of them which incidentally annoy me to death [lol] and by my guess, could kill me.Should “optimistic” be the “happy” word for today? Optimistic that I’d come out of this alive?",
