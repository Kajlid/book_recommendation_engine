He’d like to erase one of his recent cases from his memory forever, but it haunts him night and day. A temporary assignment to cover for an officer on maternity leave could be the small-town, low-demand break he needs to put the past behind him. Especially with the sexy local vet, who makes him forget everything but the way her body feels in his arms. Lindsay Snow can’t help but notice the new cop in her small town—he’s hot, charming and—best of all—he’s not in town for long. When a call to shut down a horrific puppy mill exposes the tough, sexy cop’s dark memories, Lindsay’s heart wants desperately to reach out to him. Even as her instincts remind her that relationships are just a train wreck waiting to happen… Contains a tortured hero hot enough to melt even the toughest woman’s resolve.",
