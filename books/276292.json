  "description": "In her world, single combat decides everything.  Kiriai is turning sixteen and has a big decision to make. Will she fight for her dream to battle in the arena? Or buckle under her grandfather’s pressure to become a healer?  Her best friend Eigo is an outcast from his scrounger family. On a recent expedition into the wastelands, he found a peculiar birthday gift for Kiriai—an AI trainer from a centuries-old martial arts game. Could it give her the advantage she needs? Will Kiriai win the fight that decides her future?  An impossible deadline, a persuasive mentor, and her own family all stand in Kiriai’s way. If she loses, she’ll be consigned to a mundane life, but more importantly, banned from the arena forever. Kiriai can't let that happen.  Combat Origin is the first book in Combat World, a young adult dystopia series. If you like strong heroines, litrpg and a good brawl, buy a copy of Combat Origin today and escape into adventure.",
