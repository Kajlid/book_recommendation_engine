He’s determined to break free from his brother Elliot’s shadow, and get over the soul crushing attraction he has for his brother’s best friend. The campus meetup app provides an effective distraction from Gabe and Elliot making waves as the new star players for Huntston University’s baseball team. Gabe Rodgers is loyal to his best friend to a fault, but his thoughts toward Elliot’s smaller, softer twin are anything but brotherly. When he finds out Ellis is meeting hook-ups on a campus meetup app, protectiveness, or maybe possessiveness, drives him to make an anonymous profile. Pretending to be someone else, he finds himself drawn to Ellis more than ever before. But will their connection be as strong when Ellis finds out that his secret meetups have been with the very guy he’s been trying to avoid? And when the blindfold is removed, will either of the brothers be able to forgive Gabe for his deception?All books in the Forbidden Goals series are standalone and do not need to be read in any particular order.",
