  "description": "Christmas isn't Claire Asher's favorite season. But she endures it for her teenage daughter. When Sullivan Snow moves in next door with his teen daughter, all holiday breaks loose. Suddenly there are twinkling lights and blow up decorations littering the yard, and when the two girls become friends, all kinds of nauseating jolly ensues thanks to her annoying but oh-so-good-looking new neighbor. It isn't long before Sullivan is dragging her along tree shopping, gift buying, and making her feel things she hasn't felt in a very long time. Sullivan doesn't get why anyone wouldn't love Christmas. Claire is as grumpy as a Grinch, but also smart and beautiful and funny. He intends to show her what the season is all about--with some holiday spirit, warm nights in front of the fire, a lot of steamy cuddling, and the magic of falling in love. Contains mature themes.",
