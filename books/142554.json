  "title": "The Radical Housewife: Redefining Family Values for the 21st Century",
  "description": "What does a feminist do when she becomes a middle class, stay-at-home mom? Fight even harder for the rights of women! Through vivid tales of street action, political campaigns (both Michele Bachmann and Al Franken make appearances), school curriculum debates, SWAT officers, flame wars, ultrasounds, white-liberal guilt, feminists with no interest in children, moms with no interest in politics, and gay marriage, The Radical Housewife depicts the struggle of one woman to understand herself and her role as a well-educated woman who chooses-for a variety of reasons, not least of which is the \"glass ceiling\" that enables her husband to earn a greater salary than she could-to stay home and raise her children. Ultimately, Shannon Drury asks the question: What does \"family values\" really mean? After reading The Radical Housewife, the answer may surprise you.",
