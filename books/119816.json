  "description": "Angel Moreno and Sarah Fiero fell in love in \nForever Mine.\n They beat the odds of high school sweethearts withstanding the test of time. Trust has not been an issue in years. Enter the tatted, muscled, and intriguing bad boy, Leonardo. Leonardo quickly sets his sights on Sarah. Despite Angel's utter irritation with the guy, he has no choice but to allow Leo in Sarah's life because he's family--a long lost relative. Even more unsettling is Sarah's excitement about the whole thing. As Sarah and Leo's relationship grows uncomfortably closer, Angel reminds himself the guy is family. Then things get weird. The change in Sarah is unmistakable, and Angel fears his worst nightmare is coming true. Is it possible forever has gone on too long for Sarah? There's no shortage of edge-of-your-seat, angsty drama, tears, and laughter as Angel and Sarah's love is put to the ultimate test in this addition to the Moreno Brother series. New Adult Contemporary - *Mature Content* Recommended for ages 17+ due to sexual situations and language.",
