  "title": "How to Run a Stately Home",
  "description": "If anyone knows how to run a \"stately home\" it is the Duke of Bedford, whose Woburn Abbey gives pleasure in some 1,200,00 people a year. Those planning to open their own home to the public would be foolish not to study this book first, and all readers will be entertained by the Duke's tips and revelations which can be as disconcerting as they are fascinating. Together with George Mikes, he has made a close study of the motives and behaviour of visitors to stately homes, and holds up a mirror to them as they flock though the gates.",
