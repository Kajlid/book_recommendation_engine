  "description": "Just when I think things are finally starting to calm down, I come face-to-face with my long-lost twin.Turns out, being a Daughter of Death is a whole lot more than just kicking ass and taking names.There are things like rules...and responsibilities.Oh yeah, and let’s not forget the monster that’s killed me in all my past lives. That’s a thing, too.There’s also this teensy little problem: James may be gone but the distrust he created in the supernatural community is still very much alive. With the tensions between Council members bleeding into Farrow’s Sqaure it’s only a matter of time until someone does something crazy. Now I gotta figure out what my twin wants, learn about my super badass death powers, kill a monster, and stop a war. Sounds like a piece of cake. Speaking of cake...This whole thing started over a Hostess cupcake. Do I dare hope it can end with one?You bet your ass, I do.This is the last book in the Grimm Brotherhood series. This series must be read in order.",
