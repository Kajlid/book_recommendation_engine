  "title": "Yes, Virginia: There Is a Santa Claus",
  "description": "In 1897, eight-year-old Virginia O'Hanlon wrote the New York Sun to ask a simple question: Is there a Santa Claus? The editor's response was a stirring defense of hope, generosity, and the spirit of childhood. His essay has been reprinted countless times since, and the phrase \"Yes, Virginia, there is a Santa Claus\" has become part of American Christmas lore.Based on these actual events, Yes, Virginia is the story of a little girl who taught a city to believe.",
