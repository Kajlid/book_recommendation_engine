When she brazenly confronts a Civility Squad—brutal policing groups formed under the Cavern’s new martial law—she realizes she needs help.With no control and nowhere to turn, Ata is suddenly called to train with the Cavern’s military leader Azai. As she gains more self-control and confidence in herself, Ata learns about a traitorous plot involving someone close to her. But she’s not sure where her loyalty lies: with those she loves or with her government?The Awakening is a companion novella (# 1.5) to The Cavern, book one in The Cavern Series. It can be read separate from the main trilogy novels, but is best enjoyed, and free of minor spoilers, if read after The Cavern.",
