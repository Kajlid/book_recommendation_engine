  "description": "My name's Alex. I used to think I was normal. I have a job, an apartment, good friends. I have a sister I adore, and the most beautiful woman in the world happens to be my best friend. I see ghosts. So what, right? It's on television all the time. All kinds of people see ghosts. But seeing ghosts turns into seeing demons. Seeing demons turns into walking through walls. It only keeps getting better. It just so happens I'm half demon, the only one of my kind. I met a woman and made a new friend, Victoria. She is a four-hundred-year-old vampire, and she needs my help. It turns out vampires are popping up everywhere. Some kind of new breed, more animal than vampire. They feed on anything, and can't be reasoned with. Can a half demon do anything to stop them?",
