  "description": "My hockey obsession is a little much.  But there’s nothing little about my obsession for the older man on my favorite team.  And when this younger woman goes to the team’s pre-season autograph signing for diehard fans, it’s not hard to notice that there’s one very big statistic they left out of the media guide in regards to his stick.  And although this older man might be the best goalkeeper in hockey history, for the first time ever I think there might actually be a chance for me to score my biggest goal with this rock hard possessive alpha male hockey hero for the first time.  But when the team suddenly asks him to switch positions, on the night of the season opener, to enforcer so their newest hot shot trade acquisition fresh out of college can play, I see the force with which he’ll protect what’s his…including me.  But when he finds out that young hot shot is my very own twin brother, will he give me the cold shoulder forever or show the world for the first time that he’s no longer just a hockey bad boy, but an experienced older man and team player on and off the ice who’s ready to lift the Stanley Cup and toast my brother on his success, allowing my brother to offer up a toast of his own and become my brother’s best friend and my one and only ultimate hockey hero forever?  *Hockey Obsession is an insta-everything standalone instalove romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
