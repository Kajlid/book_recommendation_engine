  "description": "THE SWORD OF AGRIPPA. Antioch.  A rogue scientist's search for dark energy collides with forces intent on preserving the old ways. Powerful oligarchs control science and religion.  Roy Swenson, banned from the US, hits Prague on a quest for energy which will transform the world and lead to a new tech revolution, a new renaissance.  He is forced to continue his research in Eastern Europe. From Prague he sets the stage for the next battle. One he hopes to win.  His experiments with DMT, pineal glands and the properties of a strange new substance (graphene) propel him into the spotlight, and the pressures build. The war begins.  Mainstream industrial, political and religious leaders view him as a threat, not a joke. Dark energy could disrupt humanity's view of everything.  Roy's dreams take him to Egypt as a young Roman soldier, Marcus Agrippa. He falls for Samia, an Egyptian slave priestess. In the secret chambers of the Great Library, she guides him through mysteries political and cosmic.  Dreams power Roy/Agrippa through devastating events and sacrifices. Join his quest.  Travel from Prague in 2020 to the Great Library of Alexandria in 48 BC, on a journey linking ancient scrolls, dark energy sensors, majestic temples, and torch-lit torture chambers. ______ * 60,000 words.",
