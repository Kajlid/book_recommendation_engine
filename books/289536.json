  "title": "A Texas Pioneer",
  "description": "August Santleben was born in 1845 in Hanover. Just three and a half months later his parents decided to leave Germany to emigrate to America. The family settled in Medina County, Texas, and Santleben grew up experiencing life on the wild American frontier. His book, A Texas Pioneer, is often revered as one of the greatest frontier memoirs of the Old West. Through the course of the text Santleben recounts tales of staging and freighting through Texas and Mexico and clashing with Indian, Mexico, and American thieves. It is a book that transports the reader to the world of the nineteenth century frontier when life was tough and frequently short. No student of western literature or the history of Texas and Mexico should miss this thrilling truthful account. August Santleben was a German born frontiersman who spent the vast majority of his life on the Texan-Mexican border. His book that recounts this period, A Texas Pioneer, was first published in 1910. Santleben passed away the following year in 1911.",
