  "description": "Nick Ceratto, a young,cracker jack litigator looking for a partnership in the prestigious Philadelphia law firm of Maglio,Silvio,and Levin discovers his firm's dark seceret for increasing it's bottom line while preparing a medical malpractice case for trial.The partners are setting up major cases by seriously injuring and even murdering their clients to produce huge jury awards. When the firm discovers he knows,Nick's only hope is to stay one step ahead of the hitman long enough to intentionally lose his case and expose the firm's corruption. As his mission careens towards an explosive climax,the only question left, is whose lives will be sacrificed along the way.This is a classic examination of the duality of the American justice system,it's strengths and weaknesses,and the interplay between it and raw ambition.Blood Money is a disturbing depiction of a system gone wrong, and the one time golden boy who is finally able to understand the bigger picture and remember the oath taken and the dream that was once so clear.",
