  "description": "Hilter's biggest counter-offensive can't stop Mahoney's one-man kill-spree! On a well-deserved R & R, Sergenat C.J. Mahoney of Patton's Hammerhead Division heads straight for a hot bar in the freezing Belgian town of Clervaux. A few drinks, a knife fight over a woman, andMahoney lands in a cell. But the worst of his tough-luck night comes when German bombs start ripping the town to shreds. Patton and Hitler had begun the biggest massacre of their wartime careers, a massive slaughter of fire and flesh that is rumbling toward its bloody finale in Bastogne. With death on his heels and a grenade in his teeth, Mahoney sprints from jail and slashes into the enemy troops with bayonets, bazookas and his eager bare hands - and the Sergeant won't rejoin his unit until he completes his one-man mission of annihilation that will be heard clear back to Berlin!",
