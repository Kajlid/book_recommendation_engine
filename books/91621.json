During and shortly after the Civil War Douglas set down his experiences of great men and great days. In resonant prose, he wrote simply and intimately, covering the full emotional spectrum of a soldier's life. Here is one of the finest and most remarkable stories to come out of any war, written wholly firsthand from notes and diaries made on the battlefield.",
