  "description": "Vivian is able to see things other people can’t. Things like shadows that move without a maker and hover over people, feeding their depression and fueling their self-destruction. She also sees kind spirits, guiding and guarding their loved ones against the shadows.When Vivian’s mother and brother die in an accident, the only option is to reunite with her estranged father at his new home in another state. Unfortunately, there are shadows in the house, and Vivian tries to avoid them during this time of heartache and anger. Her brother’s spirit warns about an especially strong shadow at the top of the stairs, one inhabiting the bedroom of a girl who disappeared fifteen months ago.Once the spirit of the missing girl reaches out to Vivian, she learns the girl was murdered in that bedroom while staring into the eyes of a trusted person possessed by the shadows. The girl’s spirit is restless; her undiscovered body lies buried in a shallow grave, not far from Vivian’s home.With her brother’s assistance, Vivian searches for answers in hope the girl’s spirit can move on. But the shadows are intent on protecting the killer’s identity. They stalk Vivian. Her life depends on releasing her own pain and anger, because the shadows won’t stop until she stops searching…or until death finds her too.",
