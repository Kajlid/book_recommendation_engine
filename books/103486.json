  "description": "On the faraway world of Faltyr, a calamitous Mage of Moor'dru must do whatever it takes to get the secretive contents of a magic chest back home to his master. But when his disastrous nature shipwrecks him on an accursed island, Kaladimus Dor must cooperate with a motley crew of survivors, including mercenaries from the adventuring guild known as Finders Keepers, to secure their only means of escape, a powerful ship of legend. Can the contentious group of survivors find this Hallowed Vessel before they are consumed, figuratively by their own inner strife or literally by the island's ravenous inhabitants? And what will happen if the survivors discover Dor is the one responsible for shipwrecking them there in the first place? Will they forgive him or will his actions be their undoing?",
