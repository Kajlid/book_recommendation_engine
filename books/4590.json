He's grown up with this cowboy, competed against him in bull riding and calf roping. Theyâ€™ve fished and swam together as kids. He never imagined Jace was gay--or that he'd been keeping secret the lust he felt for Tyler. When the truth come bubbling to the surface, things heat up between Tyler and his friend. He can't get the memory of seeing Jace naked out of his head. Nor can he stop his desire for Jace. But will fear stop him from going all the way?",
