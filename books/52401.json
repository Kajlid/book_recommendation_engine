  "description": "A young apprentice would do anything to save her kingdom, even suffer captivity at the hands of the enemy. When Alasia is taken over by ruthless invaders from neighboring Malorn, Anya allows herself to be captured and brought to their headquarters, hoping to spy on them and slip information to the Alasian resistance. Her role could help the missing prince reclaim his kingdom—if it doesn't get her killed first.  Anya's attempts to work against the enemy tangle her in an increasingly complex web of lies and secrets. Then she comes face to face with a professional spy who knows a little too much about her family, and she is horrified to realize her own father may have been involved in the betrayal that led to the Invasion.  Unless Anya can find the key that will lead to the Malornians' defeat and Prince Jaymin's safe return, Alasia is doomed. But if her father is convicted of treason, victory for Alasia will spell disaster for her family. If you enjoy the finely crafted cultures and world-building of Mistborn, Song of the Lioness, or Farseer, you'll love the land of Alasia!
