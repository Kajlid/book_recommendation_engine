  "description": "\"A simply outstanding novel\" - Midwest Book ReviewA woman born without legs spends her days swimming with manatees. Two artists, separated by centuries, guide each other's hands. And a child of the Florida frontier sits on the graves of her siblings to think about race relations and the habits of caterpillars. These are some of the women who live along the banks of a river where water billows from caverns of silent lakes. None of them are famous. None of them have children. Instead, their stories exist in a mosaic of time and shadowed history, and the things of the river - clay and water, trees and bone - carry their memories forward.",
