  "description": "Some bets were made to be lost.Kate Lamonica isn't Koti James's type. Too small. Too dark. And heaps too much work. So it's an easy bet that he can be her friend for six weeks without making a move on her, no matter what his mates would have said. Kate can't believe she's made the bet at all. New Zealand had seemed like the perfect escape from the stalker who'd threatened first her peace of mind, and then her life. She certainly doesn't need any more trouble. Why on earth has she agreed to spend time with a Maori rugby player who's far too handsome and charming for his own good â€” and knows it? But there's more than one game Koti's good at playing...Note: This STAND-ALONE romance, like New Zealand, contains some steam. If that isn't your cuppa, maybe visit another country ... er, book.",
