Having been in mourning following her mother's death, she eagerly anticipates a marriage proposal, although her pa isn't all that fond of the fair-haired young man.Looking for work, after having been a wagon master and trapper, Micah Blaylock and his Indian friend, Deer Runner, arrive in Fern Valley during an outbreak of rabid bear attacks. As the town struggles to protect itself from these vicious, diseased animals, Saffron and her family face certain peril.After a hunting party is formed, Saffron is the only woman allowed to join, having proven herself a good shot. Accompanied by her beau, Silas, and Micah, a bond forms between the brunette beauty and the mysterious mountain man. The group soon finds itself in dire circumstances, which will test the mettle and faith of each person on the journey. The Rocky Mountains, although wild and beautiful, hold a danger far greater than rabid bears.",
