  "description": "I had one goal in life: To defeat the Dysfunctionals. My mission to unite with my twin flame soulmate wasn't as important as killing the group of men that were trying to stop my siblings, and I, from doing our job.  The explosion changed my life forever. What good was being able to throw fire, if I wasn't fit enough to use it? With father missing, and the others still trying to find him, I sank into despair. Life was no longer worth living.  My only salvation was Natalie, my ex-girlfriend. She knew that I had a mission, and was determined to get me back on my feet, so that I could defeat the Dysfunctionals, and unite with my twin flame.  \nThe Zodiac Twin Flame series is a twelve book new adult paranormal romance series.",
