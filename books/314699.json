  "description": "Ashley Davis has a choice--stay in the life she was born into or move on. But it's not that simple. Despite how suffocating it feels, the Thanatos MC is her home, and Jack is the man she loves. If only he could remain faithful. Andy Shaw is the newest member of the MC and has a lot to prove. He's determined to gain the respect of his fellow brothers, but one person seems to be distracting him. There's an unspoken rule among the brotherhood, and he's dangerously close to breaking it.",
