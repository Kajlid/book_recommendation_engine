  "description": "Bishop has been a vampire for 700 years and though he wishes nothing more than to live his life in peace, getting humans to believe that vampires are not monsters is a difficult task, and vampire hunters like The Reaper make it even more difficult. Believing that a vampire killed her mother, Marika leads a band of vigilantes, determined to rid the world of these monsters. What no one knows is that Irina herself is half–vampire. Determined to deny that side of her, Marika captures Bishop, believing he can lead her to the vampire responsible for her mother's death. But over the course of Bishop's captivity, secrets about Marika's past are revealed and she soon learns that what she has always believed to be true is anything but. Now Marika and Bishop are in a race against time as they fight for their lives––and their love.",
