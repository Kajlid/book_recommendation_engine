  "description": "A south-of-the-border detective investigates grisly murders traced to a secret cabal known as Grupo Vampiro. On a college field trip to caverns near the remote Mexican village of Bustamante, the daughter of a U.S. senator is murdered, the blood drained from her body. Detective Artemas Salcido, a Harvard-educated, illegitimate son of a Mexican governor and a Yaqui Indian girl, is responsible for the investigation. Handsome and cosmopolitan, Artemas was banished to Bustamante because of his ill-advised propensity for solving politically sensitive crimes, and now he finds himself in the middle of yet another.The international press, two FBI agents, and a brutal squad of federales with orders from the President of Mexico to make the problem go away, descend on the village. Among the reporters is Laffi Rend√≥n, an old flame of Artemas' from Harvard. As more grisly killings occur, Artemas discovers a secret cabal, Grupo Vampiro, which leads him to a labyrinth of rituals and crimes stretching from mediaeval Eastern Europe to Mexico's most powerful people.",
