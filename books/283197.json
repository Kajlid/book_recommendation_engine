  "description": "Billionaire Jamison Kennedy fell in love at first sight with his sweet, country girl. They were from different worlds, but he knew she was meant for him. He wasted no time in sweeping Hazel off her feet and tying the knot.  Hazel was desperately in love with her husband, but she didn’t fit in with the glitz and glamor of New York high society. However, she was determined to be the perfect wife, even if it meant losing herself in the process.  Jamison knew something was wrong and he’d do anything to get back to the people they were when they first met. Because nothing was as important as their love.",
