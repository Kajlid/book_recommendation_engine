  "description": "~THIS IS BOOK 2. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVEN'T READ 24690~ .  For the briefest moment, revenge was sweet. My husband was suffering before my very eyes, and Bram … he was alive.  But happiness didn’t last.  The man who claimed he wasn’t my savior held true to his word. Bram didn’t rush in and save me from the cruel fate of the White Room. No one did. Now I’m tortured with red light massacres and a hell I could have never imagined. Surviving will take everything I have, but I’m determined to get answers from the man who turned his back on me.  When I think it can’t get worse … it does. Slave 24690 is all but gone. The evil woman reborn is what nightmares are made of. Insanity beckons, but even my madness won’t derail the plans I’ve set in motion.  Masters will fall. Conspiracies will reign. But will I be strong enough to let go of the one thing that could ultimately destroy me?    ***********WARNING*********** This book contains EXTREMELY disturbing situations, explicit sexual content, and very graphic language.
