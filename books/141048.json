  "description": "Brian and Dylan have been best friends for years. They have no secrets between them, except for the ones they’re keeping from each other.When Dylan lets himself into Brian’s apartment to drop something off, it couldn’t be worse timing--for Brian. He’s tied himself up to play out a kidnapping fantasy. He’s mortified, but Dylan is intrigued. He even offers to help Brian out next time he has an urge to be tied up.No. That’s all Brian can think. No way. But the idea of someone else being in control overwhelms his thoughts--and self-bondage is suddenly a pale substitute for the real thing. He gives Dylan permission, on a trial basis, and comes face to face with a side of Dylan he’s never seen before. A really hot side.As their games pick up steam, so does their relationship, along with Brian’s courage to go after the things he wants. Like, Dylan.It might be happily ever after, but there’s one secret left, and it could ruin everything.",
