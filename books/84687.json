  "description": "If the love of a parent can make a young man brave, then Alexander Martinez should have been a selfish coward. For almost sixteen years of his life, Alex had never felt that kind of love. So after new foster parents take him in and teach him what it's like to have a real family--a loving family--and Alex finally experiences the joys that life can provide, he discovers a strength of character buried deep within his soul.But Alex's dream of family doesn't last. Instead, he finds himself in a society suffering from the aftermath of total collapse, and he realizes that he has to make a choice: Will he choose to protect the liberty and freedom of others, even at the peril of his own life? Or will his own fears and lack of confidence cause him to remain on the sidelines, only to witness the complete and utter destruction of America?SON OF LIBERTY is a story of post apocalyptic possibilities. It's a little bit \"Prepper\". Certainly gun friendly. And absolutely patriotic. Long live the Sons of Liberty!",
