  "title": "Bittersweet Symphony",
  "description": "In the concrete jungles of corporate New York, a skyscraper stands in a faded industrial brownfield. The Madson Tower, a place notorious for murders and cases of deadly negligence, has attracted the interests of CEO Tony Barone and his team of employees. Sure, the landlord might be a bit creepy, Tony's daughter might be seeing things that aren't real, but the cheap rental price is definitely a steal! If Tony wasn't such a skeptic himself, he might be able to see the horrible things surrounding him. Maybe then he would notice the strange fires starting up through the building. Maybe then he'd notice his lawyer's clients are all turning up dead. Are his employees just being too panicky, or is there something more sinister at work? If Tony doesn't figure out what to do soon, he and his advertising agency might just become more casualties of a structure that eats people alive.",
