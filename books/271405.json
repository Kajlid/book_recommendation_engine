  "description": "I’m the good Gilroy. Not the serious one—the control freak who doesn’t know how to smile and had his entire life planned before he was old enough to drink and certainly not the one who runs around sticking his d**k into anything with a pulse. I’m Patrick Gilroy. Thoughtful. Considerate. Dependable. Mr. Nice Guy. That’s how Cari used to see me. But that was before. Before she moved in and made my life a living hell. Made me want things I’d convinced myself I could never have. Things that made me question who I really am. And how far I’m willing to go to get them. Because I never wanted to be just her friend. I’ve always wanted more. A lot more. Now that she’s pushed me over the edge, she’s going to find out just how much. Now that I’ve had her, I’m not going to stop until I take it all. Now I’m going to finish what Cari started. No more Mr. Nice Guy.  **Warning** This 90k words romance novel is intended for mature (18+) audiences only! You’ve been warned! **This full-length novel is the SECOND in a series and resolved the cliffhanger in book one, PUSHING PATRICK. There is no cheating and ends in HEA.**",
