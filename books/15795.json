Unfortunately, Scott's straight-arrow, FBI agent, sort-of-boyfriend Frank has other ideas - which leads Scott to wake up in a hotel room with cutie Bryce Bell, the hottest young figure skater in the country. But when Scott finds a dead body in Bryce's hotel room, he is thrust into a world of lost ancient artefacts, thieves and prophecies. As Scott races to unravel the mystery, he soon feels himself chilled by a foreboding unlike anything he has felt before.\"Greg Herren gives readers a tantalizing glimpse of New Orleans.\"--The Midwest Book Review",
