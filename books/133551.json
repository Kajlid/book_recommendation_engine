  "title": "Lost In Spain: A Collection Of Humorous Essays",
  "description": "Scott Oglesby moved to Spain with the thought that it was the perfect chance to start over. Unfortunately, he brought himself with him. The result was dysfunction, delusion, chaos and one hilarious book. Lost in Spain is a collection of humorous essays centered around one very awkward American. With irreverent imagination, larger than life characters posing as humans, and surprising heart, this book will move you. Whether to laughter, tears, anger, or even an adventure in another country is anybody's guess.",
