  "description": "Coming from a powerful line of black witches doesn't mean anything if they've abused you your entire life.I'm a broken witch.Born with weak chaos magic, I exist on the fringes of society as a fixer of people and their problems.Until I tried to save the Devil.Instead, I accidentally created a blood bond between his soul and mine.Whoops.Lucifer whispers filthy promises of all the things he'd do to me if I brought him back, but I won't sacrifice another life to restore his playboy throne.What’s worse, my ex-fiance won’t stay away.He broke off our engagement. It was his choice. So why won't he leave me alone?You'd think I'd have learned not to trust my taste in men by now, but when a one-night stand with a sinfully arrogant stranger turns into something more, the only thing I know for certain is that I'm screwed.Love almost killed me once, and I'm determined to keep my distance from them.But as they say... the road to hell was always paved with the best intentions.Authors' Note: This is a devil(ish) paranormal romance with three possessive love interests that fall first for one strong independent witch. All relationships are completely consensual. This is the second series in the Magic Wars Universe. You do not need to have read Demons of New Chicago to proceed, but there will be spoilers.",
