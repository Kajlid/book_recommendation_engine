  "description": "A race against the clock. Does love conquer all? Lucy Reed and Steve Fleming seem to have it all: a beautiful home they're in the process of restoring, a loving relationship, and quite a sating sex life. Sure, mortgage payments and a few arguments are always around the corner, but no life can be perfect, right? Lucy discovers exactly how tricky life can be when she wakes up one morning to find that Steve seems to have vanished into thin air. When the police refuses to do anything until seventy-two hours have passed, Lucy is forced to take matters in her own hands. Her frantic search brings her to the doorstep of her unsettling Italian neighbors, the Martone's. Just like that, Lucy finds herself sucked into a race against time that might force her to choose between remaining faithful to the man she loves, or save his life.",
