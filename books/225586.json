  "description": "*** An explosive new standalone from the author of the Mob Boss series ***  FBI agent Braden Kane has been gong it alone ever since a family scandal sent him running straight from the Ivy League into Special Forces. That’s where he learned the hardest lesson of all — we’re all alone in the end. And nobody can save us.  When a raid goes terribly wrong, walking out is almost instinctual. Following the rules is for suckers. There’s only one way to get things done, and that’s to do it off the books. By the time he walks out, he knows there’s only one thing he’ll miss.  Her.  Nora Murphy never really had a choice. Law enforcement was in her blood.  Raised by an old-school Irishman in a houseful of brothers, she learned early on there was only one way to survive.  Be stronger. Be smarter. Be better.  There was no time for romance. And certainly no time for love. Which made tabling her attraction to friend and fellow agent Braden Kane a no-brainer. But Braden’s defection from the FBI opens the door to their relationship in a new and surprising way. Nora’s still getting her head around the possibilities when she’s assigned an important case involving a string of high-profile crimes with a shocking purpose. She can’t wait to bring down the ring of brash vigilantes — until a connection to Braden reveals itself in the investigation.  Now they’re on opposite sides of the law and order coin. Will their love be enough to bridge the gap? Will they survive long enough to find out?",
