  "description": "The Dark Moon curse has struckFor centuries, my kind was thought to be extinct. It turns out that we aren’t, but I'm the only one left. I was chosen for reasons that I don't understand, and it’s up to me to save the werewolves when the Dark Moon curse strikes.To make matters worse—or maybe better—my fated mate Lachlan has been hexed to forget me. Suddenly, I’m a stranger to him, but it could be a gift, because as soon as we fall for each other, I’m fated to die.In order to save the packs, I’m going to need Lachlan's help. We should be resisting each other—and it should be easier because he has no memory of me—but the attraction between us is irresistible. But no matter what, I can't allow myself to fall for the alpha werewolf who is my mate.",
