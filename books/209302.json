  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for B00HFRRJ50 When Venetia was a little girl, her grandpa would regale her with magical tales of the shop he used to own in the mysterious village of Bumpkinton. But when he died, the tales died with him.  Thirty years later, Venetia and her husband chance upon an old photograph in the attic. It ignites a spark within Venetia, and she resolves to buy the shop.  As the inhabitants of Bumpkinton welcome the newcomers with open arms, why is Amelia, the resident busybody, interested in the shop? And why is it so important that it doesnâ€™t become a burger bar?  Bittersweet is the first Bumpkinton novella and is set after the short story Last Christmas.",
