  "description": "Willie Guyles has a secret he's been fighting to keep, something he thought he'd boxed up a long time ago. When he meets a drag prostitute while patrolling the streets of Oklahoma City, the old feelings return, and he can't force them back into the box.  A story about identity crisis, the horrible consequences of bullying, and the detrimental effects of self-loathing, Shadowboxer descends into a world altogether familiar yet strangely askew.",
