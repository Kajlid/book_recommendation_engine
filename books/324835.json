  "title": "We the Presidents: How American Presidents Shaped the Last Century",
  "description": "Rather than a traditional presidential history, We The Presidents focuses on a century of presidencies from Warren G. Harding to Donald J. Trump and how their presidencies have shaped today’s America, and the world. Many of today’s critical issues including immigration, inflation, income disparity, civil discord, and the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East all had their roots in earlier presidencies. Ronald Gruner’s engaging and straightforward writing describes how presidencies over the last century have shaped today’s America from the Emergency Immigration Act of 1921 to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020. The award-winning We The Presidents is more than an absorbing read; it is a great education on the issues which have shaped the American century up to the present day when democracy, both in America and around the world, faces yet another crucial test of its resilience and strength. “Essentially reading for every conscientious citizen.” – U.S. Review of Books",
