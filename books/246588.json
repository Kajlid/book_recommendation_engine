  "description": "Like any great diva, Eva Valentine is a flawed character. Spoiled, stubborn, and sassy, she exudes lioness confidence when in the company of her fellow bitches Maddie and Parker, and hungers for sex like others desire chocolate. Eva is a woman who would kiss your girlfriend as quick as she'd steal your husband, but underneath this hard-nosed facade sheâ€™s just a regular girl who craves normality, and a love that she can call her own. After images of a clumsy clinch with her very married boss make headlines in the Sunday papers, her whole world begins to crumble. Eva must come to terms with the harsh consequences of her reckless actions, but don't think for a second that this would ever stop her fun. In Europe's most expensive capital, beautiful people can always find rich friends to fly them to fabulous parties in London or glamorous holidays in Marbella.",
