  "description": "Easygoing and reckless Tex likes everyone and everything, especially his horse, Negrito, and Johnny Collins's blue-eyed sister, Jamie. Life with his older brother, Mason, would be just about perfect if only Mace would stop complaining about Pop, who hasn't been home in five months. While Mason worries about paying the bills and getting a basketball scholarship--his ticket out of Oklahoma--Tex just seems to attract trouble. Can he find a way to keep things together when everything seems to be falling apart?",
