  "description": "“Cut off the head of the snake and another will grow in its place.”  Part crime drama, part legal thriller, Betrayal in Blue follows the return of Zachary Blake and Jack Dylan as they fight law enforcement itself in picturesque Manistee, Michigan.  Following its triumph over white supremacists in the field and in the courtroom, law enforcement in the city of Dearborn, Michigan has enjoyed relative tranquility. Unfortunately, not for long, as a second (and more dangerous) syndicate and its leader plot revenge for their fallen brothers. Their scheme? To steal and release deadly Sarin gas in the city.  Police Captain Jack Dylan and his team are dedicated to thwarting the plot and bringing the culprits to justice. However, with a terrorist threat in play, the FBI usurps the investigation. However, Jack Dylan never backs away from a case or a fight. When the white supremacy leader evades the FBI's dragnet, Jack goes rogue and hunts him down in Manistee.  The inevitable standoff finds Dylan alone with his nemesis in an unfamiliar city with no FBI or local law enforcement to support him. His plans go awry, and Jack finds himself arrested by local authorities and placed on trial for his actions.  Attorney Zachary Blake comes to his defense in the biggest trial this quiet community has ever seen. The local cops and the FBI think they have a winner, but Zack and his lead investigator, Micah Love, believe there’s more to the story than meets the eye.  This exciting legal thriller concludes with a dramatic showdown that has become the trademark of award-winning author Mark M. Bello who is, once again, at the top of his game.",
