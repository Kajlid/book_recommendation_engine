  "title": "Stick Figure: A Diary of My Former Self",
  "description": "I never intended to publish my childhood diaries,\" says Lori Gottlieb of the journals she stumbled upon. \"In fact, I never intended to find them.\" While rifling through a closet in her parents' house, Gottlieb found something she wasn't looking for and barely remembered existed. The pages of these diaries served as a penetrating and ironic lens through which her younger self viewed the \"mixed-up\" world that surrounded her. \"Of course they aren't overweight,\" Lori told her psychiatrist when asked if she thought the girls at school who diet are overweight. \"Didn't I already say they were popular?\"An unflinchingly candid, bitingly funny debut, Stick Figure's compelling mix of irreverent humor and autobiography offers dead-on observances about everything from mothers to the medical profession, gender roles to the absurdities of society's obsession with beauty, and the confusion of being not quite a child, but not quite an adult yet either.",
