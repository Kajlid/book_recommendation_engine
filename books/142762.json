  "description": "Zombies- as if that wasn’t enough to ruin any girl’s dream of a happily ever after.  Reagan said goodbye to love when she was forced to run her high school boyfriend over with her mom’s car just to keep him from eating her for dinner. Now, two years later, and in need of a serious shower, she’s just over the entire concept of a soul mate- or really, any kind of mate.  Well, mostly anyway. When she runs- literally- into a group of boys holed up in a relative utopia of peanut butter and bottled water, maybe all hope in the love department is not lost.  But at the end of the world, nothing can be simple. And with a never-ending supply of Zombies, militia, a psycho-stalker and a cult-like community after her, Reagan is going to have to schedule falling in love between hunting and surviving. Hopefully she can last long enough find out if true love can still exist when everything else has started to fall apart.  Love and Decay, Season One Omnibus is the first twelve novellas in a Dystopian Romance about Zombies, the end of the world and finding someone to share it with.",
