  "description": "Air Force One is down. The President is dead. The VP's motorcade speeds him to the White House, but a rogue delivery truck slams his limo and leaves him in a coma. The work of terrorists is evident, but the sophistication and planning suggest the involvement of a foreign government. The Speaker of the House prepares to assume command, but the Supreme Court rules to overturn the Presidential Succession Act and limit succession to members of the Cabinet only. The Secretary of Defense becomes Acting President and quickly declares martial law. A constitutional crisis looms, as the Pentagon asserts control and armed military contractors police the land.The CIA pursues the one loose end the attack's perpetrators left hanging: at the very moment the President's plane was shot down, one of the terrorists placed a call to a mysterious Kuwaiti in Vienna.They find the perfect asset in Kevin \"Red\" Davis. Through his Mormon missionary work in Vienna, Davis is already on a first-name basis with the Kuwaiti.But Davis finds the Kuwaiti to be an enigma and is ultimately taken in by his charm. A bond between the two results. When the moment comes to act, Davis is torn by his many loyalties. Whom does he betray? His friend? His country? His church? Or does he sacrifice all and betray himself?",
