  "title": "Our People",
  "description": "Based on the compelling true story of the famous Elm Creek Raid of 1864. During the Civil War, Comanche and Kiowa Indians staged a massive attack on the scattered settlement near abandoned Ft. Belknap. Hundreds of warriors killed a score of settlers, took women and children captive, burned the entire settlement, and fled westward with a thousand stolen horses to the forbidding Llano Estacado, a huge blank spot on the map where no one but Comanches dared to enter. This is the story of the captives and their long ordeal, and how some were miraculously returned through the determination and courage of a black slave, Britt Johnson, whose wife was among the captives. The aftermath of the deadly raid, and the captives who vanished into the wilderness, echo all the way down to the present day.",
