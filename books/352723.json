  "description": "At fifteen years old, Dylan (born Daphne) Scholinski was committed to a mental institution and awarded the dubious diagnosis of \"Gender Identity Disorder.\" He spent three years—and over a million dollars of insurance—\"treating\" the problem...with makeup lessons and instructions in how to walk like a girl. Dylan's story—which is, sadly, not that unusual—has already received attention from such shows as 20/20, Dateline, Today, and Leeza. But his memoir, bound to become a classic, tells the story in a funny, ironic, unforgettable voice that \"isn't all grim; Scholinski tells [his] story in beautifully evocative prose and mines [his] experiences for every last drop of ironic humor, determined to have the last laugh.\" (Time Out New York)",
