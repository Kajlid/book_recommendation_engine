Mindy Menlove lives in a castle that was transported stone-by-stone from Scotland. But when her fiancé dies in scandal and Mindy decides to sell the gloomy estate, her plans unravel. She must travel to the Hebrides, where she's confronted by the castle's original builder-who happens to be maddeningly irresistible and seven hundred years young. Bran of Barra was a legendary chieftain. Since then he's enjoyed his ghostly pleasures, until Mindy's appearance disrupts them. Now, if the roguish Bran doesn't change Mindy's mind about his bonny homeland-and himself-neither of them will ever find any peace.",
