Mathilda is forced to put her future—as well as a possible company promotion and relocation—on hold. While Mathilda struggles with a life gone off course, her dying mother introduces her to a branch of their family tree in hopes that the past might bring clarity to the present. Can these stories of Mathilda's ancestors give her the strength and courage to welcome a very different future?",
