Essays include. . George Bernard Shaw on the economic basis of socialism, and transitioning to social democracy . Sidney Webb on the history of socialism in England . William Clarke on the capitalist roots of socialism . Sydney Oliver on morality and socialism . Graham Wallas on property, wealth, and debt under socialism . Annie Besant on the workings of industry in a socialist system . Hubert Bland on the future of modern socialism.",
