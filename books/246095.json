  "title": "The Parabola of Discipleship for the Churched and the Unchurched",
  "description": "This is a very interesting account of a discipleship program run through the homeless ministry of a Chicago church. It contains a detailed breakdown of how the course was conceived and executed, how well different aspects of the course went, and suggested changes for future similar courses. It also includes some exercises that could be used in future programs and a pretest and posttest to help quantify the course’s results. This book aims to serve as a workbook for those looking to begin or construct a discipleship course; the material is geared toward urban churches, but the content does not exclude or restrict readership in any way. Content at the end of the workbook is meant for actual classroom use, and the preceding narrative successfully introduces, explains, and supports the workbook’s objectives as well as the discipleship program’s goals. The narrative portion highlights personal experience with teaching students who are homeless, and these real-life examples enhance the validity of the proposed discipleship process.",
