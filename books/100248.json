  "description": "Minutes before the biggest Notre Dame football game in decades, the Fighting Irish campus is sent into shock. A bloodied and bruised young woman stumbles from the bedroom of a Notre Dame priest, collapsing amidst the game day crowd. Police identify her as the wayward daughter of local congressman Michael O’Riordan. On the other side of campus, law student George DeMarco encounters the primary suspect, Father Sean Finnegan, fleeing the university grounds. The alcoholic priest insists that he has been framed. George’s Catholic faith is tested when he agrees to harbor the fugitive, who is an old family friend. This decision throws George into a world of violence and corruption as he races to uncover the truth behind the attack on the congressman’s daughter. The further George digs, the more questions arise. Have the priest’s demons come back to haunt him? Or is he a pawn in a dangerous political game? Was Father Finnegan framed by the congressman’s opponent, Jimmy King, an ambitious kid who will do anything to win? Or was it the congressman’s mistress, Gabriella Silva, a Venezuelan spy whose life depends on the election? Or was Father Finnegan set up by Congressman O’Riordan, a thirty-year incumbent desperate to win back public support at any price? The answer is unveiled on the deadliest Election Day in American history. This thrilling story of faith, family, and how far you would go for a loved one marks the explosive debut for John M. Persinger.",
