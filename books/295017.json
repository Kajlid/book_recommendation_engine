  "title": "The Future of Leadership in the Age of AI: Preparing Your Leadership Skills for the AI-Shaped Future of Work",
  "description": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reality. The Fourth Industrial Revolution, or a Robot Apocalypse depending on whom you ask, is already underway. The transition has already started. But what it means in terms of leadership? How should leaders prepare for the dramatic shifts in the global workforce?The authors, emerging technology risk researchers and practitioners, demystify the processes behind this revolution. Rather than offering another sensationalistic, panic-inducing view on AI – or its overly-optimistic alternative – the authors explain the reality of AI implementation in business environments.The transformed economy will need a new kind of executives – motivators, innovators and social experimenters – those that have, paradoxically, developed their distinctly human skills. The Future of Leadership in the Age of AI clarifies those new roles and makes the transition easier.",
