  "description": "Vin's a hot Goth, tattooed and pierced and the most popular bartender at the Square Peg. Want to date him or buy him a drink? Sorry. Vin's body is a temple and he's barely been kissed. His heart belongs to Riley, the guy he crushed on in high school and can't forget.How about Vin's BFF Patrick? He'd let you buy him a drink and have your wicked way with him in the men's room (shh, don't tell Shane or Ben, the bar owners!) Okay, maybe Vin needs to loosen up and Patrick needs to calm down, but they're set in their ways.Enter Riley, looking for Vin, and suddenly everything changes. Vin's handed a happy ending on a plate and Patrick's free and easy lifestyle loses its glitter as he sees what Vin has.But does Vin really have his dream guy or does he just have Riley? Maybe they're not the same thing, after all.As reality ruins fantasies and divided loyalties make life complicated, choices need to be made by Vin and Patrick, but timing's everything. Speak too soon or wait too longâ€¦either can leave a true happy ending out of reach.(Author note: not a threesome romance or menage.)",
