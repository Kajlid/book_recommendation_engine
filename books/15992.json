  "description": "This deliciously scandalous novel tells us the secrets of the reigning queens of television talk shows, Deanna Reynolds and Angela Perkins.Their high-staked rivalry, fought with public smiles and private betrayals, is more than a ratings competition. It becomes an off-screen war when Deanna replaces Angela both on the air and behind the scenes with Angela's former lover after Angela moves to the big time in New York.Angela's anger at her former protégé escalates from bitterness to vengeance. And an anonymous fan's admiration crosses the line into obsession. Only one woman will emerge with her life in this battle of ego and passion.©2003 Nora Roberts; (P)2008 Brilliance Audio, Inc.",
