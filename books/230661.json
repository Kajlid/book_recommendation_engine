  "title": "The Distant Summer",
  "description": "Kathie was only sixteen that unforgettable English summer of 1943—too young to be involved in her country's desperate struggle against the Germans—too young to fall in love. Then one day she found Johnny—his young-old face framed in a shock of bright blond hair—playing the organ in her village church. And love and terror swept into her life. For Johnny was a rear gunner on a Lancaster bomber. Night after night he flew deep into Germany. One night, like so many of his friends, he would probably not come back.",
