  "description": "In 2305 when stars are considered myths, other planets are being colonized, and alliances are made with other inhabitants of the galaxies. Mallory has been the outcast for as long as she can remember, searching for things she shouldn’t, and knowing more than she should.\t In the world she knows, everyone is after something. \t Some more than others.\t In a search for the truth, she finds more than she bargained for. And as things take a dangerous turn, the lines become blurred, and everyone is on a different side. Leaving her in the middle, as both the target and prize for whatever game she’s been thrust into. There's no way out this time.\t The human girl is alone among humans, lost in her love of stars, and in a race to meet the demands of those who can’t be refused.",
