  "description": "Icelyn was given to the Horde to pay a tithe owed to them by her court. She had no plan of letting them claim her or enter her court. One arrow should have ended it, only it didn’t stop anything. Instead, she’s now prisoner to the broody, cocky, self-absorbed prince that makes her want things she’s never thought possible. Will she be able to resist him and save her court from the horrors that the Horde has planned? Sinjinn had a mission: Get Cailean to the Winter Court to claim his bride. It should have been simple. Instead, he gets taken down by a wisp of a woman who stares at him through the clearest blue eyes he’s ever seen before. The taste of her lips sends his world teetering on devastation. She’s his prisoner, so why shouldn’t he claim her as his? Because she’s his brother’s bride. Because it wasn’t complicated enough, right? One arrow will change the destiny of three lives forever. Will they be able to escape the blood oath, or will he lose her to a brother who doesn’t even want her? New allies are being forged, new enemies emerge, and no one is safe within the realm of Faery anymore. Not a reverse harem, or a love triangle. Can be read as a stand alone",
