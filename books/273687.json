  "description": "Did you know ordinary people can be turned into demons? I sure didn’t. Until it happened to me.One day, I was a regular college student, working a boring job and studying for finals—and the next, I was transformed into some strange creature of the night.Now I’ve got powers I don’t understand, I can change my appearance with a thought, and I’m having all kinds of odd… cravings.If I thought all this was gonna get me out of going to college though, I’ve got another think coming. Nope, I still need an education. Except the classes at Fallen University are on things like “Curses and Hexcraft” and “Magical Combat”.It’s not all bad. There are these four sexy as sin guys I keep bumping into—Kingston, Jayce, Xero, and Kai. I’m not sure if I should trust them; they’ve each got secrets of their own, and they’re definitely dangerous.But that craving I’ve been having?It’s pulling me right toward them.Yup, things are about to get real interesting at FU.This is book one of the Fallen University trilogy, a reverse harem romance with a slightly snarky heroine and four gorgeous, supernatural men. It includes cursing and lots of steam.",
