But when a cunning provocateur arrives in Prague, Eleanora discovers there is an even more deadly game afoot, one that reaches into Amir's past and threatens Lady Penelope's future. Now, the members of the Order must work together if they are to uncover the true enemy hiding in Bohemia. Can they work together despite their divisions? Or will their division lead to even more destruction?
