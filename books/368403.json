  "title": "Gordon Brittas: Sharing The Dream",
  "description": "This book is my manifesto for the 21st Century, a work as important in its own way as Lord Archer's 'Kane and Abel' or Rosemary Conley's 'Hop and Thigh Diet'. It encapsulates my own personal philosophy of life, my way of coping with life's little accidents and disappointments, such as the loss of a job, being shut up in a chicken coop in Bulgaria for two weeks or the complete demolition of one's place of work due to a misunderstanding with an oil tanker.",
