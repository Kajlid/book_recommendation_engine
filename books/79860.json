  "description": "Micki Jacinto is determined to be 'one of the guys.' For years, she has been flying solo in the mostly male dominated world of civil aviation. As owner and operator of a one pilot/one plane scenic flight business in the Florida Keys, Micki is used to dealing with temperamental tourists, hit and miss courier jobs, and her Coast Guard flyboy friends.When a routine USCG training exercise claims the life of one of those friends, Micki can't accept the initial report of 'pilot error.' Neither, it seems, can Luke Hardigan, an outsider with a secret agenda that quickly puts Micki's world into a tailspin.To uncover the truth, Micki must ignore her hard won survivor's instincts and trust Luke. But who is the bigger threat to her very existence--the Bad Guys with the guns, the inclement weather, or Luke Hardigan himself?",
