  "description": "Dr. Jason Longfellow is a bored FDA drug reviewer in the midst of a serious midlife crisis. He has a shiny new convertible he can't fit into, and exasperated wife who thinks he's lost his mind, three daughters who always side with mom, and with a new PI license he fancies himself a modern-day Jessica Fletcher. What could go wrong? Carpooling to work one morning, Jason gets his first case when his attractive brunette passenger erupts into relentless spontaneous orgasms. Intent on clearing himself of any wrongdoing in the eyes of Mrs. Longfellow, Jason stumbles onto a chain of evidence that leads to CureStuff Pharmaceuticals, a clinical drug trial, and a number of improbably good-looking female suspects. Will Jason resist temptations of the flesh, solve the case and prove once and for all that he is at least as smart as his five-year-old? Or will his clever plans get him murdered...by his wife?",
