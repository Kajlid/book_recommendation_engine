  "description": "Legendary rock showman Dave Graney takes us on a journey about growing up, finding your voice and hitting the right pitch. He sets off on a road-trip from small-town Australia, a young man fired up by punk rock, outside of life and looking for a way in. When he loses the map Graney finds his groove, then twists and turns his way through three decades as a working artist (including, ironically, as ‘the king of pop’). When Graney takes the wheel, you don’t know where you’ll end up. Or if you’ll get there safe. He picks up influences, stories and personal mythologies along the way. This is no standard rock ‘n’ roll trip; it’s an education. Listen carefully and he’ll lay some wicked wisdom on you. This is Graney up close, out there and on his game. Turn it up loud. Dave Graney is an ARIA-award winning musician and has recorded more than 20 albums with iconic bands such as the Coral Snakes (Night of the Wolverine is considered an Australian classic). Dave writes columns and articles for various magazines and co-hosts a show on 3RRR radio.",
