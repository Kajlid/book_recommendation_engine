  "description": "“I need to tell you why I so afraid to fall in love with you again. Why from the moment I saw you in the restaurant I tried to deny any feelings I still had for you. Why I pushed you away, why I lied to you that day in the hospital… It all started during the summer break of 2005, exactly sixty days since the last time I had seen you…” He was the Dark Angel. He came and stole what she had desperately tried to hold onto: her heart. Charlie Mason thought she knew better until her insecurities overruled and she again believed he broke her. In a bid to finally find their happily ever after, Lex and Charlie find themselves on a journey of learning how to love again. They began a new future to move forward from a broken past, but life is never so easy. When you finally have the one thing you’ve always wanted, what do you do when that place of darkness finds its way back, shattering everything you fought so hard to have? This is the final story of Lex and Charlie, two souls that were brought back together in a twist of fate. An eternal love that has been through every storm, dragged into the dark abyss without a chance of climbing out, but through all the battles they find themselves in a place they call home, away from the darkness and away from the fear. With a glimmer of hope, they look directly into the light.",
