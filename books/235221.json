  "title": "How to Be a Good Mom:",
  "description": "Despite the presence of \"how-to\" in the title, this is not a self-help book. Rather, it's a humorous account of what I've learned over the years as a mom of three unique children. In my humble opinion, there are five “rules” of Rule #1: Don’t beat yourself up (even when you’re certain you deserve it).Rule #2: Laugh a little (or a lot) (and especially at yourself).Rule #3: Listen to everything (and hold onto the good stuff).Rule #4: Love (even when you don’t like).Rule #5: Give it (all) to God.I certainly don’t think I’m the best mom in the world or even that my motherhood experiences are all that unique. I simply wanted to put this book together to provide some hopefully entertaining anecdotes full of learning and encouragement without arrogance (or even a sense that I have it all figured out).",
