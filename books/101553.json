That first note to San Franciscan Lauren sparks a series of emails that alters the landscape of each girl's summer and raises questions about how two girls who are so different will ever share a dorm room. As the countdown to college begins, life at home becomes increasingly complex. With family relationships and childhood friendships strained by change, it seems the only people Elizabeth and Lauren can rely on are the complicated new boys in their livesand each other.",
