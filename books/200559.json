  "description": "Abandon all hope, ye who enter…Men pledge to Hell Frat for one thing: Power. Those who survive the brutal hazing become the movers and the shakers who conquer the world. But to get to the top they have to start at the bottom, and nothing is lower than quivering before Satan's minion.Ryder loves his job. Not only does he manage to get the best and brightest to sell their souls, but he gets his rocks off in the bargain. When a virgin pledge with the brightest soul he's ever seen kneels before him, Ryder makes a side bet with Satan. In three days, he'll not only thoroughly corrupt the boy, but he'll get his soul in the bargain.Jacob Williams certainly wasn't in Iowa anymore. His first day on campus he had all his possessions stolen and discovered the apartment he'd rented didn't actually exist. If not for Hell Frat letting him pledge, he'd have nothing good going on at all. What he wasn't prepared for was finding himself in the brutal clutches of Hell Frat's Whipmaster—and loving every second.With the clock ticking, Ryder doesn't have time to waste, but if he gets Jacob to sign on the dotted line too soon, he won't have any excuse to keep him as his bitch. Despite Jacob's cluelessness, he's a natural born masochist—the perfect match for Ryder's sadism. Neither of them expected their encounters to cost Ryder everything he had, and demand a stunning sacrifice for love.Warning: This is the uncensored version of Hell Frat. This story contains extreme sexual situations that might shock or offend sensitive readers. Read only if you dare!",
