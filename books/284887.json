  "description": "Powerful men… working together with other powerful, immoral men is the natural order of things.  Halwende Kahn survived his encounter with the Neighbors. Their leader, Llewelyn Wither, killed Kahn’s family and burned his home. When Kahn fled with Sole Kimble to the Lone Star Output on the outskirts of San Antonio, they came under the protection of the only U.S. Army unit still operating in the area. At LOSTOP, he has been living under an assumed name and hiding from his past, trying to forget the horrific things the Neighbors put him through.  Another nearby group, led by the mysterious Burned Woman, is attacked. Patrol leader Jesse Diego’s wife is kidnapped in the raid. He leaves with his team, hunting for his wife and the people who took her.  When the helicopter arrives at LOSTOP, Kahn and others believe salvation has arrived. That is, until the announcement is made and the bodies begin to fall.  JOIN US FRIENDS! JOIN US!  ___________________________________  Paul Z.
