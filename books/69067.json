  "title": "Adventures in Mother-Sitting",
  "description": "For a daughter, at age 61, being called “mommy” by her own mother was a heart-wrenching experience. This happened to the author during the course of a three-year adventure as the at-home caregiver to her mother, much loved yet caught up in a downward spiral of physical, mental and developmentally regressed disabilities.Adventures in Mother-Sitting is not just a chronicle about the dementia-induced antics of an independent, spirited mother as she approaches the time of her death. The book is also about a daughter’s journey through an emotional roller coaster-passage of grief intermixed with surprising sweet instances of joyful connections with not only her child-like mother but, also, the core of her Self. Throughout the book, the author portrays the ways in which the physical and mental needs of an old-age mother and the emotional, spiritual needs of a caregiver daughter lovingly served each other and how the dementia served them both.",
