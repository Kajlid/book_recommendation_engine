Yes she did... \" But worse is when she forget's not to do what she is told not to do. For sometimes that can lead to much more serious trouble....like what happened the day of this story. McClintock's art, that is reminscent of 19th Century children's book art, perfectly compliments Aylesworth's playful, original, and very involving rendition of the classic Three Bears story.",
