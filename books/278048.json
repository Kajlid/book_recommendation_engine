  "description": "Hospitalized for depression over her missing husband, forensic anthropologist Elizabeth MacPherson is pleased to discover that insanity liberates one from polite hypocrisy. Out in the real world, Elizabeth’s brother, Bill, has bought a stately old mansion to use as his law office, only to find that the house comes with a charming codger-in-residence who is far too old to be a dangerous outlaw...isn’t he? Meanwhile, Bill’s law partner is trying to track down the PMS Outlaws—an escaped convict and her fugitive attorney—who are cruising pickup joints and wreaking a peculiar vengeance on lust-crazed men.Sharon McCrumb’s incisive wit and her genius for mirroring everyday life are once again on full display. The PMS Outlaws is an outrageous parable of modern mores—“a story of disparate parts that come together in a most satisfying way.”",
