  "description": "Micah can be an ass, he admits it. But most of the time when he says something stupid it's a backfired attempt at teasing. Micah never pictured himself settling down, there were too many men and women out there to keep him busy hoping from one bed to another. There's only been one man who got under his skin. His brother's best friend. However, a series of misunderstandings and arguments and years of resentment aren’t easy to overcome.  Rylan's mother dumped him on the pack's doorstep when he was a pup after finding out her husband wasn't quite human. It left Rylan with a chip on his shoulder and a need to prove himself. Micah can't help but bite back when Rylan pokes at him, but always assumed that most of the animosity between them was relatively harmless and shrugged it off as just not getting along.  Since being cornered by his little brother and warned to play nice, Micah decides that maybe the past is better left where it is. Only before he can come to terms with his own mistakes and apologize, Rylan is kidnapped and no one knows where to look.  Micah searches until he is ready to collapse from exhaustion. He even challenges his alpha. The pack and coven desperately search for Rylan but when they finally find Rylan after six weeks, it may be too late to save him. Trevor's devious mind and scheming nature isn’t going to be easily outwitted.",
