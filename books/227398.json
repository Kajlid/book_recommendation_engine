  "description": "“Who knew a bad boy could mend a broken heart?\"  What does a girl do after she discovers her fiancé is a cheating bastard?  In my case, I performed the ritual implosion of all scorned women. I drowned my sorrows in cases of white wine, wallowed in gallons of ice cream, and ignited a bonfire to burn away every damn remnant of his existence. Six months later, the only result was a permanent impression of my ass on the couch.  Adventure Dating my friends dared. A new and exciting opportunity they said.  I thought they were crazy, but I’m not one to back down from a challenge, so I signed up for the entire four-week deal. That’s where I saw HIM. Lucas Cummings. He isn’t the classic rich boy I usually end up with. The one whose idea of working up a sweat is waiting for his margarita to be served beachside. Nope. He’s a rough and tough bad boy that all fathers warn their daughters about. You know the type. Cocky swagger, chiseled jaw—the ‘V’.  SOLD, I said to myself, until I discovered he was so much more than just a BOXER.  Left Hook. Right to the heart.  This is a standalone book in The Modern Love World. You do not need to read book one, The Bartender, in order to read The Boxer. Note: Previously title \"The Boxer\". Same great book with a fresh new look!",
