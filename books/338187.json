  "description": "When she was twelve years old Mindy was sent to boarding school on another planet. Years later she returned to earth and ultimately obtained a mechanical engineering position with the super Elite Hands of Justice. Over time her mechanical brilliance has led her to be called TEKGRRL. Almost thirty, she has recently suffered from headaches, bursts of recovered memories including a trip on a flying saucer, and the sudden appearance of telekinetic skills, something she never displayed in her three decades of living. She conceals her fears of a voice inside her head while her former teammate who is now the new Secretary for Superhero Affairs, Simon Leasure, claims EHJ is a vigilante criminal unit.",
