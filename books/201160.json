  "description": "Samantha Moon and Kingsley Fulcrum set their sites on a romantic weekend getaway to Big Bear, California, only to find themselves on the hunt for a runaway boy. With darkness descending and the temperature dropping—and one little boy alone in the wilderness—Samantha Moon decides to call in the cavalry. Or, as Jim Knighthorse likes to say, the \"big guns.\" Now with Spinoza, Aaron King, Detective Sherbet, Allison, and, of course, Knighthorse joining the search, Samantha Moon will put her weekend of romance on hold to find the missing boy...no matter the costs.",
