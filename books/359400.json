Yalow. Discover what drove them and marvel at the brilliance of their contributions.Encounter great ideas - including the doctor-patient relationship, the germ theory of disease, vaccination, immunology, genetics, preventive medicine, stem cells, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis and treatment - and learn about the art, science, and significance of these ideas.Within the context of discovery and compassion at the heart of every medical advance, Medical Marvels considers the powerful forces controlling both the science and distribution of healthcare. By reading this absorbing and important book, everyone interested in good healthcare will gain a new appreciation for the achievements, the roadblocks that have been overcome and those still looming, as well as the great promise medicine holds for the future.Healthcare is among the most significant issues of our time, and it will be more so in the future. If you want a powerful and accurate lens to understand the history of medicine as well as the societal and scientific challenges it is facing now and in the future - then Medical Marvels is for you.",
