  "description": "CID assumes they have a copycat killer after the murder and scalping of a teenage girl. Twenty years earlier, vigilante father Marvin Appleby gunned down the prime suspect, Travis Dexter. Rock star Oswald Poe leaks a story so incredible, involving reincarnation and naming Appleby as the original serial killer. Unexplained Publications, involved with strange phenomena, decide to publish Poe's account. Coincidentally, they show interest in another tale of reincarnation concerning a fourteen-year old boy who claims he was abused and murdered for his artwork by his uncle. A complex tale of murder and reincarnation will keep you guessing until the final pages.",
