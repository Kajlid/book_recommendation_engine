  "title": "A Glastonbury Romance",
  "description": "First published in 1932, here is John Cowper Powys's masterwork, an epic novel of terrific cumulative force and lyrical intensity. In it he interweaves the ancient with the modern as he probes the mystical and spiritual ethos of the small English village of Glastonbury and the effect upon its inhabitants of a mystical tradition from the most remote past of human history - the legend of the Grail - to create a book of astonishing scope and beauty. Panoramic in design, charged with scenes of great vividness and informed by Powys's own towering genius, A Glastonbury Romance is still astounding readers.",
