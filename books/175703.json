He can't wait until the day he can get out of the small, sleepy town he feels trapped in. Working at the local bar is only a means to an end.  Enter Hailey Dawson, the feisty firecracker that has the unfortunate privilege of working side by side with Kellan nearly every day. Desperately needing the money to pay for her mother's medical bills, Hailey encounters Kellan's arrogant torment on a regular basis, but it seems Kellan may have met his match when Hailey goes head to head with him.  As the heat rises to a fever pitch between the couple, can Kellan's icy exterior be cracked, or will Hailey end up too close to the fire?  *This book is for adults 18 and up *Mature content, language and explicit sexual scenes",
