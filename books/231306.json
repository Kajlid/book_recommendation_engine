  "description": "The Willows live on an old farm that also houses a ramshackle trailer park. Over the years Griffin Willos, the volatile head of the family, has cowed his wife Grace into near-silent submission; as for their five children, one way or another they have learned to live amidst the dust, the heat, the madness.But when trusting young Oliver befriends an outsider, an artist intent on discovering the family's secrets, the Willows' world inextricably falls apartâ€”in a harrowing implosion of lies, loyalty, and violence. At once shocking and sad, Sleeping Dogs evokes the twisted, often savage worlds of William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor; it is a story that will linger in readers' mind, long after they have closed the book itself.",
