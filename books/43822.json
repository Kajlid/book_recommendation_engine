But when her childhood friend goes missing, she returns to her hometown of Nighthawk, Washington to unofficially investigate the mysterious disappearance.

The animals and townsfolk behave oddly. Fleeting shadows haunt her hotel room. And there is the crow with the single white feather that seems to follow her everywhere… All of the signs point her to the town’s old mine, left abandoned from the pioneer age. As a child, she believed monsters lurked in the black tunnels, but she is too old to believe in monsters now. What she stumbles upon in her attempt to save her friend changes her perception of the world around her forever.",
