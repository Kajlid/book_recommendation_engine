  "description": "John Broden has worked for the Michigan State Police for nearly a dozen years. When women start disappearing from his small community, he seeks the resources and assistance of the FBI. Broden and Special Agent Alex Darby are then thrust into their worst nightmare; a serial killer who leaves the next body faster than the investigators can process the evidence from the previous one. Add in the fact that the killer is clearly trying to turn each victim into some unknown woman, and Broden and Darby definitely have their work cut out for them. They both know the key to solving the murders will be determining the identity of the mystery woman. When they stumble into the middle of what appears to be an unrelated case, they find their key. Kelly Jo Carter is, without a doubt, the object of a killer's twisted obsession. She is also a woman with a severe, yet well placed, mistrust of law enforcement. As Kelly lays out a story of corruption and betrayal, of brutality and abuse, it is almost more than the lawmen can believe. They are determined to bring this madman down, and now they have their bait. Kelly Jo Carter.",
