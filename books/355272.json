  "description": "Dear Tracey, I don't know why I'm answering your ad, to be honest. It's not like I'm into pen pals, but it's a boring Sunday here, wet, everyone's out, and I thought it'd be something different... Dear Mandy, Thanks for writing. You write so well, much better than me. I put the ad in for a joke, like a dare, and yours was the only good answer... Two girls begin a friendship—two strangers exchanging letters, getting to know each other a little better every time they write. Sometimes writing's easier than talking. Secrets and fears seem safer on paper. And both girls have plenty of each—fears they hardly dare to confront; secrets that could blow their lives apart... 'In a word, unforgettable.' —Robert Cormier",
