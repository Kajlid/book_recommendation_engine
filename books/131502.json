  "title": "Dumping Princes",
  "description": "Set in England’s exclusive all girl’s boarding school, St Augustine’s & the nearby boys boarding school of Eades in Royal Berkshire. Everyone is titled (the Horrible Hon.’s) or rich. Based on St Mary’s Ascot, & Eton College where both Prince Harry & William were educated. These books are like being let in on the sensational secret life of Britain's aristocracy. After four years as the school misfit, Calypso Kelly has finally thrown off her label of American Freak and joined the in-crowd: the daughters and sons of British and Europe's Royals & Rock Stars. In a mad world of dorm raids, midnight feasts and escapes to Pullers Woods that separates the two schools, the stakes are high. But while her friends spend their time posting YouTube clips and manipulating the media with social networking, Calypso has won the national fencing trails and managed to pull Prince Freddie himself. When HRH (Freds) does the unthinkable and breaks up with Calypso, it sets in motion a school-wide plan for a Royal Counter Dump. Can Calypso win Freddie back just to break his heart? All is fair in love and war . . . except, of course, if you’re in love with a prince. “Funny exposé of It-girlschool life.” ELLE GIRL UK “Briget Jones for the early teen set.”- WASHINGTON POST USA “Budding Anglophiles ….will soak up the flood of upper-class British culture in this book.
