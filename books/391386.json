  "description": "Beginning the complete library of the greatest science fiction hero of all time.Volume One will spotlight the work of Alex Raymond, legendary for some of the finest storytelling of the 20th century. Raymond illustrated the Sunday strips until 1944; with his clear and much-imitated style forming the original aesthetic of the most popular and easily recognised science fiction hero for decades to come.Introducing Flash Gordon, Dale Arden, Dr. Hans Zarkov, and Ming the Merciless, this volume will catapult readers to the deadly planet Mongo.These are the strips that influenced George Lucas to create Star Wars, and which illustrator Al Williamson said were \"the reason I became an artist.\"",
