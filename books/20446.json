  "description": "The head cheerleader hooking up with the star quarterback? Totally normal.But accidentally bedding and giving her v-card to his brother , the school’s newest, hottest professor?Yeah, not so normal, and all sorts of scandalous.Oh, and that’s before they decide to “ share ”…Cheerleading captain, social royalty, daughter of a senator, and maybe a bit of bitch? As the reigning queen bee of Winchester Academy, it makes sense that I might hook up with Beckett Truman—the gorgeous, cocky, king-of-the-school star varsity quarterback. I mean that Hollywood script writes itself.But a party dare gone wrong turns into something hotter than I’ve ever imagined when I accidentally give my v-card to his brother , Porter.…As in, possessive, dominant, and totally hot Professor Truman , my new freaking math Professor . Eight years my senior, completely off-limits, and utterly irresistible.I know I should be horrified, or mortified. But it’s a little hard to feel anything but bliss when this Queen finds herself in the arms of not one, but two kings. Because Porter and Beckett want to share …I slept with the wrong brother, and it just might be the hottest mistake of my life.Each of the Winchester Academy books are completely standalone stories, with no cliffhangers.Hot, wild, and insta-love galore, with TWO utterly obsessed alpha heroes and an untouched, very, very off-limits heroine. If you love over-the-top, slightly unrealistic, and wildly dirty stories, this one’s for you!This mfm romance is all about her – no m/m. As with all my books, this steamy novella is safe, with no cheating, and a HEA guaranteed.",
