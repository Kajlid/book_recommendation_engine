  "description": "Tilda Lanai does not have great timing. For three grueling years she has honed the skills of a Guilder in the service of an Island Trade House, skills ranging from business to burglary. Now the sudden death of her House Lord threatens to unravel all of Tildaâ€™s plans. The search for an exiled heir takes Tilda across a war-torn continent and to the gates of the Sable City, where centuries ago dark magic almost destroyed the world. Along with a sinister sorceress, a broken-hearted samurai, and a miscreant mercenary long on charm but lousy with a crossbow, Tilda must brave the demon-infested ruins to find the heir who may save her House. Only then can she return home to the life she thought she wanted.",
