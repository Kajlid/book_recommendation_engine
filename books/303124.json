  "description": "Power is safety. But power has a price. How much will you pay?From a shy young courtesan, Luken has risen beyond all expectations to become one of the most successful men of the Peacock Court. Now he's presented with the ultimate opportunity: Luken has caught the attention of the Empress herself. As Luken rises in Empress Raisaga's esteem, all the privilege and influence the Court has to offer falls into his lap - if he's willing to forsake his secret lover, the servant Jes, and play the part of the Empress's pet. Luken has never cared about the frivolities of Court, but his influence over the Empress may be the only political power a man can wield in the matriarchal Empire of Kanai. Divided by jealousies, responsibilities, and the contortions of fate, Luken's friends pull away one by one, and the young courtesan finds himself alone with the promise of power as the life he dreamed of with Jes begins to slip through his fingers. Now Luken must choose between that secret life, and the chance to become the Empress's Consort - and the most powerful man in the world.",
