  "description": "It’s a dog eat dog world for Ava Martinez. On the surface her life seems charmed – beauty, brains, a successful veterinary practice – but Ava harbors a secret. And one rash act on a foggy night threatens to destroy it all. The niece of one of the most ruthless crime lords in the country, Ava has lived her life as an unwilling pawn in her uncle’s illegal game. When Ava accidentally stumbles upon an unknown man lying unconscious in the trunk of a car – a man destined for death at the hands of her uncle’s men – she risks her life to get him to safety and to thwart her uncle’s nefarious scheme. Little does she know that lifting the lid of that trunk will be like opening Pandora’s box. When Assistant District Attorney Jordan Wellington – the man she rescued – brings his dog to the door of her veterinary clinic, she does her best to thwart his amorous intentions, but fate has a different idea. When a walk in the park, a friend’s blind date, seemingly everything throws them together, the normally strong-willed Ava finds herself irrevocably drawn into a seductive and deadly game. Because if Jordan ever regains his memory of that night, both of their lives could be in danger.",
