Nutritional Medicine is a comprehensive textbook on the use of dietary modifications, nutritional supplements, and other natural substances for the prevention and treatment of more than 400 health conditions. Written by one of the world's foremost authorities on nutritional therapy, this book has been widely acclaimed as the leading textbook in its field. Meticulously documented and clearly written, Nutritional Medicine combines an exhaustive review of the medical literature with Dr. Gaby's extensive clinical experience. While written for healthcare practitioners, Nutritional Medicine is also a valuable reference book for educated laypeople who are interested in viable alternatives to conventional medicine. \"A landmark, a milestone in the history of 21st century medicine.\" - Jonathan V. Wright, M.D. \"I recommend that Nutritional Medicine be on the desk of every healthcare practitioner.\" - William Manahan, M.D. \"A formidable display of medical scholarship . . . .
