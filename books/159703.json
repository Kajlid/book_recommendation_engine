  "title": "The Uncrowned Kings of England: The Black Legend of the Dudleys",
  "description": "The Dudley Family retained its position at the centre of court and council throughout the political ferment of the Tudor century. Three of them died on the executioner's block and the black legend of their ruthless charm made them objects of hatred and fear. But the family helped establish the financial basis of the Tudor dynasty, led its armies to victory, and ruled in its name. More than once they almost seized the greatest prize of all--the crown itself.",
