  "title": "Coronation of Glory: The Story of Lady Jane Grey",
  "description": "Jane Grey was never allowed to forget that she was a Tudor, fifth in the royal line of succession after King Henry VIII. To Jane, this knowledge was a shadow across the peaceful days in her beloved valley home in the north of England.The threat was a distant one until Henry died and Jane's cousin Edward took his place. People began to whisper of a match between Jane and Edward; child marriages were common, and her parents were ambitious for money and power.When Edward become ill, Jane was thrust - at age sixteen - into the political arena, a pawn between violent and greedy men and a cruel mother would make her queen.Set against sixteenth century court intrigues, political and social unrest, and the backdrop of the Reformation, this is tha fascinating story of a young girl's struggle to find and do the will of God, even in the face of those who would manipulate her for their own ends.The bittersweet love story of Jane and Edward Seymour and the romance of Queen Catherine Parr and the charming Lord Thomas are just two of the many compelling subplots in this rich narrative.Coronation of Glory is story telling at its best, clearly demonstrating that the person who has a \"why\" to live for can bear with almost any \"how.\"",
