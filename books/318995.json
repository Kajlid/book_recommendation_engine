Racing against the Fallow Throes' ticking clock, he endeavors to repair his relationship with Prince Finley and fight off the gathering shadows in his head, as the base around him prepares for war.Half a continent away, his sister Rora is doing everything she can to reawaken the land and end Eradain's slaughter of magical beings. Still reeling from the revelation that Eradain's violent monarch is her half-brother, she journeys to the kingdom determined to infiltrate his court in disguise--and finds the seeds of rebellion are already stirring.With a magical illness running rampant and the continent arming for battle, the three realms' long-feared destruction seems inevitable. But the two shifters they believed would bring about Alemara's ruin may in fact hold the key to its survival.",
