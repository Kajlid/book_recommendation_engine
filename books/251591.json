  "description": "Each day that is blessed to us, some black woman, have also been killed or mistreated by police or by another black person. Black women around the world have always organized against injustices, and as time becomes more violent and unequal, black women continue to be the first to stand up for righteousness. It is shameful after generations and comprehensive progress in civil and human rights, that black women lives are still not valued or respected. Today, we have the #METOO movement, however, black women have been violated and disrespected for years, and when white women stand up, that is when women, in general, receive attention for their violations. This is a respective reminder, that black women lives matter, so take notice, as black women show other women how to rise up from mistreatment.
