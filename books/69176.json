  "description": "Ewan's application to the Hammer Club has hit a snag. For some reason, Master Oliver has asked him to train alongside another Top before having his membership approved. Ewan's not sure where he screwed up, but he figures he must have done something wrong for Oliver to have taken this step.Randy is the Top assigned to work with Ewan. Easy going and unattached, Randy is happy to work with Ewan, even more so when he meets the man and is instantly attracted. That attraction only deepens as the two men work together and find themselves deeply compatible in the bedroom, and in life.What happens when Randy expresses his belief that Ewan is a sub, and not just any sub, but Randy's sub? Can Ewan find it in himself to give Randy what the man wants, and what he himself needs?",
