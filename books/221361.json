  "description": "The ancient prophecy speaks of the five, those who will come to save all of dragonkind. Like most prophecies, it leaves out a lot of the important details… Sapphire is a very ordinary elf girl who runs for the hills—and gets lost in a forest instead. The same forest where a dragon egg perches high in a tree on a dark winter’s night. This is the story of what happens when egg meets girl.  Dragon Sapphire & Lotus is book one of a fantasy series for readers who love dragons, ordinary heroes, and bravery that has to be earned one day at a time. A note from  I tell stories of hope, resilience, belonging, and finding what (and who!) matters. I do that in a lot of different genres, but you’ll always get those things in an Audrey Faye book. :)",
