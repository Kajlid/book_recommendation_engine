  "description": "What would you do for one million dollars? Better yet, what would you not do? My name is Ella Taylor and I had to answer that question. I signed the contract. I agree not to ask questions. And I thought it would only be a tryst between me, Tobias, and Preston--the two billionaires who now owned me for seven days.
