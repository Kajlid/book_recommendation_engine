  "description": "A psychic detective. An alpha werewolf. A forbidden love that could tear the pack apart.Detective Macey Carpenter has been on the trail of a vicious attacker for weeks, with nothing more than a vague description of a red-eyed man to go on. Finding love is the least of her worries, but she can't deny her attraction to a mysterious man who knows more about the case than he should. Before Luke Mason can become alpha of the Crescent City Wolf Pack, he has to end the French Quarter’s demon infestation and keep the police from discovering the truth. But when he falls head over tail for the feisty human detective investigating the crimes, supernatural secrets aren’t the only things at stake. Luke has to mate with another werewolf or he’ll sacrifice his position as alpha. But as heat builds between the pair, he discovers Macey has a few secrets of her own. And even though she may hold the key to ridding New Orleans of its demons, his feelings for her could tear his pack apart.",
