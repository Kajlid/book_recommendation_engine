  "description": "Death calls, I answer.Quite literally.Every time I close my eyes, I see those who are about to die,And I’m unable to do anything to stop it.Until one day, when I try to save yet another victim, something inside of me just…flips.The shadows rise, and they’re hungry.All I ever wanted was to be normal,Instead, I found out just how different I am.I must learn to control my powers, to take charge of my life.Because if not? Well, there are angels out there hunting me.I’m told demons are safe, demons won’t care about what I am.But if an angel ever finds out…. They’ll kill me on sight.They think I’m a monster, something forbidden.They can never know the truth.When I stumble upon a group of men at a club, two demons and an angel, I don’t know what to do.I should run, but something about them calls to me.Something deliciously wicked.Something I want to explore.But giving into temptation might just bring my downfall.Author's note: Darker Shade is the first book in a series of stand-alone books where the main character will not have to choose between her men. Due to mature content, it should not be read by anyone under the age of 18. Content warning: This book contains cursing, violence, and sexy times between multiple people, including people of the same sex. It's a darkish book that explores the thematic of death, so if that makes you uncomfortable, please skip this book. I promise there will be other, lighter books in the future.",
