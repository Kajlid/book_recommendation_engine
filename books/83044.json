  "title": "Dahlia",
  "description": "Dahlia is an introvert, hides away from others, and prefers her own company. With no recollection of her life before the age of five, the majority of her days spent in and out of orphanages, and being thrown away by foster parents who no longer want her because she's strange, she's had reason to be. Fast-forward and Dahlia is living with a foster family that appears to actually want her. Things are finally normal. But that is short-lived when her past catches up with her: forgotten memories return via dreams, her new mind reading abilities, and a strange thirst for ... blood? Now with the appearance of a mysterious guy who she can't take her mind off of, and suddenly number one on a supernatural hit list, she realizes everything that's been going on in her life is nothing compared to the fact that she's not even human. Dahlia, Book 1 in the BLOOD CRAVE SERIES.",
