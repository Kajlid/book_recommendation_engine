  "description": "Retired Marine Viper helo pilot and ground cover expert, Kacey O’Donnell is called out of retirement for a special assignment: to assist in extracting the kidnapped daughter of a U.S. Senator, after an FBI team is betrayed and taken out. Former SEAL hero Nathan Weatherly looks forward to his new job as Deputy Sheriff in the small, quiet Normal Rockwell town where Kacey grew up. The former lovers have a history she has no desire to revisit, and a dark secret she refuses to share. With a young girl’s life at stake, Kacey helps pull Nathan’s team together for one last assignment. But, she finds it next to impossible to work with Nathan again—especially when she knows he wants so much more, and she has so much to hide.",
