  "description": "When Blake Hemsworth's deadbeat father takes it one step too far, the troubled twenty-year-old couldn't begin to think of how to get him back, this time. But coming home to a house empty except her stepbrother – the sweet son of her father's new, oblivious wife – gives her an idea of catastrophic proportions. Blake's road to revenge will take her much closer to this young man, hated by her father, than she'd ever thought she could before.",
