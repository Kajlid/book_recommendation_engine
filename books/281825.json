  "description": "Coming on the threshold of what promises to be the most acrimonious presidential election in American history, Diamond and Silk’s book will be a rallying cry for tens of millions of Americans who are tired of being told what to think and whom to vote for. Diamond and Silk’s story is one of overcoming poverty and shame and choosing victory over victimhood. Theirs is a story that defies the left’s narrative and that the mainstream media refuses to acknowledge, accept, and respect.",
