  "description": "In 2000, Pope John Paul II canonized the great 20th century visionary of Divine Mercy, Sister Faustina Kowalska, and proclaimed the Sunday after Easter to be celebrated annually as Divine Mercy Sunday. In 2006, Pope Benedict stressed that \"Divine Mercy is not a secondary devotion, but an integral dimension of Christian faith and prayer.\" Now Pope Francis has proclaimed an extraordinary Jubilee Year of Mercy , which will begin on December 8, 2015. These three Popes have made it very clear that Divine Mercy is a major part of the Christian faith, and now this powerful new book reveals why. Best-selling author Vinny Flynn continues his popular \"7 Secrets\" series with a book that brings him back to his roots. Vinny was one of the original editors of the official English edition of the actual Diary of St. Faustina , and he has written and edited a vast number of the Divine Mercy materials that are used today. Through his \"secrets\" of Divine Mercy, Vinny shows how Divine Mercy is not just another worthy \"private devotion\"; it is the key devotion, the umbrella devotion over everything else. Every other devotion in the Church, every ritual, every activity, every teaching is under that umbrella of Divine Mercy. It’s all there to help us understand and enter into Divine Mercy. He shows us how everything in our lives can become more meaningful, more powerful, more life-changing once we really embrace the gift of Divine Mercy ― the overflow of love from the Holy Trinity. In this compelling and timely book, Flynn draws from Scripture, the teachings of the Church, and the Diary of St. Faustina to not only reveal the heart of Divine Mercy, but to offer you an invitation and a road map so that this mercy can transform your life. If you're not yet convinced of the impact Divine Mercy can have on your life, if you've never heard of this message and devotion, or if you're curious to learn more about it, this book is perfect for you. It shows us all how to respond to the call of Pope Francis \"to live lives shaped by mercy\", and benefit greatly from the \"Year of Mercy\".",
