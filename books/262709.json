  "title": "You Are Here: Discovering the Magic of the Present Moment",
  "description": "Simple daily practices to help us discover the happiness and freedom of living in the present moment—from the renowned Buddhist monk and best-selling author.Most of Thich Nhat Hanh’s previous books have either provided an overview of the Buddhist path or offered guidance on specific problem areas in our lives, such as love, anger, power, or death. This new book focuses on Buddhist techniques and practices we can use to cut through the busyness and anxieties of daily life and discover the simple happi­ness of living in the present moment. In our daily lives we are often lost in thought. We lose ourselves in our plans, in our anger, in our worries. The practice of mindfulness frees us from these obsessions, landing us firmly in the present moment–the only moment in which we can be truly alive and truly happy. You Are Here offers a range of mindfulness practices that will help us to root ourselves in the present–“the address of the Buddha,” as he calls it–where we can experience the joys and magic of being alive, under any circumstances. Practices include: mindfulness of breath, mindful walking, deep listening, and mindful speech, as well as practices for healing emotional pain and cultivating love for oneself and others. With his characteristic warmth, gentleness, and simplicity, Thich Nhat Hanh offers teachings and practices that anyone can use to help them to live more fully and freely.",
