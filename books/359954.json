  "description": "This powerful collection of short stories of the supernatural combines L.T.C. Rolt's writing talent with his unparalleled knowledge of Britain's industrial heritage to produce tales of real mystery and imagination. This haunting anthology takes the reader on a journey from Cornwall to Wales and from the hill country of Shropshire to the west coast of Ireland. \"The House of Vengeance\", set in the Black Mountains of South Wales, tells what happens when a walker becomes lost and disorientated as the mist falls, while in \"The Gartside Fell Disaster\" an old railwayman recounts the terrible night when the Mountaineer came to grief. Alongside these are twelve other tales of elemental fears and strange and inexplicable happenings. First published in 1948, this enduring collection will appeal to all those who, like Tom Rolt, are passionate about the backdrop of our industrial landscape, but will also delight and terrify anyone who loves a good, old-fashioned ghost story.",
