Sleep is not his idea of fun, so Grandpa makes sure that the sleep is over before it has even begun.A funny, fun, action-filled adventure that grandparents and grandchildren will immediately identify with and enjoy reading together.\"The Sleepover totally encourages the participation of the kids you are reading the book to and it is a lot of fun. Enjoyed by children and grandparents alike, it brings the generations closer together. I wish Lynda had been my Grandma.\"– Jack Canfield, co-creator of the Chicken Soup For the Soul series",
