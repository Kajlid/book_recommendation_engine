  "description": "For Vân Uoc Phan, fantasies fall into two categories: nourishing, or pointless. Daydreaming about Billy Gardiner, for example? Pointless. It always left her feeling sick, as though she'd eaten too much sugar.Vân Uoc doesn't believe in fairies, zombies, vampires, Father Christmas - or magic wishes. She believes in keeping a low profile: real life will start when school finishes.But when she attracts the attention of Billy Gardiner, she finds herself in an unwelcome spotlight.Not even Jane Eyre can help her now.Wishes were not a thing.They were not.Correction.Wishes were a thing.Wishes that came true were sometimes a thing.Wishes that came true because of magic were not a thing!Were they?",
