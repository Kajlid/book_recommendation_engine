  "description": "A Maid, a Prince, and a Duke. A Gardener, a Stepmother, and a secret...  Ellie Abbington, a beautiful yet unassuming young woman, quietly longs for her life to change. Too privileged to associate with the servantsâ€”too underprivileged to associate with her own family; she dreams a dream of a prince and a happily ever after.  But it could be that her own stepsisters, conniving Dezmarie and easily-influenced Adelaide, are dreaming the same dream...of the same prince.  In the end, are dreams even all they're made out to be? Especially with deep and long-hidden secrets about to be unearthed?  A Dream Not Imagined is a non-magical fairytale novella based loosely on the classic tale of Cinderella.",
