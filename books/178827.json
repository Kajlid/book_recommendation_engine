  "description": "Kate Beck once was a nationally recognized figure skater. Eight years ago, on the brink of being one of the top three skaters in the United States, her dreams came crashing down at the hands of her coach and her mother. She walked away and has hidden from her mother ever since. Moving from place to place, she gets off a bus in Canon City, finds a job and settles in for the winter. She's been lonely and dreams that one day she'll meet a man, have a family and be able to stay in one place. It's been eight years of running. She hopes her mother has given up the search for her. Jay Hager grew up in Canon City. He once was an ice hockey player who got picked up by the NHL and played briefly for a junior team. At nineteen years of age, he blew his knee out and his career was at an end. He returned to Canon and bought a dilapidated skating rink. His business has done very well. He notices a beautiful strawberry blonde sits every weekend in the bleachers at the rink and she watches the skating classes and his pee-wee hockey team practice. He would like to get to know her, but finds a mystery around her.  Will Kate stay long enough to find love or let her past fears overwhelm all the good emotions she feels for Jay? Will her mother find her and tear her new world apart?",
