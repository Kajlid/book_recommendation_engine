  "description": "David Clerson's first novel won the Grand prix litteraire Archambault 2014. It is an original piece of fiction, steeped in myth and fable, a reflection of our own familiar surroundings in a distorting mirror.This world of \"monstrous creatures, bigger than anything they could imagine, two-headed fish, turtles with shells as huge as islands, whales with mouths big enough to swallow up whole cities\" is seen through the eyes of two brothers, the elder brother missing an arm, the younger fashioned by his mother from that arm.\"",
