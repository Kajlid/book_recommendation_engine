  "title": "Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fiction: Environment and Affect",
  "description": "This work of literary criticism argues for the importance of “ecosickness fiction” to contemporary literature. Ecosickness fiction imaginatively rethinks the link between ecological and bodily endangerment and uses affect and the sick body to bring readers to environmental consciousness. The book traces the development of this narrative mode through a compelling archive of recent U.S. novels and memoirs by David Foster Wallace, Richard Powers, Leslie Marmon Silko, Marge Piercy, Jan Zita Grover, and David Wojnarowicz. Heather Houser shows how these authors unite experiences of environmental and bodily injury through narrative affects that draw attention to ecological phenomena, organize perception, and convert knowledge into ethics. Traversing contemporary cultural studies, ecocriticism, affect studies, and literature and medicine, the book juxtaposes ecosickness fiction against new forms of environmentalism and technological innovation. Ecosickness in Contemporary U.S. Fiction recasts recent narrative as a laboratory in which affective and perceptual changes both support and challenge political projects.",
