  "description": "It was 2.47am when Chief Inspector Alan Banks arrived at the barn and saw the body of Keith Rothwell for the first time.Only hours earlier two masked men had walked the mild-mannered accountant out of his farmhouse and blasted him with a shotgun. It was clinical. Clearly this is a professional hit but Keith Rothwell was hardly the sort of person to make deadly enemies. Or was he?The investigation soon raises more questions than answers. The name Robert Calvert comes up. Who exactly is he? The more Banks scratches the surface, the more he wonders what lies beneath the veneer of the apparently happy Rothwell family. When his old sparring partner, Detective Superintendent Richard Burgess, arrives from Scotland Yard, the case takes yet another unexpected twist...\"The novels of Peter Robinson are chilling, evocative, deeply nuanced works of art,\" notes Dennis Lehane. \"Peter Robinson's cast of characters is vividly drawn. Well written...highly entertaining,\" adds 'Scotland on Sunday.'Librarian's note: this novel has two different titles, 'Dry Bones that Dream,' and for North America, 'Final Account.'",
