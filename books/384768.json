  "description": "When a man chooses his rebirth, will the mother he selects be able to forgive him? \"My death in '59 came the way I always feared it would: in the claustrophobic underground heat of a Cape Breton coal mine.\"So begins Luke MacIsaac's tale of restless afterlife. His life after death is nowhere near what he thought it would be; instead of peace, he finds an unending roll on a sea of memory that stores his entire violent past. Images of war, childhood abuse, and the tortured life of a brother he loved and failed threaten to inundate him.One possible salvation presents itself: rebirth. The problem is that this newborn girl he selects to be his mother will in her own turn live through tragedies that threaten her soul's well being. Astrid embroils herself in an affair with an older man and feeds her shame with bouts of self injury while she seeks out love and acceptance from her mother, father, and ultimately, the gay youth she betrays.What Luke doesn't realize, and what Astrid cannot know, is that their souls are linked through a past life too painful for either to remember. For Luke to live again, he must experience all the anguish they went through together. And for Astrid to find peace, she must discover unconditional love.From tragedy and loss, ONE INSULAR TAHITI is a coming of age literary novel about reincarnation and past lives from a Canadian author that demonstrates how sometimes the greatest light can come from the deepest darkness.",
