  "description": "Juliet is an author with a deadline. A big deadline…and a ratty old backpack, and she’s on her way to Belgium. Mia has a one-way, first class ticket to anywhere. Today anywhere happens to be Scotland. The one thing she knows is that money can’t buy happiness, and she has no idea what does. A chance meeting in an airport lounge and a shared flight itinerary leaves Juliet and Mia connected. They’ve known each other for only twenty-four hours and they are destined for separate countries. How do you forge a future when the past keeps pulling you back?",
