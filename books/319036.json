  "description": "It's 2013, and twenty-three-year-old Brooklyn barista Molly Diamond has just locked eyes with Jake Danner, the front man of an up-and-coming Southern rock band. It's not long before Molly and Jake fall deeply in love, inspiring each other's writing and planning for a life together filled with creativity, passion, and adventure.But nearly a decade later, Molly is teaching yoga and living in the posh Connecticut suburb of Flynn Cove with her young daughter and husband Hunter--who is decidedly not Jake Danner. Molly is lonely in picture-perfect Flynn Cove--until Sabrina walks into her studio. A newcomer in town, Sabrina has her own reasons for seeking out Molly, and their blossoming friendship will set both women on a collision course of deep-rooted secrets, lies, and manipulation.Meanwhile, a new version of Jake's hit song is on the radio, forcing Molly to confront her past and ask the ultimate questions: What happens when life turns out nothing like we thought it would, when we were young and dreaming big? Does growing up mean choosing with your head, rather than your heart? And do we ever truly get over our first love?",
