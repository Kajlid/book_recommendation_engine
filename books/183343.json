Dragons love ice cream come rain or come shine. They dream about ice cream all of the time. At home or at school or out on the town Visions of ice cream are floating around.\" Dragons Love Ice Cream is a super fun rhyming book that is perfect for kids that are into Dragons or Dinosaurs. We already know that Dragons Love Tacos, and now we find out that they love ice cream too! The book contains many teachable moments such as basic counting and color identification, but is mainly just for pure entertainment. There are plenty of kids' books out there that talk about eating your vegetables, but 'Dragons Love Ice Cream' just celebrates the pure joy of the wonderful ice cream cone from the perspective of these adorable Dragons without any preachy hidden agendas. We hope you enjoy this book as much as we enjoyed writing it!",
