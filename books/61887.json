  "title": "Mona Loves Monsters 2, Werewolf Sex Curse",
  "description": "Mona finds herself in a cemetery without any memory of how she got there or what's going on. A creepy gravedigger takes her inside to let her call someone to come and get her, but instead introduces her to his red-eyed nephew, Lucas, who has no intention of helping Mona find her way home.***Mona's fantasy of being ravished by monsters was fulfilled one Halloween, thanks to costumes and her membership in The Club, a sex fantasy organization. Mona's fantasy is about to come true again, though this time The Club isn't involved.Her dreams about being taken by a werewolf weren't just fantasies, but warnings of what's to come.This time the monster is real, and there is no escape.This erotic novella is approximately 14,500 words long and is intended for adults only. Rape fantasies and rape are very different things. This story in no way condones actual violent rape.",
