  "description": "I love him, and it’s killing me…  I never thought this would happen, but here I am—a willing captive to the most sinfully-handsome serial killer the world has ever seen. I belong to him now, the man who is both my savior and my downfall. The man who will probably destroy me one day, just like he’s destroyed so many others before me.  If I want to live, I have to be a good girl. Follow the rules. Never try to run again.  My purpose is to serve him and please him, be his dirty little secret, and I’m ashamed to say I chose this. I wanted this. But not forever. Part of me hasn’t crumbled, and that part of me longs desperately to break free from my prison.  But now there’s an even bigger evil lurking right around the corner, and soon, my captor might be the only one who can save me…   WARNING: This is a dark romance novel which contains disturbing situations, strong language, and graphic violence.
