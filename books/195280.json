After decades of running away from his father's murderous past, Peter has finally settled into his Witness Protection identity. He has a job, a girlfriend and the normal life he's always dreamed of. All of that is put in jeopardy when Inspector Douglas comes looking for help uncovering more bodies. Given the task of reconnecting with his murderous father to gain valuable information in unsolved cases, Peter must decide if he has the stomach to be the hero that the lost victims deserve. When his well intentioned therapist and Inspector Douglas push him to dig deeper into the case, Peter is faced with the realities that some family ties are simply too much to bear. A witty tale that tromps through the countryside of the Pacific Northwest, author D. K. Greene delights in this newest addition to Serial Murder lore.",
