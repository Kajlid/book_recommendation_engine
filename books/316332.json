She refuses to let the dog—or the sexy veterinarian—into her heart.Rory knows he should be hands off where Oaklee is concerned. She’s his best friend’s little sister, and it’s his job to look out for her – not try to get her into bed! They fight their attraction, but when Oaklee faces heartbreak, attraction turns into something much deeper. But Rory has his own hidden scars, and unless he can come clean with Oaklee about his past, their future together is at risk.",
