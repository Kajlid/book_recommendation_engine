  "description": "Your planet has just been destroyed and you’re lost in the space-time continuum, but—Don’t Panic! Just thumb your way to the end of the universe for a nice cuppa tea with the help of The Ultimate Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, your Baedeker for intergalactic zaniness. Featuring all five novels in Douglas Adams’s beloved Hitchhiker’s series—The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy; The Restaurant at the End of the Universe; Life, the Universe and Everything; So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish; Mostly Harmless—and the bonus short story Young Zaphod Plays It Safe, this omnibus provides you with the perfect itinerary for sightseeing across the universe, from the beginning to the end of time. Along the way you’ll meet paranoid robots, avert Armageddon (more than once!), and learn the answer to the ultimate question concerning life, the universe, and everything—even though you’ll never learn what the question is. So strap in, get ready for lift-off, and prepare yourself for comedy on a cosmic scale.",
