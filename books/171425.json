  "description": "When Eva's brother is murdered, she is forced to investigate the crime herself. What she discovers brings her up against a powerful slave-trading cartel, dark gods, and worst of all her twin sister. In a city of elvish masters and matriarchal dwarves where humans have no rights, the only people on her side are an illegally-freed slave, a senile nanny, and an ex-almost-boyfriend. But even when she nearly loses her job and almost loses her head in a sword fight on the same night, she isn’t deterred. It’s when the nanny goes missing that she really starts to worry. Femme fatale turns hard-boiled investigator in this first Eva Thorne novel. Set in a world where magic and machines can't stand against the God of Death, humans are on the run from the god's invasion. Highcrowne is the only refuge, but that means living in the Outskirts of an ancient city ruled by Avian mages, indifferent dwarves, and elves who'd prefer to see humans as their slaves. It's worst for Eva's people, Solhans, because they were the ones who summoned the Dead God into the world. No one wants her kind in Highcrowne and there are plenty who would be happy to see her brother dead. There are too many motives and not enough time to unravel the mystery because other people are dying—and Eva is fast running out of vacation time.\"A fantastical twist on mystery, brimming with action-packed adventure and a sense of clever fun.\" -Elizabeth Spann Craig, Bestselling Mystery AuthorGet books 1-4 as a digital ebook boxset:",
