  "description": "Growing up gay in a small, working-class town isn't easy. Returning there after three years spent in the bright lights of the city is even harder. But with no job, and no money, Danny doesn't have much choice. A vicious attack confirms all of Danny's fears about life in his hometown. The irony of his rescuer being Ste, his homophobic ex-best friend, isn't lost on him. But in the five years they've been apart, Ste has changed. Danny starts to hope. Perhaps Ste can give him a reason to stay, after all.~~WARNING~~This work contains graphic language and sexual contact between men and is not intended for anyone under the age of 18.",
