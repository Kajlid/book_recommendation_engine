  "title": "The Practice of Creative Writing: A Guide for Students",
  "description": "The Practice of Creative Writing is designed for all students in the introductory course, including those who may never take another writing class. Its message is, simply you can do this, and it's worthwhile to try. Heather Sellers, who writes in multiple genres herself, has developed an approach that focuses on the habits and strategies that produce good writing in any genre. These habits and strategies make it possible for students to focus, to generate lots of writing, and to get to the good stuff -- the powerful imagery and the stories they really want to tell. She makes creative writing fun by providing opportunities to be playful and to experiment at the same time she teaches students the importance of discipline and craft.",
