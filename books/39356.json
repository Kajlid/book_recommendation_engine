  "description": "\"Another must read from this brilliant author.\" -- Yeidy Cacho  \"This is one of the most original zombie series I've ever read. I don't want to give anything away but it doesn't disappoint and I can't wait for more! It has suspense, mystery, gore, humor, and very lovable character that you want to slap upside the head. Highly recommend!\" -- Heather Rick  The third book in the I Zombie series has arrived.
