  "description": "(Military Gay For You Romance)  Jake Turner is straight - or so he thinks. When he meets the gorgeous William Steel at basic training, he develops a whole load of strange feelings and emotions he doesn't quite understand.  From the very first roll call Jake knew William was different, there was just something about him. After a tough day of exercises the whole unit heads to the showers, and when Jake spots William showering across from him his manhood springs to life. He can't explain these desires - was he gay?  Jake tries to keep his distance from William, not wanting to stir up any feelings - coming out as gay in the military would make his time there very difficult. But when the two are paired together for an overnight training exercise, he has no choice but to face his feelings.  Stationed together in a abandoned wooden hut, with only their body warmth to keep away the cold, Jake will discover exactly what he will do 'For Him'....",
