  "title": "The Gnomes",
  "description": "On a seemingly deserted island, off the coast of Washington and British Columbia, deep in a temperate rainforest, lies the hidden village of Epsen…where, unbeknownst to the world, 78 gnomes reside! These gnomes harvest a remarkable anti-aging herb called Summer Frost, which is distributed in secret by Vancouver firm New Age Exports, with 50% of proceeds earmarked for Canadian charities. Summer Frost grows but one place on earth and is so popular with the American Baby Boomer generation that New Age perpetually works from backorder status. It’s a thriving industry, and many benefit from both the herbs and the charitable funds generated from their sale.However, Seattle health industry entrepreneur, multi-millionaire Devlin Black, dreams of becoming a billionaire. And he believes Summer Frost can take him there. His gut tells him where to find the precious herb, so he sends a team to the island in search of it. Once he finds Summer Frost, he’ll take over exclusive harvesting and packaging operations, expand the market tenfold, and harvest Summer Frost until its supply is exhausted—no matter who stands in his way or the cost to those same people.",
