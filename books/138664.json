  "title": "I Got Drunk and then Poetry",
  "description": "These poems were composed while having drinks downtown, enjoying the college-town local nightlife often with a typewriter and sometimes with an ink-pen and a Moleskine notebook. I let myself go, and I wrote a few gems and a whole lot of crap.I have chosen the gems and applied Hemingway’s “write drunk, edit sober”. My raw poetry was rife with typos and holes and I needed to edit it to make it clear and coherent. But I also didn’t want to overcook it; in my editing I strove to keep each poem faithful to the original so that the emotion and drunkenness would be maintained.",
