Despite the outward politeness, Eve could sense the icy chill of death.It was too late to flee. The hurricane relentlessly blew in off the Gulf. The St Amands and their unwilling guests huddled together.And Eve was among them, at the risk of her life, at the risk of losing her body and her mind to the evil of Thirteen Towers. And at the risk of losing even more - to the mad, despotic Jules St Amand, with whom Eve was falling desperately in love.",
