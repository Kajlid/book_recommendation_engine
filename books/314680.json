  "description": "Serena Chasey has nowhere left to go…After an awful relationship and a vengeful ex, she’s run out of places to hide. Taking her father’s advice, she heads for Montana to stay at her family’s lake house on Flathead Lake, the last place anyone would look for her. She’s desperate to start over, desperate to feel normal after the nightmare she’s lived for the last three years. Evan “Van” Brooks spent the last three years drowning in guilt, swallowed up by a past he can’t get away from, living in isolation in the tiny town of Lakeside, Montana. He wants to be left alone to wallow in his grief. The barrier he built around himself is impenetrable; no one gets in except his best friend and business partner Lincoln and his dog, Soldier. Everything was fine until Serena Chasey moved into the condo across the way and turned his life upside down.",
