  "description": "Seth Fisher has been to hell and back, but he has no intention of letting the torment of his past destroy his future. He thinks he's doing good. He's working again, talking, laughing, living. But everyone else still sees him as broken.  Except for one man. Raymond Vargas.  If only Seth could leave his apartment alone without a panic attack, then he could prove to everyone he's going to be okay. And he could tell the one man who has never let him down that he wants him.  Raymond Vargas has spent the past two years trying to make up for what happened to six young men who were tortured at the hands of a member of his club. He'd do anything to keep them safe, to help them heal and move on, to help them forget they ever set foot inside the Haven.  If only he hadn't fallen in love with one of them.  If only Seth wasn't still in danger.",
