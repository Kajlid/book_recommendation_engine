  "description": "**HAVEN'T READ SEDUCE? GO READ IT NOW! THIS SYNOPSIS WILL SPOIL IT FOR YOU ;)**Jack Falcon is a new man. Three years after he left his life behind in London, Jack finally feels settled. He’s surrounded with everything that is important to him; a great relationship with his brother, Alex, a bar he is about to re-open, and most importantly, he has control of his life and his dreams. He knows he can’t undo the wrongs of his past, but he sure as hell can determine his future. He has worked hard to move forward and nothing is going to undo that.Until he meets Rose. Rose Wilson has never felt normal. Since she was a child, Rose has felt nothing but the overwhelming desire to end her life and she has no idea why. We live to die, so what’s the point in living? Rose has pushed the limits in the past, and pushed people away. She can’t figure out why Jack and Alex are so insistent on helping her. Twelve years of therapy has failed to help her, so why should they be any different?Jack sees just how beautiful and important Rose is, but convincing her of that means putting his heart on the line, something he isn’t sure he can do. He can’t deny his feeling for Rose, but that doesn’t mean he has to act on them. And Jack isn’t the only one developing feelings for Rose. Before Rose, Jack vowed he would never let himself fall in love again. Before Rose, he had control. But sometimes, it’s losing control that makes you really see what’s really important in your life.***Release date 30th September******Seduce (Beautiful Rose #0.5 out now!***",
