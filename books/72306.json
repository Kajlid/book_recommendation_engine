  "description": "In Sackets Harbor, New York, on a beautiful summer day, all hell is about to break loose. Men and women from other worlds similar to this one have passed through a portal outside of the earthâ€™s atmosphere and are hurtling toward the surface. These have been gathered by fallen angels to topple a corrupt false god and though that is no longer their goal it may yet need to happen. This world may be all that is left of what was once a number beyond the mathematical capabilities of the average human mind. And it will soon be gone unless Marcus and a handful of powerful beings, with an army of gathered souls can manage to save it. An amnesiac former arch-angel of death in human form, a shape-shifter, Rose, Marcus and some others will have to sacrifice nearly everything to survive. But will they work together or fall to the darkness that is closing in on this world? And when all is said and done, will they have been the harbingers of light and life, or of death and eternal darkness?",
