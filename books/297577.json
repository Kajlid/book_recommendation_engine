Among physicians, the rate is even higher as the time spent in medical training significantly increases the risk of poor mental health. None of us are fully immune from the ravages of mental health problems. This book is about the fallibility of us all, including the doctors who are supposed to care for us. It is about the fine line of illness and normal emotion, and about how to change the norms of medical practice in light of human weakness. It’s for individuals who suffer from mental illness. It’s for their loved ones. It’s for anyone who interacts with someone with a mental illness. In short, it’s for all of us.",
