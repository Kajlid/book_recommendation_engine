  "description": "For reporter Irene Kelly it's a terrifying investigation - because it's so personal. Her husband, Detective Frank Harriman, has been kidnapped by terrorists who call themselves Hocus - deadly manipulators who give Irene three days to meet their demands before killing their hostage. But Irene's biggest shock is yet to come - as she uncovers her husband's history, and learns of a horrific crime committed a decade earlier. As seconds slip away, Irene willingly steps into a trap set by two madmen with a score to settle. And when she does, someone is going to pay for the sins of the past.",
