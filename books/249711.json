  "description": "I can’t save myself from the Cloister, and maybe I never could. The Prophet grows more dangerous by the day. His delusions are steeped in blood, and if I’m not careful, that blood will be my own. Despite the growing risk, I still continue the search for the truth, no matter if the thorny path eventually twists back to Adam, guilt in his dark eyes. I’ve seen glimpses of his soul, and I know there is more to him than the monster, but it’s so hard to reach him. I knew when I came here that I’d have to fight, I just didn’t realize the war would be waged on so many fronts.Author's Note: If you have a trigger, this book will pull it. The Maiden is the first book of The Cloister Series. The Prophet will release in May, and the conclusion to the series, The Church, will release in June.Join here: www.jointhecloister.com.",
