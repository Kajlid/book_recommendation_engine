  "description": "The Stargazers have long been guardians of the Old Magic, the precious life force of Ellemire that was stolen long ago and brought to Earth. For generations, the witches have traveled to our world to conceive a child and bring that magic home one little bit at a time. Unfortunately, this ritual turns once beautiful young women to shriveled crones and social outcasts.Aster, the youngest of the Stargazer coven, is the next to make this crippling journey, but a lot more is riding on her success. She is the Great Mother, the long prophesied witch whose child is destined to release the Old Magic back to Ellemire and save the land from coming darkness. But she soon learns that saving her world comes at an unspeakable cost, one that forces her to decide whether she can even fulfill her obligations at all. Meanwhile, her devious and power-hungry aunt Oleander is nipping at her heels, determined to do whatever it takes to make Aster her pawn and her slave.",
