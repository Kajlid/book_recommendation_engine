  "description": "They walk amongst us and we let them destroy our lives without even a second thought. But what if you had to face them knowing they could dispose of you at will? Could you survive when their sights were finally fixed on you? It was an accident, it wasn’t meant to happen, Troy just wanted to find work and a lover. He didn’t know that he could become caught up in a Black Triangle riddled in collateral damage and mystical revelations. Troy has no idea of the magic that surrounds him or the darkness that follows close behind as he finds his soul mate but soon discovers she is the reason they want to kill him. When he realizes that his life and the lives of those close to him are trapped, the magic they have yet to learn becomes their only hope. And for hope they will travel through treacherous places for which no maps have been written. Time is against them as agents and spies close in on them. Troy wants to stop the darkness from spreading, but before he can save his world he first has to save himself.",
