Now Aries, Mason, Clementine and Michael must fight the final battle for their lives. Only this time, the sides aren’t quite so clear. And it looks like the only people who can help, are the very killers themselves. There’s a new threat to survival. The Ferals. Baggers who have gone so completely insane, they will kill anything that crosses their paths, including their own kind. Mason knows he can’t trust Leon, the Bagger leader. He knows exactly what kind of monster Leon is. But without the Baggers help, they can’t stop the Ferals from killing all the survivors, especially the ones still being held hostage at the Plaza of Nations. And it doesn’t help that Daniel is back, determined to save Aries from everyone, including himself. With the Ferals closing in, the four friends must make tough decisions. Who can you trust in a world where everyone wants you dead? Trust nothing.",
