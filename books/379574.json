  "description": "The line between magic and sanity is very thin.That’s part of why I, Garnet Lacey, quit cold turkey.Never touch the stuff. No exceptions.But magic is so addictive...and my inner Goddess Lilith is hard to resist. Besides, restraint isn’t easy when you manage Wisconsin’s premiere occult bookstore, and get customers like Sebastian Von Traum—piercing brown eyes, a sexy accent, and a killer body in denim and black leather.

Run like hell—and take full advantage of the nights...",
