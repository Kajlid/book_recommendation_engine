  "description": "The basis of the Schieber law is oppress and prosper, but when a power-hungry elder decides to harness the power of superstition to assume control over his equals, a second plan is set in motion that threatens to turn his murderous crusade against him. Loyalties are demanded, blood is spilled, and betrayal is the name of the game. In the twisted city of Gordrim, the ruling Schieber class has isolated themselves from the subdued Hasste class, which toils day and night to provide the means for the Schieber's extravagant lifestyle. For centuries the Schieber controlled themselves with strict tradition and a balance of unearned power, but when the opportunity for more arises, few Schieber can resist. Alek Verdammten, the prominent head of his family, seizes control of circumstance to manipulate his people into obedience, but at a high cost to those around him. There are men and women with motives of their own surrounding him, and trust is merely a charade performed to keep others in the dark. In the midst of political chaos, a spark of life unknown to the Schieber is struck when two young hapless rejects, Jaheira and Leon, meet by chance and form a strange and unflinching bond that may hold the key to unshackling Gordrim and setting its people free.",
