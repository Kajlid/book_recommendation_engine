  "description": "He’s all about that bass…Cody Rivers wants to be a music star. And this a cappella singing competition could be his best, last chance to make it happen. However, his punk style and rocker attitude don’t exactly fit in with the world of clean-cut, wholesome a cappella groups or reality music TV shows. Even worse, a bumbling bass singer from a rival group might be his undoing.Lucas Norwood isn’t cut out to be a star. He’s content being in the background of his college a cappella group, trying not to trip over his feet while attempting to fit in with his more conservative friend group. He’s also determined not to let Cody’s barbs—or his smoking hot good looks—get to him.When the show forces them to work together, their chemistry is undeniable, both on and off the stage. But giving into their attraction may have real consequences, especially with elimination looming. Will making their dreams come true mean losing each other?Treble Maker was previously published. This version has received a light editing update, but otherwise it’s the same fan-favorite story. Contains two rival musicians who couldn’t be more opposite, first time feel, plenty of steam, and a guaranteed happy ending.",
