  "title": "Love's Complete: A Russian Adoption Journey",
  "description": "Many American families are created through adoption. In December 1991, the USSR dissolved into fifteen states. When Russia became independent in 1992, Americans began their adoption journey to Russia. Since Russia opened its borders to international adoption, more than 60,000 children were adopted into American families. More than 19,900 children from Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Lithuania, and Moldova came home to American families. This story depicts the complicated process these families go through, filled with highs and lows along the way, in order to bring their children home.",
