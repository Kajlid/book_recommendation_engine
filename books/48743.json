  "description": "Four new superheroes...One highly-skilled secret agent......are about to find out what it takes - to be a team. Not everyone can say they defeated an insane weapon smuggler, rescued a friend, and reformed a masked thief during summer break, but Kathy Allen can. And it's the truth. The first part of Kathy's vacation has been unusual, to say the least, but she wouldn t have it any other way. She and her friends Aaron, Robert, and Linda are living a dream as superheroes. Almost. Even though Kathy and her friends are superhumans - people born with unusual gifts - walking through walls, flying, and reading minds is only a part of being a superhero. Now, having formed an uneasy alliance with a man called Silence, who she first knew as her math teacher and then a dangerous enemy, Kathy is about to learn what it really takes to be a hero. And more importantly, what it takes to be a team of superheroes. How hard could it be?",
