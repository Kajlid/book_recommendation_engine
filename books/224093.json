  "description": "DeLuca Duet, Part Two  The Chicago Mob is the same as it has always been—violent, greedy, and excessive. The Outfit families have turned their backs when they were needed the most one too many times, but Dino DeLuca didn’t expect anything different.  His whole life has been lived for the Outfit—for his family.  He has a whole new set of reasons to live and fight now.  Karen Martin makes Dino change all the rules.  He’s finally ready to show everyone just how much waste is truly worth in the mafia, and just how far one will go for freedom from it all.  He’s learned these lessons well.  Too well.   Author’s Note: The DeLuca Duet is a standalone duet with a HEA ending that can be read independently.",
