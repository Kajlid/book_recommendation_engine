One of their plans was to keep Geronimo on the loose by supplying him with whiskey and ammo. General Crook had a plan to stop them, and Jim Sundance was part of his plan. He said to Jim, \"I want you to find out who's selling whiskey and guns to Geronimo. I want you to bring Geronimo in for good.\"The fate of the whole Apache nation hung on the answer Sundance was to give General Crook.All Sundance books are based on fact; this one clings especially close to it. BRONCO TRAIL tells the Geronimo story the way it really happened.",
