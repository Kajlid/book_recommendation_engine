I really connected with Erin throughout the story. Dare was a wealthy man use to women throwing themselves at him. He thought that was what Erin was like. He thought she was a gold digger. Boy was he shocked later on in the story when he found out she didn't even know who he was, or how much he was worth. This ended up being a really sweet romance. Erin, and Dare had some up's and downs but it made them a stronger couple in the end. I could feel the love between them.",
