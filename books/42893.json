  "description": "Z14 is an offbeat, fast-paced, tongue-in-cheek science-fiction story, that’s heavy on the fiction, and, let’s say ‘easy’ on the science.*Z14 is a cyborg, he’s a killer and he’s a collector of cuddly toys. He’s at the top of the food chain on the planet Deliverance. Nobody can touch him, and, if they did, he’d just regenerate anyway. He whiles away his time assassinating humans and trying to figure out why a mysterious space fleet brought millions of colonists here, generations ago.Killing humans. It’s wrong. He knows that. But it just feels right, somehow, almost like he was made to do it – and it pays really well. But Z14’s days of strutting around like he owns the place might just be numbered. When a ship from that mysterious fleet just happens to turn up, and a big, squishy clue falls on Z14’s doorstep, he starts getting some answers. He also finds himself facing the unknown. Things the humans call ‘challenges’, and, worse than that, ‘empathy’.On a planet where the law is set by the lawless and morals weren't part of the colonial supplies, an unstoppable cyborg assassin could be an unexpected force for good. Or, if not a force for good, then at least a hindrance to evil.When it looks like only Z14 can save humanity, they’ll just have to hope he decides he wants to.(Contains moderate swearing and violence)",
