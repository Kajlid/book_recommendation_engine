  "title": "Nobody Likes You: Inside the Turbulent Life, Times, and Music of Green Day",
  "description": "The full story of the rise and spectacular comeback of the band hailed as the saviors of punk rock and the next U2 It's hard to believe that in early 2004 Green Day was considered over -- the band was still together, but they were dismissed as a strictly 90s phenomenon, incapable of re-creating the success of their groundbreaking album Dookie . Then American Idiot debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts, stayed on the charts for nearly 18 months, and went on to sell more than four million records and to win Record of the Year (for \"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\") at this year's Grammy's. Combining unique access to Green Day with a seasoned journalist's nose for a great story, Marc Spitz gives the complete account of the band, from their earliest days to their most recent explosion of popularity and critical acclaim. Foremost, Nobody Likes You is a story of friendship and the transporting power of playing very loud music. It is the story of how high school dropout Billie Joe Armstrong came to write song lyrics that inflamed the political conscience of fans in a way that two Yale graduates couldnt. Green Day's story -- from rise, to fall, to rise again -- has never before been fully told.",
