  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Hazel Lisle has a problem. Or two. Or three. Problem number one: Asher Evans, her best friend and long-time crush. A lover of piercings with tan skin and a posh British accent, he’s spunky, fun, dirty-mouthed...and clearly more than what he seems. Then there is Hunter Slade. Cold. Infuriating. Unreadable. He knows just how to work her last nerve. But under his calm, impassive mask, he’s hiding a terrible secret of his own.Hunter and Ash are the least of Hazel’s worries. Someone is out to kill her, and she has no idea why. Monsters seem to come from left and right. Invisible wings follow her everywhere she goes. There’s a voice, soft and strangely familiar, inside her head. After a series of scary encounters, Hazel doesn't know who or what to believe. Only one thing is for sure: She will not go down without a fight.Due to strong language and crude sexual themes, this book is only recommended for readers ages 16 and up.",
