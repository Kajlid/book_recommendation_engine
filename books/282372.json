  "description": "One mistaken note brought them together. Their geography will tear them apart. Keeping things strictly physical will prove a challenge…\nThe scribbled message was supposed to be for Tess’s best friend and travel companion. In no way, shape or form was it meant for the hot, sexy as hell American who descends to the beach to see what the note was all about.Throwing caution to the wind, Tess decides to ditch her boring persona and pushes herself to step outside her comfort zone with the handsome, yet sweet stranger. She promises herself he’s nothing more than a vacation fling.Besides, how could Jon ever truly own her heart when he lives in Maine, USA, and she goes home to her mid-west Canadian hometown? One week to play in the sand and surf—that’s all it can be. Until true feelings start to develop…How does her heart stop listening to what her head warns will only end in heartache?",
