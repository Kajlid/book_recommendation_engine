  "description": "Meet the extraordinary man, whose tragedy inspired the song that made one average girl from Jersey into a celebrity. This \"Sex Monster\" is her favorite monster of all. His name is Alejandro Carbajal Estrada and these are his Anti-Christ Endowments.Since 2009, the Los Angeles Sheriffs have been working in orchestra with the Federal Bureau of Investigation to cover up the murder of a West Hollywood film producer. Eight months after the murder, music artist Lady Gaga released \"Alejandro,\" behind the back of her record Label RedOne, as the third single from her album \"The Fame Monster\". According to RedOne, \"Alejandro\" had poor radio performance, although Ms. Germanotta knew otherwise. Her instinct, as an artist, guided her actions and she knew that her race towards fame depended on the success of her third single release. The reality was, RedOne was setting her up for failure because the song they wanted to release, \"Dance in the Dark,\" became the worst performing single of her entire career to date.",
