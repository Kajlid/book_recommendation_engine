  "description": "All I wanted was a little peace and quiet.Instead, I've got dead Covenant members and a steady stream of letters from the new guy in town. His beverage of choice? A 2002 Merlot, with a shot or two of powerful virgin blood.On top of that, I'm breaking in a new police liaison, failing at playing matchmaker, and fighting nausea like it's a full time job.Did I forget to mention that I've also got enough girls living at the Crossroads to start my own boarding school?Peace and quiet? Out the window. --Jude Magdalyn Henries",
