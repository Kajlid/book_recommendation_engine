  "description": "NOTHING RATTLES SILVERMIST. She’s the calmest water-talent fairy around, and as cool as a deep mountain lake. But then an “unlucky” white ladybug lands on Silvermist’s head, and her orderly world goes topsy-turvy. She’s never been the type of fairy to lose things or have accidents or make mistakes . . . until now. Silvermist doesn’t believe in bad luck and silly old fairy superstitions. But all her troubles began after she found the white ladybug. Could the other fairies be right? Is Silvermist really under a curse?",
