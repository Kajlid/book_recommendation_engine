  "description": "Not everybody gets to have super powers. But then again, not everybody discovers a voodoo doll stashed away at the top of their cupboard. And even the few who do discover a voodoo doll stashed away at the top of their cupboard probably never stop to wonder what would happen if they put their own name into it. I mean, that's just insane, isn't it? Like running with scissors, or poking a sleeping bear. Steven is not an irresponsible boy, and is in fact vehemently opposed to poking bears, sleeping or otherwise. In his defence, how was he to know it was a voodoo doll, he thought it was just a very awesome action figure. With a pink pin in its chest. And the name Kyle Moorehouse wedged into his back. Curiously though, Kyle Moorehouse was the previous owner of this house, and, even more curiously, was also the person found dead on the kitchen floor. Coincidence? Or murder? Steven may just have poked the bear without even knowing it.",
