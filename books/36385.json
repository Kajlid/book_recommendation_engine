  "description": "How does one expedite torture? What happens in the mind of the tortured? Is it different for each soldier, each martyr? Only they know the answer. Perhaps Dillinger Flakewaiter, a soldier, a martyr, an everyday madman has written what it is that happens in the mind, the spirit, the body of the tortured, once the door clangs shut. Dillinger Flakewaiter was a soldier in Vietnam. After taking lead in the belly while serving his country, he finds himself in a private room at the Hanoi Hilton where he does what he has to in order to survive, and he invites us along. A travelling road show/freak circus is his first stop on this crazy escape from pain and anguish caused by his captors. After an encounter with a church-going damsel in distress and a torrid tumble with a Yugoslavian hooker, he then follows his own calling to a religious way of life. Bishop Flakewaiter of the Church of the Almighty-Yet Blessed Dollar-Sign listens to God's voice, and with the help of Deacon Allonzo, Hiawatha Hyacinth and Haymon the giant, he does God's work... but is it really God who has taken Dillinger by the hand, or is it instead the cold hard steel-on-steel slamming shut on his mind? In Vonnegutian style, the reader is inside Dillinger's world, sharing his confusion and his thoughts. Always raucous, often irreverent, Torture in the Garden of Eden takes us on the wild ride that is, sadly, nothing more than a mental escape from the deliberate hell man inflicts on man.",
