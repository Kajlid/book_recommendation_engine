  "description": "Eve Moore is very likely going insane. In one week's time, she has clear memories of surviving a murderous attack by her dead husband's mistress, teleporting to another Realm, learning her best friend isn't human, and uncovering the existence of trolls, Titans and mythical Gods. If she hadn't gone off her nut, Eve wouldn't be coming to grips with the fact that her mother had an affair with an immortal and she is apparently their love-child.But since she's getting pretty comfortable with it all, she figures she's probably strapped down somewhere cold and antiseptic with drool dribbling down her chin. Except if she's locked in sanitarium, as she must be, why is she so damn scared of the God of War who threatens to send her soul to the Underworld? And why does the mere glance from a gorgeous man, one that she was tasked to find and return to Olympus, set fire racing through her veins?Whether it's reality or lunacy, Eve has no idea, but she is on one hell of a ride. If only she could get that red-headed harlot who tried to kill her the first time to cease and desist on the murder attempts, she could enjoy her psychosis in peaceâ€¦",
