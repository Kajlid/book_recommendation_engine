  "description": "Welcome to the world of Vampire High School. New Blood is an inexpensive download that serves two purposes. 1. It introduces new readers to the fantastic two-voice Vampire High School series. 2. It provides more back story to characters in the original Vampire High School books, that we were unable to include in the original novels. Donny Kelp is a new vampire, just 'turned' two days ago, but already he's making rookie mistakes. Destined for a higher purpose, he's drawn sharply back into line. Can he follow his destiny? Or is he doomed to languish in the vampire ranks. Ian Hall writes from the perspective of Donny, the newly turned vampire. Lachelle Miller writes from the perspective of Valerie, a hundred year old vampire with a whip in her hand.",
