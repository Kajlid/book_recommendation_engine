  "description": "Nestled along the North Carolina coast, the Outer Banks Tennis Academy is the world's most elite training facility. In this pressure-cooker environment, futures are forged in blood and sweat, and dreams are shattered in an instant.  Penny Harrison, a rising female star, is determined to win the French Open and beat her archrival, Zina Lutrova. But when her coach imports British bad boy Alex Russell as her new training partner, will Penny be able to keep her laser-like focus?  Tennis is all Jasmine Randazzo has ever known. The daughter of two Grand Slam champions, she's hell-bent on extending her family’s legacy and writing her own happily-ever-after...until her chosen Prince Charming gives her the just-friends speech, right before the biggest junior tournament of the year, the Outer Banks Classic.  With a powerful serve and killer forehand, newcomer Indiana Gaffney is turning heads. She’s thrilled by all of the attention, especially from Jack Harrison, Penny’s agent and hot older brother, except he keeps backing off every time things start heating up.  With so much at stake, dreams—and hearts—are bound to break.    Game. Set. Match is a fantastic entrant in the New Adult genre! I really enjoyed this sharply observed story of ambitions, friendship and love at the Outer Banks Tennis Academy. I'm definitely Team Penny - I love that she's strong but vulnerable too when it comes to her sexy British beau. Plus, we go to Paris! Ooh lala! - Lauren Blakely, NYTimes & USAToday Bestselling Author of CAUGHT UP IN US  If you like passionate girls who put it all on the line, hot guys who are hard to read, and friendship that's about more than gossip and clothes, look no further than the Outer Banks Tennis Academy. - Holly Sorensen, Executive Producer , Freeform's MAKE IT OR BREAK IT, RECOVERY ROAD and YouTube Red's STEP HIGH WATER",
