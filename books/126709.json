  "description": "Virginia is touched but she decides that she will not go. She feels an air of herself when she takes the decision to not go. She feels such certainty of not going in between the uncertainty of life around. As if this is holding her and is a landmark in her life. She reflected on this and realised that life is about these landmarks like stepping stones. She understood that there is no story. There are only parts and there are big gaps in between the parts. There is no continuity. And then she thinks that there is no time. She feels dread and enlighten at the same time. She looks around in her imagination. She questions herself \"is she the only one who knows this? Is this real? What is real?\" It is about journey and following the dream. And in this journey that she encounters the uncertainities in life around and her thoughts.Monty stated that he might not be thinking or seeing her in between as he might get occupied with other things but that does not mean that Rosy has stopped to exist. Rosy knows her lover has been divided. Monty has started giving time to other things. There are gaps in Rosy's existence now. Monty needs greater intellectual strength to fill the gap through imagination. But he is occupied with other things and has less time both inwardly and outwardly.",
