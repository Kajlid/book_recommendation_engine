  "description": "TV teen stars, Shiloh Rush and William \"Spud\" Escott, take off on non-stop adventure in Where Angels Fear to Tread, a fantasy/science fiction mystery/thriller guaranteed to excite and delight young adults and curious, imaginative readers of all ages. Singularity Channel viewers may recognize Hollywood actress Shiloh Rush as Space Cadet Tara Guard from the sci-fi TV series Stargeant Guard, but nobody knows Shiloh is leading a double life. Haunted by the mysterious disappearance of her favorite brother, Shiloh hopes to follow in his footsteps and track him down as a secret agent for the Zygan Federation, an intergalactic empire still hidden from Earth. During this quest, Shiloh and her British co-star Spud, also a Zygan agent, fly into space-for real-to stop terrorists and invaders who could destroy the Federation and kill millions throughout the universe. Sent back in time to Earth's Ancient Middle East to save the life of a young prophet and prevent Earth's destruction, Shiloh and Spud stumble on a diabolical conspiracy and barely escape with their lives. Their assignment sabotaged, Shiloh and Spud discover the villains' real mission, face powerful enemy fighters from warrior planets and traitors from their own ranks, and race against time to save Earth.",
