  "description": "\"Eckert's skills as a naturalist, previously displayed in his Newbery Award-winning Incident at Hawk's Hill, are here given full expression and armchair adventurers will soon be caught in its spell. The pristine and often savage beauty of the killer rainforest is described in lush detail; the reader is right there, watching. Once the reader has been snagged, he'll be as much a captive of the magnificent forest as is Sarah Francis and just as intent as she to survive in a paradoxically terrifying and beautiful environment. The reader cannot help by hold his breath!\"-Cincinnati Enquirer",
