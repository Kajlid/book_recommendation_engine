A revised, extended edition was released in December 2020 by Shire-Hill Publications.In a society where oppression and conformity rule the masses and the slightest unusual behavior could be seen as treasonous, Wynter Reeves would do just about anything to ensure she isn't noticed. However, when she begins to show symptoms of a rare and debilitating illness, she unwillingly attracts the attention of the Stateâ€”in particular, the feared research facility known as the DSD. Through them she learns of the true nature of her condition, a disease known only as Ultraxenopia.",
