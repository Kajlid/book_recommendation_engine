  "description": "What Julia Child is to French cooking and Marcella Hazan is to Italian cooking, Deborah Madison is to contemporary vegetarian cooking.  At Greens restaurant in San Francisco, where she was the founding chef, and in her two acclaimed vegetarian cookbooks, Madison elevated vegetarian cooking to new heights of sophistication, introducing many people to the joy of cooking without meat, whether occasionally or for a lifetime.  But after her many years as a teacher and writer, she realized that there was no comprehensive primer for vegetarian cooking, no single book that taught vegetarians basic cooking techniques, how to combine ingredients, and how to present vegetarian dishes with style.  Now, in a landmark cookbook that has been six years in the making, Madison teaches readers how to build flavor into vegetable dishes, how to develop vegetable stocks, and how to choose, care for, and cook the many vegetables available to cooks today.Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is the most comprehensive vegetarian cookbook ever published.  The 1,400 recipes, which range from appetizers to desserts, are colorful and imaginative as well as familiar and comforting.  Madison introduces readers to innovative main course salads; warm and cold soups; vegetable braises and cobblers; golden-crusted gratins; Italian favorites like pasta, polenta, pizza, and risotto; savory tarts and galettes; grilled sandwiches and quesadillas; and creative dishes using grains and heirloom beans.  At the heart of the book is the A-to-Z vegetable chapter, which describes the unique personalities of readily available vegetables, the sauces and seasonings that best complement them, and the simplest ways to prepare them.  \"Becoming a Cook\" teaches cooking basics, from holding a knife to planning a menu, and \"Foundations of Flavor\" discusses how to use sauces, herbs, spices, oils, and vinegars to add flavor and character to meatless dishes.  In each chapter, the recipes range from those suitable for everyday dining to dishes for special occasions.  And through it all, Madison presents a philosophy of cooking that is both practical and inspiring.Despite its focus on meatless cooking, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone is not just for It's for everyone interested in learning how to cook vegetables creatively, healthfully, and passionately.  The recipes are remarkably straightforward, using easy-to-find ingredients in inspiring combinations.  Some are simple, others more complex, but all are written with an eye toward the seasonality of produce.  And Madison's joyful and free-spirited approach to cooking will send you into the kitchen with confidence and enthusiasm.  Whether you are a kitchen novice or an experienced cook, this wonderful cookbook has something for everyone.",
