  "description": "Sophie lives her life as a hospice nurse running from her past and over-compensating for her sins. She wants nothing more than to help others the way someone once helped her. But she never expected to get so attached to one of her patients. Nicholas is suddenly looking for more meaning in his life than money, fast women and flashing lights. Life as a rocker has left him empty. Only Emily filled the gaping hole in his heart and with her death, his soul is broken into pieces. When two lives collide, Sophie and Nicholas know they'll never be the same. Together, they try to figure out a message Emily has left behind. Can they succeed before the realities of life tear them apart?",
