  "description": "When it comes to milk products, Billy-boy Fudder isn't a cheese whiz.  In fact, he's a milk dud, a dairy dork, and a hurling horror.  Too bad his family inherits Breakwind Farms and has to move to the dairy capital of the world! But Billy isn't bummed for long!  He and his new friend, Fanny, discover a cheese brain and unwittingly unleash a cottage cheese monster.  But Martha the talking cow is on their side, and Fanny's smelly burps are their secret weapon against Chunk-O-Cheese!",
