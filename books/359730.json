  "description": "Fifteen years ago, I helped put my abductor behind bars.And shunned the events of my traumatic past.I’ve lived a content life with my wife.Until the dreaded phone call.Duncan Whittaker’s out on parole.The first time I confront him, I intend to kill him.But when we’re face to face, everything changes.I’m still codependent on him.Duncan’s the only man who’s ever made me feel desire.He’s also the one who held me captive for almost a year.Isolated me from others to make me grateful for his presence.Deprived me of sensation to make me crave his unwanted touch.Duncan Whittaker’s the sadist who broke me in the name of revenge.Now his twisted obsession is about to ruin my life a second time.And God help me, but I don’t know how to stop him.I… may not want to stop him.\nBe mine, Twisted Valentine is part of a multi-author collab. Ditch the hearts and flowers and step into the dark world of Corrupt Cupid. Each book can be read as a standalone, but why not grab each and every deranged romantic tale as you slip into a place where darkness rules?",
