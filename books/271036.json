  "description": "Sometimes the only way forward is to reach back through time.  Of one thing Erin is certain: the troubles her family are facing are about to get a whole lot worse. Between her little brother being sick with a mysterious illness no one can cure and her parents growing more distant by the day, Erin’s only sanctuary is the powerful older boy she likes, Kieran. But the bubble of attraction he keeps her under hides a dark secret.  Then one big mistake throws Erin’s already precarious situation completely upside-down and threatens to destroy everything she holds dear. Her only options to save herself and her family both seem impossible: reach out to a girl locked in another time or a girl from another world who possesses remarkable powers.  But reaching out to the impossible may be the only thing that could save everything she values from breaking apart.  Reach is a paranormal time travel novella - the starter story in the irresistibly compelling Tandro Series.  It is perfect for anyone who loves YA, Science Fiction, time travel and thrilling twists. And in Naomi E Lloyd's unique style, there's a dash of romance and magic in this fast-paced imaginative series.  It packs a lot in but you won't want to put it down!",
