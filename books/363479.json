  "description": "Japan's 100 Famous Mountains! 100 peaks that can be climbed by anyone willing to make the effort. Some easy, some hard. An average height of 2,200 meters, with thirteen over 3,000 meters. Who on earth would try to conquer the whole lot in 100 days? Two crazy Kiwis, that's who! In May 1997, Craig McLachlan and Travis Taiaroa set out on the ultimate adventure. As Craig said before they started out, \"Over-planning kills adventure!\". They didn't over-plan. This is the story of their 78-day journey to summit all of the 100 Famous Mountains, and the fascinating adventures they had along the way.This is one of five books available on Amazon about McLachlan's various adventures in Japan. He has also walked the length of Japan (3200kms in 99 days!), hiked the 88 Sacred Temples of Shikoku Pilgrimage, journeyed around the Saigoku 33 Temples of Kannon Pilgrimage, and trekked from the Sea of Japan to the Pacific Ocean climbing all Japan's 3,000-meter peaks along the way.
