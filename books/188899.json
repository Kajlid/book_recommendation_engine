  "description": "From first-day-of-class primping (in Juicy Couture, of course!), dating anxiety, and back-stabbing chick cliques, to teachers, gym class, and other hallmarks of school life, these ingenious photographic scenes starring SloaneTanen's signature yellow chicks bring the teen experience to life with hilarious results. Training her razor sharp sense of humor on seven \"typical\" teenagers, Sloane follows Caitlin, Edgar, Marissa, Joey, Annalise, Helen, and Andrew as they navigate a world plagued by unrequited love, pop quizzes, and parents. This birds-eye view of the blunder years is a perfect gift for back-to-schoolers or graduates, and a wickedly funny trip down memory lane for many an adult as well.SLOANE TANEN is the author of several books for adults, including the bestselling Bitter with Baggage Seeks Same, Going for the Bronze, and Hatched! She is also the creator of several books for young readers. Appetite for Detention marks her first book for teenagers, and one she is ideally-perhaps even genetically-suited to write. (Sloane is the daughter of Ned Tanen, who produced such teen cult hits as Sixteen Candles, The Breakfast Club, and St. Elmo's Fire.) Sloane lives in New York City with her husband and young son. www.sloanetanen.com",
