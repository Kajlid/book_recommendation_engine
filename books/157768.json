  "description": "World War II was in full swing when Sergeant Deacon was summoned to investigate what, at first, appeared to be a car accident right outside the gates of RAF Bardney â€“ until it was established that the victim of the accident had been tortured before his death. His face was a grotesquely misshapen mask of pain, horror lurking in his half-open eyes, turning the case into a murder investigation.Why would somebody want to kill Aircraftman Fellows and try and cover up the evidence?Unexplained coincidences made it clear that the truth was yet to be unveiled.His determination to solve the case becomes a matter of national security when he finds himself involved in a plot to assassinate the prime minister.",
