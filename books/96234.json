  "description": "Alternate cover edition for ISBN: 9781478269915 Think your landlord is a demon from hell? This one really is.Samantha Martin is an imp. She throws her gum on the floor of five star restaurants, bounces inflatable holiday decorations down the highway at rush hour, and clips jaywalking pedestrians with her car. Sam also likes to kill people and keep their souls inside her for all eternity, but acting on that particular urge will get her killed by the angels, who are determined to rid the world of her kind. Sam works hard to keep her human identity realistic: she owns slum rental properties, and she is trying to get her hot neighbor into the sack. When she kills a werewolf in an act of self-defense, his pack leaders blackmail her into helping track and kill a rouge angel. The very actions she must take to appease the werewolves put her at risk of being discovered and killed by the angels. Because angels show demons no mercy.",
