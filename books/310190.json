My brothers at Men of Valor MC and I have dedicated our lives to protecting our town and rooting out corruption in the police department and beyond.When I see Ms. Paige Perkins putting herself in danger by trying to hide at one of our stakeouts, I snap. It’s time the curvy little goddess learns exactly where she belongs--beneath me, on top of me, beside me for the rest of our lives.",
