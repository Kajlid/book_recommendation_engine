  "description": "Destination Holiness invites you on a journey. Each week provides a theme that is developed each day, along with scriptures and stories that encourage the reader to consider their own life's journey. There are Challenges and Love Notes from the author, and all along the way a sense that it was written as a personal letter just for you. Indeed it was, as the author and finisher of our faith journey toward holiness is Jesus Christ and this book is truly His inspiration.",
