  "description": "The Web, a vast machine intelligence of unbelievable power, is steadily consuming the galaxy, indifferent to any species that stands in its way. Fighting the Web brings together an alliance between disparate societies and alien civilizations to stand against it in battle. And overcoming the Web means discovering where it came from and what goals drive its single-minded advance, and learning what the future holds for intelligent life in the universe. The Warstrider series draws to a close with this final epic struggle for the fate of the galaxy. The sixth and final book in Ian Douglas's classic Warstrider military sci-fi series, originally published in 1996. The whole Warstrider series is being re-issued by War Planet Press.",
