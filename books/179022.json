  "title": "Unleash Godly Power",
  "description": "Learn how to unleash your inner power to accomplish any goal or to gain unlimited abundance. Many who have read books on infinite power were disappointed because the promised results were unrealizable. Some books describe infinite power as mystical, like releasing a \"genie from a bottle.\" They contend that if you visualize a desire, you can magically attain the wish. While visualization is important, that alone will not work without the critical missing links explained in this book. It is not as simple as waving a magic wand, but we all can unleash the power.  Everything conceived by great achievers began as images in their mind. They actualized what was once unimaginable to man, including electricity, automobiles, airplanes, and space travel. These innovators visualized these inventions using their imagination and their internal power to turn thoughts into reality. It is sad that only a very small percentage of each generation learns how to unleash the supremacy God gave us. People of all faiths will be able to relate and embrace the concept of infinite power as their own internal resource. Such greatness is attainable by all. While our goals may be to simply live free of the burdens of powerlessness, economic struggle, or loneliness, we can all have what we want and deserve in life, and this book will show you how.",
