  "description": "Interior designer Mike Stevenson is out shopping for a new ride when he literally runs into Joe Adams, a contractor who works for one of his clients. Mike feels an immediate spark of attraction, but Joe is wearing a wedding band, so Mike assumes his case is hopeless—just like the rest of his love life. Then the two lonely men start spending time together and Mike learns more about Joe’s past, falling deeper in love with him against his own better judgment. But everyone from Mike's vindictive ex to Joe's well-meaning family seems determined to get in the way of their happiness.",
