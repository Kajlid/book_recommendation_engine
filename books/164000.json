  "title": "Southern Cross Safari: Around Australia by bus and train",
  "description": "In this intriguing travel narrative, author Bruce Gall takes the reader on a 26,000-kilometre (16,000-mile) bus and train trip around Australia, exploring the nature of the country, its fascinating wildlife and stunning landscapes. We climb fire-spotting trees, look for rare animals, scale mountains, go bushwalking (hiking), explore national parks, brave wild weather and meet a host of interesting backpackers – and many local characters as well! We read Aboriginal legends, discover Australia’s early Dutch, French and British connections, discuss climate change, and much more.The author travels like Paul Theroux, with Bill Bryson’s sense of humour, but tells his own story, crafting meticulous word pictures, delightful dialogue and humorous anecdotes that will entertain to the very last page – vicarious travelling at its best.",
