  "description": "Looking back, Martha could’ve said no when Mr. Booker first tried to kiss her. That would’ve been the sensible thing to do. But Martha’s sixteen, she lives in a small dull town—a cemetery with lights—her father’s mad, her home’s stifling and she’s waiting for the rest of her life to begin. Of course Martha would kiss the charming Englishman who brightened her world with style, adventure, whisky, cigarettes and the promise of sex. But Martha didn’t count on the consequences. Me and Mr. Booker is a story about feeling old whenyou’re young and acting young when you’re not.",
