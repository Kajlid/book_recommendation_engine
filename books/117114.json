  "title": "Madmen’s Manifestos: Chris Dorner, Charles Manson, Timothy McVeigh and others",
  "description": "We may never know what drives ordinary people to commit atrocities. In some cases, murderers leave notes or publish manifestos to express themselves and tell the world what motivated them. This book is the first ever collection of such notes, manifestos and confessions.They include short diary entries and long dissertations, succinct political statements and rambling incoherent rants. A lot of the names in this book may sound unfamiliar, while others are known to most of us. Since this book is about the killers’ manifestos and not the killers themselves, each entry contains only a brief description of the person behind it. The book contains manifestos from 20 different killers, including the manifesto of \"Russian Breivik,\" Dmitry Vinogradov - published in English for the first time. Due to graphic details and language, the book is not recommended for readers under 18.",
