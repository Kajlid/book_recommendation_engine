  "description": "Until she stumbled upon the Divine Relief Temp Agency, Ilana Newhouse was having a hard time finding a summer job. Apparently, a T-shirt that reads \"Orc: The Other Green Meat\" isn’t appropriate for an interview. But when she reports for her first day as a temp, Ilana discovers why Divine Relief isn’t shy about hiring someone a little left of ordinary. Ilana is temping for the extraordinary, life-controlling, Greek mythological goddesses, the Fates. Now her summer is going to be less about surviving a stuffy office and more about avoiding being turned into a pig, or worse!",
