  "description": "Ginger is back, and facing a tough decision. Sausages or enlightenment?Ginger is about to relive the first of his nine lifetimes upon this earth - as a fat greedy god-cat in ancient India. With the help of his little pal Sparky, the cutest cat in the universe, he must curb his appetites and bring home the top sausage known to Man - without eating it.If he succeeds, he will win the heart of Madame Frou-Frou, the foxiest kitty on the block. He will also prove himself worthy of becoming the Buddha's cat. If he fails, no good cat will ever go to Heaven.Can Ginger overcome his attachment to sausages? Can he really be bothered to save feline-kind? After 2000 years and nine horribly mis-spent lives, it doesn't seem likely...Note: 'Ginger' is aimed at 10+ children, the parents who enjoy reading to them, and cat-lovers everywhere.",
