  "description": "Veronica wants nothing more than to find her brother, who sailed away years ago. But when Veronica's ship is captured by pirates, she's determined to save her own skin, while keeping her magic and her gender a secret. Disguised as male, she finagles a spot as a cabin boy aboard the buccaneers' vessel--which is bound for Ravensbeck, a stronghold where the Pirate King holds sway. He may have the answers Veronica seeks--but getting those answers could cost her more than she's willing to pay.Trigger warnings are available on the author's website and in the front matter of the book.",
