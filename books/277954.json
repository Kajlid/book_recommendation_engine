  "description": "James Baldwin's stunning first novel is now an  American classic. With startling realism that brings  Harlem and the black experience vividly to life,  this is a work that touches the heart with emotion  while it stimulates the mind with its narrative  style, symbolism, and excoriating vision of racism  in America. Moving through time from the rural  South to the northern ghetto, starkly contrasting the  attitudes of two generations of an embattles  family, Go Tell It On The Mountain   is an unsurpassed portrayal of human beings caught  up in a dramatic struggle and of a society  confronting inevitable change.\"The most important  novel written about the American Negro,\"  says Commentary . \"It is written  with poetic intensity and great narrative skill,\"  writes Harper's .   Saturday Review praises it as \"masterful,\"  and the San Francisco Chronicle   declares that this important American novel is  \"brutal, objective and compassionate.\"",
