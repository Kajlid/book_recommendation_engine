  "description": "\"It takes more than a rock star to rock your world. Sometimes you need a friend. \"\"Bandicoot Cove\"McKenzie Wood is Australia s star gossip mag journalist, and she s just spied the story of a lifetime: rumor-shrouded rock star, Nick Blackthorne who thinks he s incognito at Bandicoot Cove resort. The word is Nick s a sex addict about to come out of the closet, and who better to lure Nick out than her BFF, Aiden Rogers a pulse-poundingly gorgeous firefighter who is always there when she needs him, no matter the challenge.Aiden admits it s pretty damned pathetic that he can rush into burning buildings, but not have the guts to tell McKenzie he s in love with her. No way can he tell his best friend he d like to do some seriously sinful things to her, especially since she s never shown one iota of sexual interest.Nick looks forward to some unfamous downtime in his home country. He s surprised to find his creative muse stirred more like brought to rigid attention by a couple so sexy that all he can think about is the three of them. Together.Three bodies move together as one, and the music becomes a smoldering beat that rivals the island s heat. When the truth inevitably comes out, the heat might be enough to save three souls or end up just another sinner s lament.Warning: One plus one plus one equals OMG sex, are-you-freaking-kidding-me orgasms and some serious mind-blowing climaxes. \"",
