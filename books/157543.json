  "title": "Punitive poetry",
  "description": "This comprehensive collection of disciplinary poetry includes two of the most famous ever composed; \nThe Rodiad\n (1871) written in the late Victorian era by Richard Monckton Milnes, and the extremely lengthy \nSquire Hardman\n (1967) by John Glassco. Both were attributed to George Coleman the Younger, but he was not the author of either, the latter having been written in the early 1950s and passed off as a much earlier work. Also included are some modern day classics including Punishment Day, I Never Saw Her Coming, and The Nursery Tea.",
