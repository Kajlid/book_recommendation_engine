  "description": "The Grey family live in the tranquil English village of Deerbrook, to which, one summer, come their distant cousins from Birmingham, Hester and Margaret Ibbotson. The arrival of the recently orphaned cousins causes a sensation in the small community. The twenty-one-year-old Hester has the gift of great beauty and the terrible fault of jealousy, while Margaret, a year her junior, is her inferior in looks, though vastly superior in intelligence and disposition. Finding themselves the object of curiosity, admiration, and pity, they are quickly absorbed into the intricacies of village life: we enter the world of Jane Austen and the Brontës as we watch the two sisters fall in love with the two most eligible men in Deerbrook.Deerbrook is a delightful evolcation of daily life in a small English village in the early nineteenth century and a masterly and moving exposition of the plight of the Victorian woma in love. When this, her only novel, was first published in 1839, Martineau was accorded equal literary status to Madame de Staël.",
