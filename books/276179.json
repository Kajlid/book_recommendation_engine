My hand in marriage. My heart. And as soon as he got what he wanted, he callously sold me off for a cool ten million.In the boardroom and the twisted game his family plays, he says the only rule is to win at all costs. Yesterday I learned a painful lesson not to trust the prince of Cape Hill. Today I’ll destroy his carefully laid plans and show him just how badly he’s already lost. All the money in the world won’t be able to stop me.",
