  "description": "Doreen Green and her friend Nancy Whitehead have had a great idea: get some friends together and play an escape room! That's one of those real-life games where you get locked in a room and have an hour to escape before you die! Except you don't really. I mean, it's not like if you die in the game you die in real life, ha ha. But when Squirrel Girl and Nancy gather Koi Boi, Chipmunk Hunk, Brain Drain and Kraven the Hunter inside and lock the door, it turns out that this escape room is actually lethal after all! Can Doreen and company escape? Find out, why don't you?! It's everything you crave from a Squirrel Girl book: friendship, adventure and a room full of death traps!Collects The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #32-36.",
