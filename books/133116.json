Make it so that what happened before can never, ever, happen again. To help others find their own strength so that what happened to me, what happened to my Olivia, doesn’t happen to them.And My favorite—to find the bastards that took my life away and make them pay for what they did. This is what my life is now. A dead man, inside a scarred body, living only for revenge.*This is part one in a five-part novella series.**Due to sexual situations and violence, this series is recommended for 18+.",
