  "description": "After draining her savings, moving 300 miles and then being dumped on arrival by her boyfriend, Dayna Cook vows to stop falling for the radio jocks she works with. But then Dayna’s new boss reassigns her to co-host Hot Country 103’s morning show with the cocky but irresistible Tack Collins and her hormones start backpedaling.As Wake Up with Tack and Dayna kicks into high gear, so does the duo’s mutual lust. The boss warns them that knocking boots will kill the sexual tension that drives listeners to tune in to their show – then clamps down with a chastity belt of an offer: stay out of bed until the ratings period ends in exchange for a big, fat bonus. For Dayna, it means a sure-fire way to get back on her feet (and back at her ex). For Tack, it means the longest, most frustrating summer of his life.Without being able to gratify their intensifying desire, the pair’s sizzling attraction deviates in an entirely unexpected direction fraught with secret trysts, jealous radio groupies, a remorseful ex-boyfriend and a resentful former co-host as Tack and Dayna discover that genuine feelings create more static than casual sex ever could.",
