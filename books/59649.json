  "description": "I'm Aang -- and this is the tale of my journey through the Earth Kingdom. I traveled there with my friends Katara and Sokka to find an Earthbending teacher. I'm not sure why, but we ran into trouble almost everywhere we went. We got chased by Prince Zuko's sister, Azula, and got caught in a sinking library. Did I mention that Appa got kidnapped by Sandbenders? There were definitely some scary moments...but I can't complain about getting stuck in the Cave of Two Lovers with Katara! All in a day's work for the Avatar, right?",
