  "description": "Hercules is the owner of the Velvet Glove, the premier men's bdsm club in the galaxy. He's made sure to hire the best people for their jobs, from the cleaners to the trainers. It's exclusive, it's hot and it's all his. Malachi is the club's main trainer and an extraordinary top; he was handpicked by Hercules. The man has a secret though, one that Hercules discovers and shares with him. But if it gets out, Malachi's reputation could be ruined, and possibly the Velvet Glove's along with it. Can Malachi and Hercules maintain a relationship as well as their roles at the club? Or will their needs and desires bring their world crashing down around them?",
