  "description": "In this up-tempo, menacing thriller, Larry Crane plunks Army Ex-Ranger Lou Christopher in the midst of a mind-boggling domestic terrorism plot that tests his bed-rock values of patriotism, integrity, and marital fidelity.After retiring from a heroic career that nearly got him general officer stars, Colonel Christopher finds that his Brigade Commander chops don’t necessarily translate into a comparable civilian job—-and he settles instead for the lure of a lucrative stock broker post.Unfortunately, the stock market is plummeting, taking his self-esteem and confidence with it. He’s approached with a high risk scheme promising to resurrect his life, and against the qualms of his wife and his own nagging doubts he rolls the dice, with his honor and marriage at stake.A Bridge to Treachery is a twisting, turning chase through the back woods of Bear Mountain and the marble canyons of Wall Street on a mission to reclaim respectability from the clutches of temptation.Get your copy now!",
