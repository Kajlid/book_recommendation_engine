  "title": "Spontaneous Combustion: Enlightenment and the Cosmic Crucible",
  "description": "Shattering the dogmatic interpretations long held by the “churches,” the author has revisited many of the Bible’s mysteries, and now presents the esoteric truths contained within. An intentionally non-religious work, though dealing with core issues of religion and spirituality, this book proves to be both unique and profound. Drawing from the study of sacred texts, religious myth and symbols, from the study of metaphysics, psychology, and various occult teachings of the mystery schools, the author has presented a solid case for what he declares to be the true message of the ancients. Simply stated, Mankind is “in the Dark.” That we are in the dark, though we aren’t aware of it, is the basic premise of the book. That there is a solution, a system of personal rebirth is the initial message. Following a logical trail of investigation determined by the evidence presented, the reader arrives at the crossroads of prophecy and reality altogether.",
