She braves magic spells, dragons, evil wizards, and the treachery of the princesses themselves. As Phoenix faces these dangers, she finds herself caught in the dangerous dance inside herself - a dance of darkness and light, a dance that presents her with the greatest challenge of her life.This captivating companion to \"Aria of the Sea \"weaves a retelling of Grimm's fairy tale of the Twelve Dancing Princesses with the story of a young woman's inward journey toward an understanding of a scary, unpredictable part of her own nature.",
