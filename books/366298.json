  "description": "Samantha Blythe just got out of an abusive relationship and she just wants to find a nice guy to spend a little quality time with. Too bad the guy she finds happens to be a vampire.Nate Glover isn’t the right type of guy to be a vampire. He’s not a thousand year old Viking or an ancient Roman or a veteran of the Civil War. Even worse, he’s sexually straight and financially stable–the vampire equivalent of a Republican. Having been ‘brought over’ in 1955, he couldn’t handle being a vampire in the age of McCarthyism and Leave it to Beaver and decided to take a fifty-five year nap. Now he finds himself unable to connect with the women of the twenty-first century on any level more meaningful than a gastronomic one–that is until he meets Sam.Sam and Nate hit it off, but it isn’t long before they have trouble. Sam’s ex doesn’t want to let her go and it turns out that the Mistress who turned Nate undead in the first place, feels the same way. When Nate’s scheming friend finds out there’s something special about Sam, namely that a taste of her blood increases vampiric power, the new couple are summoned to the capital of Vampire-kind. No, not Transylvania--Miami. Murder, mayhem, and a fight to the un-death ensue as Nate struggles to accept his powers, Sam learns to live with a man who’s a permanent night person, and they both try to bridge the generation gap and find true love in Blind Date with a Vampire.",
