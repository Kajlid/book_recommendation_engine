  "title": "The Weird Orient; Nine Mystic Tales from Morocco",
  "description": "- Quality Digital Text- Original footnotes and italics- Linked table of ContentsThese prize-winning tales came from story-telling sources at a casino run by the author in Tetuan, Morocco - much like Rick's Café Américain in the classic movie, Casablanca. What the author calls the Orient, we tend to refer to as the Middle East.From the Preface:The mystery of the great desolate desert stretches, with their overpowering solemnity of deadly silence, has from time immemorial exercised a most powerful influence upon the imagination of those who frequent them; and their optical illusions are often so curious and so startling as to afford easy explanation of the legends of hidden and phantom cities, such as are told here and elsewhere, and indeed of much else beside. Stories similar to “Sheddad’s Palace of Irem,” and that of the vanishing city of the Peri in “The Croesus of Yemen,’’ are frequently met with.The mountain regions, especially that of the Sinai Peninsula, have also had a profound influence in giving color to the legendary lore of the middle Orient; and this combination of desert and mountain influences perhaps largely accounts for what is distinctively peculiar in the mysticism of the East, and for much that will be found in this book.Contents:I. - The Doom Of Al Zameri.II. - Sheddad’s Palace Of Irem.III. - The Mystery Of The Damavant.IV. - The Gods In ExileV. - King Solomon And Ashmodai.VI. - The Croesus Of Yemen.VII. - The Fate Of Arzemia.VIII. - The Student Of Timbuctu.IX. - A Night By The Dead Sea.",
