  "description": "Mila Simon is having a meltdown. Newly separated from her investment banker husband, she chain-smokes in her Jewish immigrant parentsâ€™ backyard in a New Jersey suburb while she plots her return to the Manhattan social scene. Ignoring the advice of therapists and well-meaning married friends, Mila embarks heart-first on a dangerous dating binge with a cell phone in one hand and a mojito in the other. Teetering on the edge the whole time, with only an opinionated Mama to rein her in, Mila is on a whirlwind quest for love and stability in the urban jungle.",
