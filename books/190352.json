  "description": "*** This book contains strong language, some violence, mature situations, and imagery that may be disturbing to some readers***Jessica Mead has lost everything, including her sanity. Her unstable mind is a treacherous place made all the more dangerous by her abilities. She is a Mancer, part of a race descended from angels that can harness the magic of the elements at will. Her only focus is finding Daniel though he’s been missing for over a year. But, when Bernal, the Headmaster of the Institute of M.E.R.C.E., offers her the help she needs to find the boy, she’s launched head first into a war that’s been raging for millions of years.With action, both pulse-pounding and darkly frightening, and humor, both sarcastic and absurd, M.E.R.C.E. is an engrossing multi-genre read with a powerful character journey at its center.",
