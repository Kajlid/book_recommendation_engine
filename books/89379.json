  "title": "The Devil in Gray",
  "description": "A young woman brutally hacked to pieces in her Virginia home—with a weapon over a hundred years old. A retired Army officer butchered—by an invisible attacker. A young man blinded in his bathtub—then boiled alive. What do all the victims have in common? What malevolent nightmare stalked them? He is not dead, but not truly living. He cannot be killed, only trapped. And for years he was trapped, buried alive in a desperate attempt to end the terror. But now he is free again, free to complete his ghastly mission—free to slaughter the unsuspecting. Is he a spirit? An immortal madman? Was he ever human? What is . . . the devil in gray?",
