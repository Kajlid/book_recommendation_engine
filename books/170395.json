  "title": "Grace in Practice: A Theology of Everyday Life",
  "description": "Long captivated by the idea of one-way love or Gods grace, Paul Zahl has often contended with accusations of being long on grace but short on law. Grace in Practice begins with Zahls response to the classic tension between law and grace. He then sets up the four pillars of his own theology of grace: humanity, salvation, Christ, and the Holy Spirit in the Trinity. Having discussed grace in theological terms, Zahl goes on to address the practicality of grace, developing a systematic theology of grace that is radically understood from the Bible and consistently applied to everyday life. After helpfully narrowing down specific fields of grace, asserting throughout that grace always trumps both law and church, Zahl concludes with an expanded view of grace in everything, extending this good news to all creation.",
