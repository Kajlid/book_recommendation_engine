  "description": "When Daniel arrives in America to begin his undergraduate education, he was looking to break from an upbringing in isolation at a missionary school, and maybe even learn something - or anything at all - about his father, the international man of mystery. He soon discovers America surpasses his expectations as he is introduced to the full range of freedoms afforded by his new environment. A faulty family he ran away from is substituted with a host family of peculiar benefits. Meanwhile a new revelation threatens to shatter his treasured hopes about his father, risking everything he has gained, tasted, and loved in the new country. Nina is a gorgeous stay-at-home MD, who gave up her medical career to be a dedicated full-time mother to her children. So was everyone led to believe. She has secretly been resenting the lost dreams and meaning for life as her grown children leave home to go to school. The new-found freedom and a new addition to the family, an international student matched to be her son's college roommate, introduce passion and possibilities in the otherwise stale and dull life in Edina, MN. Can she explore and rekindle the thrills of her youth and reclaim her life force without risking her comfortable and secure life? This book is intended for mature audiences.",
