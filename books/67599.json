  "description": "Living a life that straddles the virtual and the real, enmeshed in technology and inspired by it, Param is a young man in the city. In his world, the virtual is as real as reality itself. But when a friend asks Param what he would do if he had just seven days to live, he answers, 'I would go to the Himalayas.'Intrigued by his own response, Param sets out on a journey to the Himalayas, the land of his ancestors. En route, he makes an unscheduled stop at a village - one that would change his life. The village turns out to be a place of adventure, and home to a number of compelling characters, from the wise Suyash the Cobbler to the cheeky young boys Chilli and Polta, the kind farmer Kisanji and the endearing dog Poppy. Param discovers the joys of a simpler way of life. But can he resist the pull of his home world?Thought-provoking and heart-warming, Param is a fable about the many worlds we dwell in and the many masks we wear.",
