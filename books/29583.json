  "description": "NY Times Bestselling Author CD Reiss, writing as Christine D. Rice Fashion designer Jeremy St. James is everything Laura Carnegie could want in a man. He's gorgeous, rich, and talented. The fact that everyone says he's completely unavailable doesn't stop her from dreaming of being in her boss's arms. As a matter of fact, she suspects his inaccessibility is part of his charm. When Jeremy's backer is found dead in his office and he's accused of the crime, he trusts Laura, and only Laura, with the keys to the design room. She wants him back and out of jail, and in the process of exposing a counterfeiting ring and finding the real killer, she uncovers the secretive man under the temperamental artist; a man who is most definitely available, and a man who might not be that inaccessible after all. If you love Project Runway, or enjoyed The Devil Wears Prada, try Dead Is the New Black. ---------- Laura Carnegie Mysteries Dead Is the New Black Death Of A Supermodel A Dress To Die For",
