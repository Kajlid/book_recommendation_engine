  "title": "President Donald Trump Inaugural Speech",
  "description": "America has elected its 45th President, Donald J. Trump.  This self-made business magnate worked his way to the most powerful office in the nation, running on a platform that emphasized the \"forgotten men and women\" of the nation, promising that they would be \"forgotten no longer.\"  Social media hashtags like #MAGA (Make America Great Again) and #AmericaFirst were met with both enthusiasm and disdain by his supporters and detractors, but in the end Donald Trump triumphed over his opponent, Hillary Clinton, and his long fought campaign was rewarded with victory.  This ebook contains the complete transcript of his inaugural speech, delivered just after 12 noon in Washington D.C. on January 20th, 2017.",
