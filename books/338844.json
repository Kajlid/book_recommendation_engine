  "title": "Tales of MU",
  "description": "Tales of MU is a fiction series... or perhaps a serial novel... or perhaps a webcomic without any pictures... about Mackenzie Blaise, an eighteen year old freshman girl living in Harlowe Hall at Magisterius University. It's partly a slice-of-life story, inspired by my own college experiences and those of people I've known, but Magisterius University is not exactly an ordinary school... and Harlowe Hall is not a normal dormitory... and Mackenzie Blaise is certainly not an average girl.",
