  "description": "Beautiful women... JPEGS, recreational drugs... pharmaceuticals, and elite fraternities... websites - this isn't the college scene that Victor Hastings expected. Victor likes to admire the provocative pictures of the girls he's dating. Meanwhile, these girls are posting more and more on Facebook and all the social sites. Now, all the men in his fraternity are competing for the attention of these online, amateur pinups. Three women will make an impact on Victor. Erin Masters is an alluring yet na√Øve co-ed. Despite outward modesty, she has no reservations about letting friends plaster her provocative images across various websites. Emily Green-Portsmith, on the other hand, comes from wealth and is comparatively more aware of her effect on men. The influence of these women does not sit well with the house mother of these fraternity boys. Affectionately known as Ma Red, this feisty former Vietnam correspondent from the old-school of etiquette and discipline is prepared to make a fight for her traditional values. And throughout these discoveries, Victor wonders: What kind of love is this?... the wired kind.[image]",
