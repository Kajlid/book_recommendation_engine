All she knows is what she has been told: she’s fifteen, and thanks to a run-in with a bison bull she is stuck with a brain injury. The rest of her life is a blank her brain no longer fills in; she struggles with memory loss and a temper she can’t control. When the doctors send Jessica home, she tries desperately to piece together her shattered life. No matter how hard she tries, she can’t be the old Jessie everyone misses so much. Then a new friend comes along with an alternative to staying in her old life, and Jessica must confront the reality of what it means to truly leave her past behind.",
