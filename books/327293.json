  "title": "Backyard Politics: Today's Divide and a Parenting Style to Bring Us Together",
  "description": "Our political system is fiercely divided. Political differences are fracturing families, separating friends, and even introducing tensions in casual encounters. Many of our elected officials are resorting to vilification, accusation, and open hostility as a way to gain control over the political narrative. For over forty years, Dr. Craig Wiener, a Clinical Psychologist, has helped individuals and families resolve their difficulties. He uses his approach to conflict resolution to clarify political disagreements and lessen animosity while promoting a healthy strategy that works as well in the public sphere as it does at home.In the last segment of the book, Dr. Wiener encourages parenting methods that help children do less blaming of others, and he shows parents how to resolve family conflicts in healthy ways. Parents and children gain the resources to better care for themselves by cooperating as a family and become more adept at mediating social friction in the outside world. Backyard Politics is a must-read for families seeking to navigate a divided world with peace and stability.",
