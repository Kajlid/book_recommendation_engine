When Dedric is sent to spy on his mother’s clan, the MacLellans, the knight is forced to choose between the oath he swore to the man who stole him from his clan and the country that calls him home but where he knows no one.  \nA Scottish lass in love with an English knight...\n  Isabella Dunbar has served Robert the Bruce’s court for eight years as a lady-in-waiting and a peace offering from her father to a king he once challenged. When Isabella has two chance meetings with Dedric, they recognize an undeniable attraction that could place them both in danger. Questionable allegiances threaten to drive a wedge between the young couple as their lives take them back to the Scottish-English border and into the heart of a war for Scottish independence.  Will either side accept their union, or will a battle between two kings tear them apart?  Read for FREE with Kindle Unlimited!",
