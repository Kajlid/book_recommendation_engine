  "title": "Journey Untold My Mother's Struggle with Mental Illnesses: Bipolar, paranoid schizophrenia, or other forms of mental illness is debilitating for everyone including the families left to try to cope",
  "description": "This trans-formative book grips readers from the beginning and takes you on an emotional ride through the eyes of a child of a mother suffering with schizophrenia as she matures into womanhood. Journey Untold will make you laugh, make you cry, and most importantly spark a conversation about how people can cope with lifeâ€™s challenges.Mental illness is something that is still not talked about in the many communities, but especially in communities of color, like the one I grew up in, in the U.S. Virgin Islands. This memoir offers a look at mental illness from my perspective as the child of a mother suffering from the effects of schizophrenia. My hope is that this book will help to remove the shame associated with this disease and that a discussion can take place in personal circles about the harm that is done when we keep silent about unpopular disorders for fear of shame, retribution, or bullying. Mental illness is real; its consequences are shattering; and the lives left to pick up the pieces can only be rebuilt with truth and acceptance.",
