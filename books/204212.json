  "description": "This fiftieth-anniversary edition commemorates Chaim Potok’s coming-of-age classic about two Jewish boys growing up in Brooklyn in the 1940s, and includes a new introduction, critical essays, rare papers and photos, and much more.It’s the spring of 1944 and fifteen-year-olds Reuven Malter and Danny Saunders have lived five blocks apart all their lives. But they’ve never met, not until the day an accident during a softball game sparks an unlikely friendship. Soon these two boys—one expected to become a Hasidic rebbe, the other at ease with secular America—are drawn into one another’s worlds despite one father’s strong opposition.Set against the backdrop of WWII and the creation of the state of Israel, The Chosen is a poignant novel about transformation and tradition, growing up and growing wise, and finding yourself—even if that might mean leaving your community.",
