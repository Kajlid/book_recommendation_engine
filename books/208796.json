Inequality thrives as the people of Dian subjugate and control the 'dregs' of Carcer. While Mia Mitexi questions Dian's oppressive rules, she knows there is little one person can do. A chance meeting with Sol Victus, a lowly dreg from Carcer, will force them both to face truths and consequences neither of them could have expected. These things cannot long be hidden and their world will change forever.",
