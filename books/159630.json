  "description": "Stuntman and two-time cancer survivor Memphis Haines excels at beating the odds. When he's presented with the opportunity to help his ex-boyfriend with a charity event, he jumps at the chance to make up for the devastating way he left Tyler ten years ago. Memphis might have taken the college geek's virginity, but the former mathelete is now a hell of a head turner. And Dr. Tyler Hall's cool reserve is a challenge Memphis can't resist. A self-confessed rule breaker and line crosser, he'll keep turning up the heat with a single goal in mind: to melt the man's composure. Tyler Hall sticks to one simple mandate: no more dating ex-boyfriends. Ever. He certainly isn't interested in hooking up with Memphis Haines, the ex who jumps off buildings, dodges explosions, and poses for designer underwear ads. Ten years ago, falling for Memphis changed Tyler's life. The man's abrupt departure turned his world inside out. But he moved on long ago. Besides, he has a clinic for the homeless to run, patients to take care of, and no time to deal with the trouble his ex brings. Memphis, however, seems determined to rehash the past. And his boxer-dropping grin, hard body, and confident charm are resurrecting ultra-hot memories best not remembered, making Tyler's rule harder and harder to keepâ€¦ CONTENT WARNING: This book contains Man-on-Man action, adult situations and *ahem* language.",
