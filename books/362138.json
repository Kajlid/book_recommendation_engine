All that mattered was staying safe in our bubble, but it was both a sanctuary and a prison.That is, until two confident, protective strangers swooped in to save our lives. They warned us of an approaching swarm of the undead, then swept us away to a shelter called the Oasis.We were safer than ever before, and I managed to get space away from the betrayers.

Just in time for those three men to make me feel things I’d never felt before.It took two betrayals and the end of the world, but maybe my love life wasn’t as rotten as I’d thought.My Rotten Love Life is a zombie apocalypse whychoose novel with a HEA.
