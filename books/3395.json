  "title": "Bani's Dilemma",
  "description": "Bani Chamberlain has spent years trying to convince her parents that she's not the bully, but the one being bullied. They, however, are so wrapped up in their own marital problems that they refuse to hear Bani's pleas for help. It's not until her parent's split up after a late night confrontation that almost comes to blows, does Bani finally find someone who will listen to her. Bani, a self-professed LGBTQ teen and rebel, takes us into her world, telling her story directly to us, her readers. She will take us on a very honest, often times painful, journey. Will Bani ever be able to overcome her bullies? Will she find her voice? Only Bani knows those answers.",
