  "description": "Organizations provide mind-boggling compensations to their leaders as compared to an average employee. Is it because they work more?Just like the saying ‘we are the decisions we make’, the very existence of an organization depends on the decisions its leaders make! Decision-making is not just a process. It is an interplay among competitive strategies, processes, design, values and culture. Narrating the experiences of industry decision-makers, the book demonstrates that organizational decision-making is about making tough choices―navigating through a minefield of biases and execution issues. It walks the readers through the challenges faced by every decision-maker and how these decisions affect the organization. It also goes on to lay out a series of tools that readers can immediately use to enhance their organizational decision-making skills. From analysing key decisions of the past to shaping new ones, this book will equip readers with effective strategies that will allow them to become an integral part of their organization’s decision-making environment. Businesses are always on the lookout for effective decision-makers. Whether you are looking to move up the career ladder or do well in your personal life, with How Leaders Decide you will be well on your way!",
