  "title": "The Gift: A Contemporary Christmas Carol",
  "description": "Nineteen-year-old Carol is homeless and pregnant, trying to survive on the streets. Neglected for years by her father she runs away from home when she is sixteen and soon finds herself used and abused by others. Carol has no more faith in humanity, no belief in love and human kindness. Tim is a young boy, small for his age. He is virtually ignored by his mother except for when she beats him. Left to freeze in the garden on Christmas Eve as his mother entertains her friends he is taken in by Martha - a woman who has lived many decades and seen many changes in the world, and has finally grown weary of it. On a cold Christmas Eve, when the offer of a bed for the festive period turns out to be too good to be true, Carol finds herself in the middle of nowhere during a fierce blizzard. Sick with ‘flu and in the throes of a difficult labour, she finds a barn to shelter in, and, as the fever takes hold, drifts in and out of consciousness, her dreams haunted by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future. As the spirits try to show Carol that goodness still exists in the world, Martha plans the ultimate Christmas gift - a gift that could save the lives of Carol, her baby and Tim - a new ‘nativity’ to inspire the jaded and selfish hearts of the modern world.\n“Weaving together elements of the biblical Nativity and Dicken’s most famous Christmas story - The Gift is a contemporary, and sometimes dark, tale of love, hope and the endearing spirit of Christmas.”",
