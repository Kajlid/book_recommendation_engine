  "title": "The Book of Extremely Common Prayer",
  "description": "Here’s proof that God is all ears, whether it be a matter of life or death or simply a minor traffic violation. EXTREMELY COMMON PRAYER avoids the stilted language and dated pleas of 2,000-year-old Judeo-Christian phraseology in favor of modern day petitions that talk to God as if he were truly “one of us.”Comparing your size 10 figure with Cameron Diaz? Having second thoughts about skydiving with your cousin Aaron? Why not ask God to give you a hand? EXTREMELY COMMON PRAYER is here to help.From the practical to the ethereal, from pop culture to polemics, EXTREMELY COMMON PRAYER reminds us that man is just a fallible creature with lots of wants and needs, most of which won’t be met in his time on earth. But it can’t hurt to ask.",
