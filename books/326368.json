  "title": "Electric Jesus Corpse",
  "description": "By the age of 18, Carlton Mellick III had already written over a dozen novels. The only of these books to make it to print was Electric Jesus Corpse , an ambitious (though incredibly rough) epic novel that showcased a young writer's gift for imaginative weirdness. This book is recommended for Mellick fans who want to experience his early amateur work. The twisted and surreal version of the story of Jesus Christ set in a bizarre version of modern day Earth that has been ravaged by war and cannibal zombie plagues, where the landscape is slowly mutating into meat and human flesh is transforming into machine. The novel follows Christ's twelve apostles. However, in this world the apostles are pimps, necrophiliacs, skinheads, and other assorted freaks. And they have no desire to follow Jesus Christ on his crusade to save humanity whatsoever. So this novel follows the lives of these never-been apostles on their separate epic journeys into the bizarre. An awkward and chaotic work of art that is like nothing you've ever seen.",
