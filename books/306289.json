  "description": "This is a story of a total reset of my life. It is about a divine intervention. I had a battery of medical test done and was given a clean bill of health. It was Friday in mid- August. The plan was to go up to Lake Erie and fish for white bass, or at least that was my plan. It turned out that the Lord had a different plan. You see, a few hours after I left my cardiologist office, I was in the emergency room. A few hours after that I was in full cardiac arrest, dead. I was dead for 12 minutes. During those minutes the Lord reviewed my life with me. He fixed some things in my life while I lay there and, then He assigned some things to me to fix. In addition, he gave me this book. He dictated it to me from the title to the last word. Now, understand that this is not the entirety of the shenanigans in my life. There are a lot more. The rest will remain between Him and me. What is written here is intended for the children of God, especially men, as both an example of God's mercy and guidance, and also a warning of how sin and disobedience can lead to many evils including generational curses, misses purpose and even death. I hope that this intimate look into my life will act as a beacon pointing the way to the Lord of redemption, reconciliation and resurrection. I pray and believe that this book blesses you as much as it has blessed me.",
