  "description": "Buckle your seatbelt for the first-ever follow up to Ian Fleming’s only children’s story.When the Tooting family finds an old engine and fits it to their camper van, they have no idea what kind of adventure lies ahead. The engine used to belong to an extraordinary car . . . and it wants its bodywork back! But as the Tootings hurtle across the world rebuilding the original Chitty, a sinister baddie is on their trail -- one who will stop at nothing to get the magnificent car for himself.Fueled by wry humor, this much-anticipated sequel to the children’s classic by Ian Fleming, creator of James Bond -- featuring a contemporary family and a camper van with a mind of its own -- is driven by best-selling, award-winning author Frank Cottrell Boyce and revved up by Joe Berger’s black-and-white illustrations.",
