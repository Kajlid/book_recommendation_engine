  "description": "I recommended inspired action and auto suggestion practice instead of hard work and unmotivated actives. First question when you get up every morning will be what I feel inspired to do today. If you are not inspired to any action, you might even go for a walk. Most of the time you get inspired is when you are not thinking about any particular thing, (quite time) ideas and auto suggestions hit you like a bullet. This book will teach you the art of self-analyze, self- empowerment, trust, confidence, and happiness. To set an intention for your day and then an affirmation and then to tap away any resistance you feel. You can scientifically measure you feelings before and after your expanding, keep on expanding until you have the desired feelings in your body. I choose that my day be filled with wonders, surprises, excitement and delight. I choose that today and everyday people and power of nature bring good news and lots of money drop into my business and bank accounts. I choose to take inspired action and to take life light and easy. I choose to co-create with the Universe and to trust, allow and receive. I choose to allow abundance to appear in my life with ease and grace.",
