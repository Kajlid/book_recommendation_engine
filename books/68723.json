  "description": "While on a business trip Layne Stone learns that she has been dumped by her partner of six years. Hurt, angry—a little tipsy she takes solace in the arms of a stranger. The brief encounter made going home to New Orleans and starting a new life a bit less daunting for Layne. Stacy Mayeaux was unaccustomed to waking up alone in a hotel room. Normally, she was the one that crept out before the light of morning crept in. But the woman who’d left an indelible mark upon her soul simply walked away without so much as a phone number or a kiss goodbye. Neither woman thought they’d ever cross paths, but irony proves them wrong. Layne and Stacy meet face-to-face once again in the most unfortunate of circumstances and the pull between them is simply Magnetic.",
