  "description": "A festive addition to the Heart of Stone series. This novella is an accompaniment to the Heart of Stone series and shouldn’t be read until all the books in the collection have been read.  Spend Christmas with the Fox’s and their friends.  Mason’s his usual grumpy self and Ava is going all out, celebrating a Christmas she never thought she would see. However, spending the festive period in the Scottish cottage during a snowstorm is of course more fun for us than it is for the NSC squad, especially since Katie brought along her boyfriend who has a nasty habit of winding Mason up. Courtney has a surprise planned for all and Liv and Nate have news. But bring the crew together, and nothing matters so long as it’s a Christmas spent having fun, drinking lots of alcohol, oh and spending time in the notorious hot tub.  Add a couple of surprise visitors and a bump in the night and it’s a Christmas only the Fox’s know how to do.  This book contains scenes of explicit sex, including M/M/F/F and M/M",
