  "description": "Equal parts William Burroughs’ Naked Lunch, David Mitchell’s Cloud Atlas and Murakami’s After Dark, this is a story about a world gone numb, a world in which pain is the only thing that's real.From Literary Death Match champion Dan Holloway, this is a novel that cuts away the surface of modern society to expose every raw nerve underneath and puts the most important question of the internet why are there some images we just can’t look away from, while others fade before we ever noticed they were there?When mysterious Polish woman Agnieszka Iwanowa's tragi-comic death in a gym accident is uploaded to YouTube, the film's final image of her upturned trainers is the image on every student’s wall, rehashed by everyone from right wing extremists to a reclusive installation artist who only speaks through his dominatrix PA.Now graphic artist Dan Griffiths has to make the image fresh for the world’s biggest magazine’s review of the year.Dan’s obsession with Agnieszka soon overtakes his search for his own daughter, missing for ten years, ignored by the media, and now sending him - and the reader - glimpses of messages from what seems like another world. Dan’s journey sucks him into the worlds of political extremism; BDSM; a haiku-composing graffiti artist; an online community devoted to the dead girl, and its reclusive Japanese schoolboy moderator who has just paid half a million dollars for the diary of a scientist whose work he believes will enable him to bring Agnieszka back from the dead.All royalties from the sale of The Man Who Painted Agnieszka's Shoes, in paperback or ebook format, fin perpetuity, will go to The British Red Cross Tsunami Relief Fund",
