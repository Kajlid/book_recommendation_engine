But when the Queen of the Unbothered kisses Malakai Korede, the guy she just publicly denounced as \"The Wastemen of Whitewell,\" in front of every Blackwellian on campus, she finds her show on the brink.They're soon embroiled in a fake relationship to try and salvage their reputations and save their futures. Kiki has never surrendered her heart before, and a player like Malakai won't be the one to change that, no matter how charming he is or how electric their connection feels.

Is she ready to open herself up to something deeper?A gloriously funny and sparkling debut novel, Honey and Spice is full of delicious tension and romantic intrigue that will make you weak at the knees.",
