  "description": "Elle Davis is a hopeless romantic, an epic daydreamer, and best friend to party girl Abi. Oh, and she’s also a twenty-three-year-old virgin. She has always dreamed of love at first sight and the fairy-tale ending; however, as the burden of her virginity increases, so does her sexual curiosity…In her mission to find Mr Right, Elle inevitably stumbles across Mr Wrong. Following a chance encounter with a colleague, she decides to take the first steps…Luke Simms is funny, sexy and cocksure with as much baggage as the lost luggage department at Heathrow airport. He doesn’t do commitment, but he does offer Elle the experience she craves. Ben Newman is romantic, witty and drop-dead gorgeous. He is also chasing the fairy tale. But after a string of dating disasters, he’s ready to give up on the dream and end the search. Find out if Elle saves Luke Simms from his mission of self-destruct or if she ends Ben Newman’s search for his fairy tale…WarningThis novel contains strong language, particularly from a senior citizen who is old enough to know better, and a wild girl who frankly doesn’t give a f**k. There are also descriptions of sex, therefore this novel is only suitable for 18+This is the first book in the Music and Letters series but can be read as a standalone.",
