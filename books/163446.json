  "description": "Mr. Dickens writes from his experiences using the principles of sowing, reaping and harvesting. \"It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it. You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful. A tow so sacred in fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, or course got on well? Why no, not quite well.\" Dickens's classic critique of utilitarian fact and grime in a 19th century mill town. (from the back cover)",
