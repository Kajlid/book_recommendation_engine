He is now a young man, facing the same persecution and spiritual questions that his entire family has struggled against for years. Loyal to his family, Angus must match wits in a life-and-death struggle against Highlanders. By faith, Angus turns his beloved game of chess into a tool of victory. But desperate fear grips the Clan with an unexpected murder! Will Covenanters be found guilty? Angus's true test of manhood and marksmanship will come at the Battle of Drumclog!
