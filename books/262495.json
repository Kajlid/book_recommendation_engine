  "description": "Quinton Wyatt's summer break before high school should be nothing but wall-to-wall fun. Instead, his best friend has stopped talking to him; his fiendish older sister has filled his head with tales of a sadistic high school ritual called \"The Freshman Stomp\"; and his divorced father has started dating the city's most notorious barfly. Maybe a robot rabbit and a boy from his past can help salvage Quinton's vacation and launch him into the difficult — but often hilarious — world of young adulthood.",
