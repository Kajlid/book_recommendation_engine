  "title": "Rise of Rouhn",
  "description": "Through the darkness that lay spread out before him, lightning suddenly sprang forth and raced across the clouds to a single point above the tree. In a blinding flash of light and thunder, a lightning bolt bigger than anything Devin had ever seen slammed into the tree, exploding the mighty oak. Smoking shards of wood flung into the sky in all directions and rained down splintery burning shrapnel everywhere, sending Devin toppling over backward.Being an orphan, Devin never had a clue where he'd come from, much less where he was headed. The Festival of Lights was approaching, and the masters of all local trades would convene from far and near to choose their apprentices. Was he destined for a life of hard work in the clay mines? He longed to be free, but was he meant for something more? Who would choose him? Accompanied by his best friend, John, little did Devin know events that transpired ages ago were going to directly affect their future, and the future of all humanity. Rise of Rouhn is the first book of a trilogy that is fast-paced, with a rich complex story, and one that you will want to read twice. Whereas, this work has been written with adults and young adults in mind, it is recommended that due to graphic battles and difficult plotlines, the reader should be at least 9th grade or 15 years of age. This book is not suitable for small children.",
