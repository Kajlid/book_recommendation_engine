  "description": "Meet Tony - a modern everyman. All he cares about is smoking pot and watching old movies until late with his girlfriend, Marina. He is troubled not just by a series of dead-end jobs in start-ups with absurd names, neurotic bosses, and a giant cybernetic creature that haunts his dreams, but also by the strange noises coming from the apartment upstairs. And then there is Berlin - at times nightmarish and unsympathetic, at others seductive and compassionate.",
