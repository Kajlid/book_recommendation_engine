  "description": "The ghost haunting Karlee Davis is tormented by amnesia. When Karlee finds work in a small coastal community setting up a weekly newspaper, the location jogs the ghost's memory and triggers violent visions from its past. A severe storm brings Cole Maxwell, the commitment-challenged landlord living in the marina, off the water and inside. He and Karlee share their accommodation while repairs are completed on his boat. Cole's interest in Karlee makes him hyper-vigilant, and it doesn't take long before he discovers the ghost. The more Karlee learns about the ghost's background, the less certain she is of her own. She'll have to trust her instincts to find everyone a peaceful ever after...if she can exorcise the dark creature manipulating them all.",
