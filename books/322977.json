To save both our lives, I’m calling in every favor and debt owed to me.I’ll travel through realms.I’ll tussle with mythical creatures. And I’ll hand over the things I value most– even if it means playing right into Lucifer’s hands.I never could have imagined I’d risk everything for a demon.

And I protect what’s mine. ♥ If you like K.F Breene, Ilona Andrews, Patricia Briggs, Faith Hunter, Laurell K.
