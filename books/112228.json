The zombie apocalypse occurred two years ago, and there is a demand for people willing to work with this strange and sometimes foul-smelling population of the un-dead.When Rose meets Leah Smart, a soon-to-be zombie who is working at the Crispy Biscuit, her life gets very complicated. She ends up forming uneasy alliances with a zombie hunter and an undercover zombie. Her car is stolen, her house is under siege, and one of her clients is kidnapped. If that isn’t enough, she becomes the object of desire for two alpha males, though she doesn’t have the time or inclination to date either one.When she isn’t busy saving clients during the day, she is haunted by dreams of her Uncle Walter as she sleeps at night. He stalks her in her dreams, often falling apart right before her eyes, just as he had done in real life.It is a race to the finish to find out who wants to keep the zombie population growing, and how far they are willing to go to in order to keep their plans of world domination a secret.",
