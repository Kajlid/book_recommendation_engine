There are whispers that witches may hold answers, but rumours help no one.Wielders of elemental magic, descendants of gods and now existing solely in secret, the witches have been hunted to near extinction by the Varúlf, dangerous werewolf shifters.Facing an extinction of their own, the Varúlf have turned to desperate measures to try and ensure their own survival - at any cost. But it has been decades since a witch was last seen…… until one ventures far from the safety of her coven on a once-in-a-lifetime errand for an important ritual, only to find herself in the grasp of the one Varúlf unwilling to imprison her.When Isa meets Braun on a hotel rooftop, she doesn’t know the danger she is in.
