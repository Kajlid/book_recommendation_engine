  "description": "[Siren Classic: Erotic Historical Romance, time travel] It's said love is timeless. Meghan Dennehy and Will Thornton are about to prove it. Uncomfortable in her world, Meghan seeks happiness between the pages of romance novels or in the world built in her dreams. She longs for a place to belong and a love of her own. The antiques of the past hold far more interest than the fast-paced era she lives in. Over a hundred years in the past, Will Thornton, a half-breed former army scout is caught between two worlds. Passing for white, he does not forget his native heritage and proudly bears the name Ghost Walking, given to him by his grandfather. Still, his heart yearns for someone to love him for who and what he is. Fate intercedes to bring them together. But destiny isn't always kind, even to young lovers. It will take more than passion to bind them. It will take faith in a love that transcends time. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
