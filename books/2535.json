  "title": "The Racist",
  "description": "Emily was leery of Black men, but didn't consider herself any more racist than any other typical English girl. Until that day at the shore, when she found herself surrounded by them with nothing to hide her slender young body but her tiny bikini. Hours later, dazed, her mind trying to cope with what she had experienced, she found her thoughts and emotions twisting into hatred of Black men. And yet, over the days and weeks which followed her dark fantasies were filled with thoughts and memories of what she had experienced. Despite her hate, she placed herself placed in positions which made abuse inevitable, and so she was violated and abused in different circumstances by different Black men and gangs of Black men, and her hate for them grew as her lust grew in tandem with it. Yet there seemed no relief, for fire burned in her veins. And as much as she despised them she was almost unconsciously drawn to experience more humiliation and abuse at their hands.",
