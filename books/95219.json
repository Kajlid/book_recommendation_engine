Shattered in mind and soul, the former mage struggles in a constant battle with the mind of a young dragoness, Duskwing, who wishes control of their shared body. She is left with the haunting question of who and what she is. Is she the mage set upon by a false persona of a dragon, or a dragon set upon by the false persona of a human? And she soon finds out that not all of the Four Lords died in the war, there is another that still lives and he longs for revenge. Her only hope lies in the storm dragon, Sithen, who is forced to ally with the Jattar army in the hopes of penetrating the heavily populated Empire to rescue his fosterling. He takes command of their army through their leader, Baen, and reveals the secrets of his kind in the hopes that he will rescue the last female storm dragon in existence. He will risk all his pride and honor to bring her back, but soon realizes that it is not only pride and honor he has to lose. The humans pose a threat that he had never imagined.Best read after book one \"Captured by Fate\" but may be read alone, you won't be lost when snatched into the story.",
