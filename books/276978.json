That was all Julianne wanted. One last trip to escape the pressures of an arranged marriage to a man she doesn’t love and doesn’t even like. One last time to experience freedom… to go wherever she wanted to go, to be anyone she wanted to be.During her last two weeks in Paris, she met someone unexpected—an aspiring painter, Jas Mathieu. He was as handsome as hell and as sweet as heaven. He captured her heart, lit her fire, and consumed her soul.She wanted to give Jas every part of herself, but she was already promised to a powerful man who could easily ruin the simple life of the guy she fell in love with.

But because of this, her arranged engagement would also be broken, and her father would banish her from her luxurious life.Seven years later, after her father stripped her of her heiress title and privileges, she crossed paths with Jas Mathieu once again.And this time, she found out that he wasn’t exactly the struggling artist she thought he was. And he was no stranger to the family and social circle she belonged to.It turned out that years ago when they met... she wasn't the only one keeping secrets… and she wasn’t the only one who gave a fake name and a fake identity.",
