  "description": "Phaedra had always been different than the rest of her peers. Recently she started to accept that was just the way she was—a seeker of chaos and adventure. Nothing seemed to satisfy her insatiable hunger for the ill-behaved. When her brother can no longer handle her rebellious behavior, he makes a very harsh decision to send Phaedra to her estranged grandparents’ home on a Navajo Reservation in the middle of nowhere. Phaedra’s tenacious spirit is not willing to accept her brother’s rash decision. The minute her plane lands in Albuquerque, she quickly makes plans to escape. Her plans to run are easily thwarted when she looks into the ochre eyes of a man named Ebon who was sent by her grandparents to pick her up. He is bold and unusual, but in an entirely different way than Phaedra had ever seen before. Not only do Ebon’s strange good-looks easily suck Phaedra in, but so does the extraordinary connection she feels for him. Once in the small town of Ramah, New Mexico, strange things start to happen to Phaedra, things that couldn’t possibly be real. She is torn between leaving the man who effortlessly lured her there and the life she used to live. Little does Phaedra realize she is the key to the future of many who are just like her. Can Phaedra accept her preordained fate or does she fight it like everything else that has ever presented itself in her life? Can Ebon and Phaedra resist their powerful attraction for each other to obtain an unseen promise of something so much more rewarding?",
