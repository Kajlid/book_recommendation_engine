[A] saga of a brutal, bloody, bewildering year in the Baltimore Police Department's homicide unit . . . This is interior reporting at its finest.\" Associated Press\"We seem to have an insatiable appetite for police stories . . . . David Simon's entry is far and away the best, the most readable, reliable and relentless of them all . . . . An eye for the scenes of slaughter and pursuit and an ear for the cadences of cop talk, both business and banter, lend Simon's account . . . the fascination that truth often has . . . . Fueled by coffee, cigarettes and the drive to 'put down' (i.e., close) cases, these heroes keep at it long after ordinary mortals would have lost heart.\" The Washington Post\"This may be the best true-crime book, the best naked look at murder and cops and crime and life on the killing streets of big-city America in the late 20th century . . . . A rich, revealing look at the twisted lives of killers and their victims and at the men who are obsessed with solving the most heinous and baffling murders.\" San Diego Union",
