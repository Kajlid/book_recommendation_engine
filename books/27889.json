  "description": "Revised 2022Saul can control dreams, not just his dreams but dreams of people he comes in contact with. At first, he is not aware of what he can do and does not understand why people act strangely when he gets angry. When he goes away to boarding school, he inadvertently calls for help from his Spirit Guide. His Spirit Guide teaches Saul about his gift and alerts him about danger from the Man who wants the gift. His paranoid warnings turn out to be true when the Man finds Saul after finishing school. Had Saul listened, then the nightmares that the Man creates for his pleasure and gain would not have happened. To end the nightmares, Saul must solve a poorly written “riddle” before it’s too late. Saul enlists Marcie, a newly divorced nurse who works at the Lakeside Sanitarium, to help him stop the Man. He tells her the story of how he came to be at the Lakeside Sanitarium and the nightmares the Man created using Saul’s power to his advantage. When she awakes, she thinks it was all just a dream.",
