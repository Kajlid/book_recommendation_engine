  "title": "Le Morte d'Arthur: King Arthur and the Legends of the Round Table",
  "description": "THE BIRTH OF CHIVALRYThe rousing epic of King Arthur and his court has had a lasting effect on the traditions and literature of the English-speaking peoples. These well-known tales represent the bridge between pagan and Christian, Druid and Dominus. Arthur emerges at the end of the Roman Empire and the beginning of a British nation.Keith Baines's splendid new rendition of Le Morte d' Arthur faithfully preserves the original flavor of Malory's masterpiece--that of banners and bloodshed, knights and ladies, Christians and sorcerers, sentiment and savagery. It remains a vivid, medieval tapestry woven about a central figure who symbolizes the birth of an age of chivalry.",
