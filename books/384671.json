  "description": "Blending suspense, compassion, raw instinct, and grim wit, Denise Mina's Resolution completes her compelling Garnethill trilogy (which includes two New York Times Book Review Notable Books of the Year) that Val McDermid, author of A Place of Execution, calls \"head and shoulders above much of contemporary crime fiction.\" In her gripping new crime novel, Mina returns once more to the seamier precincts of Glasgow and the untidy world of the hapless but resolute Maureen O'Donnell. Maureen's abusive father has shown up again in Glasgow; and Angus Farrell, the psychologist who so gruesomely murdered her therapist-boyfriend, is going on trialâ€”with Maureen as the star witness. Meanwhile, she's embroiled in another hard-bitten family's feud when Ella McGee, an elderly stallholder at the flea market where Maureen sells illegally imported cigarettes, decides to take her son to small-claims court over unpaid wages and then turns up beaten brutally in Albert Hospital. Violence hovers in the most familiar precincts of Maureen's Garnethill, and Denise Mina once again proves herself to be an award-winning writer.",
