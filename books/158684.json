  "description": "I’ve always been fascinated by ghosts. They’re simply lost souls looking for the conclusion to their story. After years of chasing the phantom of Stone into the night, I’ve sought to live and love again in the new chapter of my life. I’m not the naïve girl I once was. I know what I want, what I need. But like the tortured spirits wandering the earth, can I find the happy ending I crave or will the apparitions of the past destroy any chance of everlasting bliss?",
