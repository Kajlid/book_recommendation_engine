  "title": "Lady Audley's Secret",
  "description": "Lady Audley's Secret (1862) was one of the most widely read novels of the Victorian period. It exemplifies \"sensation fiction\" in featuring a beautiful criminal heroine, an amateur detective, blackmail, arson, violence, and plenty of suspenseful action. To its contemporary readers, it also offered the thrill of uncovering blackmail and criminal violence within the homes of the upper class. The novel makes trenchant critiques of Victorian gender roles and social stereotypes, and Braddon deliberately creates significant sympathy for her criminal heroine, who rebels against the \"marriage market.\"",
