  "description": "In this fourth installment of The Flute Keeper Saga, Emma Wren struggles to support Princess Chloe against the tide of animosity that threatens her rule of Faylinn. With the date of her formal induction to the clergy drawing near, Emma also faces an identity crisis. Is she really meant to be a priestess, or should she strike out on her own and incur the wrath of the clergy and the Seelie Court? Meanwhile, Levâ€™s secret past catches up to him in a way that could drive a wedge between him and Emma forever. The castle is no longer the safe haven it once was. Enemies are closing in, poised to fulfill their roles as players in a much more sinister game than anyone realizes. When all hope is lost and her allies are out of reach, Emma is forced to confront the two things she fears the most: her own power, and losing the ones she loves.",
