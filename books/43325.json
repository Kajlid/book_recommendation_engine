  "description": "From the cover:\"Here again, as in Decline and Fall, we are in the fashionable Mayfair of the twenties, when the Bright Young Things execised their inventive minds (and Vile Bodies) in every kind or capricious escapade. The plot is an adroit jigsaw of amusing situations; the characters a vivid assortment of those who inhabit the socia domain that lies between Park Land and Bond Street.\"",
