Tennal, like all neuromodified “readers,” is a security threat on his own. But when controlled, readers are a rare asset. Not only can they read minds, but they can navigate chaotic space, the maelstroms surrounding the gateway to the wider universe.Conscripted into the military under dubious circumstances, Tennal is placed into the care of Lieutenant Surit Yeni, a duty-bound soldier, principled leader, and the son of a notorious traitor general.

Like all other neuromodified “architects,” he can impose his will onto others, and he’s under orders to control Tennal by merging their minds.Surit accepted a suspicious promotion-track request out of desperation, but he refuses to go through with his illegal orders to sync and control an unconsenting Tennal.

The only way to avoid life under full military control is to complete the very sync they've been faking.Can two unwilling weapons of war bring about peace?",
