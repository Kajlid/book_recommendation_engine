But when I get there, things get hard. Pun intended. It’s impossible to ignore the intense, blue eyes gazing at me from the group of women on stage being sold to the highest bidder. Something primal ignites inside me the longer I stare at her. She needs me to protect her. On a snap decision, I place a bid and before I know it I own her. But she has a secret. And I won’t stop until I figure out what it is and claim her as mine. No refunds. Proceed With Caution: Instalove. Hired hitman. Girl in danger. Funny, clever banter. Racing across town on his Harley. Longing looks. Bits of humor. Tattooed, overprotective hero with an unusual hobby. A heroine who has a mind of her own and won’t take no for an answer. Finger-banging fun times. Skirts on the edge of reality. Epic bedroom scenes. Heat Level: Molten.Action: Page-turning Suspense. HEA: Always.",
