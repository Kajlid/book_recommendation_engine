Sticking to what I was good at seemed...illogical as often as I ended up in the ER.Then my occupational hazard began to feel like more of a perk when I met, Katy. She was a night nurse at the ER I frequented.

He knew I hated him on sight, but still, he teased me and tried to sway me.There's no way it would work. I was on the run and still healing from a relationship with a 'roid-raging powerlifter. No way was I going to give it a go with someone trained to cause pain for a living.Then my ex tracked me down. And suddenly, having a fighter in my corner didn't seem like such a bad idea.",
