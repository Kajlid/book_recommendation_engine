  "description": "Some memories are best left buried.World War II. Nazi-occupied France. Marcy, the old executioner’s daughter, has suffered a shattering loss, which takes her back when she lost her first love, Jehanne, in a manor fire. Devastated by her grief over the years, Marcy has languished in a catatonic state. That is, until she hears about women dying—seemingly being drained of blood in their bathtubs and then carried to their beds. Not willing to let others grieve or die, Marcy takes the investigation into her own hands. Her findings also dredge up memories of the Twenties and the two potentially deadly women she had taken as lovers in Paris, culminating in a bizarre and perilous chase. A distant sequel to Dove Keeper, Birds in a Cage is a sensual and macabre cross between Agatha Christie and H.P. Lovecraft with allusions to J. Sheridan Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, and Oscar Wilde.",
