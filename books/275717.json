  "description": "A brilliant French scientist, Marie Nicole LeBon awakens in a Paris asylum — with no name and no memory of the tragic accident that has erased her past. Now a fair-haired deliverer has come to free her — a gentle stranger with the face of an angel who swears they are wed. In Max D'Avenant's arms she finds shelter from a perilous, unfamiliar world — and his silver-gray eyes sparkle with the sensuous promise of a warm and giving love. But her handsome rescuer is an imposter — a spy sent by the British to steal the secrets Marie has locked away in her mind . . . a tormented player in a game of war, torn between his loyalty to the Crown and his passion for the beautiful woman he is sworn to betray.",
