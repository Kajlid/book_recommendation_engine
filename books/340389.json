  "title": "I See God in the Simple Things",
  "description": "In all we experience through simple daily living, God faithfully shows us more about ourselves and where we are in our spiritual walks. Too often we allow complicated days to dominate our lives, making it difficult to cope. This lighthearted book of reflections illustrates how every day situations can become opportunities for encouragement and spiritual growth. Each lesson provides us with a moment to go to God for answers and to gain insight from His Word. We know God speaks through His Word. He also speaks through people, and He'll speak to you as well when you talk to Him. If you expect to hear from Him, you will.",
