Three Decades.Spanning the years from the optimistic post-War 1940s to the Mad Men 1950s and rebellious “Make Love, Not War” 1960s, Decades is about three generations of women who must confront the radical changes and upended expectations presented by the turbulent decades in which they lived.Evelyn, talented but insecure, faithful to the traditional values she grew up with, is a loyal and loving wife and mother whose marriage and family mean everything to her.Nick, handsome and ambitious, a chameleon who changes with the changing times, is her successful but restless husband.Joy, their daughter, coming of age at a time of anger and rebellion, needs them both but is torn between them.Barbara is the other woman. Younger than Evelyn, accomplished but alone, she wonders if she can have everything--including another woman's husband.But can she? Is she willing to pay the price? And how will Evelyn handle her rebellious daughter, her straying husband and the threat to her identity?DECADES, sweeping in scope yet intimate in detail, is the emotional, compelling story of family, marriage, crisis, betrayal and healing.DECADES was originally published in hard cover by Simon & Schuster.",
