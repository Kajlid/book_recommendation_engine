  "description": "The Waterman is no ordinary killer, but then Daniel Jacquot is no ordinary detective. Daniel Jacquot always jokes that he joined the police force so he could earn a living and still play rugby. And play he did, for France, scoring the winning try in a Five Nations final against the English. Nearly twenty years later, Daniel Jacquot is still remembered for his mighty victory. But now he's a chief inspector, working homicide with the Marseilles judiciaire. Like playing rugby, tracking down killers is a game that Jacquot understands. And Marseilles just happens to be Jacquot's own home ground. It's here, in this city by the sea, that a shadowy, elusive killer steps onto the field of play--drugging, raping, and drowning three young women. With a new partner, a rising body count, and only a three-word tattoo to work with, Daniel Jacquot gradually closes in on the methodical murderer whom the press have christened \"The Waterman.\" Highly atmospheric and intensely gripping, Jacquot and the Waterman introduces a stellar new writer to America's must-read mystery list.",
