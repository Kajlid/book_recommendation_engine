  "title": "Bareknuckles: A Social History of Prize Fighting",
  "description": "Bareknuckle fighting was one of the first organised spectators' sports and the first to boast a World Championship. Yet paradoxically throughout its history it was illegal. Dennis Brailsford is the first historian to describe the entire history of bareknuckle fighting from the Regency period until its decline in the early years of this century. He covers not only the London Ring spread of bareknuckle fighting to America and Australia. He introduces us to the individuals, the great names of bareknuckle fighting: Mendoza, Gully, and 'Gentleman' John Jackson, looking at their lives, how they trained, how matches were set up, fighting styles, financial rewards and their post-fighting careers. He also shows how new methods of travel and communication affected the organisation of fights and the efforts of those who tried to prevent them.",
