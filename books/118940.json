  "title": "The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly: Kansas City Chiefs: Heart-Pounding, Jaw-Dropping, and Gut-Wrenching Moments from Kansas City Chiefs History",
  "description": "Genuine fans take the best team moments with the less than great, and know that the games that are best forgotten make the good moments truly shine. This monumental book of the Kansas City Chiefs documents all the best moments and personalities in the history of the team, but also unmasks the regrettably awful and the unflinchingly ugly. In entertaining—and unsparing—fashion, this book sparkles with Chiefs highlights and lowlights, from wonderful and wacky memories to the famous and infamous. Such moments include the upset win over Minnesota in Super Bowl IV but also the loss to the Miami Dolphins on Christmas when Garo Yepremian’s double-overtime field goal ended the longest game of the National Football League. Whether providing fond memories, goose bumps, or laughs, this portrait of the team is sure to appeal to the fan who has been through it all.",
