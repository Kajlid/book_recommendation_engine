  "title": "The King's Servants: Men's Dress At The Accession Of Henry VIII",
  "description": "This new book (by the team that produced 'The Tudor Tailor') offers ground-breaking research into reconstructing the garments of ordinary men of the early Tudor period. It surveys relevant pictorial sources, archaeological artefacts and archival information, and provides credible evidence for the clothes in a typical royal servant's wardrobe in the early year's of Henry VIII's reign. Detailed patterns, practical instructions, specially-commissioned line drawings and high-quality colour photographs provide guidance on reconstructing men's garments circa 1498 to 1511. An essential guide to ordinary men's dress in the early sixteenth century for researchers and costumiers working in museums, education, re-enactment, stage and screen. Dispatched direct from the publishers in the UK.",
