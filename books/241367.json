  "description": "30 men. 1 woman.  I know how it sounds… dirty.    Except it’s just the premise for a new reality show, Matchmaker, where I’m supposed to find love on TV.  Thirty sexy eligible bachelors are competing for my hand, trying to prove their love for me in front of millions of people.  I know most are fake and only here to advance their careers, but there are two who draw me to them like a moth to a flame.  One is blond and blue-eyed, with a chiseled body and a prowling natural grace. And while he might seem a little rough around the edges, with me, he’s kind and genuine.  The other is passionate, driven, and totally focused on me–everything a woman could want.  I feel so torn. Do I choose the one I’m falling in love with, or can I be happy settling for the safe bet?  That should be an easy question. If I were a bystander sitting at home, I know what my answer would be.  But I’m scared. He could destroy me, burn me to ash with his fire. And if I’m wrong about him, I don’t know if I’ll ever recover…  Matchmaker is a full-length Sexy Romantic Comedy with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger!",
