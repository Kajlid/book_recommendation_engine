  "title": "Venture: The Rogue Expeditions Story",
  "description": "VENTURE is a travelogue that traces the journey of two accidental entrepreneurs as they set out to help others experience the world through the universal language of running. Exploring the roads and trails less travelled would require immersion in a dizzying array of cultures and countries, a sense of adventure, a dreamer's imagination, plenty of grit, a dash of luck, a cast of the right characters and the ability to laugh when things go terribly wrong.Through the lens of one small startup finding its place within the ever-evolving landscape of adventure travel, the reader is transported to locations as diverse as the sands of the Sahara, the glaciers of Patagonia, the vineyards of Slovenia, the emerald hills of Ireland, the wild coastline of South Africa, the towering forests of the Pacific Northwest and the astounding wildlife-filled plains of the Maasai Mara in Kenya. Along the way, stories and anecdotes offer insight into the business of tourism and spark consideration of the potential paths towards a more sustainable future.Merging running, travel, food, history, world culture and plenty of entrepreneurial hustle, prepare to let yourself be entertained, carried away and ultimately inspired to set out into the great unknown.",
