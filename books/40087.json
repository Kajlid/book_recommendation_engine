  "description": "Book 2 in the Arda Collection seriesWhen fire-tempered Georgia Steel arrives on Arda, she knows she's landed in an orgasm-a-minute paradise. There's just one muscular, handsome problem - a big stranger who wants her for a soul's mate. Fari Tul'Mar reminds Georgia of an Earth police officer, only tons more arrogant. Not to mention much, much better looking. . .The Sailkeeper of Arda gets what he wants, when he wants it, how he wants it - until he meets Georgia Steel. Fari Tul'Mar quickly learns that Georgia's loud mouth serves as armor for a wound too deep for words. He must be cautious. Gentle. Careful. Unfortunately for Fari, cautious, gentle, and careful are not his strong points. Add an Outlander uprising and Fari's own dark, painful secret, and this couple heads for disaster - or scorching passion and love deeper than either can imagine.Review quotes for The Sailkeeper's Bride by Annie Windsor\"A worthy, yet completely unique follow-up to The Sailmaster's Woman.
