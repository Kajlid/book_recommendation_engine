  "description": "When it comes to heaven and earth, God and Lucifer, Darien is a little confused. He tries to understand how such a great, loving, understanding, and forgiveful creator can strike someone to Hell and let them rule earth and not give them a second chance. Lucifer (Satan) was once the friend of Darien and he cannot believe that he could be so evil like everyone says, maybe Lucifer just doesn't know what is going on. In order to show Darien just exactly how Lucifer is, God decides that Darien should see it for himself. He does this by sending him to earth and letting him choose for himself whether or not God made the right choice and who to choose for his master.",
