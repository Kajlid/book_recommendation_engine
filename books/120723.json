  "description": "'Tales from Modern India' is a vivid collection of ten short stories exploring themes such as sanity and insanity, understanding of right and wrong and inquiry of the self. Some stories expound the theme of familial bonding while others notice the ironies entrenched in the promise of a democratic state. In this volume you will encounter the inner conflicts of a young woman, scientific and philosophical questions related to the mystery of death, a journey through the consciousness of a lonely man, the tragedy of an aspiring writer and the multiple perplexities and confusions that dot our very existence.It is not often that one encounters a group of writers trained as critics who are capable of a fluency of language and mastery of expression even as they write intense, probing and self-conscious fiction. These stories will form an integral part of contemporary literature, as understood by readers, thinking and living in our times.List:1. Stories, Life and Coffee by Ritwick Bhattarcharya2.
