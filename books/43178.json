  "description": "“I’m Charles,” he said simply, his thigh brushing her knee. He had a delicious accent, which she decided was either English or Australian.“Palmer.” She held out her hand and Charles shook it. He had a warm, strong handshake. A man’s handshake. Judy was watching from the other end of the bar where she was drying pint glasses with an old towel. She frowned.“What’s your poison?” he asked, gesturing at her half-empty glass on the bar. “Normally I take a Manhattan, but tonight it’s a Cuba Libra,” she replied. “I like to pretend I’m anyplace other than Spring Valley.”He laughed and raised a finger for Judy.“Another Heineken please, ma’am,” he said. “And a Singapore Sling for the lady.” Up close, Palmer realized for the first time that this boy might actually be her age. An exchange student, maybe? Usually she reserved her attention for older boys—college boys who were more refined than the buffoons she was forced to endure at school. But this boy was an exception.ABIGAIL SHELTON IS DEAD Spring Valley's golden girl is found floating face-down in her boyfriend's pool, hands bound behind her back, head bleeding, drugs and alcohol in her system. Her friends are the only suspects—and they all have reasons to want her dead. Everyone has an alibi, but no one is innocent. ALIBI is a 4-part young adult e-book series. Each one-hundred page installment reveals the perspective of a different character: the secret love, the nemesis, the boyfriend, the best friend. As their tales unfold, we learn that Abby is not as perfect as everyone believes, but she's not the only one with secrets to hide. This page-turning tale of suspense, betrayal, murder, and lust will keep fans of Gossip Girl and Pretty Little Liars up and reading well past curfew.",
