  "description": "After five years of grieving over the death of her four-year-old son and having lost her husband, home, and job, Tess Bienville happens upon a television program on paranormal investigation. The frightening questions it prompts suddenly overshadow her grief.  Do ghosts really exist?  Is there really an afterlife?  Could her son’s spirit be ‘out there,’ wandering aimlessly about, afraid and uncertain about where to go or what to do because of his untimely and violent death?  Obsessed with finding answers to those questions, Tess begins a journey that hurls her toward dark, painful truths she isn’t prepared for—that no one would ever be prepared for. . .",
