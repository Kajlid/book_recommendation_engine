  "title": "London Calling",
  "description": "This story begins in London in the summer of 1982. London and England were very different places then. Homosexuality had been off the lawbooks a scant fifteen years; no longer a crime punishable by two years' hard labor or compulsory hormone treatment, but not exactly widely accepted outside its own circles either. The Falklands War had just ended and the situation in Northern Ireland was steadily worsening under the iron-fisted leadership of that old hag Thatcher, while the infrastructure was falling apart and ugly labor disputes were looming on the horizon. Punk was, if not dead and buried, at least fatally wounded, and there was nothing much left for the youth of Britain safe dole queues and discontent.It is against this backdrop that the slightly neurotic Rob, who has a first class degree in philosophy from one of the more prestigious colleges at the University of London but is doing time pumping beer in an East End pub, is seduced by his new flatmate Quinn after a night of drunken carousing and, after the initial panic wears off, starts to think that maybe, just maybe, his complete lack of success with girls, might be explained by his homosexuality.Approx 231,000 words complete",
