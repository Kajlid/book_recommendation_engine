  "description": "In the French quarter of the New Orleans the Mardi Gras revellers concealed a group of pleasure seekers who preferred to wear black. For Zillah, Molochai and Twig the party had been going on for centuries, fuelled by sexual frenzy, green Chartreuse and a cocktail of vodka and innocent blood. Nothing was born in horror and brought up in suburban Maryland. Even before he ran away to find his true home, he suspected he was different from other teenagers. and when he had his first taste of human blood, he knew he was right. Ghost was the visionary singer of the band Lost Souls? When Nothing was drawn into Zillah's fatal circle, Ghost had to decide whether he should try to save the boy from himself - or abandon him to his bloody birthright.",
