  "description": "On his 17th birthday, Thunder discovers his parents aren’t really his parents at all – in fact they’re not even real people but automatons tasked with his care by his true father – the mad, time-traveling geneticist, Dr. M. T. Hart. And he’s not the heartless Dr. Hart’s only child – he also has \"siblings\". A family of hollow gods with incredible yet flawed powers created by Hart from a genetic jumble of geniuses, mystics, and saints from the past. In his mad desire to create the perfect being, Hart throws his creations into The Sequencing. Lose the game and you may be wiped clean – stripped of your powers and your mind. Or worse, decommissioned and your genetic material recycled for the next batch of hollow gods. Win the game and you get to keep your powers, keep your mind (maybe), and keep playing. For the current Sequencing, the contestants need to use their unique abilities to track down a modern Jack the Ripper in London. While his competition has amazing powers, Thunder seems armed only with his wits. Will that be enough for him to survive The Sequencing? Does he even want to win knowing that doing so could mean the end of the others and their unique gifts?",
