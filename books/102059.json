Not long after she lands her dream job as a marine biologist at the New England Aquarium, she meets sexy attorney, Todd Healy. A whirlwind relationship between her and Todd ensues, and before either realizes it, they are planning an intimate, tropical wedding in Aruba with their immediate families. All seems perfect two days before “big day”, until Robin walks in on Todd in the arms of another woman.The humiliating scene sends Robin running off into the night, confused and angry. It seems she has run for miles, when she stumbles upon an unseen object and is hurled into the sand. With the help of the full moon, she finds an ornate bottle and impulsively pulls off the jeweled stopper. What she expects to find is a mysterious note, but what she ends up with is a middle-aged, gay genie named, Zahir.With his eccentric mannerisms, Zahir quickly puts Robin’s broken heart and battered self-esteem at ease. Still owing her three wishes, it doesn’t take long for the genie to set Robin’s confidence back on the right path. He can grant her anything she wants, but the one thing she truly desires…….is true love. Robin is determined to find a way around the huge glitch in the genie’s limitations and makes a list of “must haves” she wants in a future husband. This time when Zahir flicks his wrist, a sexy highland warrior breaks through the purple haze, and he does not look happy. Its then that Robin realizes her wish didn’t just create the man of her dreams, but pulled him from his own time.",
