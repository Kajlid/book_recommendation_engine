  "description": "The story begins and ends in a small town in Maine, but within the pages, the characters travel far beyond the mundane. Jack Nielson and his best friend, Lydia, have just reunited after years of separation on their winter break from college. For old times' sake, the two decide to partake in a bit of \"innocent\" fun: practicing magic in the local forest, of course. As readers will see, there was nothing innocent about their magicâ€”not then, and not now.",
