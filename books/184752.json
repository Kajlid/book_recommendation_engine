  "description": "A hitman navigates a seedy London shot through with dark magic, demons, and angels in this wickedly hilarious urban fantasy series debut Meet Don a profane, alcoholic hitman . . . and summoner of demons. Drake owes a gambling debt to one such demon. Forced to carry out one more assassination to clear his debt, Don unwittingly kills an innocent child and brings the Furies of Greek myth down upon himself. Rescued by an almost-fallen angel called Trixie, Don and his magical accomplice, The Burned Man—an imprisoned archdemon—are forced to deal with Lucifer himself whilst battling a powerful evil magician. Now Don must foil Lucifer’s plan to complete Trixie’s fall and save her soul whilst preventing the Burned Man from escaping and wreaking havoc on the entire world. “What connects [Raymond] Chandler, Guy Ritchie, Harry Potter and Buffy the Vampire Slayer? ‘Not much’ is probably the answer, until now. A punchy debut novel.” —SFX Magazine",
