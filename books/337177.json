But as her hopes for rescue dwindle, she must use every bit of her wits and skills just to survive. Because even in darkness, light can be found. Mackenzie must hold out long enough for those she loves to free her, but every passing second brings her closer to crumbling under the weight of a past she can’t outrun.Warning: This book contains concepts that might be disturbing to some readers.
