  "description": "A Love as old as Time itself…A Goddess thought lost Forever…A Mystical Rebirth being lived Right Now… In The Beginning…As the newborn Universe cooled from the fires of Creation, a clamoring cry resounded throughout the Heavens, whispering of a nameless fear that had come to Earth.Out of the heavens came She, the Holy Sophia, the Mother of all Creation. Forsaking Her divinity, She fell to Earth and some things that should not be forgotten, became lost. Awaiting Her was a growing abomination: a powerful Dark Lord attempting to control the world and enslave the divine spark of humanity forever. Now…Lonely, broken and blind to her own divinity, modern-day Sophia is found living in the suburbs of Los Angeles. With a one-way ticket to the south of France, she walks into a series of events that ferociously forces her to remember who she really is. With her self esteem shattered from an abusive relationship, it isn’t easy for Sophia to believe that she is actually the Queen of Heaven. In fact, it all seems like a horrible joke. As the seconds tick, Sophia discovers the true identity of the Dark Lord, the desperate situation humanity is facing, and how she is the One She sent to save them. The Rose Knight is the story of how a 44-year old divorcee wakes up to her own divinity and joins forces with the Logos (Word of God), the ultimate Beloved. By the contagious love/power of their union, they create an army of awakened lovers who usher in the great Rebirth in the face of an evolutionary crisis of global proportions. In this modern retelling of an ancient mythos, Sophia dives into the depths of the Mystery when all hope had faded, in an almighty attempt to end the reign of darkness. Her story is Your story…And it is happening, RIGHT NOW.",
