  "description": "They think I belong to them... I belong to no one but they'll belong to me...  ******  I've had one goal for years.  Get out of foster care and search for the father that never knew I existed.  The problem is; I get placed in a new foster home a few months before my eighteenth birthday. This town is owned by the rich and a few of the rich want to own me.  If only they didn't know how to push every button I have. If only they didn't turn me inside out by a single look. They make me want things. They make me forget that they're trying to trap me with them. They make me forget my one goal. That is, until it comes back rearing its ugly head.    *Adult language *Reverse harem *Sexual content *Few soft triggers *Fast-paced",
