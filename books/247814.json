  "description": ".In the summer of 1995, Emily Taylor, recent widow of an unfaithful spouse, went on a job imposed grief sabbatical at her nana’s Lake Tahoe cabin in the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Professor David Taylor’s sudden death left his two daughters at odds, and his wife deep in financial, emotional, and spiritual turmoil. Emily was guarding a secret. Haunted by returning childhood memories of her twin brother’s mysterious drowning, she fears remembering Eddie’s death was her fault, and the reason for her mother’s rejection. To make matters worse, Jack Conner is trying to reignite their fractured relationship with the help of next door neighbor, and old family friend, Doc Walters. Searching for truths is dredging up unexpected trouble. Is there redemption in the clear, blue waters Emily has been swimming in her entire life? Is her nana’s God calling her name?",
