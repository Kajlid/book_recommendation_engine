  "title": "Our Godly Sexual Beings: The Fellowship of the Mystery",
  "description": "Our Godly Sexual Beings explores scripture and other ancient texts to unveil one of humanity's great mysteries--God's purpose for designing our Godly sexual beings. After thirty years of committed research and study, Donna Mack perceived an essential missing link from the age-old battle of God vs. Satan. While other books have attempted to discuss human sexuality, none have done so with as many biblical and scholarly-backed references as Our Godly Sexual Beings. One fascinating revelation in scripture is just how sacred human sexuality exists for God. The Bible sings with this truth, and Donna dives into this mystery to reveal the greatest love story ever told! With the help of over 1,300 references, Donna uncovers God's design for sex and Satan's influence that morphed this gift into a lie of lust. This book is full of many revelations and truths that will allow the reader to experience freedom from sexual sin, shame, and bondage.",
