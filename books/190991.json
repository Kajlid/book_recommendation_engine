  "description": "Rachel Montgomery's family doesn't think she can change-but she's going to prove them wrong...What could be more out of character for overly-cautious Rachel than moving sight unseen to the small town of Birch Valley to become the principal of the town's only elementary school? When she arrives late on her first day, she realizes no one was expecting her, leading to conflict with the staff-and particularly with one handsome, emerald-eyed fourth grade teacher.Liam O'Brien's life is simple and easygoing, just the way he likes it-until he shows up for school following the holiday break...Not only is his new boss the rude woman who stole his parking spot, she's highly motivated to switch things up in his very traditional school, and Liam is not a fan of change. His inexplicable attraction to the petite blonde complicates matters, as Rachel is adamant that she didn't move all the way to Birch Valley to get involved in any kind of romance.But as conflicts are resolved, family ties might draw Liam and Rachel together...Rachel discovers Liam's family is loving and supportive, particularly his mother Mary-unlike Rachel's own mother. She bonds with his brothers and his sister Maggie, and it almost seems too good to be true. Can they work through their differences and compromise enough to build a lasting relationship? Or will Rachel be unable to let her guard down long enough to take a chance on...Loving Liam",
