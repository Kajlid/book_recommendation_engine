But they sleep next to each other every night.Alfie Mack has been in hospital for months recovering from an accident.

But it quickly becomes clear that seeing his neighbour's face won't happen any time soon.Alice Gunnersley has been badly burned and can't even look at herself yet, let alone allow anyone else to see her.
