  "title": "Ishi in Two Worlds: A Biography of the Last Wild Indian in North America",
  "description": "The life story of Ishi, the Yahi Indian, lone survivor of a doomed tribe, is unique in the annals of North American anthropology. For more than forty years, Theodora Kroeber's biography has been sharing this tragic and absorbing drama with readers all over the world.This deluxe edition of the classic biography is embellished with pictures that help to bring the story to life. Many of the photographs were taken at the actual locations in the Deer Creek country of northern California where Ishi was born and lived for nearly half a century as a \"wild\" Indian. Also included are many contemporary photographs, nineteenth-century drawings, maps, and, of course, the thirty-two photographs that were included in the original edition.Ishi stumbled into the twentieth century on the morning of August 29, 1911, when, desperate with hunger and with terror of the white murderers of his family, he was found in the corral of a slaughterhouse near Oroville, California. Finally identified as an Indian by an anthropologist, Ishi was brought to San Francisco by Professor T. T. Waterman and lived there the rest of his life under the care and protection of Alfred Kroeber and the staff of the University of California's Museum of Anthropology.",
