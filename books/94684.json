Now summer is coming to an end. The last lavish party of the season at aloof tycoon Jared Fitzgerald’s “Mansion on the Rock”, an event not to be missed, is that night. Reluctantly Monica goes along with friends to crash it. They assure her that everyone will be there so they won’t be noticed in the crowd. That isn’t the case. Jared notices Monica. When happenstance finds her the last to leave, he keeps her there and sweeps her up in a decadent night to remember.This short story is a romance of what-ifs, a little truffle to enjoy.",
