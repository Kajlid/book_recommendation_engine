  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, shape-shifters, sex toys, HEA] It’s been two years since Braxton Carmichael fell in love with his partner and mate, Xander. Life with a pack of cursed shifters hasn’t been easy, but moving to Wyoming was supposed to be a step in the right direction, a new beginning. That was before tragedy struck. Xander Brighton never asked to be an alpha, but it’s a responsibility he takes seriously. Taking a bullet to the shoulder while on assignment was just part of the job, but the resulting paralysis wasn’t supposed to happen. Feeling helpless and useless aren’t emotions he’s used to experiencing. He’s moody, uncooperative, and alienating everyone he cares about, including his mate. When Braxton draws the unwanted attention of a nearby clan of goblins, none of their issues seem quite so important anymore. Xander would lay down his life for Braxton, and before the smoke clears, he just might have to prove it. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
