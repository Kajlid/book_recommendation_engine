  "description": "Now that attorney Avery Andrews is back in town, business is booming. There’s the team of ghost hunters who arrive at Avery’s office one fine spring day, searching for ectoplasm from the long-dead. The ghosters are also having altercations with the locals (a raging biker gang and Avery’s own P.I. among them) but Avery’s got other “real” problems with the dearly departed: The twenty-year-old unsolved murder of Wenda Sims. Not long ago Wenda’s niece, Neanna, came to Dacus looking for clues about what happened to her aunt. Then Neanna, too, went missing…and was found dead. Now Neanna’s best friend and adopted sister, Fran French, has come to town. Can Avery help Fran solve the two murders and prevent Fran from meeting the same fate? It’s time for Avery to unearth the truth about the past before it comes back to haunt Dacus…for good.",
