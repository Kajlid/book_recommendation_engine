Do you want to have the capability to transform your life and make it infinitely better, by paying attention to what those who have lived and died have come to understand about the meaning of life itself?As one of the world’s most accomplished mediums, Tyler Henry has had thousands of communications with those who’ve already gone through humanity’s final frontier: physical death.The life lessons he’s learned from those conversations have been truly transformative.In Here & Hereafter Tyler explains that by listening and learning from the departed, following their guidance, and paying attention to what they might have done differently, we can get more fulfillment and purpose from our own lives. Here & Hereafter will shed light on the most powerful understandings Tyler has gained from modern day mediumship—and explain how those understandings can lead us to live a more meaningful life.",
