  "description": "FrostI’m doing something I’d never thought I would. Something I swore I wouldn’t do when Elena went off and married Reed. But, as the years went by I saw the unity within the biker lifestyle and I began to crave it. Now I’m in my late-thirties and all I have to show is scars on my body, battle wounds and marks that will forever scar my skin after being on the field for the bureau. Is it wrong I want more than that? I asked myself this question for years, and not long ago I made the decision to quit my job, abandoning every benefit and decided to live for myself. For so long I had thought my work would give me purpose, but that wasn’t the case. It turned out I was much like every other woman. I only wanted to belong somewhere. It turns out where I belong is with the Reapers MC. I’ve been here for a bit now and we’re finally starting to see some fresh blood into the charter other than myself. A woman by the name of Cheyenne transferred to our charter. She’d been providing medical care down in Las Vegas with Sakura to the club and patients in their clinic. No one here knows my preferences, but I haven’t been able to keep my eyes off her. I wasn’t always a lesbian, but somewhere in my early-thirties I realized who it was I really loved-- women. The moment Cheyenne’s family hears she’s with us, they lose their shit . . . and in doing so, they ignite a war with the Reapers. They used to be our allies, but now they’re public enemy number one. Above anything else, we’ll always protect our own.",
