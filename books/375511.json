  "description": "Christmas is coming, and Tommy is trapped! Aspiring costume designer Tommy longs for his stern owner to truly claim him, and he submits to everything Dr. Tanaka wants. Everything, that is, except communicating openly with Tanaka-sama. Tommy trusts and obeys Dr. Tanaka, so why can’t he take the final step of confiding his worries to the man who wants to protect him? Tommy’s career is stalled, and his work nemesis, Susie Sofronie, is bullying him into cutting off his long black braid for charity during the Christmas matinee. Dr. Tanaka treasures Tommy’s hair both for its bondage use and as a symbol of their shared Japanese heritage. Tangled up in a knot of failed communication and obligations, will Tommy end up bald and without his man on Christmas Day?",
