  "description": "A DARING LITERARY AND HISTORICAL LOOK AT THE IDEOLOGIES OF WAR AND VIOLENCE, BY THE AUTHOR OF \"EXTERMINATE ALL THE BRUTES\" On November 1, 1911, over the North African oasis Tagiura, Lieutenant Giulio Cavotti leaned out of the cockpit of his primitive aircraft and dropped a Haasen hand grenade. Thus began one of the most devastating military tactics of the twentieth century: aerial bombing. With this point of entry, Sven Lindqvist, the author of the highly acclaimed \"Exterminate All the Brutes, \" presents a cleverly constructed and innovative history. Now available in paperback, A History of Bombing tells the fascinating stories behind the development of air power, bombs, and the laws of war and international justice, demonstrating how the practices of the two world wars were born from colonial warfare.",
