Amelia has never walked freely under the sky or played with other children, but she has a unique gift—she can fly out of her body—which Emily will protect with her own life.Remembering when she was a spirited 16-year-old with the world at her feet, Emily had no idea about the code of family honour, treacherous secrets and malicious jealousies. Her life changed irrevocably the day she entered a little bookshop near the British Museum and fell passionately in love with sophisticated black playwright, Josiah Equiano. A second fateful encounter at the British Museum sealed the beginning of their clandestine romance.But when the racial hatred of her family is revealed and a husband of their choice is about to be forced upon her, Emily’s world is shattered.Determined to help her daughter escape from her cruel sister’s deadly intentions, she vows to exact revenge upon those who would murder for the sanctity of honour—even beyond death.*Please note that the language/spelling of this novel is English (UK)*",
