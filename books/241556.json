  "description": "Arcadia was prepared to die alone, working boring temp jobs and eating cereal out of the box, until the time came that her heart finally gave out. But a chance meeting on the subway changes everything. Now she's shacked up with not one guy, but seven intriguing men who are as sexy as well...sin. But she'll soon discover that there is more to the guys than their attractive appearance. Their meeting was not as happenstance as she was led to believe. Arcadia will have to make a choice: boring safety or sexy adventure?  This is a reverse harem serial that will be released in 25k word instalments. Recommended for 18+ as it contains some pantie-melting sex scenes.",
