  "description": "Welcome to the Fairytale Shifter series… where growly alphas find their mates and heroines have babies galore! This bundle includes all of our shifter books with a BRAND NEW STORY in the back! Revisit your old favorites and discover our newest addition to the family.  Finn, Flint, and Forest have spent their lives looking for their mate. The three brothers have been through everything together, and seeing the rest of their family pair off has been hard to watch. But one day, deep in the woods, a small bunny crosses their path when the three of them are in wolf form. To their surprise, they finally find what they’ve been looking for, but it just so happens they all find it at once.  Luna Hare lost her family long ago, and she’s been traveling to different shifter villages, trying to find one that is the right fit. Secretly she’s been hoping to meet another bunny family and possibly find her mate. She never expected that when she’d come to Gray Ridge, she’d not only find a mate, she would find three. Three enormous wolves look hungry, and not for food.  Warning: Bunnies like to make babies, so it’s a good thing she’s got three wolves lined up and waiting to take a turn. This shifter book is over-the-top sweet, and just as dirty as the rest. Come back to Colorado with us, and let’s see how this works out. We have a feeling it’s going to be a happily ever after.",
