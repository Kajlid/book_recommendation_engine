  "title": "Rent Boy",
  "description": "Danny is a rent boy, an architecture student, a waiter, and hot! Working his way through school seemed pretty he serves ego-obsessed writers their cocktails at the Emerson Club; he has his toes and other appendages sucked by horny businessmen; and he escorts anyone - male, female, or otherwise - who can afford him. But then his liaison with another rent boy gets him involved with an organ theft ring centering around a crazy old doctor and a crackpot nurse. A relentless stream of social commentary, careening between sex, comedy, and murder, Rent Boy is a hysterical romp through the worlds of contemporary culture and crime.",
