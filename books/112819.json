  "description": "Picking up where Book 1, Rapture at Midnight, left off – Book 2 in “The Cynn Cruor Bloodline Series” When Roarke catches a glimpse of Deanna in Dac Valerian’s club, he searches for her in the streets of Manchester just to prove that he hasn’t lost his mind. He is unable to believe Deanna is alive when he’d buried her himself nearly five hundred years before. But when Deanna turns up on the street facing the Cynn Cruor’s headquarters, Roarke needs to know why she’s hid herself from him all these years. Knowing her secret can only destroy whatever feelings Roarke has left for her, Deanna remains silent until circumstances force her to reveal everything. Hearts are broken on both sides, but Roarke and Deanna have to work together if they are to find a way of ending Dac and the Scatha Cruor’s power once and for all. Desire rises and passions are rekindled. Will their pursuit of Dac lead to another chance at happiness? Or will it forever tear them apart? *Warning: Contains explicit content and graphic details. 18+ Audience",
