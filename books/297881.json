  "description": "Sin Child is the personal account of a strong-minded child who endured a daily struggle to find the smallest amount of acceptance and, many times, a place to fall asleep at night. The innocence and nostalgia of a one-traffic-light town fades too fast for the cotton-top child with a neglectful, angry mother and an absent father.Waking up, at the age of ten, in a house surrounded by fire and men in white robes, she was terrified of what was usually only feared by Black people and the LGBTQ+ community in rural Mississippi.Angela came to accept loss, abuse, and organized crime as a natural part of her life. The AIDS epidemic and simple abandonment repeatedly robbed her of friends and loved ones. On March 2, 2018, Oprah Winfrey appeared in a 60 Minutes segment, further introducing the concept of PTSD in those who suffered childhood traumas. She stated, “This story has had more impact on me than practically anything I’ve ever done.” Sin Child continues the national discussion about the role of childhood trauma in a person’s development.A riveting memoir, Sin Child tells the story of childhood trauma and abandonment, alongside a narrative of grit and determination, and life-saving relationships.",
