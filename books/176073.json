Abandoned by her mother at only eight years old, Kathrine Harrison was taught that relying on yourself is the only way. She grew up in chaos, getting abused by her stepdad who reminded her daily that she wasn’t worth loving. Bryce Grant was used to his dad’s drinking but couldn't understand why the man was obsessed with a woman who constantly chose drugs over her family. Bryce cared for only one person and did everything he could to keep his brother, Jace, from witnessing just how bad their parents were. Tragedy changes the boys’ lives and sets them on a path they have never envisioned for themselves. Meeting by chance, Kat and Bryce have no idea how much they have in common and love is not a choice. Can it change how they see things, or will it destroy the life they've worked so hard to maintain?",
