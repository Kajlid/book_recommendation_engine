  "description": "Many in Crossing, Oregon, would describe long-time resident Patricia Guire as an eclectic force to be reckoned with, one who speaks her mind. Yet something is changing. She seems to be dropping out of her normal activities, becoming scarce around town and less available to her friends. Amber Yager feels called to check in on Patricia. Yet as she spends time with her and discovers Patricia s hidden past, she is drawn in to a group that brings disquiet to her own soul, ripping open old wounds. Will the love she s found in Crossing be taken from her? Or could both Amber and Patricia finally find peace as God shines light into the darkest places of their hearts?",
