  "title": "The Undiscovered Country",
  "description": "Despite misgivings about moving to such a remote and primitive place (and bringing their young daughter with them), Peter and June Campbell leave Massachusetts for the lush rain forest of Papua New Guinea where Peter will conduct a year of medical research for his doctoral thesis. Dark undercurrents of their feelings for one another rise inexorably to the surface. And, as the ties that bind the Campbells slowly unravel, they begin to explore the undiscovered in themselves. Spare and evocative, The Undiscovered Country offers an uncompromising vision of the fragility of the family and of the resiliency of the human spirit.",
