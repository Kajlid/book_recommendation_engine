  "description": "Young Naeri, the only survivor of her tribe, lives by her wits. Captured by the horse-lords who have supplanted her people, she seems destined for a life of slavery-but the Mother watches over Her own. Naeri can hear the voices of the stones; her birthgift is geomancy, the earth-magic. When the time comes to learn the language of the stones, Naeri finds a teacher. When it is time to hear the voice of her own heart, she finds a man who loves her. And when it is time to awaken ancient powers, it is Naeri who guides the building of the great stone circle, which a Great Chief thinks will be eternal testament to his might. But Naeri knows the circle will harness the forces of both earth and sky-and can be used to destroy the horse-lords and restore the rule of the witchfolk . .",
