  "description": "Entanglement of a Soul is the story of a soul that goes through five incarnations which are nonlinear in time and overlap. The characters are all connected around one pivotal moment but also interact in several different settings. The novel attempts to illustrate how the actions and behaviors of each life, the karma of each character, carries on, influencing the soul in its next incarnation.This novel is essentially four conversations between the five main characters, which span from hours to decades. The topic of these conversations is mostly spiritual and philosophical in nature. They are the dialogues of ordinary people going through extraordinary life conditions, and how they react to those adversities.",
