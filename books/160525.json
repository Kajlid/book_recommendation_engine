  "description": "When Gene Lawrence was fifteen and trying to fight a crack addiction, everyone told him that the longer he stayed clean, the easier it would be to say away from crack. They were liars because eight years later at twenty-three years old, Gene finds himself struggling with the frustrating symptoms of a crack craving.It wouldn’t be so bad if he could hole up in his apartment and not see anyone, but with the holiday season coming up and his ex-girlfriend, Rebecca, back in town for her wedding, Gene has no choice but to consider what led to his drug addiction and the reasons he’s had such a hard time staying off crack since then. Especially for Allison, who he finds himself more attracted to by the day and who is trying to seduce him every time they’re alone in the same room. But he’d rather not get involved with Allison at all than fail her in the end. Like he failed Rebecca. Like he failed his mother. Like he failed himself. His relationships with people were always ruined when he let them get entangled with his crack addiction. Because although Gene chose not to go back to crack, it didn’t mean he wasn’t an addict anymore. Once an addict, always an addict.",
