  "description": "Former soap star Flick Burrows’ life is at a crossroads. After a tragic childhood she’s clawed her way to success and a kind of happiness. But at 38, she’s been jilted at the altar and is out of work. To cap it all, she’s being hounded by the paparazzi. A theatre tour around Italy seems to be the answer to her problems.The director’s youngest son, Orlando Locatelli, a successful businessman and model, is introduced after the opening night. Devastatingly handsome, clever and driven, he is entranced and, despite a 15-year age gap is determined to have her. The attraction is mutual but Flick knows it’s a bad idea to get involved. He’s too young, too beautiful, too complex. But Orlando is impossible to resist, and he persuades Flick that there’s no harm in a casual affair.Flick’s outward appearance belies her painful, damaged past. And Orlando hides a dark, disturbing secret. Recognising kindred spirits, their fling transforms into an all-consuming passion that neither can control, threatening to strip Flick’s carefully constructed life bare, revealing her deepest fear and desire.",
