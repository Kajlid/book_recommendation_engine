  "description": "Can two searching souls ever find common ground? After being injured in Vietnam, Brian Lowe returns home in a wheelchair to the family mansion on the Mississippi River in Missouri—and to a nation that has seemingly turned against the very men and women fighting for its freedom. As if life couldn’t get any more complicated for Brian, he is assigned a beautiful, sassy physical therapist who just happens to be an outspoken war protestor. Kathy Nowlin has lived her life with passion, but her passions for her career and her strong feelings about the war collide in the person of Brian Lowe. Can these two searching souls ever find common ground? Set against the nostalgic backdrop of bell-bottoms, Volkswagen Beetles, tie-dye, and rock and roll, the darker rumblings of the Vietnam War era cast their shadow as Raney's novella explores timeless questions of life, love, and faith.",
