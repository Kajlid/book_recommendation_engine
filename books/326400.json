  "description": "Expect: a fragile king, a sweet-hearted henchman, an enigmatic hitman, and a fight to the death. Cam, Alexei, and Saint have survived their battle with the devil, but with too many enemies to count, can they survive the war? “Kill me,” I choked out. “If he’s dead, you gotta kill me too.” One club, one heart. Three men, one soul. Can loving someone kill you? I feel like the world is ending every time I look at them. Cam. My brother. My president. He’s the love of my life And then there’s Alexei. I didn’t know I could feel this way about one person, let alone two. But I think of him in every breath I breathe for Cam. Every thundering beat of my heart. Because there is no Cam without him. There is no me. My life wasn’t worth living until I found something worth dying for. And I’d die for them a thousand times. Saint’s Song is the second in a hurt/comfort, biker romance, MMM duet from the world of the Rebel Kings MC. Content warnings inside the book.",
