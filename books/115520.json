  "description": "Welcome to Graveyard—an elite private military company employed by the secret society that really controls the world.Walter Stedman is Graveyard’s commander, a former Delta Force operator left slightly unhinged by twenty years of secret wars, forbidden knowledge, and abominations of science. Walter is about to go to war with an enemy like none he has ever encountered...Sid Hansen is one of Graveyard’s assets—a child soldier trapped in a God-forsaken desert filled with monsters. The catch? He may be the worst monster out there.Yoshida Tanaka is a ninja consumed by hatred in the years since a Graveyard operator murdered his young family. Now he lurks in the shadows, honing his skills and waiting for the perfect moment to take his revenge.KILL KILL KILL is a story about secret government death squads fighting reptilian humanoids for control of the New World Order. I wrote it in the dead of night, lights out, listening to Art Bell’s radio show, with a loaded 9mm HK next to my cup of black coffee, and my paranoid eyes shifting between my word processor and the door.KILL KILL KILL defies genre. It's a mix of action, horror, and science fiction.KILL KILL KILL has no trigger warnings. If you need one, you should turn away now.KILL KILL KILL is absolutely not for kids, but you should make them read it anyway. It will make them tougher.",
