  "description": "Jax Hamill is a man who has changed his life – with lots of hard work and even more dumb luck. He’s left the hell of his younger and wilder days behind, and now he has a bar, a house, a truck, and a bike. Oh, and all the casual sex in a bar back room that a man like him may desire. Jax lives his carefree life for ‘now’, and keeps things ‘temporary’. At least he did…until she threw everything he thought in to question.Sarah Matthews is a woman who would love to change her life in some ways. By default and sheer bad luck, she juggles a staggering number of responsibilities, both personal and professional. She’s single, stressed, and seriously in need of some fun. If only she could escape her overly-scheduled, vanilla life, and cut loose… just for a little while.When Jax and Sarah decide to get together – just temporarily and just for fun – it changes both of their lives for the better. But when a man from Sarah’s past returns, it changes everything for the worse. In fact, it couldn’t be worse. As Sarah fights to come back to him, Jax is forced to confront the kind of person he was, who he is now, and the man that he wants to be… both for Sarah, and for himself.",
