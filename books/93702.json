  "description": "When your heart has been broken, can you ever trust again? This is the question that Dr. Sydney Greenwood finds herself asking, when she relocates to a village in the Scottish Highlands, seeking a fresh start. There, she joins the local Mountain Rescue team, and finds a new challenge in the form of Kelly Saber - an expert climber with a hidden past - who tests Sydney's resolve to stay single. Amidst harsh terrain, turbulent weather, and life or death rescues, the two women must learn to trust each other, not only on the mountain, but in matters of the heart. This is the first in the Mountain Rescue saga, how Saber and Sydney meet, the beginning of their relationship, and their first tests as a couple, both on and off the mountain. This is...The Ascent.",
