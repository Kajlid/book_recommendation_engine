  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling author, Nana Malone, comes a deliciously royal, roommates to lovers romance.  Lucas...  I'll never stop fighting for her...no matter the stakes.  A year ago I found out I was a long lost prince. But with one lie, that’s all been undone.  But prince or pauper, I’m not going to stop fighting for Bryna. She may be the only thing I can count on right now.   Bryna…  I never meant to get in so deep with my royal roommate—but in my defense I didn't know.  If anyone else finds out his royal status, my mother will meddle faster than you can say gold digger. More importantly, Lucas’s life could be in danger. Because, I’m not the only one with secrets. And there’s a lot more at stake than heartbreak.  (This is Book 2 in the Royals Undone Duet. You must read Royal Bastard first.)
