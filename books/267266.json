  "description": "A love story doomed by the ill-fated city from which it bloomed. In 1906 San Francisco, Lillian Rutledge dared to be a lawyer and a voice for change, knowing she had to play the political game better than the men in order to achieve her greatest ambitions. Austin Whitmore was a newspaper playboy who knew the only way to save his great city from the depths of corruption was to call-out political liars to his friends in DC. They were from two different worlds, viewing justice and law from two very different angles, yet they could not resist flirting with the balance of power, or each other, once their spark was lit.Together they embark on a partnership to expose the city's unfettered graft and give in to a passionate love affair, unaware their western metropolis is about to be hit by the most destructive natural disaster in American history. When the great earthquake and fires plow through the city, Lillian learns the men she worked with are far more dangerous than any catastrophic event and will not hesitate to eliminate them both in a lawless town. Their dangerous quest leaves them hunting powerful adversaries as the smoke settles to reveal how corruption left half the city homeless and prove to the world that San Francisco will survive on equal ground.Fast-paced and riveting with historical detail, Quake and Fire invokes the Gilded Age of San Francisco in the days before it all fell apart. Journey through a love story that questioned the price of power and a woman's place in it, only to bring about the most astonishing rebirth of any city in the world.",
