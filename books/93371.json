  "description": "It may sound like common sense, but never hump an art thief. Turns out, Samantha Lytton's Common-Sense-O-Meter is super duper broken.Failed actress Samantha Lytton is getting along just fine in her lonely little life when a charming criminal called Sam or Nate or maybe even Richmond kisses her, square dances most provocatively, opens his not-so-wicked heart, and gets her in trouble with not one, but two international art theft rings as well as the LAPD.She's either gonna end up in jail or famous. Maybe both.Along the way, she fights for her life and falls for this funny, sexy disaster of a manâ€¦ and learns that finding happily-ever-after with yourself is the first step to real contentment. A cute dimple is just the second.",
