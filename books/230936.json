  "description": "A single mother and her daughters fall under the sway of the unscrupulous and amoral father of the older daughter's would be boyfriend. Unbeknownst to them, he runs a local vice ring and plays the affection the daughter has for him as a father figure against her mother, all the while pulling the teen into his web of moral corruption. Using the emotional needs of the two females against them he leads them down the slippery slope to moral corruption and degradation. Even those who might be in a position to help the girl arrest her spiral of debauchery, the female school guidance councilor, the principal and even local police officials, choose instead to exploit her. Only an older prostitute, her would be beau and his friends seem to want to help her as she struggles to find herself and her path in life.",
