  "title": "Cracked: Putting Broken Lives Together Again",
  "description": "When heâ€™s not hosting his wildly successful shows on MTV and the radio, Dr. Drew Pinsky spends his workday in a major Southern California clinic, treating the severest cases of drug dependency and psychiatric breakdown. In this riveting account, Pinsky reveals the intimate and often shocking stories of his patients as they struggle with emotional trauma, sexual abuse, and a host of chemical nemeses: alcohol, marijuana, Ecstasy, heroin, speed, cocaine, and prescription drugs. His accounts read like ER in book form-from the sexually compulsive model who alters between throwing objects around her room and shyly befriending other patients, to the girlish opiate addict who seems strangely calm during her withdrawal period because, as Pinsky soon discovers, she has been sneaking sex with a predatory male patient. At the center of all these stories is Pinsky himself, who immerses himself passionately, almost obsessively, in his work. In fast-moving, gripping vignettes, this book reveals the extraordinary human toll addiction and other behavioral and psychological dysfunctions can take on patient and doctor alike-but also the extraordinary, life-affirming magic that each side can encounter on the road to recovery.",
