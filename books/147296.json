  "description": "Brimming with new ideas for magical research, Emily returns to Whitehall School for her Second Year, only to discover that things are going to be different. Her friends have become sports-mad fanatics, her new roommates are strangers to her, her new classes are far harder and one of the teachers seems to actively dislike her. As she returns to the comforting routine of the only place she considers home, she finds that Second Year will be far harder than the first. But as the students settle in to continue their studies, it rapidly becomes clear that all is far from well at Whitehall. There's a murderer running loose in the school. A murderer who may be a newborn necromancer. And then there's the spy watching Emily from the shadows, waiting for her to make one tiny, but fatal mistake ... As the darkness falls on Whitehall, Emily may be their salvation...or the person who damns them all.",
