Those who can contribute to making the world a better place are Green, walking GMOs with plant chloroplasts in their cells who no longer need to eat. Life is good. People are happy.  Well, ...some people.  Not everyone gets to “go Green.”Calyssa Brentwood, a high school senior just finished with her cellular enhancement, is on her way to securing her place in the upper ranks of society. Until she finds herself far from the safety of Sci-City,  ...on a farm,  ...in the middle of a rebel insurgency. Realizing that nothing is as simple as it seems, Lyssa soon discovers that each choice brings new consequences ...ones that may turn deadly for those she cares about most.",
