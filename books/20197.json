  "description": "What's it like to be a zombie? Timothy Lipton finds that out in this hilarious, first-person look at the life and times of one of the undead. A victim of an experiment gone wrong on the way to finding a cure for the zombie plague sweeping the globe, Timothy soon hooks up with a partner -- Zombie Marilyn Monroe -- who turns out to be the unlikely accomplice he needs to navigate his way across the Wasteland to regain his memory and find the mysterious 'Meridian.' In their zombie Odyssey, Tim and Marilyn encounter the Wild Man, the Fat Lady, the Naked People and even Tim's wife. 'Zombie Honeymoon' takes the genre to places it's never been before â€” not only inside the mind of a 'Zee' but to the inevitable conclusion that, yes, zombies want a little love, too.",
