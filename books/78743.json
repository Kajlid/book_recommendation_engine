  "description": "They say that everything that happens, happens for a specific reason and Sebastian Blackwell and Michael Reed will soon come to realize that they are no exception of this age old rule. The events that will inevitably follow, shall entrap Sebastian within the unknown dimensions of his sleeping subconscious and as a result, a door shall be opened. Although not a sound penetrates the infinite darkness, a sound is made just the same. This door however, isn't technically a door at all and yet in the same breath, it is still an opening between the physical and spiritual realms. As for Michael Reed, Sebastian's best friend, his path will cast him down into eternal darkness from which there will be absolutely no return. Doorways are everywhere, even those that shouldn't be there to begin with. Still, just because they shouldn't, doesn't mean that they aren't there and just because we cannot see them, doesn't mean that they don't exist.",
