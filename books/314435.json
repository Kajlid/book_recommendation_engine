  "description": "I assumed I was done running from psychopaths for a while. I guess I was wrong. Doctor Maxwell Thornton, brilliant ex-surgeon and man most likely to insult you without even trying, seems to have an unwanted penchant for landing in the middle of murder cases. Since moving from the bustling metropolis of LA to a small town in Texas, Maxwell has struggled to fit in with the eccentric citizens of Rainy Dale. He’s made tiny steps forward, but the only person who truly seems to understand him is Sheriff Royce Callum. When one of Maxwell’s new patients ends up poisoned to death, the cold blooded killer suspects Maxwell knows a lot more than he actually does. Avoiding homicidal maniacs is always prudent, but once they catch your scent, it’s fight or die.",
