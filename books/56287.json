  "title": "The New Revelations: A Conversation with God",
  "description": "This is a life-altering book. It contains New Revelations. It provides the tools with which to pull ourselves out of despair, lifting the whole human race to a new level of experience, to a new understanding of life itself, to a new expression of its grandest vision. Neale Donald Walsch believes that the human race has reached a Time of Choosing. Our options are being placed before us by the tide of events -- and by those whoa re creating them. We can either move forward, building together at last a new world of peace and harmony based on new beliefs about God and Life, or move backward, separately and continuously reconstructing the old world of conflict and discord. In The New Revelations, bestselling author Walsch offers possible and powerful answers to the questions facing the world, and urges us to open our hearts and minds to what may be one of the most important spiritual statements of our time.",
