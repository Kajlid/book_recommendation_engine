Suddenly, she's faced with a choice she never expected―does she keep the baby and start thinking about someone besides herself, or try to go back to the way things were?Brilliantly funny, with a wonderfully fresh and original voice, Thanks for Nothing, Nick Maxwell is a smart, romantic novel about love, relationships, and knowing when it's time to start growing up.",
