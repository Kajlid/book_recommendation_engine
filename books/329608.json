  "description": "My only goal now is to win the help from three men—men I cursed into assuming the shape of beasts sixteen years ago…My name is Belle.After Kronos takes control of Delerood, my soldiers and I are forced to retreat.Realizing the blow is a big one, I also realize the only way back into Delerood and through Kronos’ time-loop, which keeps outsiders out, is by returning to Castle Chimera.There, I’ll need to appeal to the three monsters who live there, monsters known as Alder, Horatius, and Beacon.But appealing to these monsters won’t be an easy feat because, sixteen years earlier, I cursed them to their vile shapes.Not only did I curse them to take the shape of monsters, but I also cursed them to remain within the castle’s boundaries—forever.To say they hate me is probably an understatement.Yet, I still need them because they’re the only way to defeat Kronos.Why? Because sixteen years ago, the three of them served under Kronos, hence why I cursed them in the first place.While securing their help will be a feat, so is trying to convince myself I’m not moved by Alder’s rough touch, Beacon’s bitterness, or Horatius’ secret…",
