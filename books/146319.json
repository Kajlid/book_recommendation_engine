  "description": "Orcs are monsters, bred for violence, predisposed to act with brutality and hate. They lack morals, empathy and intelligence. They are the slaves of the supernatural world, tools of war and torture. But history is written by the powerful -- what would freedom mean for the orcs? What if an orc could find a woman who, by her very nature, could give him the chance to forge a unit, a future, for his people? This is their story.",
