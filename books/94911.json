  "description": "Just when they were sure that the strangest thing that could happen in the Bay Area was a vampire war, Omari and Jamilah find themselves faced with a new threat: a werewolf, in the form of their recently bit friend Dragonbrush. As the full moon fatefully approaches, the siblings wonder what will happen to their Filipino friend when he fully transforms, and more importantly what will happen to them? Brace yourself; you're going back to Oakland, CA, a place filled with bullies, gay hipsters, illegal parties, and drug dealing DJ's, escaped convicts, vampires and now, werewolves.",
