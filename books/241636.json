  "description": "A childhood promise. An unbreakable bond. One tragic event that shatters everything.  It all started with the boys next door…  Devin and Ayden were my best friends. We were practically joined at the hip since age two. When we were kids, we thought we were invincible, inseparable, that nothing or no one could come between us.  But we were wrong.  Everything turned to crap our senior year of high school.  Devin was turning into a clone of his deadbeat lowlife father—fighting, getting wasted, and screwing his way through every girl in town. I’d been hiding a secret crush on him for years. Afraid to tell him how I felt in case I ruined everything. So, I kept quiet and slowly watched him self-destruct with a constant ache in my heart.  Where Devin was all brooding darkness, Ayden was the shining light. Our star quarterback with the bright future whom everyone loved. But something wasn’t right. He was so guarded, and he wouldn’t let me in.  When Devin publicly shamed me, Ayden took my side, and our awesome-threesome bond was severed. The split was devastating. The heartbreak inevitable.  Ayden and I moved on with our lives, but the pain never lessened, and Devin was never far from our thoughts.  Until it all came to a head in college, and one eventful night changed everything.  Now, I’ve lost the two people who matter more to me than life itself. Nothing will ever be the same again.  A standalone new adult contemporary romance with a happy ending. Only suitable for readers aged eighteen and older due to mature content and possible triggers.",
