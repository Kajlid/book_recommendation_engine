  "description": "Memoirs of the Purged Soul... This book is a compilation of 25 poems written and arranged by author Kenisha N. Wise. The book is divided into four sections or categories, which represent different phases of Kenisha's life from late teens until recent years. These poems symbolize moments in her life that ignited creative recordings of emotions, thoughts, and events. Reading this book is like taking a peek into Kenisha's diary, her memoirs. While reading this book, begin to reflect on your life and the things within your own soul. You will be able to relate to these poems because they capture thoughts and emotions we all experience in life. Kenisha has perfected her own method of purging and offers each reader a solid example of how we can express ourselves through the power of written or spoken confessions. Most poems have been left in their original written form to preserve their novelty, as well as to convey her original thoughts.",
