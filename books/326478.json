  "title": "We Are Amused: Over 500 Years of Bons Mots By and About the Royal Family",
  "description": "Simply because of who they are, members of the Royal Family have always been highly quotable, from Queen Elizabeth I declaring that she had the heart of a king to the Prince of Wales confessing that he talks to his plants. This unique collection of royal wit and wisdom brings together many hundreds of gems, both sacred and profane, which have fallen from the lips and the pens of royalty, from Henry VIII to Prince William.",
