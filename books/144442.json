  "title": "Midnight Visitors",
  "description": "This short story is set in the world of The Green Woman. It follows naturally from the second volume of the series, The Subtle Fiend, but can be read as a stand alone story.When Aisha learns the identity of her betrothed, something unheard of happensâ€”her parents try to prevent the marriage. But in a city bounded by a crystal Hemisphere, where no rebellion is tolerated and every gesture is monitored, where can Aisha hide? Adam, her brother, believes the rumours of a resistance movement, the followers of the Green Woman, but to put his sister in their hands, first he has to make contact, and the Pure Ones have so much more practice at rooting out clandestine activity than he does. The Green Woman is moving, but so is the evil generated by the the Elders of Providence. Many stories will end in tragedy before the fate of the world is settled.",
