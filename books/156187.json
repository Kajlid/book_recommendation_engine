  "title": "Menage Maid Service",
  "description": "After a hard night of partying and poker, a disoriented Ethan wakes up to find two sexy women dressed in skimpy French maid uniforms on his doorstep. They tell him that they have come to service him and his house. Not quite believing his luck, Ethan eagerly invites them in. The women explain that they work for Menage Maid Service, an exclusive company that provides Cleaning with a Tryst. One of Ethan's friends booked and paid for four Menage Maid Service appointments and then promptly lost them in the poker game to Ethan the night before. Ethan doesn't remember winning such a sweet pot, but he is more than willing to enjoy the prize. Content Warning: This steamy novelette is all sex and no nonsense. It contains explicit language and material much too naughty for this description. For readers 18+ only! Themes explored in this short story: M/F/F menage, spanking, BDSM, casual encounters, submission. Series Note: This book is the first in the Menage Maids series.",
