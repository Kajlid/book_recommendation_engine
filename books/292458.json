  "description": "The moment I heard Ryder’s voice I was a goner.  As a photographer, I was used to working with beautiful people, but Ryder Williams was the most perfect male specimen that had ever stood before me. I knew without a doubt it would take no time at all for him to be the next big thing... or for him to steal my heart.  Model and photographer, we shouldn’t cross that line, but there was no stopping the passion we felt. Nothing else mattered. Not the age difference. Not that he was a client. Not even our pasts.  After my assistant caught us together, he was gone. I tried to put him out of my head, until fate threw him back into my life and my bed.  Time and time again we’re brought together, should I keep fighting or finally accept what my heart wants?",
