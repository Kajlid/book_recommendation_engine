  "description": "Rick's girlfriend from years ago was dead. Murdered. Buried. Or was she? Who was the girl he'd seen at the motorway services? Why was he so sure he knew her? And who had started calling him in the night ... whispering his dead girlfriend's name? In the world of the Mesmer, 'alive' and 'dead' are ambiguous ... the only certainty is pain. And when Rick enters that world he must confront everything he has ever held true, all those comfortable and naive beliefs, if he wants to gets out alive.",
