  "description": "Logan Dean's happily-ever-after was only a week away.  A fairy tale wedding.  To the vampire king of Charleston.  Unfortunately, she never even tasted the cake. Thrown into the past by a vengeful rival, Logan must navigate the unfamiliar waters of 1780, face an old nemesis and find her way back to Ian before her enemies hunt her down.  Ian Grant almost lost Logan once and vowed it will never happen again. But when she disappears on their wedding night, not leaving a single clue behind, he swears heâ€™ll never stop searching.  Is the love that binds them strong enough to withstand two hundred years and an adversary willing to do anything to keep them apart?",
