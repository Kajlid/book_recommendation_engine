  "description": "Welcome to Raven Academy… Where the price of admission could be your soul…  Adeline Jones is perfectly average. Or at least she thinks she is until she receives an invite to attend Raven Academy, complete with a full scholarship. Raven Academy is the mysterious school that only the elite of the elite go and despite Adeline's misgivings about giving up her whole life to attend, there's no way her parents are going to let her give up such an opportunity.  But things at Raven Academy aren't what they seem. Everyone is a little too perfect, a little too rich, and a little too powerful for any normal student population. Things only complicate further when Adeline catches the eyes of Raven Academy's group of elite boys.  Can Adeline figure out what secrets Raven Academy is hiding before its too late? Or will the price of admission to the elite academy be more than she can pay...like perhaps the price of her soul.  School of Broken Souls is book 1 in the Academy of Souls series.  This is a paranormal, reverse harem, fantasy and bully romance.",
