  "description": "Stay with me.Three simple words.One impossible request.I’ve loved Allie McCallister for as long as I can remember. Her happiness and well-being mean more to me than anything else, which is why when the opportunity of a lifetime presented itself, I had to take it. Three months was such a short amount of time to be apart to provide the financial stability we needed to start our lives. It wasn’t supposed to catapult my band to stardom, and it sure as hell wasn’t supposed to set off the chain of events that pushed my relationship with Allie to the brink. Our hearts were shattered, our love tested, and when everything fell apart she begged me to leave. Eight years ago, tragedy broke us. Now we’re back in the same little town where we once dreamed of building our future.She’s a divorced, single mom.I’m a damaged country music star.There are a hundred reasons for us to stay apart.But all it takes is one look, one touch, one kiss to know our story isn’t over. Now I have to convince her to let me stay.",
