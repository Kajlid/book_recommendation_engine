  "description": "They say in a hundred years, Deadwood will be long gone-blown away like prairie dust.  They also say Wild Bill Hickok can't be killed. Unless he wants to be.  Gem Theater owner Al Swearengen and whorehouse madam Laurette Parkhurst want Wild Bill Hickok killed. They don't want Deadwood-and their dirty profits-cleaned up. But the famous gunman hasn't survived this long on sheer luck. He can only be killed if he deliberately lets his guard down. But Hickok would never be so careless.",
