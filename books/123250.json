Have him open the package. Then have him storm into my home for the most panty-melting scolding of my life.Step four: Still figuring out step four.HANSI'm a dangerous man.A man who has spent the last two decades removing so many souls from this earth that it's a miracle my hands aren't permanently stained red.I'm a man who belongs in the shadows.I certainly don't belong in my pretty little neighbor's bedroom when she's not home, touching her things and inhaling her scent.I shouldn't follow her. Shouldn't watch her. Because no number of cookies on my doorstep will change the fact that love isn't an option for me.The only option left for me is violence.",
