  "title": "The Libraries of Thought & Imagination: An Anthology of Books and Bookshelves (Pocketbooks",
  "description": "The Libraries of Thought and Imagination celebrates books, libraries and biblophilia. Artists and writers were invited to select and write about an imaginary bookshelf and consider the different characteristics of private and public libraries. Contributions range from the way individual books are presented, catalogued and stored, to imaginative, explorations of the library as a historical and philosophical model, a reification of thought. Written and photographic essays discuss a number of important library projects and book interventions by internationally renowned artists.",
