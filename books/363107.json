  "description": "Introduce young children to the timeless poetry of William Wordsworth, whose traditional verse is accompanied by vivid oil paintings inspired by the poem's original themes. These beautiful images create a parallel story accessible to Lonely little Robot doesn't have much to be happy about, working all day in the factory. One day while sadly walking by himself, he follows a bird over a hill, where he finds a field of daffodils. After dancing with them, his spirit is filled with joy. Children will observe the contrast between the dreary, metallic robot world, and the lively, colorful world of the daffodils and nature. They will cheer little Robot for sharing the power of nature with the others, bringing happiness to the once dismal factory. In an effort to have children understand the basic themes of the poem, easily recognizable characters such as robots and animated flowers are used to act out the poetic verse. Bold illustrations and easy-to-read text lend themselves to lap-reading and group story time. Children will relate to the basic emotions (sadness, loneliness, happiness) of the robots, and can be encouraged to think about what cheers them up when they are sad, and to talk about how nature makes them feel. This is the first book in the new Lobster Press series, “Read Me a Poem,” in which classic poetry is given a contemporary artistic twist.",
