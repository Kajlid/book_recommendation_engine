  "title": "Monsignor Quixote",
  "description": "A religious novel, it tells the story of a humble priest who is elevated to Monsignor by the Pope himself because of a clerical error. It's modern picaresque, with frequent nods to Cervantes... Quixote and Sancho drink and talk - about Judas and Stalin, the prodigal son, Marx, and belief that wears off like vodka. A book of moral complexity that explores deep theological themes in a light-hearted, accessible way.",
