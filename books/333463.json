  "title": "The Healer's Keep",
  "description": "Something is threatening the legendary Healer’s Keep, where students gifted in the healing arts are trained. Will they learn enough in time to keep the darkness at bay? Or will the Shadow King turn their gifts against them and once again walk the world?“This complex and engrossing companion to The Seer and the Sword can be read independently. Lovers of fantasy will gravitate to its magic, its compelling characters, and its classic struggles between good and evil. Recommend this fine offering to fans of Diana Wynne Jones and David Eddings.”— School Library Journal“Four young people divided by geography, class, and philosophy come together in the dream realm to fight the powers of darkness. . . . The tale works well both as a sequel [to The Seer and the Sword] and on its own. Solid and satisfying.”— Kirkus Reviews",
