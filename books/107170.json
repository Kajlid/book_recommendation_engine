  "description": "The Viking north clashes with the supernatural east in an epic historical fantasy tale of heroism and redemption.Banned from his homeland, Viking warband leader Asgrim Wood-Nose has been declared outlaw. Unless he can raise a princely blood debt, he will never see his beloved Denmark again. When a Saracen merchant brags of a great treasure hidden on the Frankish island of Noirmoutier—home to the Black Monastery—Asgrim believes fate is offering him a chance to go home again. But an ancient evil has escaped the Black Monastery, an eastern demon that wears the skins of its victims. Hunted by this monstrous foe and tormented by the ghosts of those he has slain, Asgrim’s only ally becomes another lonely soul, a Frankish woman abandoned by her people under suspicion of witchcraft.Beware the foe behind the strange threshold.
