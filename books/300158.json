Possibly.My heart? Irrevocably.Kincaid is cruel. Savage. A monster. I should hate him, but something inside of him whispers to the dark parts of me, bringing me back to life. So, when he says needs me, I owe it to him to try.Two of the seven lords of Hell are dead, and I may be the only creature on this mortal coil able to reach them. But my power is drawing unwanted celestial attention, luring in new foes on all sides until it’s impossible to know who to trust.Better the devil I know, than the ones I don’t.Sins of the Damned is book two in this enthralling series of sinful truths, wicked desires, and a girl caught in the crossfire of a celestial war centuries in the making.",
