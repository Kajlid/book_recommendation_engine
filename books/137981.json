With Ava the members of their Spiritualist circle experience more and more of the otherworldly communications they seek, but Pari makes sure everyone knows where to point the spotlight. When a visit to a decrepit house with an unfortunate history results in an impromptu psychic session, the group is presented with a task theyâ€™re not sure they want to take on. Ava finds she may have the protective friendship of her circle, but will she ever feel safe truly being herself?",
