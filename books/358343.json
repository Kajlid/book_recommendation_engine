If they don't, their love was never yours to begin with...\" The road to love is never smooth, and when Jon pushes Cameron away with his demands, he thinks he's lost his chance forever. Jon has held his love for Cameron in check, waiting for his late-blooming friend to grow up. Then one college summer working road construction, they are forced to share a bed, bringing them closer than ever before. The dark nights spent in each other's arms reveal their mutual attraction, but Jon pushes too far, too fast. Cam has looked up to his best friend Jon for years and trusts him completely. He enjoys the gentle loving they share but when Jon wants to go further than he's ready for, Cam balks, and Jon's reaction costs them their friendship. Years later, Cam needs a friend, and Jon returns home to lend his support. Has there been too much water under the bridge, or will they both finally be ready to embrace the love they once lost?",
