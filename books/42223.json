  "description": "A new star bursts onto the post-apocalyptic fiction Thomas Koloniar. An epic dark saga set in a dystopian near-future, Cannibal Reign follows the fortunes of a small band of survivors, as they make their way across a nightmare landscape populated by bestial, flesh-eating savages after an asteroid strike destroys America. A dark, smart, action-packed vision of a terrifying possible tomorrow—when the only law left is “eat or be eaten”—Koloniar’s Cannibal Reign is an absolute must-read for fans of TV’s zombie smash hit The Walking Dead , Cormac McCarthy’s The Road , Lucifer’s Hammer , the Mad Max movies, and, of course, Stephen King’s immortal horror masterwork The Stand .",
