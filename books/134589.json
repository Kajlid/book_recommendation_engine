  "title": "Tablets: Choose the Right One for You",
  "description": "This eBook should be read by anyone who is considering buying a tablet PC. You might already own an iPhone and think that an Apple iPad makes most sense, or have your heart set on an affordable Android tablet, but before you look at tablet PC models and prices, consider what type of tablet user you will be. Once you formulate a clear idea of what is important for you, analysing the app ecosystem, design, hardware and other factors will become meaningful, and your choice will be truly satisfying. This 4000 word eBook doesn't try to sell you any particular brand or model, it presents you with questions to consider about what you want to use a tablet for, and asks you six key questions in the HUGOMETER algorithm for choosing a tablet.",
