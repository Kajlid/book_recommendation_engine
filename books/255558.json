  "description": "Theo Glass used to believe that love was just a fairy tale. Orphaned and disowned by his homophobic step-family, he and his grandma make ends meet as best they can. But when his grandma’s tireless charity work is honoured, Theo makes sure he spends his last pennies to get her to the palace, hosted by none other than the gorgeous Prince James himself. James is sixth in line to the throne of the United Kingdom and a disappointment to just about everyone. He never felt at home at school, on the rugby pitch, or even in the Army. Being royalty means he’s been forced to keep a lid on his bisexuality. But when he meets Theo at the honours ceremony, he knows he’s in serious trouble. Needing to find purpose, James convinces Theo to use his charity event savvy to throw a fundraiser ball in a secluded castle. All James has to do is behave himself around the sassy twink. But soon the chemistry between them is too strong to resist. Their lives are too different and there’s no chance James can come out as the first Prince of the United Kingdom with a boyfriend. But James knows if he doesn’t show Theo how much he means to him, he’ll lose him forever. Can love conquer all? Or is that something just for fairy tales? A Right Royal Affair is a steamy, standalone MM romance novel featuring a pack of unruly royal terriers, a romantic ball, feisty swans, a wicked step-father, and a guaranteed HEA with absolutely no cliffhanger.",
