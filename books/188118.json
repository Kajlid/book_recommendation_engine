  "description": "... Long before the bird reared its ugly beak, there was beer. And lots of it. In the humble world of alley cats, Tom has everything he interesting enemies, a long list of girl cats who'd like to scratch his eyes out, and enough beer to make sure his repressed memories and his mysterious destiny stay repressed. Until Wild Rat microbrewery shuts down. To restore his favorite beer to its former glory, Tom will have to fight prissy bureaucrats, streetwise alley cats, and Broxton's most barbaric rats. And behind it all, an evil so great that even Broxton's most hardened rodents dare not squeak of it.",
