  "description": "Layla has been running from herself for longer than she can remember. Her thoughts scare her - her cravings frighten her - and, the things she wants to do would be frowned upon by all good members of Society.After she accidentally kills the President of the Hell Hounds MC Kent Chapter, a void is left within the club. There are a few runners that could step up and take on the role of President, unfortunately none of those candidates play nicely with one another - except when Layla is around.Can she serve as the proverbial glue to keep the club together? Or, better yet fill the void herself?----I was a mess, and I wish I could say that I was a mess because of the situation I was in, but the truth was that Iâ€™d been a mess for a while now. So maybe staying here - in this club, was exactly the kind of experience I needed. Maybe here I would find my purpose. Because floating around from country to country doing photoshoots was getting old really quickly.",
