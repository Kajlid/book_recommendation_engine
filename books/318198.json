  "description": "DISABLED DECAY: When a Duty of Care Becomes DeadlyMatilda Lock aka disabled vlogger Tilly-Tok likes to show the world that a wheelchair isn’t an obstacle—it’s an opportunity. She’s done everything, and she’s done it all on camera. Almost everything anyway. There’s one trending topic she hasn’t been able to engage in—until now that is. Urban exploring. When support worker and bestie, Tessa, finds an abandoned Doctor’s surgery they can get into, they can’t believe their luck! Getting in is just a matter of breaking one lock (but it’s new so they aren’t really breaking any of the unwritten rules of Urban adventure). Getting out is going to be a different story, though. In this classic horror, there are ghostly secrets to behold—one’s which Tilly-Tok can’t avoid, much less run from. With the added element of inescapable terror, Tilly-Tok will have to muster all of the bravery and independence she can if she’s going to be the one to help out Tessa for once! If she doesn’t . . . Well, these ghosts aren’t going to be the only tortured souls in this place.",
