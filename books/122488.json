  "description": "A GIFT AWAKENING. A LEGEND REVEALED. In a remote corner of the Arctic, unexplained phenomenon haunt an isolated community. Several people have disappeared, and somehow young Erika Holstrom knows why. Still reeling from the loss of her mother, she escapes to university, only to be followed by unsettling visions of the future. When a Russian submarine vanishes in the far North, Erika's nightmares suggest the answers lay buried deep in her family history. Now, just as the melting polar ice releases its sinister secrets, Erika and her friends are in a race against time to convince the sceptical authorities what is really happening in her Arctic homeland, before it’s too late. Will they succeed, or is the frozen North lost forever...Helluland is a modern coming-of-age saga that blends the mystery of speculative fiction with the intrigue of a geo-political techno thriller. Inspired by the effects of climate change in the Arctic, its climax is a moral condemnation of inaction and perhaps an unsettling prediction for the future. Readers looking for a dynamic genre mash-up with potential supernatural elements and a rousing cast will find this excursion into the cold worth taking.",
