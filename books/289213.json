  "description": "When four immortal brothers venture onto mortal lands in search of a damn bird, they somehow manage to also acquire me.I’m just as surprised as they are. One minute I’m chained up with my master’s fist raised, and the next, Chaos himself has stepped in and saved my life – or at least my face. I’m used to saving myself, and my new life in immortal lands isn’t going to be easy.I mean, I do cause a little trouble… I may have put a taco in one of the brother’s boots. But that’s small potatoes compared to the magical freaking bubble I end up in – which I wholeheartedly blame Chaos for. It might be invisible but it is very real to me. I’m trapped within a pretty tight perimeter of at least one of the brothers, and if he leaves the room and I’m not right behind him I will literally be crushed to death against the wall. So we’d better get used to working with each other, and living, and showering. Everything! Privacy doesn’t exist anymore.There’s more going on here. With me, with them, with the world we all reside in. Their kingdom is on the brink of destruction. No one can be trusted, and we only have each other. Can the four immortal alpha males drop their guard long enough to see what’s right in front of them? This is a full-length, slow-burn reverse harem filled with humor, crazy antics, and excitement as Shade and her men fight overwhelming odds to find a way to be together. HEA guaranteed...but they're going to have to work for it.Reviewers are saying fans of Tamora Pierce, Maria V Snyder, Jaymin Eve, Jane Washington, Tate James, and Auryn Hadley will love these books. ⚠ Warning: laugh out loud funny and potential drink snorting. ⚠",
