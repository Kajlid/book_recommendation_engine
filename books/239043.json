  "description": "Sought is the first installment in the reverse harem paranormal romance serial, Seeking Serena. Serena I survived the night, but I haven't survived them. I broke their millennia-old tradition. I broke their biting game right in half. I should've known they wouldn't just let me walk away from them, oh no. They think I'm something else, that maybe not quite all vampire - but who cares? The Master wants me gone and there's nothing standing between me and his thirteen heirs. Nothing but a kiss. \nAmbrose, Theron, and Orlando\n The Master came to us, one by one, and told us exactly what he wants: Serena. She's a threat - watch her. She's not like us - figure out what she is. She's still our game to play - play it. All that matters is that one of us wins, but this is just the beginning. Serena Moon is unlike any other woman, mortal or immortal. Safeguarding our hearts and our lusts will be key, but how long can we be expected to resist her? Especially after what happened last time...",
