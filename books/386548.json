In 'The Adventure of the Dying Detective' our favourite genius has caught some strange and deadly disease among the sailors and the filth of the London docks.Holmes' mind may have been affected and he spews insults at Dr. Watson the like of which his readers have never heard before. But there's one glimmer - can Watson locate Mr. Culverton Smith, the world's leading expert on the disease who is presently in London?Librarian's note: (from the publisher) this scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the original.
