  "description": "Their choice is simple. Fight together or die by a weapon that makes dragons fall from the sky.  As a Dragon Rider, Nadiyah loves the sky, thirsts for adventure, and breaks all the rules. Not even sparks flying with Azel, the Chief’s son, will make her submit to dragon clan traditions.  Her dragon’s flames are ready to incinerate the army marching on their sacred valley. But this army doesn’t demand war. Instead, they need powerful allies.  Nadiyah finally has a chance to explore with the help of Caden, a handsome lieutenant. But, scarred by civil war, the world outside Dragon Valley may be more than what she bargained for.  The true battleground is in her heart. Azel may die in the gruesome trial to become the next Chief. Caden will never be accepted by her people.  Now, Nadiyah only wants the impossible: to keep the men she loves, and unite the army and dragon clans against a common enemy hellbent on destroying them all.  \nDragon Valley is the first volume in an epic fantasy romance trilogy. The heroine will have multiple love interests and will not have to choose between them.",
