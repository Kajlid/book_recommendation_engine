  "description": "Lake Fisher is known as a place where miracles happen. The Reed Brothers are hoping for a miracle of their own — to be able to take a vacation for one solid week with no paparazzi showing up. They descend upon Lake Fisher hoping for quiet, but they find a lot more. They find a lovely community of people that welcomes them with open arms. In true Reed brothers style, they get to spread a little Christmas cheer and perform a few miracles of their own.THIS BOOK IS NOT A STAND-ALONE ROMANCE. It relies heavily on the prior books in the series.This book is told from the points of view of the five Reed brothers, Edward, and the wives. If you have not read the other books in the series, you won’t be lost, as long as you know the brothers. Find out who’s having babies, who’s getting in what shenanigans, and find out about new romances that might be brewing in this charming novella.",
