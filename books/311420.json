  "description": "“She’s clearly spooked about something.”“No,” Finn murmured and narrowed his eyes. “She’s not afraid, Tony. She’s bracing.”“For what?”“No fucking clue. I’ll tell you when I find out, which will be five minutes from now.”Adeline Smith is running for her life from people who have hurt her and everyone helping her. Addie knows that she should keep moving but doesn’t know where to go and needs a place to hide while she catches her breath and comes up with a plan.Finnegan Dawry is the calm, cool, and very capable Sergeant at Arms in Cascadia MC. Finn knows that he and the other men in the club can fix anything Addie needs help fixing if she’d only let them.Addie walked into the roadhouse operated by Cascadia MC in a small town outside Seattle to get help loosening a couple of lug nuts, and seeing her feels like a kick in Finn’s gut. He’s fifty-fucking-plus years old and not at all prepared for anything to hit him anywhere, and then the frustrating woman won’t tell him what’s wrong. If they push her too hard, she might disappear down the road in a cloud of dust, so Finn will have to find a way to protect her until she’s learned to trust him.This is a story about strength and survival and about finding something you didn’t expect in the middle of an absolute shitstorm.Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn’t your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
