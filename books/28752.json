  "description": "Three women are murdered with obsidian mirrors. As dark and mysterious as the notes found next to the bodies.The police call in Yvette Garcin, a specialist with the OMR- a French government agency tasked with monitoring cults and religious movements.Little does Yvette know that she is in for the ride of her life. Her investigation uncovers a string of apparently unconnected a 1967 murder,a group of 7th century Yemeni priestesses, the Holy Grail, and the Priory of Sion- all of which lead her deeper into a murky netherworld of occult conspiracy but bring her no closer to solving the murders. Just as she thinks she's hit a wall, a sudden, catastrophic turn of events sets her on the trail of an international plot to bring about the Apocalypse. And it may be too late to stop it.",
