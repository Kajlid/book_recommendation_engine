  "title": "Peace Behind the Wire: A Nonviolent Resolution",
  "description": "On January 18, 2011, twelve prisoners signed a solemn pledge and set out to see if they could live in peace with the men inside Georgia’s most dangerous maximum security prison. It was a simple but powerful pledge: for forty days they would follow the example of iconic peacemakers and commit themselves to timeless, nonviolent principles. Peace Behind the Wire: A Nonviolent Resolution chronicles the Power of Peace Project’s story as it grew to include prisons, schools, and churches across the United States, even planting seeds of peace inside prisons in South Africa, Mexico, Honduras, and Ukraine. With those initial signatures, POPP was officially born, and its founder, Kit Cummings, began the journey of bringing peace to those most removed from it. Peace Behind the Wire is the fascinating true story of this unlikely band of brothers, and the movement they inspired-- one that has become a Teen Peace Phenomenon. Author Kit Cumming’s stunning new book asks a simple question: Are you ready for PEACE?",
