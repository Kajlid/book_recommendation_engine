  "description": "When Cooper McCain’s past lovers show up in Chaos, Texas, in order to rekindle an old romance, Cooper knows he’s in trouble. He’s worked hard to put both Mallory Johanson and Liam Jacoby behind him. The memories surrounding their past relationship have left him feeling bitter and afraid of trying again. Letting go of heartbreak is a hard thing to do. Nearly as intimidating is knowing that to do so means coming out of the closet to those closest to him. Is love reason enough to forget past hurts, to move forward in a relationship that has the ability to make the three of them very happy? Is Cooper willing to risk everything in order to find out?",
