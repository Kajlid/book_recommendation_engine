  "description": "A historical holiday story of homecoming and second-chance romance by NAACP Image Award Nominee, Beverly Jenkins.\n  In 1883, Lydia Cooper is happily traveling back home to celebrate the simple joys of the holidays when an unexpected complication appears in the all-too-distracting form of Gray Dane, the man she loved as a girl; the man she left behind. Gray, a soldier, is finally returning home too. Seeing Lydia after fifteen years reignites all the temptations from years ago…and also the pain and regret.  But as Lydia and Gray make their way home together, they get a chance to mend the past, and rediscover the joy, trust —and passion — of before; to realize that love isn’t just sweeter the second time around, it’s downright decadent.  This novella was previously published in Gettin’ Merry, A Holiday Anthology   “Jenkins’s dialogue crackles ...” –Publishers Weekly  “Her stories are delicious and always leave behind both feelings of satisfaction and want...for her next novel.” –Fresh Fiction  “Jenkins is a gifted storyteller who knows how to bring special spark and sass to romance.” –Romantic Times BOOKclub",
