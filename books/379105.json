This creature erupts from the sky, extinguishing lives from our existence. All acts seem random, the deaths unexplainable, the bodies indecipherable. These are the elements that convinced bored college graduate Mina Clyne to investigate the supernatural. But with eyewitness accounts as her only evidence, she becomes desperate to prove the demon’s existence despite the constant supervision of skeptical and overprotective friends. Only action will give her the answers, the reason these bodies were taken from the earth and charred completely to ash.But how far will she go to prove a supernatural truth? And will she survive when in the midst of all fires lies…the demon’s fog. Written By Christine SoltisCopyright July 2010First Edition",
