  "description": "An outcast maiden. A fae prince. A match bound by fate.When outcast cobbler Rhianne braves the enchanted wood to find her fated love, absolutely everything that could go wrong does. The Matchweaver witch’s magical loom reveals Rhianne is fated for the most powerful fae prince in history. Sounds great to Rhianne, but the Matchweaver has big plans for the prince, and they don’t involve a lowly cobbler. The Matchweaver rages at the match, and her fit angers the ancients who crafted it. The ancients present a magical wand to Rhianne, setting the young woman on the path to raise a new Matchweaver.The Matchweaver sets a deadly darkness to spread across the kingdom, and Rhianne has days to raise the new Matchweaver or everyone in Lore will die.Although horrified at the darkness unspooling across the land, Prince Werian is rather delighted at the turn of events. He was meant for adventure such as this and doesn’t mind dodging dangerous spells. What he isn’t prepared for is the sacrifice he’ll have to make to save the kingdom.This quest isn’t what Rhianne and Werian believed it to be, and if they don’t figure out how to rescue themselves and Lore, it won’t only be a legendary love lost, the entire kingdom will disappear into the void.Loosely inspired by the old tales of Robin Hood, Enchanting the Fae prince is the second stand-alone fantasy romance in the Kingdoms of Lore series but readers can start with this book. *This series is set in the same world as the Dragons Rising series, but readers can begin with any of the books in this series.",
