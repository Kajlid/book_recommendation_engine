  "title": "Literary Outlaw: The Life and Times of William S. Burroughs",
  "description": "Anarchist, heroin addict, alcoholic, nihilist, homosexual crusader, and brilliant writer, William S. Burroughs was the patron saint and Prince of Darkness of the Beats of the 1950s. His ground-breaking avant-garde masterpiece NAKED LUNCH shocked the literary world with its graphic descriptions of drug abuse and sexual perversion—and resulted in a landmark Supreme Court ruling on obscenity. Pulitzer Prize-winning author Tim Morgan's biography of Burroughs captures one of the most lionized artist/criminals of our times—a violent, reckless genius whose history is as bizarre as his fiction. A rebel—hero, Burroughs symbolized the anti—authoritarian cause for three generations of the young and disillusioned—exploring the murkiest depths of human terror and degradation in his art—and in his life. Literary Outlaw is a wild ride through the life of a man who became an icon for the counterculture and whose perverse and decadent life mirrors his remarkable art.",
