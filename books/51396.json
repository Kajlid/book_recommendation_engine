  "description": "Curzio Malaparte was a disaffected supporter of Mussolini with a taste for danger and high living.Sent by an Italian paper during World War II to cover the fighting on the Eastern Front, Malaparte secretly wrote this terrifying report from the abyss, which became an international bestseller when it was published after the war. Telling of the siege of Leningrad, of glittering dinner parties with Nazi leaders, and of trains disgorging bodies in war-devastated Romania, Malaparte paints a picture of humanity at its most depraved.Kaputt is an insiderâ€™s dispatch from the world of the enemy that is as hypnotically fascinating as it is disturbing.",
