  "title": "The Error World: An Affair with Stamps",
  "description": "From the Penny Red to the Blue Mauritius, generations of collectors have been drawn to the mystique of rare stamps. Once a widespread pastime of schoolboys, philately has increasingly become the province of adults obsessed with the shrewd investment, the once-in-a-lifetime find, the one elusive beauty that will complete a collection and satisfy an unquenchable thirst.As a boy, Simon Garfield collected errors - rare pigment misprints that create ghostly absences in certain stamps. When this passion reignited in his mid-forties, it consumed him. In the span of a couple of years he amassed a collection of errors worth upward of forty thousand pounds, pursuing not only this secret passion but a romantic one, as his marriage disintegrated.In this unique memoir, Garfield twines the story of his philatelic obsession with an honest and engrossing exploration of the rarities and absences that both limit and define us. The end result is a thoughtful, funny, and enticing meditation on the impulse to possess.",
