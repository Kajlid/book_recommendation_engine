  "description": "WINSTON CHURCHILL’S famous tribute, “Never in the field of human conflict have so many owed so much to so few,” was said of men like Wing Commander. Stanford Tuck and his comrades, the “so few” who saved England in 1940 from the onslaught of Hitler’s invasion.An outstanding leader in the Royal Air Force... ace of aces in the Battle of Britain... hero of a daring escape from an “escape-proof” German prison, Stanford Tuck was one of England’s best-loved and best-known fighter pilots. From the hard-fought air battles over France to the epic confrontations in the skies of England, this magnificent biography paints a vibrant and colorful portrait of Tuck and his most exciting moments—the breathtaking dogfights ... his stunning victories over the Luftwaffe...his innovative and imaginative air tactics.Illustrated with handsome drawings, Fly for Your Life not only tells the story of a legendary pilot, it re-creates in graphic detail experiences common to all RAF airmen who flew and fought. Roaring aloft to defend their homeland in Hurricanes and Spitfires, these were the same men who would later carry the air war to Germany itself. Here is an utterly fascinating portrayal of great warriors doing their jobs with immeasurable courage...men who convinced themselves that they could return from impossible missions.",
