  "description": "Life in Lincoln, Maine couldn't seem more boring for introverted writer, Mark Stevens. But he liked it that way. Alex Sutherland just wanted to fit in with his friends in Portland and get noticed by one in particular, Beth Malone. Life seemed normal. That would change. After a strange object explodes in the sky, Mark and Alex each find they have amazing new abilities. And they aren't alone. In New York a string of bank vaults are mysteriously emptied with no trace left behind. Now two factions are looking for those who have discovered these new abilities. Each with a different purpose for them in mind. People who lived normal lives face changes they never expected, and will be taken to places they thought they'd never go.",
