  "description": "Everyone wants to get close to a rock star.  The bright lights. The music. Those talented fingers strumming… a guitar. Everyone wants to bang a rock star.  So why do I keep running from the one who wants me?  I’m America’s Sweetheart. I have a reputation. He’s a boy-band icon turned rock god. I’m vanilla. He’s every flavor of bad. And he’s much, much too young for me.  If I end up in Nick Ryder’s bed, my career and I will both be screwed.  ...but that’s only if I’m caught.",
