They are uniquely individual, but together they are power and magic. I imagine they are not quite of this world. Though what that world would be and who they are within it, is your story to tell.(one minor deet - I'm really not much of a D/s or BDSM fan)Photo Description: Three gorgeous men lie with heads together, two facing one way, the other between them reversed. Their intent eyes gaze up out of the picture. One's dark-skinned, curly haired, full featured with dark eyes. The next's a pale-skinned brunet with blue eyes. The last has more olive skin and dark eyes. They touch hands lightly, the connection between them palpable.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Hot Summer Days\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.Download the story, read it online or find it in Don't Read in the Closet, Volume 1.__________Genre: sci-fi, fantasy, m√©nageTags: gay m/m, threesome, friends to lovers, firefighter, futuristic, magicWord Count: 3,632",
