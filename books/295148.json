  "description": "Ren Moretti I’ve lived my entire life to the beat of one simple motto. Work hard to play hard. A no brainer, really. As one of five partners to a nationwide security firm, I do whatever it takes to get the job done, making sure to reward myself with whatever the hell I want. Sure, the job comes with its own set of dangers—but none of the bullets or knives come close to the peril of one alluring young woman. Casandra Martinez—my little angel—is a risk all on her own. Turning my world from black and white to vibrant; she’s a sensory overload and far from simple.But the biggest problem is far worse than just a kink in my routine. No. She’s off limits. Forbidden. Unwilling to heed the warning, I’m drawn to her light. And like a moth to the flame, I fall. Only one question remains… Will her love be my salvation or my demise? Acts of Salvation is book two in the Men of WRATH series but could be read as a Standalone. WARNING (OR INVITATION): AOS contains mature language and gasp-worthy scenes.",
