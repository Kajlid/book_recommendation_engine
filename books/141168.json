Since then, citizens have been divided into two classes: a wealthy class who lives forever and a lower class of Temporals who just try to live. Soccer player Ledger Dent has been offered an opportunity to join the wealthy Eternals, which seems to be a triumph until he meets an old coach and slowly begins to unravel why competition is unacceptable. Itâ€™s then that he realizes more than his personal glory hinges on a victory.",
