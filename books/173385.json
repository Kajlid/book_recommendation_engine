  "description": "Werelioness Addy Wilson did the unthinkable—she kidnapped an alpha’s cub. Not because she wants to harm the small child but to save him from his father. Unfortunately, as she flees for her life and tries to disappear into the confusion of the city, she runs into her mate. Or rather, he hits her with his car. Zane is gorgeous, delicious, totally lickable and… an Enforcer for the North American pride. In fact, Zane works directly with the pride’s beta. Now she’s torn between running to ensure the child’s safety and staying to make a life with Zane.  **Stand alone, no cliffhangers.**  Quick & Furry: Love, Laughs, and a Bit of Rawr on the Go.
