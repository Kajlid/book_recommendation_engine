  "description": "Bryant didn't know, okay? When the Fated Date Agency matched him with an alpha, he had no idea that it was Cade.  Of course, that excuse didn't hold up for long. Soon the bookish young omega figured out who he was emailing. Bryant made the choice to keep it a secret from the best friend he'd always crushed on - and to let Cade believe he was talking to a woman.  The thing was, Cade was straight. No matter what the agency said about them being fated mates, it was never going to work between them. It would be best for them both if Bryant just stopped emailing him.  Unfortunately for Bryant, his sexy jock friend liked the idea of a girl fated just for him. And he wasn't going to give up that easily.  Omega's Lie is a steamy 60-page paranormal gay romance story and the first part of the Fated Dates trilogy.",
