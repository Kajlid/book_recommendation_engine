  "description": "If ever she learnt her lesson that you can’t rely on the man you love, Lily has certainly been taught.  Escaping to a tropical paradise, she meets an eccentric local woman, Yolanda, to help her rebuild her life so she can forget about getting her heart decimated by Richard Hayden-Quik, once again.  But things are never that simple and to her surprise, her tricky bastard ex-husband wants her back and is willing to do all most anything so they can be a family.  Is it possible to trust someone who constantly breaks your heart and spirit even though they are the love of your life?  And when you have two people in his life, his long term ex-lover, Tia, and his best friend, John Bentley, literally vying for your blood, is there any way you can piece together your relationship?  Lily continues her roller coaster love affair ride that takes a humorous but dark and terrifying turn in a surprising way. One bitten, twice shy but how much can one woman take?  Can true love survive and will she? The concluding part to the problem of getting Rich Quik… and it’s a much bigger problem than she could have ever imagined!",
