  "title": "The Best Bits of Physics",
  "description": "Just got a new Kindle for Christmas? Interested in science and the world around us? Studying for exams?  Physics is fundamental to our understanding of the world around us. Everyone should have at least a basic knowledge. This book explains some of the most interesting parts of physics in simple terms. It dips in, never taking more than two pages for one topic. There is even a good selection of experiments you can do at home! It is suitable for any student of science as well as anyone wanting to enhance their knowledge.  A few words from the author: Physics is a hard subject. Everyone knows that. Tell someone that you are studying physics and they will be impressed. This will probably be followed by a comment along the lines of \"I could never do that at school\". It is still one of the most demanding GCSEs and A-Levels.  This book is an attempt to serve up some of the best bits of physics. It should give you an understanding of the key concepts in modern physics. Along the way I hope you will be convinced that the heart of physics isn't all that hard after all. Perhaps you'll even be able to explain it to your friends and family...",
