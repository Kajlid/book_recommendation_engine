  "title": "Flibbertigibbety Words: Young Shakespeare Chases Inspiration",
  "description": "With quotes and references to the famous works of William Shakespeare and the words he invented.It all starts one morning when words fly into Williamâ€™s window. He wants to catch them, but they are flibbertigibbety and quick and slip right through his fingers. Soon whole lines of verse are leading him on a wild goose chase as they tumble, dip, flip and skip all through town, past a host of colorful characters the observant reader may find as familiar as the quotes. William remains persistent, and with time and the proper tools he finds a way to keep the words with him.",
