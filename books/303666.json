Sent by her father to locate the Knights Templar's greatest treasure—and save her kingdom from ruin—Princess Isabella of France finds one of seven secret doors that unlocks the Templars' mysterious treasure. With this discovery, she expects the mission to be easy. But when she is ambushed on the Camino de Santiago, Isabella is not only forced to seek refuge with the exact company she was sent to steal from, but she's unexpectedly reunited with her one true love, Etienne.It's not long before the past catches up with Isabella and Etienne. Now they must both decide: to love again, or to remain loyal? Etienne is tied to his vow as a Templar and Isabella to the will of her father.Isabella's quest leads her to love, friendship, and self-discovery—but if she's not careful, it could also lead to the end of the world.Even though this novel is a work of fiction, if you visit the Camino de Santiago today, you can still see the symbols and runes that inspired the secret Templar code as well as the towns, cathedrals, and castles from the story.This historical fiction is the first book in a trilogy that combines the cipher-breaking mystery of the Da Vinci Code with the life-altering spiritual lessons of The Alchemist.",
