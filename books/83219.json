  "description": "WHAT HATRED BREEDS is the story of Kayla and Julian Moore, a newly married couple and their struggle to stand against the evil that pursues them in the form of Stella Moreau, Julian's nefarious mother. Kayla and Julian embark on an arduous journey that was set in motion on the very day Kayla touched the fiber of her adversary…Stella Moreau had great faith in her craft. She had faith in her lineage. Her blood was Toussaint, her name was Moreau, but she was Metoyer by right; by privilege. She had a fiercely latent centuries-old power that coursed straight through her lineage and had been passed down to her. It flowed from Geneviève, to Cèlestine, to Anastasie, to Gisèle, to Grandmere Lisette, to Maman Angelique, to Stella. Metoyer's did not have to operate under the confines of voodoo; they were not bound by the laws of rituals. They called to something deeper, something much darker. Of course if anyone knew the true source of the darkness that lie behind the Metoyer's power, they would surely pray for their souls. The Metoyer's were more powerful than the boundaries of voodoo and far darker, a source of power hidden for centuries.This book will take you to the underbelly of spiritual warfare and have you riveted as the story begins to unfold with each page. Surprisingly, Kayla and Julian's plight is not uncommon and the reader will instantly be able to identify with the torrid love story tangled within the stronghold of darkness.",
