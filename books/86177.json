  "description": "Following the death of her mother, Ruth McGovern, 14, is sent off to boarding school in the Scottish Highlands. Feeling lonely and rejected, Ruth struggles to settle at Grimewell Manor, (once a Victorian orphanage) but taking part in a séance not long after she arrives, a spirit called ‘Jennifer Rose Carr’ seems to be attempting to make contact with her. When Ruth gets lost one day trying to make her way back to school, she is surprised to come across a real life ‘Jennifer Rose Carr’, who befriends her. When she is bullied by classmates, Ruth finds herself spending more and more time with Jennifer who has the kind of life with her mother, Dolores, Ruth envies.Cast as Mary Magdalene in the school nativity play, Ruth begins to find acceptance at Grimewell, and when she embarks on a relationship with Jake, from nearby St Wilfred’s, things start to look up. But when the bullying gets worse and when Ruth finds herself rejected by Jake too, Ruth’s desperation sets off a chain of events that culminates in tragic, life changing consequences.",
