  "title": "The Dog Who Ate the Truffle: A Memoir of Stories and Recipes from Umbria",
  "description": "An authentic culinary journey—part memoir, part cookbook—introducing readers to the people, places, and food of UmbriaVeteran food critic Suzanne Carriero spent a year and a half in Umbria, and this is her intimate look at its ancient recipes, traditions, and the people who pass them on. Each of the book's eight chapters features local cooks, as their personal stories are as much a part of the cuisine's essence as are the crops they grow and the family dishes they prepare.Anecdotes, sidebars, and boxes are used throughout the book to further illustrate Umbrian life—from buying a rabbit in the country, to making torta di Pasqua for Easter, to reading the Italian wine label, and drinking cappuccino after lunch (a serious breach in tradition). With a food and wine glossary included as a reference for travelers, The Dog Who Ate the Truffle immerses the reader in the people, cuisine, and lifestyle that few are privileged to experience. Suzanne's colorful stories and authentic classic recipes make for an intimate and illustrious travel cookbook.",
