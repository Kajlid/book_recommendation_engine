  "description": "Sky's whole world is turned upside down when she catches her long-time boyfriend cheating. Depressed over the breakup, she decides to drive to the beach to spend time with her friends and drown her sorrows in hot guys and fruity drinks. The only problem with her plan is her piece-of-junk car. It breaks down halfway into her trip, in the middle of nowhereâ€”a place where cell phone towers don't even exist. Ford's life has changed drastically in the past year, and he spends his days working at his family's run-down auto repair shop. When his father tells him to go rescue a stranded traveler, he soon finds himself with a hot opportunity to forget about what ruined his life, even if it's only for one night. With sexy chemistry between them, Sky and Ford agree to a one-night stand, to let go of what each of them are running from and enjoy each other with no strings attached. But as their heated night progresses, they both know that one night is never going to be enough. What happens when one night turns into two? And two turns into three? Can two people, who know nothing about each other, really fall in love?Or is lust just playing with their torn hearts?",
