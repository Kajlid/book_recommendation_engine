Unfortunately she is soon betrayed and captured by the dreaded German secret police, the Gestapo. She and the other captives are subjected to terrible and obscene tortures, but her captivity soon takes a strange turn and she is faced with revelations about her own sexuality, danger from all sides, and the possibility of love and rescue from the most unexpected quarter.
