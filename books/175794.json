  "description": "Though it may be difficult to believe, the eleven stories in this collection are based in truth. Author Jeremy Sayers hails from a family of adventurers and farmers. His father’s family came to America in 1715 and settled in Virginia. His mother’s family arrived much later, immigrants and migrants. All together, these people were coal miners, blacksmiths, and cowboys. Most of all, they were believers in whatever it was that let them survive one sunrise to another. And they were storytellers. Fencline and Other Stories brings some of those tales to life. Like the myths of ancient cultures, the Greeks, Hindus, Hebrews, and Native Americans, these stories tell about a particular time and place. But, they also contain something timeless. These stories give us reasons to laugh and to mourn. And the characters in these tales teach us something about coping with strife as we share little parts of their lives.",
