Now, I’m facing the damning consequences.The walls are closing in as I balance duty to grandmother’s memory with my impossible feelings for Kyros. Then there’s the freakin’ human-vampire hybrid thing to deal with.The problem is, I’m no longer willing to lose the person I’ve gambled against from the start.Our fates hinge on a single roll of the dice, and one wrong move could collapse the tower of cards I’ve painstakingly built.If that happens, I’ll lose more than I ever bargained for.",
