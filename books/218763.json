  "description": "Latchling Blood Moon – A Cassidy Edwards Novella (The story of Lady Elizabeth Rowle and Dorian Ramsey)  Fate picked me to face an ancient evil. As a powerful Latchling of the Stonehenge Druids, I, Lady Elizabeth Rowle, walked the path of my destiny. I lived life battle-ready, training continually, and spending my days delving into the arcane, seeking any and all knowledge that might aid my quest. At last, I felt ready to face the evil haunting my dreams. But there was one thing I hadn’t prepared for.  Love.   Scotland, Fourteenth Century  When Lady Elizabeth Rowle discovers the ancient evil of the Mindbreaker has reawakened, she knows her time has come. Finding unexpected allies in the Scottish Highlander, Dorian Ramsey, and the French Devil of a vampire, Jacques LeBeau, she fights the battle of her life—only to discover that fate has other plans.   Note from Carmen:  What started out scheduled to be a 20,000 word novella ended up almost 46,000 and full-length book... but what can I say? Elizabeth Rowle had a lot she wanted to share including an insight on Lucian that will be helpful to know when reading \"Rebel\".",
