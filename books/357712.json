  "description": "Charlie Matherson really doesn't have a clue how to go about telling his friend Tom Harris that he's gay. What makes matters worse is that Charlie's been head over heels in love with Tom for more than a year. Finally, at a Christmas party, Charlie throws caution to the wind-and gives Tom a long, intensely hot kiss. Was it sheer desperation, stupidity, or both? Charlie's sure he's really made a mess of their friendship. But has he?",
