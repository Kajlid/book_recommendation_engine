  "description": "From the author of L.A. Weather comes a magical, humorous, and passion-filled odyssey about a beautiful young widow’s search for her missing child—a mission that takes her from a humble Mexican village to the rowdy brothels of Tijuana and a rarely seen side of Los Angeles.Rescued from turmoil by her favorite saint, Esperanza embarks on a journey that tests her faith, teaches her the ways of the world, and transforms her from a fervently religious innocent to an independent, sexual, and passionately devout woman.“Esperanza’s Box of Saints fills our souls with colors and flavors, but more importantly with a sense of genuine, heartfelt candor, born from true faith. With a smile on our face and a pang in our heart, we find renewed hope in Esperanza's quest.” —Laura Esquivel, author of Like Water for Chocolate“The saints in María Amparo Escandón's novel take us on a journey that explores the nature of sin and absolution, the pain of loss, and the resurrection of desire...an enormously compassionate work about a woman who wrestles with her own faith and emerges victorious.” —John Sayles​ “A sweet and entertaining novel by an inventive writer.” —Oscar Hijuelos​ “A highly original, beautifully written, and heartwarming tale.” —Tony Hillerman",
