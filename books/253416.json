  "description": "“There is pleasure in the pathless woods, there is rapture in the lonely shore, there is society where none intrudes, by the deep sea, and music in its roar; I love not Man the less, but Nature more” -Lord Byron  Being a Mer/Human hybrid isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. I’ve been on the sidelines my whole life thanks to my odd looks and “questionable” prestige. Now though, it’s time for the Summer Solstice festival where Mers who just turned 25 can meet the royal heirs to see if they hear the Call to Bond. There are currently seven hunky heirs, one from each kingdom who have yet to find a mate...and it’s just my luck, they’re coming to a kingdom near me!  Join Rowena and her seven men on the adventure of a lifetime as they discover what destiny and the Gods gave in store for them and learn to navigate their new, and complicated relationship. This is a Reverse-Harem Novel, meaning the heroine doesn’t have to choose, she can have them all!",
