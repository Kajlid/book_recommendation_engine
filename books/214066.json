  "description": "Coryn Williams is left behind in the megacity of Seacouver after her parents commit suicide and her sister, Lou, flees the city to work for a non-governmental organization (NGO) in the wild lands. For company, Coryn has her companion robot, Paula, who helps her get through school, keeps her safe in the city, and acts a coach for her in many things -- including running marathons. But Coryn misses her sister. When she graduates from high school, she is required to choose a profession. She refuses, instead choosing to “go feral” and leave the safety of her city to find Lou. She abandons most of her technology, which will not work in the wilds anyway, but brings along her robot companion, Paula. \tWilders explores the relationship between the two sisters, between the megacites and the wild lands, and between a city girl and her robot protector. Coryn must grow up during a science fictional adventure full of drone flights and fights, frightening ecobots, and dangerous weather.",
