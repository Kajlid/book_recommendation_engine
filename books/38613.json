  "title": "Bob Dylan: A Biography",
  "description": "Written at the dawn of the seventies by a former crime reporter and self-confessed \"mafia expert\", this book was not only the first serious study of Dylan's life and work, but also a landmark in the way popular music was written about. In addition to a Bob biographer's wish-list of interviews, Scaduto pulled off the remarkable coup of getting Dylan's full co-operation without conceding an editorial veto. Dylan has read this book cover to cover and discusses its uncomfortable contents with the author at length! Though a veritable publishing industry has followed in Scaduto's wake, arguably no-one since has come as close to revealing the true nature of the man behind the shades. \"Pioneering portrait of this legendarily elusive artist. Now in a welcome reprint, it's a real treat to read this still-classic Bobography.\"- Q ***** Five Stars! \"A classic!\"-Paul Williams, author of Bob Performing Artist \"Pioneers are often written out of history but never let it be forgotten that Scaduto was the man. It's scandalous that this book has been out of print for so many years. Its return should be greeted with dancing in the street.\"-Jimmy Rogan, from the foreword \"The author's triumph was that ultimately he persuaded Dylan to talk.\"-Liz Thompson, editor of the Dylan Companion \"I read it. Some of it is pretty straight, some of it exactly the way it happenedâ€¦ I rather enjoyed it.\"-Bob Dylan",
