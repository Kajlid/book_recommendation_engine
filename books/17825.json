At the scene of each horrific suicide, the team find a dead old man with a spider placed in his mouth.

With Detective Inspector Mark South in tow, Fred has to stop the killings, solve the riddle of the spiders, and help find a missing girl called Heather- All before his bosses make him take early retirement and his violent past catches up with him. But DI Fred Fairservice has other much darker demons to deal with.",
