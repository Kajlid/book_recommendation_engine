  "description": "Beat the blues! If you ve been searching for the right way to manage any type of psychological difficulty, then this essential guide is just what you need to revitalize your life! However, this book is also for the five faces of society--the working class, the militants, the shamans, the scholars and the business class. Just as the mind is composed of five similar elements, which can be regrouped into the ancient trinity model of the mind, society--from the micro-level of the family to the macro-level of the universe--is also composed of the pentagon or trinity model. For instance, the ancient shamans of Mindoro s Hanunoo Mangyans believe that individuals have three souls. A neutral one on the head, a bad one on their left side and a good one on their right side. In the Hindu culture, this is translated into Vishnu The Preserver, Siva The Destroyer and Brahma The Creator. Plato, in The Republic, later calls these elements as the rational side (scholars), the desiring side (the business class, militants and working class) and the spirited side (shamans), respectively. But in 1923, Sigmund Freud--the Western Father of Psychoanalysis--calls it the mediating Ego, the desiring Id and the spirited Superego. And as the ancients say, if the scholarly mediating rational side is in control of the two other irrational sides, then there is health, peace and harmony within the individual. This Middle Way technique may be a bit tricky at first, but with enough practice, it will ensure a happy family, community, country and Universe.",
