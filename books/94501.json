  "description": "Take part in a Sci-Fi Experiment.Convergents are mergers between humans and intelligent beings. (After the apocalypse, humans are no longer considered intelligent.) To become a Convergent, a person undergoes a gradual chemical process that takes weeks. By the end, you are stripped of everything that makes you human and flawed and are endowed with superhuman cognitive powers. You reach such an advanced state of hyper-connectivity that you become one with the universe. The catch is all traces of your former self are gone. You don't even understand what a \"self\" is. Would you converge? Read Convergence and decide for yourself.(This is the first of several chapters. Convergence will be released chapter by chapter for free on Goodreads. Enjoy!)",
