  "description": "Successful in her quest, Flowridia returns to Staelash for a joyous affair—the long awaited wedding of Marielle and Zorlaeus, an event promising to seal her kingdom and Nox’Kartha as allies. But the price of Ayla’s return, and the sacrifice it demands, weighs heavily on her heart. To do nothing means to live a life of loneliness, but to act would condemn her eternal soul.  Meanwhile, Etolié wades through the cesspool of politics, yet drowns in a loneliness she cannot voice in words. The news of Khastra’s new position in Nox’Kartha forces her to confront a few harsh truths of her past, as well as her place in her dearest friend’s life, if she has a place at all.  For Flowridia’s mission to be complete, she must make allies of enemies—including enemies thought dead. And Etolié finds herself at the center of a murderous conspiracy, yet to speak the truth would condemn the one she loves the most.  Kingdoms clash, betrayal is nigh, and the bounds of love are tested in the third installment of Fallen Gods.",
