  "title": "Consent: Bondage Tales",
  "description": "According to the third edition of The Mann Dictionary of Savage Intimacy, consent is defined as “compliance in expectation of being ravished while bound.” Lauded by both the National Leather Association-International and Lambda Literary Awards, Mann writes stories—perhaps even true tales—that produce dangerous levels of testosterone, vigor, and seminal fluids. But the author’s favorite trophies do not hang on the wall—though they are often well-hung—but are kept trussed atop the bed in anticipation of consent. This book features commissioned erotic sketches and photographs.",
