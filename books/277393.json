  "title": "Magic in Vienna",
  "description": "Vienna was enchanting, like another world. It was everything Cordelia hoped it would be. She couldn't say the same for her charge's uncle, Dr. Charles Trescombe! He regarded Cordelia as plain and dull and sensible. She looked at Charles with pity—still young, handsome, but buried in books and medical studies. What a waste, she thought. It was foolish to fall in love with him. Only when he smiled at her could she believe in the magical possibility that he might return her love…Betty Neels is a sales opportunity that simply cannot be missed. She is a consistent #1 seller whose books are eagerly anticipated and sought after by her readers. A retired nurse herself, Betty is particularly well-known for her tender romances set in Holland, featuring Dutch doctors. Fans of Betty Neels will love these Reader's Choice books, all set amidst the lowlands of Holland and the English countryside—all four are Betty Neels at her best.",
