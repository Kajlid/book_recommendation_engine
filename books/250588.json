And with so many Sith Masters among them, the goal is not unachievable. As Naga Sadow readies his fleet to attack, one lone person threatens to undermine the entire campaign -- Jori Daragon. She isn't a Jedi. She's an explorer, a mapper of hyperspace who stumbled on the plans of the Sith. And she just may be the saviour of the Republic.Collected issues: Star Wars - Tales of the Jedi : The Fall of the Sith Empire #1-5",
