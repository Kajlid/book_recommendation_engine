  "description": "Can a movie feed your soul? Stories. Be it a parable of Jesus, a C.S. Lewis fantasy, or a movie such as Saving Private Ryan , stories have been around since Creation, a means of both education and entertainment. By far, our favorite way to listen to a story today is at the movies, whether in a theater or a family room. Indeed, says Ken Gire, movies are the parables of our culture—earthly stories that sometimes have heavenly meanings. Can we discern God's voice in the modern parables of film? Yes, it is there, sometimes loud and crystal-clear, sometimes barely a whisper, sometimes even despite the filmmaker's intent. In Reflections on the Movies , Ken helps • sensitize our \"eyes to hear and ears to hear\" God speaking,• develop the skills to understand movies and their themes, and• learn to reflect on the medium as a form of spiritual enrichment. In 1999, Ken was one of thirty Christians selected for a month-long study under some of the film industry's top talent in Hollywood. He has led numerous spiritual retreats where he has used movie clips to illustrate his messages. Reflections on the Movies and Ken's previous books in this series— The Reflective Live, Reflections on the Word , a devotional, and Reflections on Your Life , a journal—are designed to help you become more spiritually sensitive to the everyday moments of life.",
