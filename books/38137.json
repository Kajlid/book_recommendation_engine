  "title": "A House for Hermit Crab",
  "description": "Poor Hermit Crab! He's outgrown his snug little shell, so he finds himself a larger one -- and many new friends to decorate and protect his new house. But what will happen when he outgrows this shell and has to say good-bye to all the sea creatures who have made Hermit Crab's house a home?  Children facing change in their own lives will relate to Hermit Crab's story -- and learn a lot about the fascinating world of marine life along the way.https://openlibrary.org/books/OL81969...https://openlibrary.org/books/OL24238...",
