  "description": "Marianna Sinclair has lived years in England, separated from her family and regarded only as an unpaid servant to her aunt and uncle. She is overjoyed when her brother comes to collect her, returning her to Scotland. Yet, her thrill is quickly diminished when she learns she's to wed the son of a local landowner, the detestable Walter Ramsay. But even this is overshadowed as her traveling party is pursued by a fierce Highlander army. Her dismay becomes outright fear when her own brother abandons her while he makes his escape. Lachlan Maitland spent seven months as a prisoner of the English and bears the scars of their brutality, inside and out. He wants only to be at King Robert Bruce's side, winning Scotland's freedom, not chasing the bandits terrorizing the Highlands. His pursuit leads him to Mari Sinclair, and once he discovers she is betrothed to the Maitlands' longtime enemy, he eagerly kidnaps her, hoping to trade her to the Ramsays for peace in the Highlands. He quickly decides that she is the most confounding captive he has ever known. Soon, he regrets that he's made any deal with the Ramsays to trade her, for Lachlan is not sure he can ever let her go. Contains mature themes.",
