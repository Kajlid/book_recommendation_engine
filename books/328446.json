  "description": "\"My Evening with the Debutante\" That unflattering article by Kramer Adams started the whole thing. The \"debutante\" was Maryanne Simpson, columnist at a rival Seattle paper, which her father happened to own. Despite her anger at Kramer's interfering opinion. Maryanne decided the tough, streetwise newsman was right about one thing; her life had been too easy. She wanted to earn her own way. And she wanted to earn Kramer's respect. No, more than his respect... She quit her job, left her luxury apartment and gave up her trust fund -- a Cinderella in reverse, with Kramer Adams her reluctant prince.",
