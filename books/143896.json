They were men like Linus Rawlings, a restless survivor of Indian country whoâ d headed east to see the ocean but left his heartâ and his homeâ in the West. They were women like Lilith Prescott, a smart, spirited beauty who fled her family and fell for a gambling man in the midst of a frontier gold boom. These pioneering men and women sowed the seeds of a nation with their courageâ and with their blood. Here is the story of how their paths would meet amid the epic struggle against fierce enemies and natureâ s cruelty, to win for all time the rich and untamed West.From the Paperback edition.",
