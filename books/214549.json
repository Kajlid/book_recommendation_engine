  "title": "Going Around the Sun: An Engaging Astronomy Book for Kids with a Fun, Musical Twist",
  "description": "Astronomy for kids! If you are looking for home school supplies, this book needs to be on your list. Through bright illustrations, young readers learn about our solar system to the tune of an old familiar song, \"Over in the Meadow\". In Going Around the Some Planetary Fun , readers also learn of our place in a very big universe and an appreciation for the world we live in. Mother sun and her \"family\" of planets \"spin,\" \"roll,\" \"tilt,\" \"blow\" and \"whirl\" around the Sun to the tune of \"Over in the Meadow.\" Each of those actions is astronomically correctâ€•for example, Earth is the one that \"tilts,\" and that's what creates the seasons. It is also astronomically up-to-date, with Pluto being a \"dwarf planet.\" Bright illustrations create an exciting mood, and there's plenty of interesting supplementary information in the back along with tips on related ways to integrate science, art, and literature in the classroom.
