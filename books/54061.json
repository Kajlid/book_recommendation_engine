  "description": "Dr. Vasquez designed this Affirmation Daybook Journal as a tool to encourage increased empowerment within children.Parents, and school officials (educators, teachers, counselors) are invited to use lessons within this daybook as a guide to empower children, giving them the self-confidence needed to persevere.Dr. Vasquez maintains that affirmations, and the use of self-fulfilling prophecy techniques can change the focus of what children achieve, what they want to achieve, and what they hope to achieve.Since bullying is a pandemic in our nation’s schools, it is important for children to express and affirm who they are through positive expressions and actions. This helps build a child’s inner strength and certitude over time.",
