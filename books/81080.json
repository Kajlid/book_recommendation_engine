  "description": "The Shoebox Project is a collection of pictures, notes, letters, and scenes that focuses on the notorious Marauders - Mssrs. Remus Lupin (Moony), Peter Pettigrew (Wormtail), Sirius Black (Padfoot) and James Potter (Prongs). The narrative follows them through two years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and beyond, and explores the exploits, friendships, and relationships of an antecedent generation of Hogwarts students. One of the most emotional, witty, and memorable fanfictions ever written, The Shoebox Project is a perennial favorite. Though it was never finished, it is one of the most involved and stunning extracanonical fan-written additions to the Harry Potter series ever written",
