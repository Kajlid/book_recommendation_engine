  "description": "Just as basking in the glow of the warm evening sun does, this radiant collection of poetry and art from bestselling poet Wilder, will leave you filled with hope, love, and peace.Accompanying Wilder’s first book of poetry Nocturnal , Golden is another collection of celestial-themed poems and art by poet Wilder Poetry. Differing from its sister book, this collection is divided into four parts––“Magic Hour,” “Soul,” “Oracle,” and “Sanctuary” ––and focuses on the brightest star in our solar the Sun. Much like the celestial body that inspired its name, Golden explores the brighter, sunnier emotions life has to offer. Readers are guided down a sunlit path to happiness and learn that once the heart is open, opportunities for love never cease.",
