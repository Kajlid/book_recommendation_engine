  "description": "Reduce your stress with only 10 minutes of meditation!Do you know what meditation is? It is quite possible that you have heard of it and may even have heard of the benefits. However, unless you are properly taught how to meditate, you may never experience the many benefits that meditation provides. I have written this book so that beginners who don’t know anything about meditation can have all the information they need to meditate successfully and see improvements in their stress levels, their quality of life, and how they deal with their problems.Many of your questions about mediation will be answered in this guide. It's worth bearing in mind that I’ve worked with students all over the world. The questions covered with in the section are the most frequently asked questions and you’ll be given the answers you seek.This book is a complete guide and does not expect you to have any previous experience. It teaches you what happens inside the body when you breathe correctly and helps you understand the process of emptying the mind of thoughts. You will find that your life will change if you simply follow the exercises provided and continue to meditate on a daily basis. It only takes a few minutes of your time but it is completely life changing.So why is meditation so helpful and is the theory proven?Over the course of the last twenty years, meditation has become streamlined. It is not simply an alternative way to relieve stress. It is effective because you learn to shut out the things that bother you and you learn to cope with your life from another aspect entirely. You no longer feel that you need to live up to the expectations of others. You learn to accept yourself and accept the changes that are inevitable within your life.In fact, with the number of people now being treated with anti-stress medications, it is clear that other alternative methods of coping with stress are necessary. Those who meditate find that improvements begin within a couple of weeks, but the philosophy behind meditation lasts a lifetime. That means that they are better able to cope with problems when they happen, and that they suffer less from the effects of stress.This book makes no assumptions that you have prior knowledge of meditation and thus takes you from the very basics through to the different types of meditation so that you can use this powerful exercise to improve your life beyond recognition. You will be happier, less stressed, and more capable of relating to the world around you. Your own personal development is in your hands, but once you realize why it works, you will be encouraged to keep up your regime of daily meditation, even if only for 10 to 15 minutes per day.In this book you’ll discover…What is meditation and why you should do it.Why meditation works.New breathing techniques.Proper posture and its importance.The answers to your most common questions and concerns.What is a monkey mind?How meditation can help you cope with COVID-19.Perhaps even more relevant to today's society, we have added a bonus chapter on how meditation can be a useful complementary treatment for the mental effects of COVID-19.
