  "description": "“King Arthur has dominated my life for decades and now I am banished from his side. I am not certain either of us can survive this torment...” Lancelot, the greatest Knight of Camelot is flogged almost to death, exiled, and stripped of his King’s grace. Alone and lost in both body and soul, he starts to rebuild his life, choosing convention over controversy. Fate has other ideas. First he must fight to regain his honour, then he fights for his King’s life. Finally, they must both face their enemies, the rival fey families of Albion. But this is not their only fight, in a world where love between men is not permitted, the king and his greatest knight must find a way to face their long denied passion. They must redeem a love both men find hard to bear. A reimagining of the Arthurian myths, of romance and adventure, sorcery and action, creating a new Camelot you’ll never forget. Lancelot and the Wolf is the first in the epic story of The Knights of Camelot. This story is a cross between an adult version of ‘Merlin’ and ‘Brokeback Mountain’ - WOW!
