  "description": "For over one hundred years, Central Park has been a maximum security prison. Home to creatures of unimaginable power, they are kept imprisoned by the wards that surround the park. Now those wards are failing and people are dying. Creatures, called the Unholy, are escaping into the night. Only the Hunters, an elite force of warriors can stop them. Sepia Blue is a new hunter, with little experience. Together with her gunman and partner, Cade, they must stop the wards from failing completely. Can a hunter with a dark past and a darker sword stop the Unholy before they destroy all of humanity?",
