  "description": "They get shut out the last game of the season, which, yeah, just about sums things up.Tanner Mackenzie is what he is: getting close to the end of his professional hockey career, mostly friends with the senior dogs he fosters, and at peace with the fact that he’s the kind of person who’s just going to be alone. He’s not planning on any of that changing, at least not until the team’s new teenage prodigy moves into Tanner’s building and plants himself squarely in Tanner’s life, bringing a boyfriend who sees a little too much, and a mother as deeply unimpressed by Tanner’s chess abilities as she is by his shaggy hair.Tanner knows all too well that getting attached means getting hurt, but now he finds himself faced with an even scarier truth: what if the risk of getting hurt comes with everything he convinced himself he could never have? What if, this time, things can be different?",
