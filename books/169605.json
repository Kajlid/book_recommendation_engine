They refuse citing cruelty and deceit, although in secret both men have had fantasies about Celina for years.When Celina overhears her name offered up as the challenge, she persuades Arizona and Dallas to allow her to help them win the bet, no strings attached, just to spite Lucie. Celina has always had a secret crush on both men, and doesn’t want to pass up her chance for one week with them both.But during that week, Celina is offered a job in New Orleans that includes the opportunity to pursue her career dreams. There’s just one catch. Arizona and Dallas are bound by an ancient curse that prevents them from ever leaving the island.",
