  "description": "Raised to rule the criminal underworld... Born to skate her heart out. As heir to my family's mafia throne, I've learned to threaten, torture, and kill. But the only place I really feel at home is on the ice. So when Mom has my coach murdered to end my figure skating dreams, I know it's time to run. With my hot but off-limits bodyguard by my side, I flee to a little town where she'll never find me. All I want is to lie low and perform in secret at the local rink. But a chance meeting with two passionate, damaged men seeking their own healing on the ice opens up new possibilitiesâ€”both for my skating and my heart. They have no idea who I really am. And with a gang terrorizing my new neighbors and a stalker leaving me gruesome gifts, I don't know how long I can keep my violent history in the past. Can I defend my new life without turning into the brutal mafia princess I never wanted to be? * Shotgun Spin is the first in a new mafia romance series from bestselling author Eva Chase (writing as Eva Chance) and Harlow King. It includes M/M content. Prepare for thrills on the ice, in the streets, and between the sheets with four hot, passionate men and a heroine who refuses to play by the rules.*",
