  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, shape-shifters] The Gathering is called. The spell is cast. There is no escaping the Midnight Matings. Socially awkward and practically invisible to the rest of the world, Whitley Turner wasn't overly upset by the elders' announcement. Either he'd find someone to claim him or he'd disappear completely. So when he finds himself mated to a sexy-as-sin orca shifter, he's not sure whether to jump for joy or run screaming. Jude Chambers knows exactly who the shy swan shifter is. He's been looking for a way to get close to him for months. Using the forced mating decree and a little cunning help from a friend, landing Whitley as his mate was a piece of cake. Feeling guilty about the situation wasn't supposed to happen. Why couldn't Whitley be the egotistical jerk he imagined him to be? It doesn't take long for Whitley to realize something isn't right. When the truth is revealed, how can Whitley forgive his mate when being invisible was far less painful? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
