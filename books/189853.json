  "description": "Dear Reader,In my Brides Trilogy, three unconventional young women vow never to marry, only—one by one—to be overtaken by destiny. Scholarly Olivia is most certainly The Least Likely Bride...One moment Lady Olivia Granville is strolling along a path, her nose buried in a tome of Greek philosophy; the next she is plunging down a rocky cliff. When she regains consciousness, she is naked and unwittingly trapped on a pirate ship. Her captor, though, is no ordinary pirate. Wickedly handsome, disturbingly mysterious, the gray-eyed master of the Wind Dancer is both a physician and an artist, and admits to making his living from the sea.Most disconcerting of all, when he turns his glittering eyes on her, he sees not the stammering, hopelessly bookish young girl Olivia has always been, but a passionate, beautiful woman who can, if she chooses, embark on the adventure and the love of a lifetime.I invite you to share in Olivia's passionate, enchanting adventure.Warmest wishes,Jane Feather",
