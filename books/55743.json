  "description": "The world is dying. The ones who remain have survived wars, famine, the worst plague in history, and now they must contend with widespread infertility. Anya of Terismark is one of the rare ones who is still capable of bearing children - a Carrier. Her high street value makes her a priceless commodity to slavers, smugglers, and scientific facilities. Following a harrowing ordeal that left her with half an arm on one side, she finds herself trapped inside a medical haven for Carriers, a safeguard against the horrors of the post-plague wastelands. Her first day at the Facility introduces her to a new world filled with technology and indoctrination, yet all is still not as it seems.",
