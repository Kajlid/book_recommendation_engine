  "title": "Lindy & The Wulfen",
  "description": "After a devastating blow to her already fragile self esteem, werewolf Lindy Vincent has decided to stop being the pack whore and change her life for the better. With the help of her two best friends, her alpha female, and a feisty she-wolf named Eula, Lindy starts down the road of self-improvement, happy for the first time in years. Crimson Atarn is a Wulfen, a cross between a wolf and a fairy, and the only one of his kind. After casting a spell for his truemate, he finds himself in the Mortal Realm rescuing the she-wolf meant to be his. When someone from his past threatens Lindy, Crimson will show the realm why no one messes with a Wulfen's mate. This book contains one Wulfen with eyes only for his mate, a she-wolf trying to start her life over, and the spell that brings them together. Expect plenty of shifting, growling, and neck biting, fairy magic, and gratuitous use of the word \"mine.\"",
