  "title": "The Language of Saxophones: Selected Poems",
  "description": "A long-awaited collection from a pioneer of the spoken word movement, these poems soar and sway with the syncopation and melodies of jazz. Portraits, chronicles, incantations and invocations, drawn from a lifetime of prolific activity.\nFrom his early days in the Black Arts Movement and up to the present, Daáood has been a powerful artistic and social force, an inspired seer/seeker. Whether collaborating with renowned musicians, heading up a performance group or inspiring and nurturing new talent, he speaks to and from the urgency of his time.\nKamau Daáood, performance poet and community arts activist, is the artistic director of Los Angeles’ World Stage Performance Gallery, which he co-founded with master drummer Billy Higgins. His work can be heard on his award-winning CD Leimert Park.",
