  "description": "Scarlett Jackson is anything but perfect. The first time she met famous chef and entrepreneur Guy Chapman, she set him on fire. As a result, she was blacklisted from every restaurant in New York City to the point where she couldn’t get hired at a taco stand. But she didn’t give up. She got busy. Now she’s running her own food truck and things are taking off. Except... through a mixture of impeccable timing and bad luck, she’s parking near Guy’s newest and most ambitious undertaking: restaurant row.  For Guy Chapman, everything must be perfect. His businesses, his food, his whole life. He has more on the line that just creating a culinary empire. There are people who rely on him, from employees to a sister who requires twenty-four-hour care. So when a plucky baker running an inconvenient food truck throws a wrench into his plans, he can’t just let it go.  When things start getting hot in both their kitchens, Guy and Scarlett have to decide what’s more important: winning the block, or winning each other’s hearts.",
