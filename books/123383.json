  "title": "War Against the Jews: How to End Hamas Barbarism",
  "description": "In War Against the How to End Hamas Barbarism, Alan Dershowitz—#1 New York Times bestselling author and one of America’s most respected legal scholars—explains why the horrific attack of Oct 7 and Israel’s just response changes everything.   It has changed the relationship between Israel and the United States, especially with regard to the possibility of direct American intervention.   It has required Israel to consider its nuclear option as a last resort to assure its survival.   It has revealed dangerous attitudes among America’s future leaders on today’s college campuses toward Israel’s possible destruction.  It has exposed media biases that have been exacerbated with Israel’s vulnerabilities.   It has united Israelis and Jews around the world as never before, despite the deep divisions among them politically, religiously, and ideologically.  Nothing will ever be the same.   It has clouded the future of peace between Israel and its Arab and Muslim neighbors and has diminished the proposals for a peaceful resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict.  It has made predictions about the future of the region nearly impossible, except that imposing instability is inevitable.  In this short book, Dershowitz analyzes these transforming events and suggests how to move forward.",
