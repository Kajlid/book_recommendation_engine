  "description": "Introducing the King brothers-three red-hot Texas billionaire cowboys who are wildly devoted to their family ranch...and the women who can tame them.SHE KNOWS WHEN TO HOLD'EM.As a newcomer to the great Lone State, Chloe thinks she's immune to the charms of cowboys-until Ryder King comes along. A gorgeous rodeo star with a gambling problem should spell trouble for Chloe, who's as quick-witted as she is stunning. But there's something gentle in Ryder's otherwise wild nature that gives her pause. And she can only fight her attraction for so long...IS HE READY TO SHOW HIS HAND?Texas born, bred, and proud, Ryder has always had a way with the ladies-though not so much with poker. He's just bet, and lost, a third of his family's ranch in a game. Can Chloe, the daughter of a card sharp who knows how to play to win, team up with Ryder in Vegas to help him win it back? The closer Ryder comes to getting back the ranch, the greater he risks losing his heart to Chloe. Is he ready to lay it all on the line for her? And can she trust that Ryder is for real-or is one of Texas's most notorious playboys too good to be true?",
