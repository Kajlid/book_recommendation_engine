  "description": "One touch... One kiss…The first time Noah Bryant meets Colbie Michaels, they collide at the top of a snowy mountain in California and sparks fly. Swamped by sudden emotion — and a desire she can’t control — Colbie panics. Before he can get her phone number or last name, she’s gone. When they end up serendipitously meeting in Seattle one week later, Noah is certain Colbie is his destiny, and he can’t make the mistake of losing her again. One night... One forever love…Colbie wants to believe in a happily-ever-after, but experience tells her falling for Noah is more likely to lead to a broken heart. Only, how can she resist him as he sets out to prove that they’re destined to be together? Especially when he’s intent on fulfilling every last one of her secret desires and he’s willing to keep proving it to her every day... and every sweet and sinful night.",
