  "description": "I’m Gabriel Stone. The Dark Bearer’s guardian angel. Poker king on the highway to Hell.  Ex-Prince of Hell, Draxil, has been reawakened, triggering an old beef with the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. They’ve given Heaven an ultimatum. Hand Draxil over or they’ll scorch Earth.  But things can never be that simple.  Draxil is now connected to the Dark Bearer. If he dies, Aurora dies, unleashing Hell on Earth. As Heaven is siding with the horsemen, I’ve got no choice but to reunite Draxil with his team of demons to avert the apocalypse. Problem is, they’re either imprisoned in Hell or scattered across the planes, and time is short.  Looks like I’ll be winging my way to Hell for a good old fashioned prison break.  This is one gamble I better get right. ’Cause if I’ve aligned with the wrong side, it could cost me my very soul.  Fallen angels Vs the Horsemen of the Apocalypse. A high noon showdown on a Chicago Loop rooftop. Get ready for Judgement Day.",
