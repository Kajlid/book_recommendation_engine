MacDonald, the beloved author of Cape Fear and the Travis McGee series, is now available as an eBook.   After Tal Howard returns home from a Korean prisoner-of-war camp, he can’t help feeling that something’s missing. Desperate for a thrill as much as a big payday, Tal heads for the sleepy village in upstate New York where, a dying pal once assured him, buried treasure awaits . . . if Tal can find the girl who can lead him to it. But there’s another stranger in town, a man Tal recognizes instantly: Earl Fitzmartin, a cold, mysterious loner who terrorized him and the other POWs. Somehow Earl got here first. And now this psychopath is watching Tal’s every move—and waiting to strike.   Features a new Introduction by Dean Koontz   Praise for John D.
