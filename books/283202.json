Needing a temporary escape from a violent boyfriend, she takes up an advertised position as a live-in caretaker ‘with light duties’ at a country retreat outside Melbourne. The owner, Philip Boulton, is a hunky high-flying banker who visits on weekends to attend to his small herd of cattle.  Hannah is dismayed to discover that Philip has been taught all he knows about farming by his attractive next-door neighbour, who lusts after Philip and resents Hannah’s presence. Hannah can’t tell whether Philip is ‘more than friends’ with his guru.  Philip has recently discovered a family secret. Fearing Hannah’s skills as a family history researcher, he keeps her at a distance.  Meanwhile, as her ‘boss’, he helps Hannah to overcome her fear of cattle and she learns to love country life … and Philip.",
