  "description": "Performing Arts Festival (PAF) is an inter hostel competition at IIT Bombay, where a pair of hostels present an hour long skit. The paired hostels completely own the performance, right from script writing, to dramatization, sets, sound, lights, music, and publicity to attract people to come and watch the show. This story, a laughter riot, is about the PAF presented by H6 and H9 in 1991. With an amazing story line, some never before seen incredible special effects, amazing light and sound effects, great actors, musicians, and dancers, in short with an abundance of talent, Moonstone was headed for a definite victory. Did they succeed?In this non-fiction humor book titled “Moon Stone: The Incredible One Hour”, I have tried to capture the very interesting true life story behind this PAF. Teenage is a time of our life which is usually filled with the maximum fun and adventure and if you are one of those who spent it in a hostel, then it is almost like double bonanza. I did my graduation from IIT Powai and stayed in the hostel for 4 years and can easily say that those 4 years where one of the best times of my life. The book is also laced with many additional humorous incidents from my life at IIT Powai.",
