But from the ashes rose the undead, hungry for the flesh of the living. Protecting the populace are zombie hunters like Titus Defoe, ex-Leveller and now agent of the crown. As Titus battles the zombie horde he comes to realise that some sort of intelligence is controlling them. Along with his Brethren of The Night, he must look deep into the rotten heart of the undead capital, to discover the cause of this evil canker!",
