  "description": "Charley Van Leeuwen can tell by a man's kiss whether he's been drinking Taittinger or Veuve Clicquot. Not that she kisses many men, a fact her friends deplore. So imagine their surprise when she comes home to San Francisco with her new husband, Jack.Jack Fairfax is the definition of tall, dark, and handsome. But is he the mild-mannered meteorologist he claims to be?Sometime between finding a dead body in her bathtub, tagging along on a ransom drop, and getting rescued by her husband in a hail of bullets, Charley begins to believe there's more to Jack's past than he's willing - or able - to admit.So, here's Charley, used to her money as a cushion, forced to protect her family and friends and rescue her non-profit repertory theatre from artistic and financial ruin. If that means dealing with kidnappings, murders, bitter ex-boyfriends, out-of-control relatives, and vicious former spies - all while staging a play - well, nobody ever said marriage would be easy.",
