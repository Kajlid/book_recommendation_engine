  "title": "Wrapped In Black",
  "description": "It’s the UnHoly Trinity’s first Christmas in New Orleans. Nora decides she, Søren, and Kingsley need to celebrate with a very special gift-giving game—not a boring White Elephant exchange, but a Black & Blue Elephant exchange where the gifts hurt as much to receive as they do to give. And Nora already knows exactly what she wants…This erotic holiday novella takes place shortly after the events of “Christmas in Suite 37A” (Michael’s Wings).",
