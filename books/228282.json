  "description": "In the yoga tradition, bhakti is the path of the heart. This devotional branch of yoga is growing in popularity as increasing numbers of practitioners seek greater peace and more heartfelt connections in their personal and professional lives. Artist and scholar Ekabhumi Charles Ellik invites us to cultivate these feelings of love and connection through coloring, meditation, and art in The Bhakti Coloring Book.Following on the success of The Shakti Coloring Book, Ekabhumi has created 40 brand-new, easy-to-color images from the bhakti tradition. Mandalas, deities, and symbols adorn the pages of this heart-centered book along with guidance for using the images both in spiritual practice and for simple pleasure. Devotional art is an important part of the bhakti tradition, as sacred imagery can shift our consciousness into a naturally meditative state. For experienced artists and novices alike, this book offers an enjoyable entry into this powerful practice.",
