  "description": "As his moment of death looms, Dracula suffers the ultimate betrayal. The champion of the Catholic faith in Eastern Europe realises there is no place in Heaven for him. It is Lucifer who comes to claim him, though he does not want Dracula's soul.Instead, he bites into Draculaâ€™s neck and then offers his own blood to drink. Dracula suffers his mortal death, but he re-awakens and suffers a startling metamorphosis, becoming a monster born of Darkness. Immortalised with Lucifer's blood coursing through his veins, the two are bound by blood for eternity. Lucifer has groomed him for this day, and lays out the task before him.Dracula is to destroy the institution of that which he has championed. By bringing down the Catholic Church, he can undo the Crucifixion and turn man against God once more. If he succeeds, then Lucifer will ascend again to Heaven and signal the end for all mankind.",
