  "title": "Elven Magic",
  "description": "A short story about Elves and Witches with Dialog and a story with names. What I was trying to achieve in the first edition is a story without names, chapter by chapter. This is the second edition of Elven Magic and it delves deeper into Fae the elven witch's apprentice and there endless struggle to recover their lost spell book from Earthen Lands without drawing any attention to themselves because this is strictly forbidden by the Elven Elders. This is only Book 1 of 3.",
