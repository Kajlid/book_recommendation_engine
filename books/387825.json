  "description": "This book is no longer published and will not be republished again.When the future depends on trust—things might get a little rowdy. After receiving a Dear John letter from his fiancée, Eli Smith isn’t sure what comes next. He’s spent years going from one rodeo to the next, biding his time and saving his money for the ranch he wanted to call home. Unfortunately, he tries to find the answers at the local saloon—too bad the more he drinks, the more he can’t stop thinking about the attraction he’s had to deny. Until now… Ready to hit the road, Vinn hunts down his circuit companion and best friend, Eli. The last place he expected to find him was in the saloon drowning himself in the bottom of a bottle of whiskey. As if things weren’t complicated enough with the ever-growing attraction between them. But alcohol lowers inhibitions, and for a few brief minutes, Vinn entertains thoughts of going for it—despite the fiancée, despite the friendship, and despite the fact Eli isn’t gay. Rodeos and cowboys make good bedfellows. But do you risk a friendship simply to scratch an itch?",
