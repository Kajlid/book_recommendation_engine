  "title": "Rooms for Rent in the Outer Planets: Selected Poems 1962-1996",
  "description": "A selection of poems by the man described by the Globe & Mail as \"the greatest of our poets.\" Rooms for Rent in the Outer Planets includes three decades' worth of thought-provoking work, including poems from the Governor-General's Award-winning The Cariboo Horses to Naked with Summer in Your Mouth.Purdy personally made this selection, assisted by Sam Solecki, the editor of Starting from The Collected Prose of Al Purdy . In these poems, Purdy ponders the remains of a Native village; encounters Fidel Castro in Revolutionary Square; curses a noisy cellmate in the drunk tank; and marvels at the \"combination of ballet and murder\" known as hockey, all in the author's inimitable man-on-the-street style.Rooms for Rent in the Outer Planets is destined to become the standard Purdy poetry volume for many years to come.",
