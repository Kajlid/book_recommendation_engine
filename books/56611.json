  "title": "We Three Kings",
  "description": "Over two thousand years ago, three great kings journeyed across the desert, riding through the heat of day and dark of night. Each from a different region, each beckoned by the same gleaming star, each bearing treasures, each wishing to welcome a newborn asleep in a manger's hay -- a baby named Jesus, who would change the world.This beloved Christmas carol, written in 1857, celebrates the wise men's journey and the first Christmas night. Internationally renowned artist Gennady Spirin pays his own type of homage with paintings so exquisitely detailed and wrought that they, too, are a gift -- to that baby in the manger and to you.",
