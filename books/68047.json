  "description": "Sometimes the monster that haunted you as a child truly is real...All it took was one phone call to bring Nicole Jones's life crumbling down around her. Now a nightmare she thought she'd left in her past is back, and he's not exactly bringing her candy and flowers. While fleeing, in a non-terrified fashion, she meets a menacing man in a dark alley. Then promptly passes out at his feet.Gideon Evans hasn't exactly been having the best run of luck, but all that changes when a buxom little blonde collapses right in front of him. Or at least he thinks it has. It doesnâ€™t take him long to realize that bombshell is an appropriate description for more than just her looks. Now he's facing several problems, including a surprising enemy, his own dark past, and a rather inconvenient case of lust. Can they work together to battle the nightmare that's chasing them? Or will they succumb to the monster within?",
