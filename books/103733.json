  "description": "Amethyst – book 1 of the Guardian series is currently free. Linked is the 2nd book, and this is Dentelle, the 3rd installment in the Guardian trilogy.Lexi Adams cheated death when she successfully linked and became the only living Dentelle. And while she’s ecstatic to be alive, her troubles are just beginning. She’d hoped to keep her Dentelle status a secret, but that didn’t happen. Once the Guardian Senior Council learns she’s a Dentelle, they begin interfering in all her affairs. Imposing new rules, they even dictate where she’ll live and who she’ll date. As an Amethyst, Lexi was forbidden from dating Guardians, and as a Dentelle she still is, but the Senior Council makes one exception: they are allowing, and even promoting, a relationship between her and Ash. The question is why?While dealing with the nuances of being a Dentelle, warring with the Senior Council, and trying to keep her relationship with Jason – the man she loves and hopes to link with – a secret, a series of harrowing events take precedence. An Amethyst friend is abducted, a person very close to her heart goes missing, and the Ray-pacs resurface, namely, her arch nemesis, Kieran. In order to save someone she loves, Lexi embarks on a perilous, solo journey. Personal sacrifice is her only option, but she hasn’t considered her heart and soul may be in jeopardy, too. Refusing to give up hope, Lexi vows to fight to the end. But can she win the biggest battle of her life and defeat Kieran once and for all?",
