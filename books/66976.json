  "description": "Special Agent Stella Lavender is looking forward to an elegant outdoor wedding, a much-needed change of pace from her adrenaline-fueled work as an undercover drug agent. On the grassy lawn of the Rosscairn Castle B&B, she waits with the couple’s family and friends for the ceremony to begin. But one of them has other plans, and as the guests grow restive, the satin-clad bride is dying most horribly.When the sheriff asks for Stella’s assistance, she’s energized by the opportunity to prove herself. But why would someone kill Justine, the bride, on her wedding day? The grieving groom claims that she was a much-loved angel who couldn’t possibly have had any enemies. Stella finds that he is deluding himself, that jealousy, depression, and grief colored Justine’s current relationships. The groom's former girlfriend haunts him obsessively. A young couple blames Justine, a midwife, for their daughter’s disabilities, claiming the child’s birth was mismanaged. An ex-lover lost his job when Justine accused him of stalking her. Perhaps more importantly, Justine had concealed her past from everyone, even Mike. Even as a paranoid drug dealer seeks to silence her, Stella must unravel these complex knots before Justine’s murderer claims another victim.Weaving together themes of family, gender, and identity, Cold Feet is a mesmeric, disquieting story that takes the reader to the discovery of a chilling truth: sometimes death is the only way to secure a secret.",
