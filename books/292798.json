It is two centuries since the Arcpelago voted to go anarch. Everyone hoped it would mean more freedom, a Utopia. But no, they just got bored. Tibar attends a meeting where new discoveries about the energy of dimensions (surplicity) are presented. She and a small group investigate and find new challenges and new ways to remake society.",
