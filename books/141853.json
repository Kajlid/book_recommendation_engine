  "description": "Spoiler alert. I fall in love with the man who comes in the night. He watches me down the scope of his rifle and it’s terrifying, and exhilarating, not knowing when he’ll squeeze the trigger. If he’ll squeeze the trigger.Maybe I’ll die tonight……maybe I’ll die next week. It’s a sick and twisted game, but it’s ours. And just when I think our story ends at a distance, he comes in close, thrusting himself into my life. We are at war, him and me, and eventually, he’ll have to kill me. If he doesn’t, someone else will.",
