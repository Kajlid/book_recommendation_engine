  "description": "In this wickedly funny novel, Robert Ludlum combines the explosive pacing of The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Supremacy with a bitingly witty send-up of everything from government bureaucrats and pandering military men to the mob, the law, and organized religion. \n\nWar hero and infamous ladiesâ man, General MacKenzie Hawkins is a living legend. His life story had even been sold to Hollywood. But now he stands accused of defacing a historic monument in Chinaâ s Forbidden City. Under house arrest in Peking, with a case against him pending in Washington, it looks like the end of Macâ s illustrious career. But he has a plan of his ownâ and it includes kidnapping the Pope. Whatâ s the ransom? Just one American dollarâ for every Catholic in the world. Add to the mix a slew of shady â investors,â Hawkinsâ s four persuasive, well-endowed ex-wives, and a young lawyer and fellow soldier who wants nothing more than to return to private lifeâ and youâ ve got one relentlessly irreverent page-turner.From the Paperback edition.",
