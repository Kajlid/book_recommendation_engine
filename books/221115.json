  "description": "Librarian's note: An alternate cover edition can be found hereTrain to the Edge of the Moon is about all shades of the young people reality – struggles with career, romances, feeling lost, misunderstood and rejected by society. It’s funny, it makes you laugh and in the next moment it gets sad and dark and you want to crawl into the corner and cry a little. It also raises controversial issues such as addictions, depression, and abuse. Those who have been beaten down, and nearly robbed of everything that makes them who they are, those who refuse to adapt and be another brick in the wall in the modern mayhem will find peace and understanding here.",
