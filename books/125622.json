  "description": "Destined Union is a sexy, surprising and witty story about coming out, and of becoming who you are.Tordis is a Swedish sex therapist who comes to Ireland and begins to work in the most progressive hospital in the world, the Royal Hospital Dublin. She thinks she knows who she is, heterosexual and monogamous, because that's what she's been told from birth. When her life experiences take her off the culture lines of both Sweden and Ireland, she is surprised and delighted to finally have the honor of getting to know herself fully.Coming out later in life is not uncommon. Many come out in their 40’s, 50’s, 60’s, and even later. People in their 40’s and older were raised in an era when heterosexuality and monogamy were the only openly accepted options for living life. People who come out later in life realize that they have always been what they thought they weren’t, and finally get the honour of getting to know themselves. Some are shocked at their discovery, but most are comfortable becoming who they really are, who they have always been. - Tina Brescanu, Author of Destined Union-",
