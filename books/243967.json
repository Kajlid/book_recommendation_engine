  "description": "Princess Lenora is supposed to be preparing for her wedding. But she and Prince Coren are sidetracked when the Balance, which holds two alternate worlds in place, begins to crumble. “Any sensible person would be heading away from the giant. . .” Princess Leonora is not a sensible person. She has the power to alter the present- and she’s not afraid to use it. Prince Coren can read minds, but he tries to do it as little as possible. Then a giant attacks the north countries. Leonora rushes toward adventure, creating a double to take her place. Coren follows and gains a double of his own. Now Leonora and Coren face trouble from all sides. The giant is a formidable enemy. The Balance, which holds alternate worlds in place, is crumbling. And the doubles are forming evil minds of their own. Leonora and Coren are running out of time. . . and patience. They need to fix things fast- before they lose their minds completely. “Will be welcomed by those who enjoy challenging fiction, told with humor and energy.” School Library Journal. “This is not standard fantasy at all, tending more to the fantastic and surreal… a lot of fun.” - LOCUS",
