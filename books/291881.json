  "description": "As one of the most influential figures in all of church history, the apostle Paul led a life of faith that transformed lives in ways that can hardly be measured. Yet what is more inspiring than Paul’s impact is his heart to reach others with the gospel of Jesus Christ. It is this heart for the lost that drove Paul to earnestly share God’s Word and save countless souls. Witnessing Like Paul takes an in-depth look at Paul’s passion for evangelism, inviting you on a journey through the life and lessons of a man whose zealous love for Christ and those around him changed the world. With powerful teachings and reflections on Paul’s motivation, humility, and servitude, author JJ Lusk reveals Paul’s example as a faithful, willing vessel that God desires to use on earth. In this insightful Bible study, Lusk takes a close look at Paul’s approach to preaching, identifying the characteristics and techniques that set this apostle apart throughout his story, encouraging you to believe that the same God who moved through Paul can accomplish amazing works through you today. With scriptural wisdom and practical application, Lusk’s biblical guide will open your eyes to the foundational principles behind Paul’s vision of ministry so that you can live your life on mission by passionately and purposefully sharing the truth of Christ. An enlightening work for group Bible studies, Sunday school classes, or as a sermon series, Witnessing Like Paul will inspire you to boldly walk in faith as you begin to see others reconciled to the Father through Jesus’s work on the cross.",
