  "description": "\"Watch out for the creaking.\" An Inuit woman gives Greg Walsh this warning before he heads on a wilderness trek in the Canadian Rockies with his friend Dean, Sarah Brandt, and their guide. In the wild, Greg and Dean—conservative, blue-collar workers—soon conflict with Sarah, a liberal, career woman. Then Greg hears creaking and pulls Sarah away from a landslide that kills Dean and Ben and sweeps away all their supplies except a knife and a canteen. Greg and Sarah argue, but soon cooperate to survive. They find they have unexpected similarities, and each comes in touch with unresolved pain. A friendship forms, then grows into love. They face dangers, forging a deep trust that neither of them have ever experienced. Greg and Sarah survive the wild, but back home, their social groups sow discord. Yet they don't want to lose the most profound relationship in their lives. Will they survive together?",
