  "description": "Even in the peaceful, sun-splashed world of the Green Forest, the Laughing Brook, and the Smiling Pool, trouble sometimes makes an appearance and disturbs the lives of the animals living there. And so it is in this charming story about Jerry Muskrat and his friends Little Joe Otter, Spotty the Turtle, Grandfather Frog, and Billy Mink. First, Farmer Brown's boy has set nasty traps all around the Smiling Pool and that spells trouble for Jerry and the other creatures who live in and around the Pool. Wise old Grandfather Frog must think long and hard to come up with a solution for that problem. Then, suddenly, the water in the Laughing Brook stops flowing and before long, the Smiling Pool drops to alarming levels. Something must be done, but what? Children will love finding out as they read or listen to this classic Thornton W. Burgess fable, which combines the fun of a good story with important lessons about kindness, stick-to-itiveness, cooperation, and other virtues. Six full-page illustrations, based on originals by Harrison Cady, enhance the text, newly reset in large, easy-to-read type.",
