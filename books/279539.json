After an encounter with a mysterious stranger, he and his friends are imbued with incredible powers—at last giving his life meaning.  But this dream soon disintegrates once one of the friends is taken by an alien warlord named Titan. In a rescue effort, the remaining group is sent across the galaxy in search of the only possible aid—a legendary, immortal warrior missing for centuries.  During the spectacular intergalactic journey, the team must join forces to reclaim their friend and stop a sinister scheme devised against humanity by Titan and his vast empire. The multiverse-spanning, millennia in the making conflict for the soul of reality is set in motion, but even if the group prevails, they risk losing what it means to be human.",
