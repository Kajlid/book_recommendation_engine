  "description": "NOW A USA TODAY BESTSELLING CONTEMPORARY ROMANCE NOVEL!JULESI didn't plan on him....Or for him.Or anything that had to do with Cal Donovan from Boston.Meeting him had been a complete and utter surprise, taking me completely off guard. I met new people every single day in my line of work and none of them affected me. Wasn't that the way of things though? You could meet a thousand people and none of them would mean anything to you, but then you'd meet one and they suddenly meant everything.I was a self-professed workaholic. When did making yourself your number one priority become such a horrible thing? I wasn't entirely sure, but I learned fairly quickly after my last breakup that men didn't like being second on a woman's priority list. And they seemed to be intimidated by a motivated female, calling me things like \"hard to handle,\" \"challenging, \" and \"difficult.\"Being single seemed to work best for me and I had no plans on changing my relationship status anytime soon.And then I met Cal.And he f*****g ruined everything.",
