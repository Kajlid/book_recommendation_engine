  "description": "Many are they who say of me,“There is no help for him in God.” Selah.—Psalm 3:2Sherlock Holmes, the world’s only consulting detective, has no clue of the rich symphony God has planned for his life. When murder strikes too close, the music of Sherlock’s life turns dark and melancholic, and he vows to find the destiny of a person’s essence after death.Professor Moriarty, a maestro of the criminal world, complicates Sherlock’s investigation with blackmail. The professor’s associate, Irene Adler, presents quite another distraction.Sherlock enlists the aid of his good friend, Dr. John Watson, but receives more help than expected. John’s wife, Mary, is a woman of God and seeks to guide Sherlock’s search with her prayers.A case at St. Michael’s Mount proves nearly fatal, but provides Sherlock with an interlude to immerse himself in his music. When he is lent a del Gesu violin (meaning “of Jesus”), he gathers data from biblical scholars and receives insight from another realm.As an atheist and a gifted intellectual, Sherlock prides himself on his powers of observation and deductive reasoning. Will he finally be able to accept the Truth when his deductions defy science, logic, and his strict policy of self-reliance?The Game is on!",
