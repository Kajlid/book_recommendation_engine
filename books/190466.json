  "description": "Anna Walker was excited about the possibilities opening up for her in Austin Texas. She made the move to Austin from Orlando Florida when she inherited a home and small amount of money. It was perfect timing for a new start. The financial assistance was exactly what she needed to open up the Spiritual Shop she had been dreaming about.  Jon was the super hot caretaker that had been contracted to the house for the rest of the year. Anna’s Aunt paid Jon in full so he was going nowhere until his contract ended. Having Jon around was a huge distraction because he was just so darn sexy and at the same time he was pushing her to sell the property.  Getting past cranky beginnings, Anna starts to see how kind and considerate Jon is behind his sexy exterior. They started spending more and more time together and Anna realized how easy it was fall for him. All is good until she over heard the Caretaker’s phone conversation and realized he was hiding huge secrets that threatened her existence.  The Caretaker Part One is the first novella in the 4 part series full of romance, mystery and suspense.",
