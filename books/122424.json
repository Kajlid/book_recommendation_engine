Davidson, author of Relics of DawnThey promised a world free of disease and suffering, but at what cost? Kami was strong, stronger than the others, but she couldn't outrun them. Taken and bled for one purpose, she holds on, following the spark and whispers of hope... Ruth's life is no longer her own, memories becoming as intangible as smoke, her fingers never able to grasp what had been. That is, until the elixir. The clock has turned back, but a flashing specter remains... Jarum was determined to succeed, founding Lazarus to find the key to immortality no matter the consequences. With ruthless determination, he was on the cusp of infamy until the lights. Until the dark... In a showdown between predators and prey, their stories will become interwoven in a near-future landscape where science at its zenith can't escape its bloody origins, their desires reflecting back at them in the glow of fireflies.\"Once you start Lazarus, you won't be able to put it down until the very end.\"",
