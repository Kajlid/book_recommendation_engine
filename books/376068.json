  "description": "Thomas had been living the life of a lazy man, afraid of failure. His dishelved two bedroom apartment and the filthy gas station he worked at from midnight to morning were close reflections of the depraved inner world he inhabited. All of that was about to change. A double murder, an unholy creature, and two fresh wounds on his neck would lead Thomas to find a purpose, find himself, find his God.",
