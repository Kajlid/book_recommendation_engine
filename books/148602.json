  "description": "Dylan Pendragon is not what she appears to be. She lookes like a twenty something, hippy, new-age follower… When in fact she was a ninety year old witchling from one of the oldest families connected with witch craft.She has yet to get any powers so to speak. But she is destined to be the most powerful witch of them all…And she is a virgin.Justice is a seven thousand years old Vampire. He is the oldest friend to his former king of their kind, Cormac O’ Heachthanna. There are three things that vampires love. Blood, fighting and sex and not necessarily in that order. Justice lost his wife about six thousand years ago so he has devoted his life to keeping man kind safe… and he has had no sex in that many years.The Dark One has one thing on his mind. Capture Dylan Pendragon and take what he thinks is his… her virginity and her power which will blossom like a rose once she is taken. He will do anything to get her and that power or die trying.In the course of one night under a full moon two become connected and set into motion events that can’t be stopped that will ultimately bring victory for some or one and the rest will be cast into a void less underworld.Can Justice show Dylan he wants to protect her without touching her? Will he listen to his heart where love that has been dormant for so long is blooming.Will Dylan allow Justice to protect her so she can figure out how to get her powers and be strong enough to fight the Dark One? Or will she fall and be the sacrifice that the Dark One intends her to be.",
