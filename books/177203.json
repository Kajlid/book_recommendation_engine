  "description": "Valentina “Vale” Zamora is a twenty-eight-year-old executive with a global travel wholesaler and fresh out of a contentious and unfulfilling marriage in which her ex-husband left her for a stripper. Slowly piecing her shattered self-esteem back together, she jets off to Paris in search of some retail therapy and, if she’s lucky, a steamy distraction to bring her some sexual excitement—and maybe even some life insight. Sex is definitely on her mind, but a relationship is not. So when she finds herself sitting on the flight next to a mysterious and sultry self-made millionaire, her heart races and her body tingles like never before. A mutual attraction quickly emerges, and after a steamy in-flight make-out session, Vale decides to pursue him as her sexual tutor.An erotic escapade unfolds against the backdrop of Paris, but will their unbridled lust be a tragic error in judgment, or will it be the beginning of a deep and lasting love?Yummy Addictions is a contemporary erotic romance about one woman’s sexual exploration, experimentation, and awakening.",
