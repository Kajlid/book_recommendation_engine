The Vice President is none other than charming Embry Moore himself.Soon, Greer finds herself caught between past and present, pleasure and pain--and two men who long for each other as much as they long for her. And as war and betrayal press ever closer, they tumble headlong into a passionate love affair that will change the world...From the USA Today bestselling author of Priest comes a contemporary reimagining of the legend of King Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot--elegant, carnal, and unforgettable.",
