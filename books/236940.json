  "title": "Color Your Future: The First Ever Coloring Vision Board",
  "description": "Color Your Future is a unique and engaging way to conduct vision board workshops. The coloring book is also a valuable self-discovery book for your own use. Why a coloring vision board? The act of coloring is a relaxing art form that allows your brain to be creative and contemplative at the same time. By combining coloring with compiling pictures and words that represent our future lives, we are connecting and committing to a deeper, more meaningful life. You will find that the wide variety of images, sayings, and words in Color Your Future-- plus the incredible savings in cost, time and effort of collecting magazines-- makes it the perfect tool for outstanding vision board creation. Select an image, saying or word, color it, cut it out, and attach it to a back page in this coloring book or to poster board. There are two different ways to use this coloring book for a workshop. You can offer each workshop participant their own Color Your Future book. Or, you can make copies of the pages of the coloring book. The advantage of this coloring book is that I release the copyrightâ€”in other words, you are encouraged to copy and distribute the graphics in this book! Whether for your own discovery and journey or for conducting a workshop, Color Your Future, the first and only vision board coloring book, will lead you on a wonderful path to your future.",
