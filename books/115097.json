  "description": "Book 2 in the Afflicted A Blind Gay Romance Hunter and Dillon have finally come to terms with the idea that they want more than just hot sex with each other. They’ve decided to open themselves up to a real relationship and are trying to move beyond the fears that have prevented both men from trusting in the unquestionable beauty of what they’ve found. Dillon has given up his job as a male escort and Hunter has unwittingly exposed his vulnerability. But even as they’ve committed to each other, fear has crept in and is attempting to dismantle the very things they hold precious. Dillon’s family isn’t quite finished with him yet and Hunter is torn about whether he should step into the fray. Can Dillon let his past go or will it intrude on his present and destroy the love he’s found? Can Hunter open enough to help heal Dillon’s wounds and build a future? Can he speak the real words in his heart? Can either of them?",
