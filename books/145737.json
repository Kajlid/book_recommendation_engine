  "description": "Change the past-and the future may come undone. An outstanding collection of time-traveling alternate history stories from 16 major science fiction writers, both old and new. Every day, a thousand possible futures die unborn around us-corners not turned, paths not taken. But if one could go back into the past and change it, the outcome could be unimaginable.ix • Preface (Futures Past) • essay by Jack Dann and Gardner Dozois1 • Aristotle and the Gun • (1958) • novelette by L.
