  "description": "Set against the dramatic backdrop of 1785 Scotland, Elaine Coffman delivers her most breathtaking novel ever. In this unforgettable romance, a marriage that starts off to defy fate, just might end in love…Lady Meleri Weatherby is desperate to escape the unthinkable: marriage to a man she does not love, a man she knows to be unspeakably cruel. In a bold move, she breaks off her betrothal to Lord Philip and flees her home in Northumberland, vowing to marry the first man she meets, never considering the consequences of such a show of independence.Robert Douglas has been dealt an equally dark hand by fate: the proud Scot must take an English bride or lose his ancestral home and noble name. It seems an impossible situation, until destiny puts him in the path of a strong-minded English lass with a will to survive that equals his own.Marriage is an ideal salvation for both. Meleri will be safe from her vengeful fiancé in Beloyn Castle with the Douglas clan, and Robert will be able to keep all he holds dear. But neither has bargained on a heartless man who will go to any lengths to seek revenge, the tenacity of a stubborn ghost and the most powerful force of all: love.",
