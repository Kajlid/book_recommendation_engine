  "description": "Sometimes what starts out as fake can get all too real.  Things started out innocently enough. Put on the spot by my sister about going on a blind date, I mention I’m already dating someone else. But then she wants to meet him. Better yet, she wants me to bring him to our upcoming family gathering so he can meet everyone. Which would be a fantastic idea if he wasn’t a complete work of fiction.  My best friend, Julian, suggests I bring a fake date, and it sounds like a good plan. What could go wrong? We’ll go home, spend the weekend with my family, and they’ll stop setting me up on blind dates. No one gets hurt and no one has to know. Easy peasy, right?  But then there’s Jackson. And it’s no coincidence that his last name is Sparks.  Maybe one day I’ll learn that listening to Julian is always a recipe for disaster. Someday I’ll remember that he talks faster than he thinks, and any idea out of his mouth is probably a bad one. Until then, let me explain how I got into this mess. My name is Avery Jane, and I’m about to show you what happens when a fake relationship gets all too real.",
