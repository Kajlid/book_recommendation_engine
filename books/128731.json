If you have amassed huge credit card bills and defaulted on one or more loans, you are probably being chased for payment on a daily basis; here you can learn how to manage the stress of handling creditors and keep on top of your finances while looking after your overall health. Even though right now your life may seem difficult and your debts appear to be insurmountable, there is a solution.  The best thing we can all do in our lives is to look after ourselves because nobody else can. It is our responsibility to make sure we keep healthy and motivated to be able to cope with all that life throws at us.  As a wellbeing specialist, it is my pleasure to accompany you during this journey to a better “you”: a healthier, debt-free, wealthier you.  Use this book as a practical guide to refer to on a regular basis – either to keep track of your debt management strategy or to read up about healthy habits and recipes.",
