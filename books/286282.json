  "description": "If you learned that the people who matter most to you were keeping life-changing secrets about the fate of your existence, both past and present, what would you do?Laila Callidy's life is already an intricate balancing act of struggling to get a handle on her recently found supernatural abilities while trying to maintain a normal life as the manager of a diner in a small town. Three years before Eluding Destiny, she discovered that her DNA places her as the most powerful hybrid—part Fae, part Angel, and part Guardian—to be seen in the supernatural world in thousands of years. She may be the strongest to ever live. Still, she tries to hold onto the simple pleasures from her human existence. The comfort of her boyfriend's embrace, an unspecified number of leisurely drinks, the companionship of her friends and family. But when a hole is torn between the dimensions, presumably from the Fae Realm, she and her clan are instructed to find the breacher and bring anything they find to their Angel. Rather than finding him, he finds her. After all, that's why he came to Earth. To find Laila Callidy. His twin sister he was separated from at birth. His twin sister, and their mother of course. But no one was prepared for the information that he brings and the path of dangerous dominos his knowledge knocks into movement.",
