  "description": "“Smart, sensual and suspenseful as a thriller, Queen’s Gambit is a must-read for Philippa Gregory fans—and heralds a brilliant new player in the court of royal fiction” (People).Divorced, Beheaded, Died, Divorced, Beheaded, Survived...This is the story of the last wife of Henry VIII, the one who survived.Widowed for the second time at age thirty-one Katherine Parr falls deeply for the dashing courtier Thomas Seymour and hopes at last to marry for love. However, she attracts the attentions of the ailing, egotistical, and dangerously powerful monarch Henry VIII, who dispatches Seymour to the continent. No one is in a position to refuse a royal proposal so, haunted by the fates of King Henry’s previous wives, Katherine is obliged to become his sixth queen.Katherine must employ all her instincts to navigate the treachery of the court, drawing a tight circle of women around her, including her stepdaughter, Meg, traumatized by past events shrouded in secrecy, and their loyal servant, Dot, who sees more than she understands. With the Catholic faction on the rise, reformers being burned for heresy, and those close to the king vying for position, Katherine’s survival seems unlikely. Yet as she treads the razor’s edge of court intrigue, she never quite gives up on love.Queen’s Gambit captivates with “intrigue, romance, and treachery…and the type of meticulous attention to historical detailing that discerning fans of Alison Weir and Philippa Gregory have come to expect” (Booklist).",
