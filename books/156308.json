  "description": "This book was the result of a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign to create a unique Indian cookbook for a global audience of culinary enthusiasts. Nandita Godbole is the chef and creative force behind the acclaimed underground supper club Curry Cravings™. As a third generation cook and passionate advocate for the Indian cuisine, Nandita continues to build her distinctive identity by simplifying and updating traditional Indian recipes to create unique, healthy, delicious and well balanced meals for the modern kitchen. She does not believe that the Indian cuisine should be represented by numbered selections on backlit signs or standard choices on laminated menus, but should be easily accessible, as it is extremely important in the everyday global kitchen. Using her unconventional approach to Indian food and cookbooks, Nandita’s maiden outside-the-box cookbook, A Dozen Ways to Celebrate, provides a glimpse into the rich diversity and adaptability of traditional Indian food. It is a new concept to approaching a cuisine, away from the predictability of this genre. This richly visual resource not only includes more than 100 recipes in 12 elaborate menus, each originally presented at one of Curry Cravings™ secret supper club dinners, but it also provides cohesive and balanced menu plans, a shopping cheat-sheet and a wealth of practical notes that build confidence with the cuisine. Invite Nandita and her books to be at your side in your kitchen for a transformative approach to cooking Indian meals.",
