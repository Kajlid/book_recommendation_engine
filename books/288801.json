  "description": "Secrets broke her heart... and have now come back from the grave to haunt her.So far, Lorna Addams’s forties are not what she expected. After a very public embarrassment, she finds it difficult to trust her judgment when it comes to new friendships and dating. She might be willing to give love a second chance when she meets the attractive William Warrick, if only she could come to terms with what her husband did to her and leave it in the past.How is a humiliated empty nest widow supposed to move on with her life? It’s not like she can develop a sixth sense, séance her ex back, force him to tell her why and give her closure. Or can she?Book contains: kick-butt women who are considered middle-aged in their forties but who don't let themselves be defined by a number, paranormal elements (psychics, ghosts, magic, etc), some strong language (nothing too earth-shattering), sexy scenes but they aren’t 50 shades of OMG or anything, and a nice heaping helping of a second chance at first love. Doing midlife right!",
