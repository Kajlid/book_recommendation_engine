Where crowds of hunched and oddly dressed youths would probably be train-spotters, where you could have a reign of terror on a Sunday afternoon just by riding your cast-iron scooter across the blue brick pavement, and where the height of excitement on the street was getting two Beech Nut chewing gum packets on the fourth turn of the handle.Philip Whiteland entertains with this collection of articles presenting some keenly observed and very funny meanders through the past and present. Why not come and join him on the trip, but, whatever you do, remember to keep “Steady Past Your Granny’s” This newly updated version addresses some previously reported problems, has improved formatting and...includes pictures!,\"Steady Past Your Granny's\" is the first book in the 'nostalgedy' collection of stories, which also includes \"Crutches for Ducks\" and \"A Kick at the Pantry Door\"",
