  "description": "At forty, Sylvie Schiffer has a gorgeous house, two perfect children, a successful husband with a lucrative business. Everything but what she wants passion and romance. With the twins off to college, Sylvie thinks her marriage is about to bloom, until she discovers that her husband, Bob, is already seeding the garden--with a woman named Marla! When Sylvie confronts Marla, she gets the shock--and inspiration---of her life. Except for ten years and fifteen pounds, she and Marla could be twins. But all is not bliss even for Marla. Though she has the best of love--romantic presents, hot sex, candlelit dinners--she lacks the one thing she wants a husband of her own. Going beyond revenge, Sylvie hatches a brilliant, hilarious, and daringly outrageous scheme that just might fulfill both their wildest dreams...or leave them with nothing but two broken hearts.",
