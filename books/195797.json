She is supposed to be off limits, but her rebellious nature makes my most sought after asset jump with excitement. Finally a challenge that I’m more than willing to accept. I will bend her to my will. I won’t stop until I have her complete submission.Get in and get out. That’s the challenge. My tool accepts.",
