  "description": "At the heart of this book is a unique eating programme designed specifically to let you detox and feel wonderful in time for the summer holidays or a special event. At 14 days the diet is half the length of the original detox and so offers a more accessible option if you want to ready yourself for poolside, beach or in the run-up to a special occasion. And if you don't even have two weeks to spare I've introduced two brand new plans for even more rapid results. The 3 day ultra-detox plan is a diet super rich in nutrients to kick start a healthier digestive system and stimulate detoxifying organs, and the 7 day re-energise plan is the ideal pick-me-up when you're feeling run-down, lacklustre and lacking energy. With fabulous ideas for breakfasts, superb salads, summer soups, super smoothies, desserts and snacks, as well as great tips for barbecuing, Carol's Summer Detox plans will re-invigorate you and boost your energy levels - exactly what you need before a holiday, a special event or after a stressful period in your life to restore your vitality.",
