  "description": "Jessy feels like she is the only girl in the whole world without a pet. She really wants a cat, but there's just one problemâ€”her parents can't stand cats. But Jessy is determined to have one, so she makes herself a fluffy white cat suit and refuses to take it off until her parents buy her a real cat. She even goes to school in her cat suit and eats raw fish under the table! Jessy's parents finally give in, but to their surprise, Jessy seems to have changed her mind about wanting a cat, and has her sights set on something else.",
