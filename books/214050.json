  "description": "Here is public poetry of uncommon moral urgency: it bears witness to the sufferings of the innocent at the hands of history and to the martyrdom of those who have dared look history in the eye. \"Rich, quarrelsome...handsome and brutish...Hill's poetry is the major achievement of late-twentieth-century verse,\" says The New Criterion. \"Canaan is one of the few serious books we will have to mark the millennium.\"",
