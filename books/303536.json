  "description": "I’ve never been the jealous guy, I’ve always gotten what I want, and if it’s not freely available to me, I’ve taken it for my own without apology. It’s funny I can tell already that you think I’m an arrogant arse and you are mostly right. My name is Lincoln Forrest and I’m Australia’s wealthiest mining magnate, and I’m used to getting everything that I want because everything comes at a price, including people. What you don’t know is that the moment I saw her, I knew that she was made for me. Her body, mind and soul purposely build for me. Made for my pleasure. She doesn’t know it now, but it won’t be long, and she will be mine forever. So am I jealous that her pipsqueak geologist husband stands beside her? No. Am I jealous that she’s laughing at his pathetic joke about a rock fact? No. Am I jealous that she wears his ring? NO! Jealous - Not Me! I’m not that guy. I get what I want, and I want Madeline James and I’ll do absolutely anything to have her.",
