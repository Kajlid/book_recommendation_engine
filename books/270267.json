  "description": "Red Squadron is the tip of the spear in the war against global terrorism. Navy SEAL Commander, Noble Bauer, leads the JASOC Taskforce and knows his team won’t be complete until he finds a Communications Specialist. He knows just the man for the job. The only problem is can he get him to listen. Damn it, why did the best man for the job have to be the one he left behind so long ago? The last person Max Delgado expected to see while on an Undercover Op is the guy who left him high and dry after his life fell apart. The asshole who left him to pick up the pieces alone when his father was arrested for espionage, while he was still a teenager. Why the hell should he listen to a damn word Noble has to say now? JASOC wants information they believe Max’s father holds. Max has always wanted answers. Can Noble keep his heart intact and his hands to himself, as he works with the one man guaranteed to make him crazy?",
