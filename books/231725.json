  "description": "To make your own rules in magic will end in misery or mastery. The team is torn apart, and soulmates are separated. Caleb is sent on secret missions he canâ€™t even tell Abigail about while she must lead a specialized force against the dragons threatening to take over the academy. While she is forced to work with people who don't trust her and lie to her parents about college, the secrets are piling up, and answers are nowhere to be found.  When troubles arise for Abigail's closest magicless friends, she must balance her two lives and protect them both. But not all is as it seems, and some she thought needed saving are the ones coming after her. Some who she thought were after her truly need saving.  Loyalties tested, love tried, magic put to the test... Magical creatures restless from hiding for so long threaten to overrun the world and take back what they believe belongs to them. And with them, a darkness spreads. Abigail must find the light again or lose everything to shadows and evil.",
