  "title": "Mindfulness for Compassionate Living: Mindful Ways to Less Stress and More Kindness",
  "description": "Self-compassion is a life-changing way of thinking that is rooted in Mindfulness. By learning to have more loving kindness and forgiveness for ourselves, we have more empathy and compassion for others. The self-compassion movement has been growing rapidly over the past two years with recent research into the neuroscience of compassion showing that changing our thinking habits makes new neural pathways in the brain - and that compassion can be learned.The benefits of this practice are personal and global, from learning how to manage chronic pain to relieving stress, boosting the immune system and circulation, along with improving relationships as we connect more authentically with others. With gentle exercises to try, meditations, visualizations and inspiring case studies, Awakening the Compassionate Mind is your first step in applying loving kindness first to yourself, then others, releasing negativity and living joyfully from the heart.",
