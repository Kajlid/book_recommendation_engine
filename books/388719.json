  "description": "Sexy B&D Scifi Set On Far Worlds! Back home on earth, Megan's sexlife was boring. That was before she was kidnapped into space and learned to love submission under the tutelage of Khiru, the fierce Rhysh Master. But, in Book 2 of the bestselling \"Two Moons\" saga, Megan is about to find ropes less appealing when she is kidnapped by a rebellious outlaw. Kidnapped and held hostage by a determined and dangerous freeman, she slowly learns to love, Megan must fight ruthless adversaries as well as the conflicting feelings in her own heart. At a time when she needs strength and resilience, will her love for Khiru, the fierce Rhysh Master, be help or hindrance? In The Freeman's Captive: Two Moons 2, the second novel of her intergalactic adventures, Megan finds herself in a battle she didn't choose, one in which the outcome will forever change her life.
