Entire star systems—and billions of people—are becoming cut off from the rest of human civilization.

But “control” is a slippery thing, and even as Grayland strives to save as many of her people form impoverished isolation, the forces opposing her rule will make a final, desperate push to topple her from her throne and power, by any means necessary.
