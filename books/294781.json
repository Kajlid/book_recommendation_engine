  "title": "Always With You",
  "description": "I’ve always relished being a man of mystery. My LA hotel empire is public, but my private life as plain old Reid Davenport stays that way. Right up until it doesn’t, and the tabloids threaten not just my privacy, but that of my family. I’d do anything to protect them from the limelight.  But must it involve Hailey, the fiery PR consultant I can’t stop fantasizing about?  Hailey Connor keeps warning me she won’t take on an uncooperative client. So why is she so compelled to help me? Maybe it’s something about how her face softens when I talk about my family. Maybe it’s because she genuinely wants to help.  Or maybe it’s my brooding demeanor that causes her to melt so fast when I kiss her.  Even though I’m constantly infuriated by this little spitfire bossing me around, every time she smiles, I can’t help wanting to pull her close and not let go.  I think Hailey is starting to fall for me, despite being my polar opposite. But when our worlds collide, can I convince her we’re a perfect match?",
