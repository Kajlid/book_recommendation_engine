  "description": "The South Was Right!, the Kennedy brothers dispel many commonly held beliefs about the Civil War. Their well-researched arguments demonstrate the South's many legitimate complaints during the antebellum period, including unfair taxation and unequal constitutional rights. The victorious North rewrote history to justify its invasion of the South, which was legally and culturally a separate, independent country. Furthermore, the Kennedys explain how lingering myths about the Civil War are still being used to discredit and exploit former Confederate states. The authors' bold ideas and rigorous documentation will change the way readers think about the Civil War.",
