  "title": "Inca: The Golden Sun",
  "description": "In 1532, the Andean Mountains were stained with the blood of civil war. The warrior Atahualpa had just defeated his politician brother to take control of the storied Incan empire, and led a triumphant march back to the capitol of Cuzco, at the head of tens of thousands of battle-hardened soldiers. Meanwhile, a poor middle-aged soldier from the forgotten western plains of Spain landed on the Pacific Coast of South America. Francisco Pizarro had recruited a hundred ragtag, armored conquistadors to seek their fortune in the New World. He'd bet his life and dreams on the rumors of a wealthy empire nested in the Andes. In a grave coincidence, Pizarro and Atahualpa's forces stumbled upon each other outside of the small town of Cajamarca. As Pizarro and his men hid behind their cannons in the shadows, Atahualpa and his best warriors entered the town square to make contact with these foreigners. What follows is the true story ambush, murder, ambition, politics, and glory that brought an empire to its knees.",
