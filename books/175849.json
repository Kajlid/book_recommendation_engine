  "description": "A Modern Day \"Ruth\" Love Story of Regency Proportions...  Lady Margaret and daughter-in-law Georgiana live in the French Alps in a charming chateau that was once filled with love and joy. When they are suddenly widowed, mother and daughter are heartbroken. How will they survive? The chateau seems empty and they are nearly consumed by grief, not to mention barely scraping by.  When they are invited to return to England to be cared for by distant relations, will they find the courage to cross France in spite of the turmoil of the Revolution? Can they make a new life in County Essex? Will penniless Lady Georgiana be doomed to life as a governess forever? Furthermore, she keeps finding herself in--well, predicaments. Precarious predicaments, truth be told. Will she ever stop getting into these ridiculous dilemmas so the Earl can stop coming to her rescue?  Lisa Prysock enjoys sharing her faith in Jesus Christ through her writing. She is also the author of \"To Find a Duchess,\" \"Hannah's Garden: A Turn of the Century Love Story,\" Volume I and \"Abigail's Melody,\" Volume II of the Victorian Christian Heritage Series.
