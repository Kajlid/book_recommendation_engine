  "description": "Shannon was becoming a good liar. Brad insisted she take her medication, but she hid the pills under her tongue to avoid an argument. She was beginning to have flash backs of her past. She wanted to know who she was, and what happened to her that resulted in her being found floating on a rubber raft at sea, beaten nearly to death with a broken arm and no memory of who she was or what had happened to her. And just who are these two strangers who both claim they were her former partners who worked for the government; each of them insisting that the other is a Russian spy.",
