  "title": "DÃ¡lvi: Six Years in the Arctic Tundra",
  "description": "A DNA test suggesting she shared some genetics with the Sami people, the indigenous inhabitants of the Arctic tundra, tapped into Laura Galloway's wanderlust. An affair with a Sami reindeer herder led her to abandon her high-flying New York life for a fresh start in the tiny town of Kautokeino. When her new boyfriend left her unexpectedly after six months, it would have been easy, and perhaps prudent, to return home. But she stayed for six years. Dalvi is the story of Laura's time in a reindeer-herding village in Arctic Norway, forging a solitary existence as one of the few Westerners living among one of the most remote cultures on earth. Both a heart-rending memoir and a love letter to the singular landscape of the region, Dalvi explores with great warmth and humility what it means to truly belong.",
