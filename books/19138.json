  "description": "Mary Rosenthal is looking forward to her summer vacation. Good books, the beach...life doesn't get any better. But when her aging car blows up she's desperate enough to take part in WLVH's newest contest - live in a truck for a chance to win it. It's not exactly how she planned to spend her vacation, but the scenery - AKA her opponent - is just as nice to look at as the beach would be, but he's tough to read. One minute she thinks he likes her, the next he's standoffish again.The last thing Ethan Westbrook wants to do is live in a truck, but his father convinces him that it's a great publicity stunt for their family-owned chain of pharmacies. He went into the truck counting down the seconds until he could get out of it, but after a few days with Mary, staying put didn't seem so bad. As a matter of fact, he couldn't think of anywhere he'd rather be.A guy, a girl, and a truck...things are heating up at WLVH, Love Handles, where love is more than just a song!",
