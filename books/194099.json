  "description": "You may be looking at the back of this book, watching as someone else is reading it-a book entitled: Love: Expressed. And you're thinking, 'They must have issues.' So to help them out for a moment:This isn't another one of those 'self-help' manuals.This isn't a book about romance and sex, or feelings and cuddles.This isn't a guidebook offering relationship advice, giving tips on how to find 'love' and 'look after' it.In those senses, this isn't even a book about love.It's a book about life-every part of it. About how it should be lived, how it should be explored, how it should be expressed. This is a book about meaning, about life's trajectories. It's about God. It's about you. It's about them.In that sense, this is all about love. But if I could capture here what I mean by 'love' in that sense, I wouldn't have needed to write a book.“Tristan Sherwin has written a smart and beautiful book showing us that Jesus Christ is the love of God expressed as a human life. This is the life we are called to imitate; this life of love is what we are made for.”-Brian Zahnd; Author of A Farewell To Mars“Refreshing, authentic, inspiring, and yet practical-Tristan is a breath of fresh air.” -Jeff Lucas; Author, Speaker, Broadcaster“Love: Expressed is a work of dirt-under-your-fingers spirituality.” -Jonathan Martin; Author of Prototype",
