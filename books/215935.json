  "title": "Sex and Sushi: Great Married Sex",
  "description": "These highly detailed, short, to-the-point, stories are narratives of one couple's actual sex sessions as written by the woman. They're written by the wife for her husband to learn what goes thru her head when they're having sex. The stories are a form of communication between the couple. In honest and painstaking detail, the wife shares her thoughts, actions, comments, conversations, and sexy feelings, before, during, and after their sex sessions. It's Mummy Porn at its sizzling best. They're laugh-out-loud sexy funny - not in a funny joke way, but in a sexy, OMG, I'm-too-red-in-the-face, way. This is where the reader finds herself fully immersed in the stories. The stories engulf the reader in such a way that the reader becomes fully heated and aroused. This super-racy book is too hot to read in one sitting. It's a steamy, hot, dirty, naughty bundle of erotic sexcapades of real-life taboo sex sessions between a happily married, adventurous couple who both love pussy and anal sex with each other. That might seem odd in today's society, but these stories are first-hand descriptions of mind-blowing sex at its finest. The sultry thoughts that fill the woman's head during foreplay, sex, orgasm, and post-orgasm are beautifully illustrated in these stories. This is the complete must-read unabridged version. Well, there's no abridged version, everything's in here. The abridged version would be one empty page. You want the full version. Read the book for some great entertainment.Warning - Men who patronize women will not enjoy reading this book.",
