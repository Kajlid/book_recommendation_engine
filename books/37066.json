  "description": "Cameron Delaney Tyson's just an ordinary guy, living an ordinary life, trying to sort out his issues along the way - or that's what he keeps trying to tell himself, that is. He doesn't believe in the supernatural, thinks dreams are just daily recycling, and lives in the here and now. Meanwhile, a vicious star dreamling from another galaxy is tracking him, he's trying to prove himself to the woman of his heart and soul and an ex-playmate is stalking him through sex magic and nightmares. What's an ordinary guy going to do?",
