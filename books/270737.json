  "description": "This box set includes the first three books in the Dragon Saga, over 1800 pages of action-packed romantic fantasy. An arrogant dragon. A smart-mouthed priestess. The fate of the world depends on them working together. Suzume’s life is ruined. Exiled to a remote mountain shrine, she’s training to become a priestess. A life of poverty doesn’t suit her, and she dreams of her old life as a princess. When she accidentally awakens the god of the mountain, she discovers new powers and a whole lot of problems. The god is a fake. For five hundred years, the dragon was trapped at the shrine. Betrayed by the woman he loved, he needs to find her reincarnation to get his revenge. Since Suzume freed him, he chooses her to help him. But when Suzume discovers she is that woman, it’s a race to seal him again before he finds out. With new powers come dangerous enemies. The dragon is not the only one she needs to worry about. A powerful monster wants Suzume for his own. Until she can learn to control her abilities, the dragon is the only one who can protect her. They must learn to work together to stop the monster, if they don’t kill each other in the process...

A story of love, magic, and revenge that readers say they couldn’t put down. Get the first three books in the saga today!",
