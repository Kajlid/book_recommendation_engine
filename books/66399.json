  "description": "Insects inhabit an often unseen world, pursuing strange, tiny and astonishingly full lives far beyond our wildest imaginings. From the dawn of humanity, our six-legged fellow earthlings have fascinated us. We've swatted them, sprayed them, and cursed them; at the same time, we've also studied them, admired them, and woven some of our most compelling prose about them.In Insect Lives: Stories of Mystery and Romance from a Hidden World, distinguished nature writer Erich Hoyt and Smithsonian entomologist Ted Schultz have gathered more than 70 selections from the best and most entertaining writing ever penned about insects.Insect Lives delightfully captures the entire range of our preoccupation with insects, from timeless passages from the Bible, Aristotle, and the great nineteenth-century naturalists to the lyrical appreciations of famed poets, novelists, and essayists; from the groundbreaking discoveries of cutting-edge thinkers such as techno-guru, Wired magazine founder, and longtime beekeeper Kevin Kelly; from hilariously hyperbolic science-fiction to screenplays to classic cartoons.",
