  "description": "“My heart enlarged at a thought I’d never had for another woman... I wanted to keep her.”\nLeaving his Navy career behind, Mac Whittaker is ready to join his family on Capitol Hill and pursue the political dream he’s had since childhood. He has the entire American fairy tale at his fingertips, and all he needs to complete it is a woman he adores at his side.When he finds the mesmerizing Georgie Astrella vacationing at his best friend’s beach house, he’s sure the pulsing in his veins means she’s the one.Problem is, Georgie isn’t looking for a man or love. She’s just getting back on track after putting her goals aside for way too long. With the contract on her Grandma’s salon expiring, she can finally return to graduate school and bury herself in the law that’s always called to her.She certainly can’t afford for the intoxicating kiss she shares with the oh, so charming Mac-Macauley to turn into anything requiring her heart.Fate has other ideas, throwing them together until neither of them can walk away from the attraction thundering across their souls.But her family’s past would make his future an impossibility, and they’ll have to decide just what they’re willing to sacrifice for love.From award-winning author, LJ Evans, comes a story of family and sacrifice inspired by Lewis Capaldi’s “Bruises.” If you like vibrant characters and emotional journeys, you won’t want to miss this friends-to-lovers, military romance.",
