  "description": "Whoopi Goldberg has always been her own woman. From her days in standup, through her acclaimed work as an actor, and now into her duties as the moderator and co-host of The View, Whoopi has been outspoken and honest, respectfully taking no prisoners even while drawing people in and making them laugh--or cry. Total honesty, administered civilly and with a healthy dose of audacity, is her hallmark and her way of life.In her new book, Whoopi shares stories from her own life when she's been forced to deal with tough situations in family, marriage, friendship, and business. She relates how she navigated through them with healthy honesty, which has all but vanished in the era of the volatile pundit. Naturally, she tells these stories with the humor, irreverence, and joy for which she's known, and she also speaks up about the challenges dealing with one another here and now, especially with the growing disrespect and rudeness in this country. Cheeky, a bit naughty, occasionally in-your-face, this humorous book will bring readers into her world.",
