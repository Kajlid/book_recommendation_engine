No guy is ever going to want her.\" Even though it's her freshman year in college, she vows to quit school and run away. That is, until her mother's husband catches her with going out the door in the middle of the night with a suitcase. Tina finally, tearfully, confesses, and is surprised by her mother's husband's insight and perspective--and how willing he is to show her just how beautiful and loveable he thinks she really is.</p><p style=\" left;\"><em><em>Selena Kitt Single<br>Short Story--Big Bang!<br>(approx 7400 words)</em><br><br><em> This title contains shamelessly wicked displays of the taboo so hot--careful!--it may just melt your e-reader!</em><br></em></p><h2 style=\" center;\">GET MORE TABOO STORIES FROM SELENA KITT</h2><ul><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B0068UAZJW\">On the Bus</a></li><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B0068UBBYK\">In the Fold</a></li><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B007RZ5WFO\">Under the Stars</a></li><li style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B0068UAW0Y\">Dar... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B007X6IHC2\">Tin... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B00AFNO2JW\">Cla... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B009XHUCBI\">Chr... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/dp/B009AM5D5G\">Ann... style=\" left;\"><a href=\"amazon.com/Becca-ebook/dp/B00AKNH0LY&...",
