But the problem rapidly grows much worse than that when Ackley realizes his true purpose is assassination of the Morcian crown prince—an assassination Ackley prevents, but at great cost.Banished from his own country, bound magically to the crown prince of his enemies, Ackley is certain of just one whether he can figure out how to break the spell or not, his death is assured.",
