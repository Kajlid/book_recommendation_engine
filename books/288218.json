  "description": "I’ve been a pawn in this game for longer than I can remember.  Before I died on the streets of Chicago.  Perhaps before I was born.  But these days, I’m not even sure which side I’m on. Ever since the Dark God brought me over to his side, all I know is the end is coming and when it does, I’ll be here to greet it.  But time is running out, and only two paths remain:  To be the woman I was always meant to be and fight to save my dying world.  Or give into the darkness inside me and become the Dark God’s queen forever.",
