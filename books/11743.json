  "description": "Elder Neal A. Maxwell once called Henry Eyring \"the most distinguished Mormon scientist of this dispensation.\" Henry Eyring discusses various aspects of science, religion, and life. Some of his topics are truth, heredity and environment, communication, freedom through obedience, the Church, Church leaders, work, the scriptures, the age of the Earth, organic evolution, nature and revelation and miracles. Especially interesting are his illustrations of how science and religion complement rather than detract from one another, and how the principles of both can be used to live a happier, more abundant life.",
