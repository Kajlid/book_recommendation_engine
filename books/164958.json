  "description": "Club Extraordinaire: go there for discipline and adventure, go there for the thrill, go there for sweet, sweet love.Club Extraordinaire is a place Julie had shared with Nathan. A place where they could indulge themselves in the senses. A place to be free. Going there alone for the first time since Nathan had walked out is a strange and liberating experience, and one full of surprises.Just who is the masked stranger, and what is it about him that draws Julie so powerfully? Is it the way he moves, or the way he is so confident and masterful? Or is it that he reminds her so strongly of her ex?And who is the handsome guy who runs the coffee shop across the street from the Club? There's clearly far more to him than first meets the eye.Pulled in different directions, Julie must work out what she really wants from life: does she want it all, or does she just want escape?A story of passion and intrigue, of endings and new beginnings. A story full of the twists and turns familiar to readers of PJ Adams' work, including the bestsellers Winner Takes All and Black Widow.",
