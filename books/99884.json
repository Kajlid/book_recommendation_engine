  "description": "Catherine Jewell enjoys the small quiet town she's recently moved to where she's a botanist at Elmwood Gardens and also has a small garden center, Roses in Thyme. At least she does until she discovers a body with a garden fork in his back at Elmwood Gardens. John MacDoougal, the police chief of Portage Falls, has never had to deal with a muder in his ten years as police chief. As he questions the suspects, many who are Catherine's co-workers and friends, she works to divert his suspicions elsewhere since she's sure none of them could be the murderer. When another body is discovered, they start working together, and in spite of their inexperience and several close calls with death, they solve the murdrs and restore calm to the little town of Portage Falls.",
