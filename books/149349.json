  "title": "Taking a Dare",
  "description": "In Dare Gentry's mind, one female was as good as another. A fact he often pointed out to his Hellion brothers. He didn't believe in love, relationships and definitely wasn't into being a part of a couple. Loose, free and easy is how Dare liked his play.  That was until Ryley Daniels blows back into town ten years after they'd first met. And reignites feelings Dare's scarred heart never wanted to remember but couldn't seem to forget.  From the author of Hiding in Plain Sight, The Possibility of Trey and Reinventing Mel, comes the third novel in the Hellion MC Series.  Sometimes love can survive...distances, time and even the objections of your own heart.",
