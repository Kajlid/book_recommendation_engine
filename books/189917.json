  "description": "A social, cultural, and economic as well as political history of the United States, this single volume unabridged edition of Morison's classic history traces the major strands in America's history all the way from prehistoric humans to the assasination of President Kennedy.\"Prospective readers may well ask wherein [this history] may differ in form and content from other American histories of similar length. Politics are not lacking; but my main ambition is to re-create for my readers American ways of living in bygone eras. Here you will find a great deal on social and economic development; horses, ships, popular sports, and pastimes; eating, drinking, and smoking habits. Pugilists will be found cheek-by-jowl with Presidents; rough-necks with reformers, artists with ambassadors.\"Moreâ€¦than in other histories will be found on sea power, on the colonial period in which basic American principles were established, on the American Indians, and the Caribbean. I am offering fresh, new accounts of the Civil War and the War of Independence. A brief account of the parallel history of Canada, so near and dear to us, yet so unknown in her historical development to most citizens of the United States, has been attempted.\" -- from the Preface",
