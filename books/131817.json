  "description": "We all know that cats go \"meow\"-but they also go \"purrrr\" when they're happy, \"schmick schmack schmick\" when they eat, and \"hissssssss\" when they're mad! Big dogs go \"WOOF\" and smaller dogs go \"ruff, ruff, ruff,\" and very small dogs go \"yap yap yap yap yap...\" What other sounds do these animals make? Every small child loves cats and dogs, and babies can go \"purr\" or \"ruff ruff\" along with these lovable pets. Simple text-three or four words a spread! -and adorable illustrations make these board books perfect for the smallest readers.",
