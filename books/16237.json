  "description": "Juanito is miserable—his family has just moved to New York, and because he only speaks Spanish, he has no one to talk to. What's more, his dog, Pepito, is lost! Juanito knows that most of his neighbors won't understand “Mi perro se ha perdido,” so he asks a man at the bank to help him make a sign in English. Suddenly, people all over the city want to help Juanito find Pepito...and the search is on!",
