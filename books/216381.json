  "title": "The Genesis of Germs",
  "description": "The concept of disease and germs can be dfificult for Christians to understand in a creationist worldview. The author sheds light on the origin of germs and how they fit into a Biblical worldview and the possible function of these microbes before the fall. He also considers how these constantly mutating pathogens are not evidence for evolution, but rather of de-evoution. Every year seems to bring an impending threat of a new disease outbreak. The spread of these scary diseases, from avian flu to SARS to AIDS, is a cause for concern and leads to questions, such as: Where did all these germs come from? How do they fit into a biblical worldview? What kind of function did these microbes have before the Fall? How can something so small have such a huge, deadly impact on the world around us? Dr. Alan Gillen sheds light on these and many other questions in this revealing and detailed book. He shows how these constantly mutating diseases are proof for devolution rather than evolution, and how all of these germs fit into a biblical worldview. He also shows how germs are symptomatic of the literal Fall and Curse of creation as a result of man's sin, and the hope we have in the coming of Jesus Christ.",
