  "title": "Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible & Why We Don't Know About Them",
  "description": "Picking up where Bible expert Bart Ehrman's New York Times bestseller Misquoting Jesus left off, Jesus, Interrupted addresses the larger issue of what the New Testament actually teaches—and it's not what most people think. Here Ehrman reveals what scholars have unearthed:•The authors of the New Testament have diverging views about who Jesus was and how salvation works•The New Testament contains books that were forged in the names of the apostles by Christian writers who lived decades later•Jesus, Paul, Matthew and John all represented fundamentally different religions•Established Christian doctrines—such as the suffering messiah, the divinity of Jesus and the trinity—were the inventions of still later theologiansThese aren't idiosyncratic perspectives of just one scholar. They've been the standard widespread views of scholars across a full spectrum of denominations and traditions. Why is it most people have never heard such things? This is the book that pastors, educators and anyone interested in the Bible have been waiting for—a compelling account of the central challenges faced when attempting to reconstruct Jesus' life and message.",
