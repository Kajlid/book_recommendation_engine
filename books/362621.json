  "description": "In this visually stunning picture book, Caldecott Medalist Steve Jenkins illustrates animals both large and small at actual size. How big is a crocodile? What about a tiger, or the world’s largest spider? Can you imagine a tongue that is two feet long or an eye that’s bigger than your head? Sometimes facts and figures don’t tell the whole story. Sometimes you need to see things for yourself—at their actual size. \"A must-have for any collection.\" (School Library Journal)",
