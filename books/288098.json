  "title": "The Brixon Agreement",
  "description": "(New cover, same book. Originally published 2018.) California, 1870’s. Bailey McLaine . . . young, naïve, an innocent beauty who is more at home in a saddle than in a parlor. For months she’s struggled to keep her uncle’s ranch afloat during a severe drought. She’s done quite well, too. Or so she thinks, right up until the moment she discovers her uncle has borrowed heavily from one of California’s most notorious money-lenders. Now those loans are coming due and she has no way to repay them. A quick trip to San Francisco to meet with her uncle’s lender turns into an unmitigated disaster. Brick Brixon . . . handsome, rich . . .and one of California’s most powerful men. And eager to exact his revenge against the man who stole his father’s land so many years ago. When Bailey’s plan falls apart, he presents her with a proposal of his own. Become his mistress for one week out of every month for the next nine months and the debt will be forgiven. Reject his proposal and she will lose the ranch as soon as she misses a payment. A despicable option for an innocent young lady, but there are no other options. Is saving her home worth trading her virginity to this stranger? And what about her heart? Will he take that from her too?",
