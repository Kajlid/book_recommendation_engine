  "description": "I'm Toph. After my father found out that I'd been competing in Earthbending tournaments, he put me under constant surveillance! So I left home. Now I'm traveling through the Earth Kingdom with Aang - he's the Avatar - and his friends Katara and Sokka, on Aang's sky bison, Appa. I'm teaching Earthbending to Aang, and man, do I have my work cut out for me! Even though we've had our differences, it's kind of nice knowing these guys will always have my back and point me in the right direction when I can't feel which way to go.",
