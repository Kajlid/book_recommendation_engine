  "description": "On April 5, 1981, two college coeds were kidnapped from a residential street of Albuquerque, New Mexico. The next morning, the girls were found in a desolate mountain arroyo; one raped and murdered, the other savagely stabbed 33 times and left for dead. As fear engulfed the University of New Mexico's quiet campus, police had few clues to assist them in tracking down the vicious killer. This book is based on the true story of what happened that night in the Sandia Mountains, a shockingly brutal crime that changed the city of Albuquerque forever. It is a gritty tale of unspeakable violence and the relentless search for justice, but it is also the story of a young woman's incredible will to live ... and her life-long struggle to escape the legacy of that deadly arroyo. 2013 New Mexico-Arizona Book Awards finalist 2013 eLit gold medal in True Crime Rated #2 on list of \"Top 25 Best True Crime Books\" True crime drama \"Surviving Evil\" feature \"Escaping the Arroyo\" story on November 5, 2015 on the Investigation Discovery Channel.",
