  "description": "Master the gift of gab with the phrase book that makes Erin go ha!From Dublin on Five Pints an Hour to Genuflection for Beginners , Wicked Irish helps visitors negotiate the nuances of a country where even trees are considered Protestant or Catholic. Learn to flatter customs \"'Tis a grand machine you have there, officer!\" Politely decline the heavy Irish \"I've given up pig entrails/congealed blood for Lent.\" Show appreciation for fine \"ACK ACK! Mother Mary! That goes down the nun's knickers!\" There's even a special section just for \"Should I replace divots in consecrated ground? Am I entitled to relief from this dolmen/ewe/leprechaun? Shite! I don't usually lose a putt in the wind.\"Wicked Irish is instant gift of gab, and soon you'll be toasting newfound friends, strangers, barmaids, and even stray dogs with confidence.",
