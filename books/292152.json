  "description": "The greatest trick the First Vampire ever pulled was convincing the world that he didn't exist.If you enjoyed the Blade or Underworld movies, you will love the Shade of Devil series.Before the now-infamous Count Dracula ever tasted his first drop of blood, Sorin Ambrogio owned the night. Humanity fearfully called him the Devil.Cursed by the gods, Sorin spent centuries bathing Europe in oceans of blood with his best friends, Lucian and Nero, the world's first Werewolf and Warlock-an unholy trinity if there ever was one. Until the three monsters grew weary of the carnage, choosing to leave it all behind and visit the brave New World across the ocean. As they befriended a Native American tribe, they quickly forgot that monsters can never escape their past.But Dracula-Sorin's spawn-was willing to do anything to erase Sorin's name from the pages of history so that he could claim the title of the world's first vampire all for himself. Dracula hunts him down and slaughters the natives, fatally wounding Sorin in the attack. Except a Shaman manages to secretly cast Sorin into a healing slumber.For five hundred years.Until Sorin is awoken by a powerful Shaman in present-day New York City. In a world he doesn't understand, Sorin only wants one thing-to kill Dracula and anyone else who stands in his path. When the descendant of an infamous vampire hunter steps into his life, Sorin is torn between conflicting feelings in his heart-revenge or love. But to a woman like Victoria Helsing, it might just be considered a bloody good date.The streets of New York City will flow with rivers of blood, and the fate of the world rests in the hands of the Devil, Sorin Ambrogio.Because this town isn't big enough for the both of them.",
