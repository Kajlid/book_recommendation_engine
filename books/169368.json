  "description": "Théoden: On the evening of branding my new son, Noel, my King has called a special meeting of his Court. I can't possibly guess what this meeting is about, as everything within his kingdom is running perfectly. I do know one thing, Ara loves to entertain and be entertained, so at least that's something to look forward to. What I'm not looking forward to is having to see Nolan, Lord of District Four. We really don't get along. Well, as for my children, when the Master is away, the boys will play. In fact, I insist on it. Noel: I've just received my official brand, the insignia of the House of Théoden. Along with the brand comes a load of responsibilities I am to adhere to. Apparently, my new life involves being an enforcer. I'm to be trained by Marco, my eldest and most sadistic brother. I'm not looking forward to that, not one bit. At least tonight, I'll get a reprieve. For tonight, we celebrate as only the House of Théoden can. Warning: This serial contains strong adult content not meant for sensitive eyes. The novelettes in this serial will be filled with dark, twisted, raunchy and steamy scenes between powerful, sexy men that will either offend you or get ya revved up. This series will not be pulling any punches, and it won’t apologize for hurting your feelings, either. You’ll find no fluff and ruffles here. The vampires are not misunderstood, hopeless romantics looking for love. The werewolves are not cute and cuddly and the dragons aren’t the ones from your childhood. This is NOT a romance. There are approximately 19,100 words in this novelette.",
