  "title": "Quf-Man",
  "description": "The product of a 23rd century experiment gone haywire, ADAM KOOP is an elegant seven-footer, human in appearance but having the strength of four men, the mind of an Einstein and the scruples of a killer. Koop is the first Quf-Man, the alpha male who shatters the bonds of servitude and leads his fellow human-anthropoid hybrids to dominance of an entire planet.  Light years away on Planet Earth, JONATHAN FELS is a dropout with a history of poor academic performance and a rap sheet for illegal prospecting. Fels joins the Marine Corps and qualifies for a surgical makeover that provides exceptional strength, cat-like reflexes and a cerebral-computer interface.  When Koop and his hordes attack a colonized moon, Fels and his cybernetic marines deploy to rescue a cult of human females. Earthâ€™s future hangs in the balance.  . . . A realistic tale of the future based on experimental warrior enhancement and real-world genetics, by a former USAF pilot turned geneticist.",
