  "title": "Blue Chameleon",
  "description": "He can turn himself into anything and appear to fit in anywhere, but it seems that neither the swirly snail, the green grasshopper nor the stripy sock want to be friends. Will he ever find someone to talk to? Someone just like him? With a subtle and witty interplay between words and illustrations this introduction to colours and shapes (and chameleons ) is sure to delight everyone, from the youngest child upwards. Another triumph by prize-winning Emily Gravett.",
