  "description": "I came here with a single goal in mind. An aim. A purpose.I will break out of Darkmore Penitentiary.But I was a fool to think that it would be so simple. And now with more and more Fae relying on me to get them out of this slice of hell, I find myself unable to do a damn thing.Mason Cain stabbed me in the back and left me to rot in the dark. So now I have another goal in mind before I escape this place, because no one messes with the Queen of the Oscura Clan and lives to tell the tale. The moment I get out of this place, my sights will be set on him.Between the four alpha males luring me in, the psychopaths trying to kill me and the monster roaming the halls at night, I have my hands full in here.But one thing is for sure. I’m not throwing my life away in this place.So I’ll do whatever it takes to escape.",
