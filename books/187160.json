  "description": "Poppy is bored to tears with her dead-end job and dull life, so when a species of alien warlords arrives on Earth, seeking women to help repopulate their race, why wouldn't she sign up? She doesn't care who she's matched with-until she meets him. Sexy, long-haired, tattoo-sporting and leather-pants-wearing Wheaton. Diplomat Wheaton expected a cultured Earthling to help in his mission, not some crazy-haired woman named after a flower and whose speech baffles his translator. Pardon my French? Knock it off? But Wheaton is soon smitten and eager to turn Poppy's good-morning kisses into an all-day affair. Doing the nasty? Bring it on! But Poppy must do battle with the slimy councilor Demascus, and an extremist group opposed to the Pact. And that's before a glitch in the Bridal Pact program makes all existing matches invalid, and glossy Hannah, the perfect politician's wife, arrives on board. Her Wheaton. Reader This story has graphic sexual language and scenes-no closed bedroom doors (or other rooms) here! An adult science fiction romance from Ellora's Cave",
