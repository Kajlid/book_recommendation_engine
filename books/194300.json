  "description": "Santa Claus's daughter sets out to break a curse and free a magical kingdom--in this beloved\n New York Times\n bestseller.  Though few mortals know his secret, Nicholas is more than a jolly red-suited man who visits children all over the world on Christmas Eve--he is also the king of Forever, Land of the Immortals. Each year he gets letters from millions of boys and girls, and helps make their Christmas wishes come true. But one year, a special little boy from New York City asks something Nicholas has never been asked before: \"What do you wish for Christmas, Santa?\" With that simple question, a magical story unfolds. Nicholas answers that his only wish is for a child. And soon the immortal people of the kingdom celebrate the arrival of Holly Claus, the princess of Forever and the first child to grace its ground. But their happiness is dashed when an evil sorcerer places a spell on the infant, turning her heart to ice and freezing her kingdom in time. Many years later, just in time for Christmas Eve, Holly travels to New York, intent upon saving Christmas and freeing the land of Forever. Holly will make this the most magical--and memorable--Christmas the world has ever seen. This ebook features a note from Brittney Ryan including rare images and never-before-seen documents from the author's personal collection.",
