  "description": "What does a guy do when his best friend starts doing things that are completely out of character? In the case of Luke McAllister, you can't do anything - until you figure out exactly what it is that is different. The fact that his best friend is a girl complicates matters a heap. Nothing makes sense when RaeNell Stephens, the girl that has \"the best curve ball he's ever seen,\" starts blushing and acting like a durned female. All of this at the beginning of the summer to end all summers' too. This is the summer that Luke, RaeNell, and their friend Farley Midkiff set out to locate, and cash in on a rogue Civil War soldier's stolen one million dollar Union payroll. Undaunted by thousands of scholars and fortune seekers having looked unsuccessfully for the treasure for a hundred years, the three 12 year-old friends search diligently for themselves. What they find is an adventure - though maybe not what, or where, they expected!",
