He determines to give life to the garden and changes it into a village. Serpentinu puts up advertisements because to unite the community, different professions are needed. A wide range of animals respond to Serpentinu’s adverts, all of which carry out worthwhile jobs in the community. But then Serpentinu seems to disappear...Il-Villaġġ ta’ Serpentinu is a book through which various themes such as poetry, diverse animals and different kinds of work can be explored. Questions are also raised throughout the book to spur critical thinking in its young readers.",
