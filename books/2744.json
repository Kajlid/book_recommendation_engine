But it all came crashing down when her husband died unexpectedly. Not sure what to do, she retreated inside herself, shutting off everyone as she wished for the impossible. But there was still work to be done.When Calliope finally agreed to photograph the construction at his new hotel, Silas Hope was thrilled. His attraction to the sub was strong, and he wanted nothing more than to see her bound in his dungeon for both their pleasure.To do that, though, Silas would have to convince her to open up to him, mind, body and soul. He knew what Calliope liked, because he’d witnessed her submission firsthand. Now all he had to do was get her to let him wrap his ropes around her wrists and put the kiss of his leather on her bottom.But while the two of them are exploring a new Dom/sub relationship, another force is at work in Augstown, one that shows that some spirits don’t like change...especially when they’ve been around for four hundred years.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find Strong BDSM theme and elements, dubious consent.",
