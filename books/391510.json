  "title": "Terminal Earth",
  "description": "What will you be doing when the shadows fall and the clocks stop? Some of the most talented new voices in short fiction from around the world offer their takes on the end of the planet as we know it. Man-made, geological, biblical, extraterrestrial - the nature of the end of days is imagined in many ways but they all have one thing in common. The final acts of humanity. From lovers watching firestorms in exotic island locales to strangers playing a last game of baseball in abandoned America; through the eyes of sentient robot hunters or businessman suicide bombers; in the strongholds of alien-built bases and across the body-strewn beaches of Asia; looking down from spacecraft and peering up from bunkers, the only certainty is that our Earth is terminal and we will look for a way to continue, somehow, somewhere.",
