  "title": "The Fire This Time: U.S. War Crimes In The Gulf",
  "description": "Based on research conducted in more than 20 countries as well as eyewitness accounts, this book refutes the misinformation disseminated by corporate media and government sources about U.S. involvement in Iraq. Descriptions of war-torn Iraq during and after Operation Desert Storm illustrate the effect war crimes and violations of international law had on the Iraqi people; updated material examines how the people are still being affected more than a decade later. Analysis of the second Bush administration's use of the September 11 events to justify a new war against Iraq is included, as are letters to President Bush and the media.",
