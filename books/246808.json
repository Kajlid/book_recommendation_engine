  "description": "Karis Dunway is looking for a complete overhaul of her life. On the tail-end of a heartbreak, she makes a desperate move and applies to be a part of a matchmaking program for big predator shifters. Colt seems charming and sweet over messages, but meeting the scar-faced man in person sets Karis’s life on a path she can’t escape from. And the more she gets to know her potential future mate, the more she thinks she doesn’t want to escape. But Colt has a nickname that sends up big red flags. His friends and enemies call him the Warmaker, and pretty soon she will figure out exactly what that means. And it could cost her more than she could’ve ever imagined.  Colton Dorset, aka the Peacemaker, aka the Warmaker, is hunting for something to tame his bear. He’s on a tear sabotaging Trigger’s ranch, and now his options are slim: find someone who can settle him down, or leave the life he has worked so hard to build. But Karis isn’t what he imagined, and on top of that, she is hiding an animal that gets his inner grizzly all riled up, instead of settling him. If he could figure out what kind of shifter she is, he might be able to navigate this new arranged match, but Karis keeps him guessing at every turn. And as life at the ranch spirals out of control, he will have to figure out if her animal is a help, or a huge hindrance.   Content Warning: Explicit love scenes, naughty language, and piles of sexy shifter secrets. Intended for mature audiences.",
