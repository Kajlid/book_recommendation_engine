  "description": "In 2112, dystopia is upon us, and the United Nations Authority is trying to stop energy and technology behemoth GIATCOM from destroying society once and for all. At the vortex of this futuristic struggle is twenty-first-century inventor Dr. Ben Richards, who created a way to harness wind power, a clean and renewable energy that could have changed the course of humanity if he hadn't died under mysterious circumstances. The UNA determines that keeping Richards alive in 2017 is key to saving the world from becoming a nuclear wasteland. Meanwhile, GIATCOM is using every method at its disposal, including enhanced humans and android doppelgangers, to thwart that effort and capture Richards for its own purposes, setting up an epic battle between future powers in the past.",
