  "description": "Nightmares Sterling and Ruthie have more things in common than they realize, even though from the outside it doesn’t seem like they do. Blood Sterling is a decorated war hero. Ruthie is an ex-con. Their two worlds should’ve never collided, but fate has a way of turning life in the direction least expected. Now Ruthie has to try to come to terms with the fact that she’s in love with a biker who’s also a decorated Navy SEAL. One who leaves for months at a time with little to no advance warning, taking her heart with him each time he goes. Pain Sterling has a lot of things to overcome in order to have Ruthie, the biggest being her mind. She doesn’t think she’s good enough. He thinks she’s perfect. Now it’s up to him to show her just how right he can be.",
