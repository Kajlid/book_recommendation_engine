  "description": "In the beautiful land of Puget Sound, there are bones beneath our feet...BONES BENEATH OUR FEET is the heartbreaking historical epic story of the conquest of the Natives of Puget Sound by the \"Boston\" tribe. Focused on the period from 1844-1858, BONES BENEATH OUR FEET explodes with political intrigue, stormy intermarriage, tenderness and betrayal, misunderstanding and fear, sudden massacres, greed and sacrifice, trials of law and of spirit, warfare and martial law - all the richness and sorrow of life. This tragic tale resonates powerfully even today: though the gravestone of Chief Leschi, leader of the Native cause, reads: \"LESCHI - Judicially Murdered Feb. 19, 1858,\" in 2004Leschi's name was cleared by a special Historical Court of Inquiry headed by the Chief Justice of the Washington Supreme Court. This is not just a native story. It is the story of all Americans who live on this beautiful land - a story for all who are passionate about tolerance, dignity and liberty.",
