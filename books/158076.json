  "description": "Cecily Thompson swore off men a year ago. There’s only been one man who’s tempted her to end the drought… hockey hottie Jason Campbell. He had her rethinking her stance on dating, but a misunderstanding quickly sent her running in the opposite direction. Jason hasn’t been able to get Cecily off his mind. Not a single night has gone by without dreams of the fiery redhead he met in a bar months ago. When he finally sees her again at a friend’s bachelorette party, he’s ready to do what it takes to keep her right where she belongs… by his side. Checked Into Love can be read as a standalone. Each book in the Bachelorette Party series features a different couple. And if you've read the Blythe College series, you'll see some familiar faces from there, too!",
