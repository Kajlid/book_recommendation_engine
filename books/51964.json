  "description": "Bambang Widjanarko is one of Bung Karno's aide during 1960-1970. He wrote his experience in accompanying Bung Karno everyday in a straightforward manner without losing his sense of humor. People have written Bung Karno as the Proklamator, as a prominent political figure in the national and international world, as the vocal leader of Indonesian people, as a husband or a father. Few see him as human with humor, with tempers, with tears, who cares about his people, as a gallant gentlemen, surrounded by beautiful women but remained lonely inside. (",
