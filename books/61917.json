  "description": "Boss and Her Billionaire: A Love on Deck Book by Michele De WintonCruise director Michaela Western has everything she wants—everything except a sex life. But there are no secrets on cruise ships. She risked her job once for a dalliance with the Captain, and won't do it again for a few minutes of toe-curling pleasure. Until a devilishly handsome new staffer with a body made for sin tempts her to walk on the wild side... Investment billionaire Dylan Johns always gets what he wants. He is used to giving orders—not taking them—until he's forced to go on hiatus from his investment company. To bide his time and carry out an old dream, he takes a job on a cruise ship—and ends up taking orders from his gorgeous, but uptight, new boss. He is determined to loosen her up with a fun onboard romance, but their no-strings fling turns serious and Dylan is forced to confess his lies. When the affair threatens to shatter Michaela's own career dreams, she finds herself caught between the devil and the deep blue sea.",
