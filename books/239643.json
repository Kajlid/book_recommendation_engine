Married a conceited pretty boy, check. Husband decided that our nine year marriage was an open marriage but forgot to tell me, check.

Crazy ex-husband sending gifts, check. For once, I’d like to have a life that is planned out by me and not the people or ordeals that clash with the life I want.ChaseMy life was what I wanted until the night I found out I was a father. Being a foster child doesn’t always give you the warm and fuzzies about having a family. I’m a member of the Southern Chaotic’s MC. All I wanted was to ride with my brothers, drink myself into oblivion and find a warm body of the female variety to spend a few hours with. Now, I have a kid that is anything but the fun loving kid he should be after being abused by his mother. Learning to be a dad and deal with all the conflicts that rattle my kid is frustrating on its own, but add in the curvaceous blonde that has been placed in my path and life is anything but delightful. She tries my patience and unmans me without even knowing.For once, I’d like to have my life back to the way it was with the addition of a healthy and happy kid.This is a standalone book, but to better understand some of the situations you should read the first book Minor Glitches. This book is meant for an audience 18 and older. There are some scenes that may not be suitable for some readers.",
