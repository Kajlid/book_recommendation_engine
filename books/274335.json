  "title": "The Box Top to Life's Puzzle",
  "description": "Imagine trying to put a complex puzzle together, without looking at the final picture. Wouldn't that be a discouraging task? Many people find life to be just like that. Millions of folks are struggling to locate satisfactory answers to life's big questions. They wonder: \"We are born, we live a little while, and then we die. Is that all? What are we humans supposed to get out of life?\" There are many different explanations for our role on earth and how we arrived here, but who is correct? Where is an accurate picture to aid us in completing life's puzzle? Hurst says, \"Nothing is as secure as confidently standing on the solid ground of reality, and nothing is as repulsive as struggling through the swamp of falsehoods and error.\"  \"Just as directions to a destination are made more clear with, for example, a road map, The Box Top to Life's Puzzle is intended to be on the same higher level of clarity; helping readers to piece together the often confusing and contradicting elements of going through life and making choices by seeing the 'big-picture' outlined in front of them within his remarkably laid out pages. With the galley text providing clear quotations, bullet-pointed highlights and a sequential 'flow' of logic cascading from chapter to chapter, readers are proposed a scenario in which they can either accept, argue or disbelieve, but certainly cannot ignore and will be captivated by Hurst's unambiguous presentation.\" - Pacific Book Review",
