She had managed Gregory’s bar for years but she knew he would never sell it to her.  After one giant mistake, he went from bad to worse. As a psychic, she knew it was a downward spiral.  Taking her future in her own hands, she contacts the Alpha in Edenton. He is happy to sell the empty bar no one has the time, nor desire to renovate, much less run.  Their attraction is unexpected and the last thing either want, but they find the only thing they need in each other.  There is just one problem. Slater’s second in command is plotting against him. Liam will use anything to take over as Alpha.  Plenty of werewolves, an old vampire flame, plus a paranoid second, and don’t forget the psychic with a whole lot of attitude.",
