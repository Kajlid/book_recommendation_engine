  "description": "Kirkland  It should have been easy.  When I was told to protect a client who owns an adult website, I imagined a woman who was impossibly tall with legs all the way to her chin. I saw curves that were subtle but perfect for holding onto. I saw a face that was symmetrical, everything proportioned as it should be. I saw a beautiful, sophisticated woman, the kind I loved to welcome into my bed.  Until I met the client herself. Mabel Watson. She was wearing a bulky sweater that was a God-awful blue color with little, black dogs all over it. Her hair was pulled back into pigtails that were then twisted into cutesy little buns. And...she actually had on knee socks!  Ash told me to keep my hands to myself. I sure as hell will...  Mabel  Hypocrisy drives me up a wall, yet I’m probably the biggest hypocrite to ever live. I own one of the leading adult websites in the country, maybe even the world, Cumming’s Treasure. But I don’t know what half the terms used as common language on my website mean. You see, I’m a virgin.  I grew up in a conservative, religious household and getting my mom’s voice out of the back of my head is almost impossible. Until I lay eyes on Kirkland Parish. An operative for Gray Wolf Security, Kirkland is supposed to be my guardian, my shield between my quiet world and the threats that have promised my impeding death.  He’s the one man who can turn my world on its end and make me feel things I didn’t think I was capable of feeling. I’m just not sure if he is capable of love…and I’m definitely not sure that he’d ever be able to love me.  Note: KIRKLAND is the fourth book in the Gray Wolf Security series. You can read it on it's own, but it is highly recommended that you read DONOVAN, DAVID and JOSS too :)",
