I walked to my fate with my eyes wide open. But before you say I deserved whatever happened to me, you should know. I was desperate. I was alone. I was afraid for my life. You would have done the same thing.I thought things couldn’t possibly get any worse.But then, I woke up in darkness, unable to move. There was only one thing I was sure of: I wasn’t alone anymore.And then I heard HIS voice...Pieces of Autumn is a work of dark romance, intended for adult readers who will not be offended by themes of kidnapping, human trafficking, and violence.",
