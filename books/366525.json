  "title": "A Darker Shade of Blue: Stories",
  "description": "John Harvey has been described as the master of British crime fiction: From the mean streets of London to the jazz clubs and clip joints of Soho, this is a world of broken families, revenge killings, and prostitution; drugs, guns, and corruption; a world of overstretched police forces and underpaid detectives; men and women who strive nonetheless for a kind of justice; a world in which everything, even friendship, has a price.Featuring characters like Frank Elder, who tried to turn his back on police work and failed; Jack Kiley, ex-cop and now a London-based PI; and the renowned jazz-loving and much-loved Detective Inspector Charlie Resnick, John Harveyâ€™s finely crafted vignettes perfectly encapsulate life in the badlands of contemporary Britain.",
