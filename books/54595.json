  "description": "Since Tinch Turner lost his wife, he's spent his nights brooding, boozing, and brawling. When one of his escapades lands him in the ER, he finds himself staring up at the beautiful new doctor in town, Addison Spencer-and for the first time in years, he feels a spark. Meanwhile, Reagan Truman finds comfort in the makeshift family she's made in Harmony-and in a new baby, the first born in the Wright Funeral Home in 45 years, proving to everyone that life does go on.",
