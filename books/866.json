  "description": "This National Geographic guide to healing foods and natural, herbal, home remedies is carefully researched by the authors and conveyed in the same friendly and authoritative personality as in their popular call-in radio show. In the book, organized as Q&As between the general public and the Graedons, they report how and why such treatments work and also offer a dozen new recipes for food so good for you, it serves as preventive medicine. This book contains as much information as a voluminous encyclopedia of home remedies, yet it's quick, easy, inviting, and fun to read. Presented alphabetically by ailment and then, within each of those, by food or remedy, the book offers the basics of three standard diets for health, weight control, and fitness, along with a dozen new recipes for preparing food to match the diets. It includes a helpful index and cross-referencing system, making the book both a good shelf reference and an entertaining browse. This book builds on the reputation of The People's Pharmacy and adds the extra value that comes from a partnership with National Geographic.",
