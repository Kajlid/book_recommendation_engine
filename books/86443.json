  "description": "In The Night My Sister Went to Hollywood, Hilda Sheehan offers poems on love, exhaustion, classic movies, supermarket shopping and seals in the bathtub. Her poems 'bristle with the stuff of life'. Her language is 'vigorous and seductively surreal'. 'What kind of a mother writes poems / anyway, and why?' she asks. A mother of five, Hilda Sheehan is that kind of mother. Read this debut poetry collection now: 'time is running out ... Asda will shut soon'. Hilda Sheehan was born in 1967 in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire and grew up in Leyland, Lancashire. She has studied English Literature and Creative Writing at the Open University, while raising five children in Swindon. She lived in Thailand for ten years, and has been a psychiatric nurse and Montessori teacher. She is editor of Domestic Cherry magazine and also works for Swindon Artswords (Literature Development) and the Swindon Festival of Poetry. \"Metaphor is an important gift of the true poet, and Hilda Sheehan has that gift in abundance. 'Oh Asda' is a perfectly pitched, hilarious and disturbingly accurate picture of the way we live.\" William Bedford \"Behind the drama, the irony and touches of humour there is poignancy and often a huge sense of pain. A very original voice is emerging in this remarkable debut collection.\" Myra Schneider \"This is a collection that licks its hanky and scrubs the muck from your chops.\" Martin Malone",
