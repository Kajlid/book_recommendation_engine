  "title": "Sex Lives of the Popes",
  "description": "Prionâ€™s internationally bestselling Sex Lives series presents lighthearted accounts of the sexual escapades of major figures in history, politics, religion, the arts, and film. Irreverent and gossipy, the books are packed with carnal tidbits and eye-opening revelations. In the last 2,000 years the Popes have set the sexual agenda for almost a quarter of the world's population. But while preaching chastity from on high many have practised something altogether more dissolute. The Pope was the most powerful man on earth, and there was no one who could tell him he could not sleep with whoever he wanted. There was a female Pope too, which only became apparent when she gave birth in the street. Added to that there have been pornographers, homosexuals, pedophiles, womanizers, perverts, and good old-fashioned adulterers who have occupied the Holy See. Sex Lives of the Popes is a humorous expose of papal promiscuity.",
