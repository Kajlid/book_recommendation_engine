  "description": "This isn't your typical love story. RJ and Parker come from two completely different lives. RJ is the star wide receiver on their school's football team. Parker is the shy new girl that has encountered too much trauma for a seventeen year old to handle. With an overbearing father, and a secret better left untold, how can they possibly find the love they so desperately deserve? When their worlds collide, it is unlike anything anyone has ever felt. This unlikely pair shows that life is truly what you make of it, and if you just take it day by day, you may find something worth living for.",
