  "description": "In a palace high atop a dark, gloomy mountain lives a blind fairy. Day after day she sits on her golden throne, waiting for someone to visit her. But no one ever comes. The fairy's only company are a brad of wicked dwarves that have tricked her into believing they are her faithful servants. They describe to her how beautiful everything is, but all the while the palace is falling into ruins. One day, the dwarves' cruel tricks drive the blind fairy off the mountain and into a nearby forest. There she meets an old woman and learns the truth. The fairy's eyes are finally opened and she exacts her dreadful revenge -- banishing the evil dwarves forever and restoring her kingdom to its former glory. An original fairy tale that shows how controlling one's destiny can be as simple as opening one's eyes to the power within.",
