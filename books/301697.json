The Fluffy Cupcake’s owner and baker extraordinaire.She regards her fluffiness with disdain. I regard her fluffiness with so damn much desire it’s becoming impossible to hide it day after day.This summer, I’m putting her on notice. She will be my cupcake by July thirteenth. That’s the day she turns the big 3-OH. And OH, am I going to take pleasure in showing her how to live again.Haylee might be my boss, but I know how to stay hands-off in the bakery. I’ll save those hands for the bedroom where they’ll roam over every one of her curves like the beautiful, delectable, sweet cupcake she is. The time has come to teach Haylee there is more to life than baking sweet confections, and I’m the perfect guy for the job.Is it possible?I don’t know, but I have to try because there is no point in staying here if I can’t have my cake and eat it, too.",
