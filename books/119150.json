  "description": "Jack Sloan, an ex-Miami cop turned private detective, is in serious trouble. Down on his luck with a gambling addiction that threatens to shred the new leaf he's turned over, his debts to drug dealers are about to get him the beating of his life, or worse. Life in the concrete jungle isn't easy, and Jack contemplates taking drastic action until a knock on his office door makes all his troubles disappear. He suddenly has a new client with a simple problem and loads of money to resolve it-or that's how it seems. As the nightmare escalates, Jack Sloan finds trouble around every corner of Miami and South Beach. Too late he discovers his client's lies have dug a very deep hole, a hole deep enough to bury them both, and there's only one way out. Someone has to die.",
