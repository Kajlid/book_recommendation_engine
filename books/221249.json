  "title": "A Wide Woman on a Narrow Boat",
  "description": "If you’re thinking of making the life-changing decision of moving from a house to live on a narrow boat it is wise to do your research. Spend time holidaying on a boat, look at as many boats as possible, read the magazines and the books that give an idea of pitfalls and costs and speak to people about the life-style. Either that or just go out and buy a boat. Which is what the author did and then to make life a bit more ‘interesting’ decided to make the maiden voyage alongside another novice her ex-husband. That decision increased the steepness of the learning curve and quickly dissipated the illusion of life aboard a narrow boat being serene and tranquil. But she survived that first journey along the Rivers Nene and the Great Ouse, survived a harsh winter and went on to mostly love but sometimes hate life aboard. This is the story of travelling the water-ways, of towns and countryside, of the wild-life both human and natural. The story of getting it right and getting it wrong and of plans not going to plan.",
