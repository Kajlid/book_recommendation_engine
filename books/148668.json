  "description": "The gripping conclusion to the best-selling Dark Fantasy CRUXIM trilogy...  Vampires and their plague-poxed brethren threaten to overrun the world like a blood-borne wave. At their helm, is Beltran, a Vampire whose malicious nature is as black as his many secrets.  Standing between Beltran and the destruction of all Cruximkind is Amedeo Aeternus—the half-Cruxim hybrid of the prophecy, the Cruor driven on by an unremitting desire for revenge.  Along with the Sphinx Sabine and Cruxim Skylar—whose love for him is as fierce as their warrior natures—and a handful of Cruxim, mortals, and mythological creatures, Amedeo must make a final stand to end the horrors of his past and create a future for all of Cruximkind. But dark secrets still haunt him, too. With a battle so bloody on his hands, will the weight of his own fears crush him beneath the very Crux his people have suffered for millennia?",
