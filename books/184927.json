  "description": "For Australia’s favourite actress, Kate, the price of fame is homesickness. But working on this movie is the chance Kate needs to propel her career into the international arena, even if it means working on the other side of the country away from those she loves most. Five years ago, Gareth wasn’t a rock-God with a million adoring fans. He was just an ordinary guy who fell in love with Kate when she ordered a sandwich. Who does that, right? For Kate, Gareth will do anything to show how much he loves her. Tonight he’s organised a special surprise she’ll never forget.",
