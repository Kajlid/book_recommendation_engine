  "description": "Angelica Rose's mom always told her that desperate times called for desperate measures. Walking into a strip club and asking for an audition certainly qualifies as desperate, but when her mom's battle with cancer ends months before Angelica is due to start college, she doesn't feel like she has much choice. The moment Morgan Cadwell sees her on his stage, he knows she's the one woman who could make him break all the rules. There's no way he's going to let Angelica dance for other men, so he hires her as his live-in personal assistant instead.Morgan's offer lets Angelica keep her clothes on...but little does she know that, in the end, he'll make her bare her soul instead.",
