The magical creatures of the Other Realm are falling sick – even the supposedly immortal ones. The illness is striking two by two like a plague filled Noah’s Ark. The mermen asked for help first, but it turns out they’re just the tip of the iceberg.Gato and I need to find the source of the sickness, to stop it spreading and to find the antidote. Emory’s adoptive parents are two of the ones that have fallen sick and I can’t watch him lose his pseudo parents when I’ve already lost mine. I’ll do anything to save the stricken victims - even if it means working with my parents’ own killer…I know this much, the illness isn’t natural, and whoever is behind this has nothing but sinister intentions.I need to find the perpetrator.I need to find the cure.And I need to work out how I feel about Emory. I don’t know which task will be harder…",
