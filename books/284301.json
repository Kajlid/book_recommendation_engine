  "description": "“You need to be careful.” The day the manager of my rock band said that changed my life. As Brooklyn Dawn’s newest member on probation, I didn’t think I’d have to worry about anything but rocking hard. I didn’t expect my tumultuous past to come out. I definitely didn’t expect us to be in danger. I never considered I’d need a bodyguard.  Or that my best friend in the band, our drummer, Cooper, an ex-Ranger, would vie for that role—along with a much more personal one as my guy. Forget the bodyguard my label hired. Cooper is determined to take care of me. Onstage and off. In bed and out.When friends become foes and strangers become threats, trust is all I have left. But falling in love with the last man I ever expected to is just one more complication while I’m trying to stay drama free and most importantly, alive.Author’s note: Play Mine is a standalone friends to lovers rock star romance. The Brooklyn Dawn series has a suspense arc that goes through the entire series. It will be resolved in the final book. Play Mine ends in a happily ever after with no cliffhanger for the main couple.     \n★ Series Reading Order ★\n  Lost in Oblivion Seduced (prequel) Rocked Rock, Rattle and Roll Twisted Untwisted Destroyed Consumed Committed Shattered Fused Owned Merry Oblivion Paradise in Oblivion   Winchester Falls Trilogy Anything But Mine Bulletproof Weeks Edge of Forever  Found in Oblivion Bedded Bliss Triple Trouble Dirty Duet Lost Lyric Perfect Pitch Raw Rhythm Finding Forever  Hammered Manaconda Manhandled Manipulated Maneuvered  Rock Revenge Trilogy Rock Revenge Rock Reclaimed Rock Redemption  Brooklyn Dawn Play Dirty Play Fast Play Mine",
