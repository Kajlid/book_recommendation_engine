That’s what comes to mind for most people when they think of BDSM.When you peel back the trappings, silence the heavy, throbbing bass line of the club music, what’s left are the beating hearts, the gasps, the exhaled breaths. Heels on a tile floor, or the rustle of fabric.Sometimes, the best parts of BDSM lay nestled among the softer sounds of play.Related Books: Most of the vignettes feature characters who’ve already had feature books.",
