Our world is no longer the same, and neither is Aon.I learned his dark secret the moment the sun peeked over the horizon for the first time in thousands of years. Every king and queen in Under used to be human—even Edu. But not Aon. He’s the only soul ever made by the Ancients, their firstborn and only son.Now that they’ve been set free, he has no choice but to obey his makers and do what he has been created to do. Rule. Aon, the King of Shadows, was a madman and a warlock. But he no longer exists. In his place is someone—something—far worse. The King of All.",
