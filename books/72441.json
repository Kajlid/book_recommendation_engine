  "description": "A timeless classic, beautifully rejacketed.      Test your knowledge of the book and its characters, and learn more about water dowsing!     Reunited for the summer, the Swallows and Amazons with Dick and Dorothea launch a prospecting expedition to find the lost gold mine of the high hills above the lake. But the mining camp runs into all sorts of not only the danger of fire in the drought ridden countryside but also scary encounters with unsafe tunnels. Worst of all is the sinister Squashy Hat, who appears to be a rival prospector and who's certainly a spy -- how can they keep working without him discovering what they've found?",
