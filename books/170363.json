  "description": "Bad little rich kids get hidden away, forgotten stains on daddy's country club membership. So where do the rich kids go when they've gone bad? Why, the prestigious Hollyfield Academy of course! But now something terrible is brewing at Hollyfield. Something strange is trying to get to the younger, silver spooned elite. Behind the manicured lawns and guards with tasers, there is a new evil that is waiting to take hold. Imagine the power you would have if you could control some of the richest kids in the world. Fallon Malone knows being sent to Hollyfield Academy won't be a walk in the park but it won't be as bad as everyone says, right? When she starts to forget things and her roommate goes missing, she wonders if her new boyfriend and his friends have anything to do with it. Something is wrong at Hollyfield and once Fallon figures it out, it's up to her to stop it. But if she thinks her year can't get any worse, than she is wrong, dead wrong.",
