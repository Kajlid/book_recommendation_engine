  "title": "Is Religion Dangerous?",
  "description": "Holy wars, crusades, discrimination, intolerance -- these by-products of religion are all that many contemporary commentators can see. But is religion dangerous? Is it a force for evil or even \"the root of all evil,\" as Richard Dawkins has claimed? Does religion lead to terrorism and violence? Are religious beliefs irrational and immoral? One of Britain's foremost philosopher-theologians, Keith Ward here addresses these concerns with intelligence and insight. Without religion, he argues, the human race would be considerably worse off and have little hope for the future. Thought-provoking and compellingly argued, Is Religion Dangerous? is a trenchant response to today's critics of religion.",
