  "description": "Thick yet see-through. Tall, majestic and unbreakable, an endless wall of ice stood before a young man by the name of Azuris Nex who has always believed that he is fated to live a lonesome life. Thanks to his quiet and icy way of conducting himself, it is next to impossible for him to attract people or to be able to reach out to them. Being the last ice dragon in existence, he has no one in the world that can understand his situation especially since he is incapable of controlling the powers contained in his dragon self. So he simply accepts his cruel life of loneliness. But one day, after being surrounded by vicious wolves and unable to turn back into his dragon form, he is saved by a hunter named Robin Foremoon. Stunned by Azuris' icy beauty and his cool demeanor, Robin becomes persistent and stays by his side, even when it is revealed to him that Azuris is not a normal human. Will the young dragon halfling allow this determined hunter to melt his icy heart or will he continue to isolate himself?
