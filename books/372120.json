  "description": "Book two in the Vampires & Mages & Weres, Oh My! Series Just a demon's luck. Seth finally finds the perfect house...and it comes with an angel. The last thing that demon Seth expects to come across while househunting is an injured angel...especially one who has no idea he's anything but human. Every instinct in him wants to stay far away, but Kyrian is being targeted by another demon, and Seth reluctantly finds himself playing guardian to the irresistible male. Kyrian has no idea what is 'haunting' his house, but after he breaks his ankle being shoved off the deck, he's had enough. Strong, handsome Seth is a godsend, making him feel safe and secure. But he alludes to secrets that will test everything Kyrian believes...and turns the tables on just who needs protecting. Reader Advisory: This book is part of a series, but can easily be read as a standalone book.",
