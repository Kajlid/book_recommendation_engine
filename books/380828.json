  "title": "Pictor's Metamorphoses and Other Fantasies",
  "description": "Selected and with an Introduction by Theodore Ziolkowski In the spring of 1922, several months after completing Siddhartha, Hermann Hesse wrote a fairy tale that was also a love story, inspired by the woman who was to become his second wife. That story, \"Pictor's Metamorphoses,\" is presented here along with a half century of Hesse's other short writings. Inspired by the Arabian Nights and the tales of the Brothers Grimm, these nineteen stories display the full range of Hesse's lifetime fascination with fantasy--as dream, fairy tale, folktale, satire, and allegory.",
