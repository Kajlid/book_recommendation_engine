  "description": "BLYTHE SPIRITHer trip in time to 1785 Scotland was supposed to be a vacation, so why did Blythe feel that her stay at the MacKenzie pile of stones had her imagination working overtime, making helpful suggestions about every bump in the night: demon, considers you yummy take-out; really ugly gargoyle, wants to sleep in your bed.So she wasn't at all surprised when the first hunk she met turned out to be Mr. Dark-Evil-and-Deadly himself, an honest-to-goodness vampire. His voice was a tempting way above 88.6 degrees, but when Darach whispered, \"To waste a neck such as yours would be a terrible thing,\" she decided his pillow talk left a lot to be desired.Dangerous? You bet. To die for? Definately. Soul mate? Just wait and see.",
