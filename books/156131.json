She cannot dismiss the handsome face, the haunting eyes, or the feelings that are stirring deep inside. It's time to seek answers. Compelled to return to Africa, she is convinced that there is more to the wild animal attack that left her orphaned as a child.Driven to protect the young woman from a shared past that only he remembers, Ashling risks revealing his nature as he follows Josephine across continents. For his entire life, time has had no meaning; with her decision to return to Africa, time is of the essence.Drawn together by events neither can control, as well a deep connection, Ashling will discover if his stone heart will beat again, or slowly be torn apart.",
