  "title": "All the Best People",
  "description": "Sloan Wilson has written a chronicle of two members of the upper-middle class, Dana Campbell and Caroline Stauffer, whose parents are part owners of a fashionable resort hotel on Lake George in the 1920s and 1930s. As he did in THE MAN IN THE GRAY FLANNEL SUIT, Wilson again explores the sensitive underbelly of American success. His descriptions of the frustrations of sex, from teenage petting to the vicissitudes of the marriage bed, are lush as well as relevant.",
