  "description": "Colton Tremblay won a Stanley Cup with his hometown Montreal Canadiens, but his bad-boy reputation earned him a ticket out of town, traded to the expansion San Antonio Generals. This French-Canadian has no idea what to expect from the land of tacos and Mariachi bands, but he quickly learns that Texas is full of beautiful women, and the one who catches his eye first is no puck bunny. The daughter of Mexican immigrants, Maya Dominguez has worked hard for everything. Now she’s landed her dream job as a beat reporter for San Antonio’s new NHL franchise. As a female reporter in a male-dominated business, Maya knows she has to be at the top of her game. She can’t afford any distractions, especially not from the players she’s assigned to report on. When Colton asks Maya to help him get to know his new city, she’s determined to keep things strictly business, but Colton is used to getting what he wants. Can he persuade Maya that this time, he is playing for keeps, and if he does, what does it mean for her job?",
