  "description": "\"I see Gondwane as it shall be in the untold ages of dim futurity, near the time when the Earth shall be man s habitation no more, and the great night shall enfold all, and naught but the cold stars shall reign. The first sign of the end ye shall see in the heavens, for Lo! the moon is falling, falling. And there shall come a man into the lands, a man not like other men, but sent from Galendil . . .\" The name of the man is Ganelon Silverman and this is the first of the classic science fantasy adventure series by Lin Carter!",
