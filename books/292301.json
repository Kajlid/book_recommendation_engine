Too embarrassed to confront Julie, Yvonne flees with barely a word.Baffled as to what is bothering Yvonne, and hating the distance between them, Julie sits her wife down and finally gets to the bottom of things. A romantic night away, soaking in a hot tub, takes them down a path neither of them ever could’ve imagined.Will exploring their options draw them closer together or make them question everything they know?",
