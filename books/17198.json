  "description": "A failed suicide attempt unites the last living minotaur, Evander, with the eminent sorcerer and perfidious rake Scammander, who might have lost all of his magical knowledge or might have just stashed it elsewhere to make room for his biggest plot yet.Bonded by suffering and a special antipathy for humanity, the two set out to do what all villains dream of: destroying the world, one civilization at a time.But how can two creatures annihilate the world?This is the pathos-filled recollection of the Beginning of the End, narrated, against his will, by the murderer Evander. It is by turns pithy, lyrical, and harrowing, and best when read in solitude, perhaps under a full moon.Kindly “eliciting” the tale from Evander is Tristan D’Mure, who loved the world the way it was, and will do all that he must to make sure he obtains the truth of how the world was nearly destroyed—and find Scammander, who is once again mysteriously missing…Pars Prima is a blood soaked novella of 21,000 words, constituting a grizzly, inclement prelude which is to be succeeded by two novel length entries.",
