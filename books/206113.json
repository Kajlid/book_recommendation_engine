  "description": "“AN EXPLOSIVE START TO AN MC ROMANCE SAGA THAT WILL (FINALLY!) SATISFY YOUR SOA FIX!”\n - Romance Readers Unlimited  His name is Damian Cross.  Son of the president of the most notorious motorcycle club in Southern California.  People feared him. Grown men peed in their pants at the mere mention of his name. Locals have labeled him as the Demon of Rogue Town, an angel of terror and darkness, a harbinger of death. His ways were savage. He punished without mercy and killed without remorse. He wasn’t the bad boy that teenage girls fantasized about. He was an evil man... the wickedest of the wicked... and his devilry had no limits.  But there’s another side of him, beyond his tough exterior and the life of decadence he lived and the frightening stories that accompanied the patches on his kutte... a side that was capable of love and compassion, a side that was caring and comforting, a side that was passionate and protective.  I know this to be true because we were lovers once.  But that was years ago.  For reasons I didn’t tell him, I left and he never heard from me again.  But now, I have returned, though rekindling the fire we once shared was farthest from my mind. I came back for one purpose, and one purpose only... to tell him about a matter that could very well change the life he knew.  What I didn’t expect is the discovery of how much I still longed for his touch... how much I still pined for his kiss... how much I still craved for the thrill that only he could provide... how much I still loved him.  And I knew...  I knew that if we got back together again, I would just be booking a one-way ticket to damnation.  For we are two souls in desperate need of each other... in a town that is surrounded by shadows... a town of sinners and monsters... a town of secrets and lies... a town of blood and death... a town of gods and outlaws...  A town of rogues.",
