  "description": "They relate how Dom Manuel that was the high Count of Poictesme, & was everywhere esteemed the most lucky & the least scrupulous rogue of his times, had disappeared out of his castle at Storisende, without any reason or forewarning, upon the feast day of St Michael & All the Angels. They tell of the confusion & dismay which arose in Dom Manuel's lands when it was known that Manuel the Redeemer--thus named because he had redeemed Poictesme from the Northmen, thru the aid of Miramon Lluagor, with a great & sanguinary magic, was now gone, quite inexplicably out of these lands.",
