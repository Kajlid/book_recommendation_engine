  "description": "Catherine has enough problems in her life without adding more. She lives in a town full of Wiccan witches, where she holds absolutely no powers. Her best friends seem to take all the best men, and her work colleague has a major crush on her. Other than that, life is pretty sweet.Until a dagger appears in her bedroom, bringing back frightening memories of a past both her mother and herself left behind long ago. The ghosts of the past refuse to stay buried however, and they threaten to swallow both of them whole, closing in on them...And then the charming, roguish Mr Rouquette appears. He is gorgeous, kind, and clever...so why does it feel as though there is something not quite right about him? And can Catherine trust him at all when her world begins to crumble around her feet, and he seems to be at the centre of it all?...",
