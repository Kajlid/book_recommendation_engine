  "description": "Colin Perth wants nothing more than to be a normal kid, with normal parents and an average, mundane life. Unfortunately, his mother has different plans for him. An excerpt from A Mother’s Love:“He went home and took the blankets and sheets off his bed. He set up the tripod and camcorder and went into his trunk for a few special items. He WAS really looking forward to tonight, but not for the obvious reasons. Tonight he was going to make Sandy pay for making a fool out of him. Erin wasn’t getting off either, but he would have to wait. Sandy was the one who swore to his face that she wouldn’t cheat on him and that she wasn’t interested in Erin. Lying bitch. His mother was right after all.”",
