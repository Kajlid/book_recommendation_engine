  "description": "A new book in the world of Cindy Eller. While this book takes place in the same world as Cindy Eller, no knowledge of any other series is necessary to enjoy this book. This books is standalone and does not have a cliff-hanger. Included at the end is a short story previously published in the author's First Kisses, Near Misses collection.  Iris Keshet has spent the last few years of her life working in her sister's bakery, happy to just drift along in her life. All of that is about to change.  Getting fired from Cindy's bakery feels like the worst thing that could have happened to Iris, but she finds herself drawn into a project investigating the lost art hidden for centuries within the restored Great Library in Magic Central. With her talents and history in art, the project seems like the perfect match. Iris's own special gift for bringing art literally to life, if temporarily, is a great asset to the project.  But, Iris soon discovers that, as with art, life often has more to it than what is seen at first glance. There are some who will stop at nothing to fight the spread of Magic through the 'Ordinary' world and any who represent Magic and all its gifts.",
