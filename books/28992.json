  "description": "A natural follower meets a natural leader. The only question now is who will have the biggest influence over the other? Elijah is a natural follower, but he’s never thought too much about the way he lets his cousin talk him into all kinds of crazy schemes. What he has thought about, a lot, is the fact that he’s pretty sure he’s not entirely straight. When a drunken game of truth and dare sees Elijah’s cousin, Louisa, find out he might be gay, her influence leads him straight into his favourite sexual fantasy.  Aaron has always believed that he’s a much harder man to manipulate, but that doesn’t mean he’s never been hurt, or that past pain doesn’t influence his actions in the present. Aaron might be dominant to the core, but that doesn’t mean it’s all easy for him. As meddling family members, former submissives and large amounts of alcohol all come to bear on them, Elijah and Aaron are about to find out just what sort of influence they are destined to have on each other.",
