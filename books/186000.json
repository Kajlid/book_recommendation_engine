  "description": "“Love doesn’t follow Einstein’s rules of the universe. It doesn’t march across a linear plane of time. No. Love is other worldly. It doesn’t believe in rules and timelines and logical next steps. My brain kept reasoning with my heart that we couldn’t feel this strongly about Graham Jackson, the guy that I only dated for two weeks, but what I’ve come to learn about the heart is that it doesn’t listen to logic.”  Rachael Early, the first female White House Chief of Staff, is facing the scariest chapter of her life – the unknown. After discovering that Graham Jackson is one of the Sons of Liberty – a political talk show that is shaking up Washington – she ends their two week, whirlwind love affair. However, fate has other plans, forcing them back into each other’s lives. Rachael and Graham begin their journey to overcome the hurt they’ve caused each other and move forward while struggling to find balance in their new careers. In the conclusion to Rachael and Graham’s story, their relationship is tested in ways that they could have never imagined. In the end, does love really conquer all?",
