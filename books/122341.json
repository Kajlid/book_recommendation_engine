  "description": "\"Wizdom didn’t know dragons really existed. He’s never ridden a white woolly mammoth or flown on a griffin. He’s never known a real king or a princess or been friends with a goblin. Wizdom’s never seen elves that glow blue all the time. All he’s ever known are his adoptive mother and his aunt Kayden. One day he finds himself in a secret world, face to face with dragons and fire monsters. He meets an interesting girl, Pandora, who he learns is no ordinary girl, just as he is no ordinary boy. Wizdom soon finds himself on a magical journey full of secrets, sorcery, danger and evil. He fights many fierce battles and faces certain death as his quest leads him on an adventure like never before as he discovers his true identity…or does he?\"",
