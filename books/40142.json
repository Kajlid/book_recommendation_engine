  "title": "Bystander: A Tale of The End of the World as SHE Knew It",
  "description": "Bystander, NY was the kind of place that people only found by accident after making a few wrong turns on their way to someplace more important. There were no highways or major thoroughfares, just a few crooked roads that eventually led down to the village square. It looked like a place that time forgot; with Tarlick's General Store, a non-denominational church, the grange, a local bar called the Beer & Jeer, the volunteer fire station and an old brick horse trough planted with annual flowers being the only highlights of the town's center. For a city-bred woman like Ellie Richardson, Bystander was the perfect place to start over after the death of her husband. Self-discovery paves the way for a little romance, a lot of healing and business success in her newly adopted small town. Unfortunately, the calm of small town living will be shattered when terrorist attacks force everyone to rely upon each other for day-to-day survival.",
