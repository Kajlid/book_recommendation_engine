Meanwhile, the team is sent to Europe, as exchange students to track down Zarkov.Little does Murry know that Zarkov, now critically injured from their last encounter, is tracking her as well. While in England, she discovers an old friend of her grandfathers, as well as an old enemy; the man who was responsible for his murder.She also learns that Zarkov has a plan to destroy the government of Great Britain and that someone in the CIA might be involved. Who, if anyone, can she trust, especially when she becomes trapped in East Berlin, with the only hope of escape being a ghost from her own past? Can Murry Peterson survive her encounter behind the Iron Curtain?",
