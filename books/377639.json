  "description": "The residents of Alaska’s largest national park are stunned by the death of one of their oldest members, eighty-seven-year-old Sam Dementieff…even investigator Kate Shugak. Sam, a lifelong resident, was dubbed the “father” of all of the Park rats—even though he had no children of his own. Kate, his niece, is surprised to discover that in his will he’s left her everything, including a letter instructing her simply to, “find my father.” In the three days after Kate begins her search through Sam’s background, she gets threatened—and worse. Kate struggles to fulfill Sam’s last wish without losing her own life to the people who are following her every move. Long-lost family secrets and fatal consequences are interwoven with the epic history of an unforgiving land.",
