  "description": "The biggest mistake he’s ever made could get him killed.  The Skulls have a set of rules, and Nash has broken one of them. He’s using drugs. Since Sophia rejected him, Nash has been spiraling out of control. When he puts Eva’s life in danger it’s up to Nash’s brother Lash to save him from himself.  Sophia never realized the protection The Skulls provided her until she was attacked. Lash saved her but with an ultimatum. She helps save his brother, or he makes it known she’s not under Skull protection.  Sophia’s feelings for Nash have always been her weakness. As she keeps her word to his brother, trying to help Nash overcome his addiction, the two of them grow closer through his pain, and Sophia realizes she cannot run any longer.  However, The Skulls’ enemies are numerous, and Nash’s careless behavior has exposed the whole club to danger. Someone is plotting against the club in the hope to take control of the town, and they’re going to start with Nash. Can he stay strong as his life and that of his woman are endangered, or will he relapse into the drugs?",
