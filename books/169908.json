Determined to make it back to the princess he loves, he escapes into the wilderness where he discovers the lair of a dragon.Grandious, the dragon, doesn't care about anything besides himself. He wants to be left alone with his treasure. However, there is something about Thaddeus that has him entranced. He finds himself opening his home and his heart to the little cat.
