  "title": "To Die For",
  "description": "Determined to realize her dream of television glory, a fame-obsessed weather reporter conspires to murder her husband Local weather reporter Suzanne Maretto wants nothing more than to transcend life at her suburban television news station. Unrelentingly perky and ruthlessly ambitious, she dreams of national stardom. And she believes that in order to realize her destiny, she must get rid of her husband, whose buttoned-up demeanor has grown tiring and whose tragic death would win her the sympathy of millions of television viewers. With the help of three easily manipulated teenagers—one of them her lover—Suzanne sets her murderous plan in motion . . . Told through a series of recollections by twenty-four characters, To Die For, which inspired a movie of the same name starring Nicole Kidman and directed by Gus Van Sant, is a razor-sharp satire of a celebrity-obsessed culture, and the story of one woman’s all-consuming pursuit of fame. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Joyce Maynard including rare photos from the author’s personal collection.",
