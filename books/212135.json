Kenzie is a talented graffiti artist with a secret identity, known only by his tag, a pair of handcuffs. He spray-paints a BDSM scene on a wall at the side of Steele’s workshop, hoping Steele will see the security footage and track him down. However, Steele is working late and catches him in the act.Steele recognizes Kenzie from the club and demands twenty-four hours of sexual slavery as penance for the graffiti.
