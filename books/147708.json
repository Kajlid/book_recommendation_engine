  "description": "God speaks to me through the radio. Right. That’s crazy. I know. Only sometimes I don’t. Sometimes I think I have an Angel who plays songs for me whenever life gets rough, songs with the perfect lyrics to get me through the day. Luckily, my life’s been pretty easy—or at least it was until the boy with the sword tattoo showed up on my bus. He was aloof around everyone else, but around me he turned on this shy grin that just kept me guessing. And despite the rumors about drugs and violence in his past, that grin drew me in. That’s when everything went to Hell.Because I don’t just have Angels populating my thoughts, I have demons too. They live in my dreams. I thought they would stay there until I watched the life of the boy with the tattoo blow up in his face. Now I think they’re hunting him. And if that’s true, his only chance for escape lies in facing his past—a past he’ll do almost anything to forget.I guess it’s up to my Angel and me to help him remember.",
