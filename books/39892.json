  "title": "All the Rage: A Riotous Romp Through Rock & Roll History",
  "description": "A riotously funny, fiercely energetic romp, this no-holds-barred autobiography takes readers through the highs and lows of an extraordinary career, chronicling nearly four decades of dynamic music history. Written by an enthralling raconteur, the book covers the sixties' British R&B explosion and Mac's work with the Small Faces; the seventies' loose and boozy rave-ups of The Faces with Rod Stewart; the eighties, playing keyboards with Bonnie Raitt, Bob Dylan, and The Rolling Stones; and the nineties, tickling the ivories behind Melissa Etheridge, Bruce Springsteen, Buddy Guy, and Billy Bragg. In colorful descriptions of life on and off the road, including moving notes about the deaths of friends Ian Stewart, Steve Marriott, Keith Moon, and Ronnie Lane, McLagan sets a standard for compelling, behind-the-scenes storytelling that other musicians will be hard pressed to match.",
