  "description": "Excerpt from The Zzg or Zig Zag Guide Round and About the Bold and Beautiful Kentish CoastWell - informed persons familiar with the geographi cal situation of Calais and Boulogne are, generally speaking, under a strange misapprehension as to the relative positions of Margate and Ramsgate, which are not Siamese Twins. They are not in separable as were Castor and Pollux, Balbus and Caius, Box and Cox, William and Mary, Hero and Leander, and other historical characters usually bracketed. Nor are they by any' manner of means alike, as were the Two Dromios: on the contrary, so distinctive are their character istics, that it would be ordinarily impossible for the least keen observer when in Margate to think he was in Ramsgate, or vice versa.About the PublisherForgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.
