  "description": "A little way in the future, time is distorting. Time Tornadoes are causing havoc. People are whirled out of their own time, never to return, and a Woolly Mammoth has been seen on the banks of the River Thames. But time is big business, and whoever gets control of time controls life as we know it! In a house called Tanglewreck lives a girl called Silver and her aunt Mrs Rokabye. Unbeknown to Silver there is a family treasure in the form of a 17th-century watch called the Timekeeper, and this treasure holds the key to the mysterious and frightening changes in time. When the sinister Abel Drinkwater arrives at Tanglewreck in search of the watch, Silver realises she must embark on a journey through Time and Space to find the Timekeeper.",
