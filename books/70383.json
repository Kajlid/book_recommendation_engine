But he does know that Thor is lying to him, and Odin is up to something wicked.Meanwhile on Earth, Amy Lewis just wants to get home in time for dinner, but she's on a collision course with chaos, and an old evil is awakening that threatens all the Nine Realms. If Loki remembers exactly what Odin is hiding and manages not to be too distracted by Earthly gadgets, Amy’s boobs, or three day benders, he might be sly enough to stop it – and extract some vengeance at the same time.This first volume of \"I Bring the Fire\" is for anyone who suspects chaos and mischief makers might have their own redeeming qualities, and anyone who just wants a good fantasy romp through modern Earth, ancient Asgard, and beyond!",
