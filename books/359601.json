  "description": "*BONUS! Now includes the short story, Falling Star's Epilogue Starting Forever at the end of the file.* Adam has set his sights on florist Jade Graham. She’s not the kind of woman he’s used to, she’s too smart to play the role of arm-candy. Adam is going to have to keep his celebrity status a secret for as long as possible, because what woman in her right mind would get attached to a playboy without a conscience? Jade Graham is going to be one tough case, but she seems hell bent on proving that there is more than one way for a star to fall. 55,000 words, 3390 Kindle Locations",
