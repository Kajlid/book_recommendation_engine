  "description": "Seventeen days until Margot's seventh birthday- and then it will be Bailey's birthday, too! It's the Great Birthday Month! And birthdays mean presents- or so Bailey has heard. \"I'm sure you'll get lots,\" says Claudia. Her owner Nicki always gets FABULOUS gifts. \"We must have to be good...,\" says Margot, \"before we get all our presents, too.\" And Bailey is good. He doesn't bark. He doesn't jump on Aunt Syl. He doesn't sleep on the sofa. Bailey is actually CALM! \"Here come the presents, \" thinks the hopeful dalmatian. Bailey will soon discover that the best presents are not gift-wrapped. Set in New York City, author Elizabeth Happy's story of great expectations presents a dog's eye view of big city life- from comfortable brownstones to soaring skyscrapers, from the din of early morning garbage collectors to the clamor of evening rush hour, form Central Park to the Staten Island Ferry. Illustrator Andra Chase has captured the whole scene in vivid watercolors. And her depictions of the eager-to-please Bailey and his muddled sidekick Claudia are heart stealing. Bailey's Birthday is \"a kiss and a bandanna\" and a gift of love to readers of all ages.",
