  "title": "Come As You Are: The Story of Nirvana",
  "description": "Nirvana came out of nowhere in 1991 to sell nearly nine million copies of the landmark album Nevermind, whose thunderous sound and indelible melodies embodied the confusion, frustration and passion of the emerging Generation X.As one of the greatest music biographies of all time, Come As You Are is the up-close, intimate story of Nirvana, with exclusive in-depth interviews with band members Kurt Cobain, Chris Novoselic and Dave Grohl, as well as friends, relatives, former band members and associates. A final chapter details the last year of Kurt Cobain's life.From their early days in rural Aberdeen, Washington, to their domination of the world music scene in the early 90's, Come As You Are tells the Nirvana story as no other book does, candidly and first-hand: the allegations of heroin use; the soul-crushing pressures of sudden success; the burden of their unasked-for role as spokesman for a generation; and the tragic spiral that culminated in Kurt Cobain's death in April 1994.With close analyses of every song on each of the band's three major albums, a comprehensive discography and more than one hundred rare and never before-seen photographs, posters and original lyric sheets, Come As You Are is by far the most intimate look ever at one of rock's most influential and significant groups.",
