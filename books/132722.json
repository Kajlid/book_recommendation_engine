  "description": "When a swimming pool salesman’s client drops dead during his presentation, he unwittingly becomes the recipient of information only one person on Earth is privy to – the knowledge of what happens to people when they die. Greg Simon is a regular guy. A widower with two daughters away at college, his days consist of time spent at the office, evenings of TV and a couple of beers. His uncomplicated life is rudely interrupted when he begins hearing voices and develops an elevated level of consciousness he can’t comprehend. His frustration mounts until he realizes he has inherited a unique ability to help others, and makes it his goal to do so. Nothing is standing in his way – except for a team of FBI agents who specialize in national security issues. Greg’s newfound knowledge, if unleashed on the public, would give life a new meaning, and change the world forever. With a self-deprecating sense of humor, and an optimistic eye, Simon does everything an untested hero can to fight off the government and bring comfort to those in need. If he’s not successful, his battle will have to be waged by his successor – the next Knowledge Holder.",
