  "title": "Day of the Dead",
  "description": "The Day of the Dead is a special holiday celebrated in many places like Mexico and parts of the United States to honor people who have died. It's celebrated between October 31 and November 2 and there are costumes, but no one says, \"trick-or-treat.\" There is candy, but this candy is shaped like coffins and skeletons. People picnic in cemeteries, go to parades, set off fireworks, and bake special breads and meals to remember friends and family members who have died. Encourage understanding of diverse cultures. Featuring full-page illustrations, these beautiful editions look at the history and customs associated with various holidays and present early readers with high-interest offerings.",
