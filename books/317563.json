But our society (and our relatives specially) only acknowledge percentages that are above 99.9%. Students who fail to meet the astronomical expectations often face self doubt and suffer depression. While the parents apply pressure to prepare their children for the 'wild competitive west' out there, it is this enormous pressure which not only hinders our growth and learning but leads to increased stress and anxiety.About the author: Jaikirat Singh Sethi, now in 11th Grade, has been through the same pressures and has seen the same up close. Having seen a few close friends suffer from chronic depression, he writes about his journey from 9th Grade to 11th grade and wants every student out there to know that it is ok to be average ! You don to have to be depressed if you do not score the stratospheric percentages. His journey should make you feel -\"it is ok to be normal\"!",
