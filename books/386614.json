  "title": "This Enchanted Land: The Saga of Dane Wulfdin",
  "description": "Wales was the only land to totally repulse the invasions of the fierce Vikings. Dane Wulfdin finds out why when he and his crew attack Rhodri Mawr's shire to seek revenge on the Welsh leader for humiliating them in Anglesey. Rhodri's soldiers promptly ambush the Norsemen, and Dane becomes stranded in a foreboding realm filled with monsters, mayhem, and magic. The warrior makes a narrow escape from his human pursuers only to be bewitched by wicked Queen Shera. During his strange odyssey, Wulfdin also battles a dragon, a kraken, and giants straight from one's worst nightmare. After witnessing a harrowing Druid ceremony, Dane finally cries in frustration, \"Doesn't anyone live in this enchanted land that isn't huge, evil, or bellicose?\" The answer is a resounding \"No!\" in the first collaboration between authors William P. Robertson of the United States and Fiona Ingram of South Africa. What THIS ENCHANTED LAND does provide is plenty of sorcery, seduction, and intense action. David Cox's detailed period art and Robertson's stark, image-laden poetry add another aesthetic dimension to an already riveting adventure of the Dark Ages.",
