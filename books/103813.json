  "description": "Welcome to Rest Inn Peace -where life begins at the end of the road and murder is sometimes funny. Cobra Carpenter has trouble with substance abuse, staying out of jail, and seeing things that aren’t really there. A big city boy, he’s been released from prison (again) just in time to inherit his dead grandmother’s inn on the outskirts of Yellowstone National Park. He has also just been granted full custody of his twelve year old kid, Zoe, whose only non-imaginary friend is a kleptomaniac hypochondriac who lives in fear of rabies and bacon.Zoe inherited Cobra’s flair for seeing things that aren’t really there, and he is none too happy about it. To complicate matters, the inn’s manager, Regina Oxford, insists those imaginary things that aren’t really there…are really there; every dragon, fairy, zombie, talking animal, ghost, and even the creepy winking statue. This includes the imaginary creatures that live at Rest Inn Peace, and the ones who rent rooms by the night. Cobra hates the crazy inn and plans an escape. But where will he and Zoe go? The world outside is crumbling; people are hungry and desperate. Here in rural Broken Spur Valley, food is plentiful, water is fresh, and life is good. Well, it’s mostly good. There are, of course, those pesky murders in town…that started the day Cobra and Zoe moved in. Pull off your shoes and traipse through a land of fairies, dragons, trolls, and an assortment of misfit humans. Rest Inn Peace is a charming bed and breakfast nestled in a magical grove, next to a cemetery packed with brain-starved zombies. Oh, and a word to the wise; beware of cross-eyed flying lizards with an addiction to eggplant and cauliflower.",
