  "description": "Dr. Roman Micheli runs his laser clinic like a discreet Swiss bank. His World Health doctor wife Isabel devotes herself to curing leprosy around the globe. Devoted professionals, they have no time for children and hardly enough for each other. Then the Michelis’ complacent partnership starts to unravel. An American violinist sweeps onto a Geneva concert stage to weave a musical spell over her jaded audience. Ever the doctor, Roman strains from his seat to diagnose the purple birthmark marring the virtuoso's beauty. Could the science of his lasers transform this young musician’s future?  Or will her art threaten his? In this love triangle of serial misunderstandings, lost opportunities, well-meant bungling, misplaced passions and fatal cultural confusion—no one foresees the unexpected consequences that lurk under ‘the skin’ of his or her everyday choices.",
