  "description": "An aging research vessel, the Port of Galveston, Krill America, is suddenly flooded by an underwater earthquake and dashed against the jagged edge of a glacial iceberg. Her battered surviving crew members are thrust into a perilous struggle for survival against the freezing waters of Antarctica's Southern Weddell Sea, the most ruthlessly treacherous place on earth.Crippled and sinking, the remains of the ship are the only hope of Max, an elderly Mexican seaman, and his fellow shipmates. Without basic function and facing diminishing supplies of food and water, the crew labors tirelessly to restore broken and antiquated systems in order to provide essential electricity, power, and heat. Max recounts the events and describes strained relations among crew members who compete for control and those who vie for the affections of Kat, the only remaining female member of the crew. Eventually, the Krill America sinks into the sea, leaving the exhausted crew to salvage and huddle into a small derelict shell-of-a-shrimp-boat while hoping desperately for rescue from a certain death-by-winter. A surprising and stunning conclusion reveals a hidden truth that no one, least of all Max, suspects.\"Krill America\" is a \"relentless impending death\" fast-paced thriller suspense novel that has been described as a cross between \"The Old Man and the Sea\", \"The Flight of the Phoenix\" and \"Titanic\". Prepare to take a mind-bending roller-coaster journey to the bottom of the world as KRILL AMERICA sails to crush a frigid cabin-fever winter with \"I was there\" graphic wealth.",
