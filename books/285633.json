  "description": "Floe Ryan was frozen - or 'vitrified' - at sixteen. She and her parents had a rare disease, so it was their only choice until a cure was found. Now she's been thawed and it's ten years in the future - but she's still a teenager. And her parents are still chilling out... So now her little sister is her older sister, and she's making Floe suffer for every snotty thing she ever did. It's hard getting used to... not to mention a new school, new technology, and a zillion other new things that happened while she was napping in the freezer. Luckily, she has Taz, the hottie skater boy who was a popsicle too, so they get to reintegrate together. But now they're trying to close the Venice Beach Cryonics Center - with Floe's parents still in it! It's up to her to save the clinic and her parents - so she can finally have a somewhat normal life.",
