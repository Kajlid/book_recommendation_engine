Even the smallest toddler will enjoy the wonderfully silly sounds in this book, so join in and waddle along â€“ you've never been on a walk like it!The trademark Julia Donaldson rhymes and rhythms in this cumulative story are perfect to read aloud, and Nick Sharratt's mischievous and funny illustrations make the bright and playful Toddle Waddle a sure winner. Just right for toddlers!Look out Hippo Has a Hat, Chocolate Mousse for Greedy Goose, One Mole Digging a Hole, Animal Music and Goat Goes to Playgroup .",
