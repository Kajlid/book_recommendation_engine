  "title": "Fettered For Life",
  "description": "First published in 1874, FETTERED FOR LIFE is both a page-turning melodrama and a classic of subversive literature. As young Laura Stanley struggles to make her way independently in New York City, she faces prejudices, limitations, and dangers based upon her gender. She also encounters a colorful cast of villains and heroes representing a cross-section of New York society: a vile and corrupt judge, a working-class wife-batterer, a suffragist woman doctor, a gutsy washer-woman, a female crossdresser, and the young man who must accept Laura as an equal before he can win her love. Through the plot’s many twists, the author’s uncompromising view of gender relations comes through: Only when women are allowed their full share of humanity and autonomy can a marriage of true minds take place.",
