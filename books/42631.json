  "description": "Billy Fletcher learned to farm the family's tobacco fields--and beat slaves--by the hands of his father. Now, his father is dead, the slaves have long since been freed, and the once-lush fields are dying. Salvation by the name of Abraham knocks on the farmhouse door, bringing wild ideas. He can help Billy Save the plantation and return the fields to their former glory... by raising his father's slaves from the dead.Can the resurrected slaves breathe life back into the Fletcher farm? Having brought the slaves back from graves that his father sent them, can Billy be the kind master his father wasn't? Is keeping the farm worth denying the men the freedom they earned with death?Billy's conscience holds the key to those mysteries, but not the biggest one: what does Abraham really want from the former slave owner's son?Welcome to The Fields.Praise:  \"The walking dead, a post-Civil-War setting, and a sinister Lincolnesque figure add up to a fresh new take on the zombie mythos.\" - Tim Waggoner, author of Nekropolis, Broken Shadows and Darkness Wakes\"With The Fields, Ty Schwamberger did the near-impossible: made zombies interesting to me again. Not only interesting, but frightening, as well. Throw in more than a dash of scathing social commentary, a pace that never stops to catch its breath, and a sly bit of gallows humor, and you've got a winner. Kick yourself if you miss this one.\" - Gary A. Braunbeck, Bram Stoker and International Horror Guild Award-winner, author of To Each Their Darkness and A Cracked and Broken Path",
