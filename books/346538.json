  "description": "Aside from the nagging and sometimes troubling memories and questions of his past, life for Will over the last year has been truly blessed. His relationship with Skye grows daily as he plans and prepares a future life for them. However, all he envisioned is endangered by an unexpected stranger with a shocking identity. Suddenly, Will learns more about his past than he thought he'd ever know, but it comes at a steep price when he and everyone closest to him are thrown into the middle of a dangerous plot that threatens all their lives. Every Tear, the moving sequel to The Pirate Daughter's Promise, is an example of how God never leaves our side, even in our most troubling and sorrowful moments, taking every tear into account.",
