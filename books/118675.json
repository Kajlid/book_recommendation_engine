  "description": "In a post-apocalyptic world, rebuilt and dominated by porcelain skinned albinos, seventeen year old Joanne Brennan's pigmented skin is her defining characteristic. It controls every aspect of her life: who she can associate with, where she's allowed to live and what kind of job she is qualified to hold. Joey may be proud and confident while others of her kind are broken and self-loathing, but she will never be anything more than a \"Pig.\" While finishing her senior year of high school, Joey cares for her bedridden mother and works in a swanky coffee shop just to get by. Daily she struggles to maintain her ideals. There was a time when Joey dreamt of equality. The death of her father, the man who raised her to love the pigment in her skin and never accept injustice, changed all that. Now Joey's hope and determination have made way for apathy. Unexpectedly, her sad life gets turned upside down with the homecoming of Grey Redcrest, a boy whose pale skin and snowy white hair are as forbidden as they are beautiful. Despite the numerous warnings, Joey can't deny her inexplicable attraction to him. His interest in her is just as mystifying. What will happen if she lets go of her reservations? Will Grey be everything he claims to be or will he inadvertently lead Joey to discover a much deeper attraction and a means to restore her lost hope.",
