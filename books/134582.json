  "description": "We are a world on the brink of extinction. Thanks to humanity’s greed, we are now seeing unprecedented environmental destruction and loss. Planet Earth has had enough.Is there a way forward, into a world in which all living things can live in harmony? Or does humanity have merely a few generations left? In this groundbreaking collection of essays, Ali Horriyat digs deep into the environmental crisis to determine both its root causes and possible solutions. Through a spiritual lens, he examines the undeniable link between capitalism and climate change, and explores ways in which we can all ignite the revolution the planet so desperately needs. A Natural World in Love provides a glimpse of a better, more harmonious future—one in which humanity learns to live in love with the natural world that surrounds us.\nAll proceeds of Ali Horriyat’s books go towards Compassiviste Foundation, funding compassionate action for a harmonious future.",
