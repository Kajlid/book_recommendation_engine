What she didn’t know was that she was mine, always had been, and it was high time I showed her exactly that.  Snow  Hunter was my father’s head of security and the man I loved. I was tired of the gilded cage my father had built for me. I wanted my freedom, but that meant leaving Hunter.  But when he told me I was his I knew there was nothing more I wanted than to surrender to the alpha that he was. And it was in those moments where he was memorizing every part of me that I knew one thing…Hunter owned me.  Warning: Mila has teamed up with Aria to bring you one short, filthy fairytale retelling that’ll make you question your morals but have you turning the page for more.",
