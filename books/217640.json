  "description": "Twenty-one years after the destruction of Darth Vader and the Emperor, the Star Wars galaxy has been hit by a threat more deadly than anything that has gone before. In VECTOR PRIME, aliens invaded from outside the galaxy and were routed. . . at great cost to our heroes. Now, in a climate of mistrust - especially of the Jedi - Leia cannot convince the New Republic that the threat may not be over, even as the next wave of alien warships are entering the galaxy. . . It is up to Leia, Luke, the Solo kids - Jedi Knights all - and the few who believe to defend the Outer Rim planets from invasion!",
