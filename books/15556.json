  "title": "A Civil War Christmas",
  "description": "The Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright of How I Learned to Drive, Paula Vogel, has crafted what The New York Times has declared “an ambitious, richly detailed and beautiful new seasonal offering.” Set on a chilly Christmas Eve during the latter days of the Civil War, A Civil War Christmas weaves a tapestry of fictional and historical characters, such as President and Mrs. Lincoln — together with holiday music, marches, hymns and spirituals of the period—to tell a story of companionship and communal hope arising from one of our nation’s darkest hours.This volume features a conversation between the author and noted historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, commentary on the music of the Civil War and its singing soldiers and excerpts from historical journals such as that of Walt Whitman. A Civil War Christmas, declared “The Best Play of the Year” by the Hartford Courant, premiered in 2008 at Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, CT under the direction of Tina Landau.",
