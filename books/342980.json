  "description": "Jack's haunted by fears of the past. Madeleine holds a powerful secret. And Rachelle is running away. For the last seventeen years, her husband, Jack, and son, Justin, have been Madeleine Seymour's world. Then, during Justin's wedding reception, Jack collapses. Jack needs surgery, and he insists it be performed by the doctor who perfected the procedure. But the doctor isn't reachable, and time is running out. Dr. Rachelle DuPres, plagued by memories of a deadly failure, flees America to search out her roots in her ancestral village in Provence, France. But as she tries to locate the graves of her Catholic uncles and her Jewish parents, will their roles in the Holocaust bring more angst-or the answers she so desperately seeks? A poignant story about choices made along the way...and the miracles of the heart. Set in the breathtaking beauty of France. The second in a trilogy. Don't miss Pilgrimage, the first title in the trilogy (set in Italy): It was a day when nothing should have gone wrong...but everything did.",
