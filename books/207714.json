  "description": "Book One in the History and Horrors Short Story Collection\"It was only me that could see her. Tragic, dead Ivy. \"Sometimes I wished I weren't so lucky. Wished I experienced her the way the rest of the world did: as a cold draught, or a banging door you been gosh darn meaning to get fixed for months now. But to me she wasn't just a flash of light in the corner of your eye. She was a young woman in a torn yellow bustle dress and eyes like storm clouds. A reminder that there were layers between life and death that stretched far beyond our comprehension.\"Stranded in the middle of the Australian desert, the Golden Plains Hotel is isolated, run down and haunted by murdered Ivy Westerly. Through the barrier between two worlds, Ivy and publican's daughter Alice console each other in their monotonous existence. Alice is ecstatic when she finds a way to leave the Golden Plains. But tragic, dead Ivy won't let go of their friendship quite so easily... Goldfields is a paranormal short story from Australia's past.",
