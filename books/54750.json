  "title": "Great Beginnings: Opening Lines of Great Novels",
  "description": "A great novel's opening paragraph creates a magical space that draws in its reader. In an instant, the vista of an intriguing and wondrous world beckons. Great Beginnings presents hundreds of these glorious openings, from the early nineteenth century to the present, each one pulling us into a new and different universe. Some novelists stroll unhurriedly into their stories, while some leap directly into the action. Arranged in fourteen categories, from \"Once Upon a Time\" to \"Brevity Doesn't Count,\" Ensign's selections show the sheer technical artistry, breadth, and genius of the novel. Great Beginnings will bring a delight of recognition with first lines that are so remarkable they have become memorable as famous quotations, such as \"Call me Ishmael\" or \"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times....\" But the pure enjoyment of Great Beginnings lies in the length of the excerpts: Instead of a jumble of first sentences, Ensign's excerpts are full paragraphs that impart the essence of these miraculous novels. Great Beginnings selections are sure to send readers back to their old favorites as well as lead them on to new discoveries. Entertaining and inspirational, Great Beginnings will appeal to anyone who has spent long afternoons caught in the spell of a novel.",
