  "description": "The September 11th, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center changed the United States of America. Those changes affected American society on all levels, from the top echelon of government through to the everyday working American. Molly McKinney was one of those Americans. Having ambitions to become a doctor, Molly joined the Army Reserves to help pay for college, but she had to put those ambitions on hold when she was deployed to Bagram airbase in Afghanistan as a Military Police (MP) specialist, tasked to be a prison guard. Soldier On follows her trials and tribulations as she makes friends for life, falls in love, and discovers how ordinary people can become extraordinary, for good and bad, when faced with extraordinary circumstances.",
