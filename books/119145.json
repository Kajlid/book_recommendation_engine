  "description": "Richard, a successful businessman, is deep in a coma. Unknowingly to all, he can hear everything said around him. He has no choice but to listen as his wife Anna and daughter Ella long for his passing. He also has a son that no longer acknowledges his existence. His family lay in waste, the fallout of his selfish life spent pursuing money and excess. Frustrated by what he has now learned about his family, he wishes someone could hear him so he could apologize. Just as all is lost, a voice, inside his conscious says, “I can hear you.”",
