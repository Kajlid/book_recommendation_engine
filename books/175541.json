That is until her house gets raided and she finds out her boyfriend was actually a CIA agent turned traitor. When he escapes custody and begins stalking her she turns to the only man she knows can protect her, the man she’s been in love with since high school.When Nora shows up on his doorstep looking for protection, Jack Coleman tries to turn her way.
