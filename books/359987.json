  "description": "Seminar paper from the year 2007 in the subject English Language and Literature Studies - Literature, grade: 1,3, University of Constance (Literaturwissenschaften), course: Margaret Atwood's Later Fiction, language: English, abstract: Margaret Atwood's novels The Handmaid's Tale (T.H.T., 1985) and Oryx and Crake (O. & C., 2003) are works of speculative fiction that are set in the near future. Both of the depicted scenarios take place in the U.S.A. and could be classified as \"survivor's stories\" as they are told from the perspective of a person that survived the new system or the catastrophe the books deal with.

The scenario in O. & C. on the other hand occurs around the year 2025 and depicts a world wide catastrophe where Snowman - the narrator of the story - is one of the few surviving human beings.

To start with, I will take a look at the social and political background of the time the novels were written in, followed by a generic analysis of the works. Secondly I will answer the question about the inspiration for these novels and I will deal with the epilogues Atwood added to her books. This will be followed by a chapter about the main topics of the novels which are reproduction, religion and sexuality. Last but not least I will compare the main characters an",
