  "description": "It is autumn 1935 when a mystery woman appears in Port Alma, a small sea village nestled on the chilly coast of Maine. A fragile, green-eyed beauty, the woman arrives with little more than the clothes on her back and a wealth of unspoken secrets. Before a year goes by, she will flee Port Alma on the same bus that brought her there. But before she goes, she will irrevocably alter the lives of two brothers--leaving one dead, and the other perched on the edge of madness....In lyrical and sumptuous prose, Edgar Award-winning writer Thomas Cook has penned a mesmerizing novel of brotherly binds, damning betrayal, and the desperate acts people commit in the name of passion.
