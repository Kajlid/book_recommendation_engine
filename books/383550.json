But when her uncle tracks her down, can she escape his despicable intentions?One of the seven \"horrid novels\" named in Jane Austen's \"Northanger Abbey,\" \"The Castle of Wolfenbach\" is perhaps the most important of the early Gothic novels, predating both \"The Mysteries of Udolpho\" and \"The Monk.\"This edition reprints the complete text of the 1793 edition and includes a new introduction and notes by Diane Long Hoeveler, one of the foremost modern scholars of Gothic literature and feminism.",
