Things are bound to get a little hot...Hira thought volunteering to save her people against the coming dragon attack would mean killing the invaders with her trusty sword. She had no idea they were planning on chaining her in the middle of town--naked.And then a wolf Shifter appears with an offer. One she can't resist. But what is she willing to give up to save herself and her town?SULTRY FIRE is a steamy reverse harem involving a sarcastic heroine and an arrogant wolf pack who want her for their own. This tale is short and shouldn't be taken too seriously. It's meant to be a sexy break from reality that leaves you with a smile. No cliff hangers for these feisty characters!",
