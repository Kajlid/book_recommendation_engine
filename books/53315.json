  "description": "The rippling effects of choices made in a family…A mother’s love for her children…Unspoken communication…This inspirational, true-life story explains a mother’s choices, struggles, and beliefs. The life experiences of a family are creatively weaved through Christina’s history in Sweden and her children’s lives in early 1900’s Chicago. The book culminates with the true life, present day experiences of her great-great granddaughter, unable to verbalize her own story. This book shows a family’s love can sustain us through many adversities, and that one person’s choices can have a dramatic effect on many lives. And, it explores the possibility of communication between people that occurs without words, across time and space. Part creative non-fiction, part memoir, this book is sure to spark your emotions, enthrall your heart and inform. A great read!",
