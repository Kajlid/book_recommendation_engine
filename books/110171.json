  "description": "Let me tell you a little secret—men have NOT always been in charge. Let me tell you another secret – ORDINARY PEOPLE HOLD EXTRAORDINARY POWER! Conversations with EVE (Every Vagina on Earth) is an eye-opening, inspiring, and motivating book. It shares a fascinating account of how the “Myth of Male Superiority” took away EVE’s rights and freedoms. It gets to the heart of the matter, and tells exactly WHY - * EVE have “traditionally” been considered subservient to men? * abuse and mistreatment of EVE are an everyday occurrence worldwide? * EVE are still restricted in education, employment, and civil liberties? * millions of abortions occur each year in spite of modern medical science? But Conversations does much more than answer those critical questions. It gives EVE simple, easy ways to use their TRUE power to change their lives and change the world. It inspires EVE to create a better today and a brighter tomorrow through a velvet (r)evolution powered by new ways to look at EVE’s past and new ways to take charge of our future. We don’t have to change men’s minds. We only have to change ours!",
