  "title": "Hannibal Barca: The Lion of Carthage",
  "description": "Before Napoleon. Before Caesar. Before the Mediterranean was ruled by a Roman Emperor, the finest general in the world hailed from Africa.  Hannibal Barca and his family dominated the powerful city of Carthage. As the fledgling city-state of Rome broke their peace treaty and bargained for war, Hannibal sacrificed all that he loved to march against the bully power.  The strength of his wife and mother at home kept Carthage in check, while Hannibal executed the most daring invasion in military history...marching over the Alps with dozens of war elephants among his guard. He drives terror into the Roman people, racing to the gates of Rome...until enemies within send cracks through his carefully planned victory.  When brothers die and comrades betray, who but Hannibal can offer hope? When Rome is within reach, what cost is too high for victory? When family demands heartbreak, where does allegiance lie?  Amid the passion of war, Hannibal finds one enemy he can respect. But after freeing this young Roman officer, he grows into Hannibal's greatest nemesis, rescuing Rome from the abyss. Will honor be Hannibal's undoing? Does strength stand a chance against deceit? When politics and warriors are at odds, who will win the day?  Hannibal Barca is the thrilling tale of a family dedicated to the greatness of a city and the sacrifices they each make during the Second Punic War.
