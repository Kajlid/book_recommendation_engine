  "description": "Heroes, villains, sweethearts and sweet talkers.The entertaining, infuriating, even charming characters in these eighteen stories, which turn the spotlight on the opposite sex, give the lie to those who claim women don't or won't write well about men.In this latest crop of the best short stories from Woman's Hour, you will find brief encounters, mad passions, sibling rivalries, endearing fathers, and men in love, in submarines, in mid-life crises. Beautifully written by some of our most celebrated international women writers, these stories eloquently encapsulate Alice Munro's definition of a short story as 'a world seen in a quick glancing light'.",
