  "description": "“Choosing to heal is one of the hardest decisions you can ever make…”When horse trainer Damian Bradley agrees to work for wealthy Richard Watts, he doesn’t realize that the protective mask he wears is about to be destroyed.Since leaving home at seventeen, doing his best to forget the horrific trauma he endured, he prefers the company of horses to that of people. Horses accept him for who he is, and they never bring up the painful memories that he has so carefully tucked away beneath his prickly exterior.Lila Watts, Richard’s cherished daughter, is immediately drawn to Damian, but he does his best to push her away. However, she starts to break down his walls with her authenticity and compassion, and she begins to tap into the vulnerable parts he’s desperate to keep hidden.The arrival of Lila’s predatory aunt Kat sets in motion a collision of past and present, forcing Damian to confront demons long since buried. Can Damian choose to let go of his limiting beliefs so that he can begin the arduous process of healing? Or will he remain hidden in the shadows, and lose his chance at love?",
