  "title": "Off the Leash:  A Woman, Her Dog and the Road Trip of a Lifetime",
  "description": "Off the Leash is about freedom. Not asking permission. Risking everything. Heeding messages from the universe to change your life. It's a triumph tale about a woman who grabs her dog, jumps in the car and goes for a little spin across America to revive her life. She needed a defibrillator as big as a nation.Jean Ellen Whatley sets out on a coast-to-coast journey with enough baggage to bottom out a truck: her illegitimate roots, an abusive childhood, the ex-husband who did time in prison, two brothers gone inside too few years. Then, there's that other little matter, the other brother she's never seen.Defying convention, logic and her bank account, what unfolds on her 9,000 mile odyssey is nothing short of life-changing: aided and abetted by old friends, strangers on the highway, long-lost family members, cosmic playing cards that plop in her path, a wicked sense of humor plus the comfort and protection of her loyal dog Libby, who reminds her to live in the moment.You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll see yourself in this deeply personal, sometimes comical, always edgy, but ultimately inspirational memoir, which lovingly reaffirms that at the end day or the end of our journey, we're all in this together. It's about breaking free from thinking our lives are predestined to be hard or sad or screwed up. It's about having the courage to listen to our gut, no matter the risk. It's about our connection to other people and how precious little time we have to tell them we love them or thanks for the hamburger, sometimes in the same breath.",
