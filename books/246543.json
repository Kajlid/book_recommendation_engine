  "description": "Tom Gunderson’s friend, who happens to be transgender, was bullied with the president’s words by a classmate and ends up dead. Now Tom is living with the guilt that he didn’t do or say enough. If anyone would have said something else, maybe his friend would still be alive.  Tom has more questions than answers: Was his friend’s death a murder or suicide? Should the bully be prosecuted if the friend committed suicide? Will the bully get away with it because he used the president’s words? Did the bully do more than send tweets?  Tom Gunderson is convinced his friend was murdered. Tom, a classic underachiever with a high IQ but low grades and a bit of an outsider, has to navigate through the daily grind of high school while looking into the suspicious circumstances surrounding his friend’s death. As Tom investigates the death, he discovers who his true friends are and gains some insight into who he is. Tom’s discoveries might surprise you.",
