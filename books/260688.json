  "description": "Marriage--it's all about love and understanding and being with each other for the rest of your days. For Elise, it means something entirely different.Thrown into a marriage on her father's orders, Elise isn't prepared to be married to the man known as Luca Pasquino. Luca is the next capo in line to take over his father's empire with an iron fist. He's cruel, he's evil, and he's ready to destroy anything and anyone that gets in the way of his plans for complete control.Elise has no idea what is in store for her. All she knows is that she can try to survive her life for the rest of her days with Luca.Update from I'm listening! In my zeal to tell my story, I relied on the expertise of others to ensure it went from my head to the printed page, which didn't go exactly as planned. Deadly Vows has now been re-edited to ensure the grammar and punctuation are now as they should be. Enjoy!",
