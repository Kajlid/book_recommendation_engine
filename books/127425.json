An enigmatic loner, he hides the fact that during the daylight hours, he rests within the dark confines of the earth, rising after twilight--a routine he has carried out for five hundred years.Now, murder has struck his tranquil community, coinciding with the arrival of a sinister newcomer, and he is drawn into the sordid game of a killer. But joining forces with a mortal and an otherworldly daywalker, he soon finds himself in a battle for survival. And when the woman he loves becomes a pawn in the game of rivalry, things turn personal, for he will do whatever it takes to save her. Beware the setting of the sun and listen for the call of the wild wolf crying out its warning of immortal presence. You see, this is their time--after the fall of night. (Corin & Angelique is a 1st edition paperback, but revised version of ebook originally published as After the Fall of Night.)",
