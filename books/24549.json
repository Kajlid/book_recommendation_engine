  "description": "Whitley Wickingham learned of her grandmother’s death and left immediately for the family farm in Bridlehook, Oklahoma. The day after her arrival she explored the house and curiosity led to the attic where she found her grandmother’s antique mirror. The reason for it being stored in the attic and how it was hoisted up there were mysteries at best. Immediately she began making plans to move the mirror downstairs. That’s when everything changed and the definition of normal at the Wickingham Farm took on a whole new meaning. Nothing was as it seemed and no one appeared to be who they said they were. Whitley Wickingham had no idea of the terror that lay in wait. In her worst nightmare she would never have danced so closely to insanity and she would’ve awakened before sheer evil forced her to run for her life. But this wasn’t a night terror and she would try to go without sleep for fear when she closed her eyes it would be for the last time. US Copyright Registration # TX0007410202",
