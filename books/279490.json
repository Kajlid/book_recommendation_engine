  "description": "‘My parents were now dabbling withdrugs and Southern Comfort, even going so far as to put a selection ofhallucinogens into my bottle to witness the effects for their own amusement. Ionly know this because my mum made no attempt to hide it, often speaking openlyabout their experiments with my milk supply. Her only regret being the time sheadded a small amount of speed to my formula to see how long it would take me tofall asleep.’Set in the UK andIreland in the late 1970s and early 1980s, YouShot My Dog and I Love You, is a harrowing story of horrific physical andmental abuse inflicted on the author at the hands of his parents.
