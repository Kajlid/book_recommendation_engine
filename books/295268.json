  "description": "Sabrina is still in love with her ex. It's been nearly two years since they ended and she's still reeling from the breakup. It doesn't seem to get easier, even though everyone has been telling her that it will and all she needs is a rebound. Time will heal her broken heart. She deserves better. Just move on. Let go. Get over it. He's not worth it. She knows they're right. She needs to move on. So when one of her friends suggests she hook up with Daniel Fitzgerald, a charming, handsome teacher by day, and artist by night, she agrees, thinking maybe this is what she needs. After all, it's just a casual, no strings attached situation-ship. But could it ever be more?",
