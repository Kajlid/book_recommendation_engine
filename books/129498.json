  "description": "A young girl is relaxing at her favorite spot in the forest when she suddenly realizes she is being watched. It turns out to be Nermal, who is in need of her help. His world is a hidden one, which is being kept alive by the dreams and hopes of children. Elf like people called Mems inhabit the colony. They are very quiet, content people whose world has been turned upside down by the Drones. Drones are the complete opposite of Mems. The Drones have stolen the crystal that keeps the Mems' world safe and happy. Nermal's job is to find a child who can help him retrieve the crystal safely from the Drones. Can this little girl whom Nermal has chosen do it? Can she outwit the high Drone, called Master, and get the crystal back? These are the questions that you, the reader, will have to find out.",
