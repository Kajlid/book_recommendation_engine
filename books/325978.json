So my Italian heirs and I made plans—big, life-changing plans, and tried to move on with our lives.But I was naive to think that there weren’t snakes lying in the grass, just waiting for the opportune time to strike.It was a blow no one saw coming.We didn’t start this war, but with the help of our unexpected allies, we’re sure as h*ll going to end it.I vowed that I would never sit idle while my family is in danger.And I never break a promise.",
