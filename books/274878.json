Take up yoga - that woman she hate-follows swears by it3. Start practising mindfulness - all those people can't be wrong...4. Quit smoking. It's not 1999.This Is Not A Love Story is a book for anyone who's ever wished they were perfect. It's a book for anyone who feels like a failure. And it's not a love story, it's a real story.
