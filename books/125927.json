  "description": "Anno Adelmann—survivor of two heart attacks—is a wealthy widower, and his four scheming daughters all have designs on his inheritance. Anno, who refers to them variously as hyenas and piranhas, decides to have a bit of fun at their expense. But what starts as a joke soon becomes much more serious, and the family finds itself dealing with kidnapping, blackmail, and even attempted murder. In this witty and irreverent satire, vanity is mocked and bad behaviour deliciously punished as four sisters learn some uncomfortable lessons in sibling rivalry.",
