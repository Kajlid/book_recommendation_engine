  "description": "\"Everybody knows the story of the Three Little Pigs – Or at least they think they do. But I'll let you in on a little secret. Nobody knows the real story, because nobody has ever heard my side of the story\"A spoof on the classic three little pigs story, this time told from the wolf's point of view.You may think you know the story of the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf – but only one person knows the real story. That person is A. Wolf. His tale starts with a birthday cake for his dear old granny, a bad head cold... and a bad reputation. It ends in the Big House: The Pig Pen. What really happened when A. Wolf was at the door? Was it an historic pig out or a Mother Goose frame-up? Premeditated swineacide or simply an accident? You read it. You decide. For those who think they know the story of the Three Little Pigs and the Big, Bad Wolf, here it is as they've never heard it before. In this highly acclaimed collaboration, Jon Scieszka and Lane Smith combine their talents for droll tales and provocative reporting to bring the true story of this much maligned figure to the public. Big and Bad? Could be. Hilarious? Of course.Illustrated in full color.",
