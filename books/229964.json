  "description": "This is the complete boxed set of the Walker Saga. Seven books. Over 500,000 words.  Follow Abigail and her friends as they journey through the First World star system. They have an important and dangerous mission: gather the seven half-Walker females. This group of loyal, crazy, determined girls are the only ones who can stop the Seventine before they destroy their worlds. Also contains epic adventure, soul-mate love stories, crazy worlds filled with fantasy and danger, and boat-loads of snarky humor.  First World: Seven half-Walker girls. Seven worlds. One chance to save them all!  Abigail Swish’s life is nothing to brag about: gang-ridden city, orphanage style accommodations, and a matron who’s kinda on the evil side.  Not that she has to worry about that for much longer. She’ll turn 18 soon, and then it’s goodbye compound, hello dangerous streets of New York City.  Of course, as her luck would have it, she doesn’t make it to 18 before her world is turned upside down. One ambushed meeting with an accent-bearing, sword-wielding stranger, and suddenly her entire life as she knows it is a lie. Apparently she was just stashed on Earth for safekeeping and has been lost to her family ever since. And it’s time to return home. To First World; a land of unimaginable beauty.  Of course, one should never forget how the old tale goes: beauty often hides the darkest secrets.
