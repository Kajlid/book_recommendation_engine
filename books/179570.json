  "description": "Mackenzie Day is reeling from the death of her best friend, Maddie. She's lost her rock, her partner in crime, and her only family in one feel swoop. With that loss, Mac has lost track of herself, and the things she cares about, including her mind-reading abilities.When the opportunity for vengeance arises, she becomes so blinded by her hatred that she no longer recognizes the person she's become. As her empathy towards others slips away, even she can't believe how far she is willing to go to claim justice for Maddie.Without her moral compass and her sense of self, how can she possibly stop a group of mind-reading terrorists from killing tens of thousands of people? Can she see past her anger to care about anything besides retribution? How can she save her newfound family, when she can't even tell the difference between herself and those who are truly unforgiven?",
