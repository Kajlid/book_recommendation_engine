  "description": "Finn Murphy never promised to stay.After years on the road, he came home and enlisted the help of his brothers only to find answers about the murder of friends in Ukraine. That was the plan: find the people responsible and be on his way — until he fell in love with Elise Berenger.Elise Berenger is still struggling to feel safe.Two years after being kidnapped by a transnational trafficking ring, Elise can hardly walk an unfamiliar street without having a panic attack. Taking her recovery slow and steady, with the help of her therapist and the supportive Murphy clan, was fine with her — right up until she fell hard and fast for Finn Murphy.Acknowledging their relationship is complicated and their future together is anything but certain, the pair focus on exacting justice, planning to deal with the questions about their future later. Then Finn makes a catastrophic mistake, thrusting the Murphys into an international manhunt that places them in the company of the world’s rich and famous and forces them to beg a favor from criminal kingpin Nico Vitale.When the identity of the man behind the murders is finally revealed, the Murphys must literally storm the castle in a race against mercenaries who have their own agenda. Finn comes face-to-face with the truth about who he is, and then there’s no more time to wait-and-see: he and Elise finally have to acknowledge they weren’t meant to be — or find a way to reconcile their differences and come home to each other.",
