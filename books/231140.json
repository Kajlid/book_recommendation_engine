  "description": "Note from the author: I'm going to be honest, this was my first book baby. It has it's flaws, but it also introduces you to a lot more characters. I also believe I've grown A LOT since this first book. I just wanted to thank you for giving this one a chance, and trying it to begin with. I hope you'll take another chance on some of my other recent works!!! Zara Edgingway is a twenty-six year old secretary. She has a daughter that apparently knows it all and a best friend that could possibly have the mouth of Satan, but she's been with her through hell and back. Then there's the hunk'a'licious biker neighbor finally showing interest in her. If only she wasn't about to face her next obstacle in life, the one she ran from six years ago; her ex-husband.Talon Marcus is the president of the Hawks Motorcycle Club. For two years he's had his eye on the quiet, reclusive, yet sassy, neighbor Zara. Finally, he has the chance to claim her as his woman. Just when her past catches up with her, she'll need, not only his protection, but the help from his biker brothers.Now, if only she'd stop fighting him along the way.",
