  "title": "The Accidental Entrepreneur: Turning Tragedy into Triumph to Embrace my Destiny in Entrepreneurship",
  "description": "I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth, but it tarnished. At least, that's what I was told. Life as I knew it fell apart when I was just 4 years old and it would continue to go downhill for several years afterwards.What did I learn from these experiences? The world doesn't owe you anything. If you want to make something of yourself, it will be up to you to take ownership and accountability of the outcome. A mentor once said I was \"fearless in my ability to address risks, viewing them as walls to jump over rather than barriers to stop me\" - and he was right. I try not to let anything stand in my way when I am pursuing a goal.Follow along with me on my journey of self-discovery and how I managed to navigate all of the lessons life had to throw my way. Instead of letting them knock me down, I used these lessons as stepping stones on the path to success, turning tragedy into triumph to embrace my destiny in entrepreneurship.",
