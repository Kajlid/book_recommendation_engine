A gang of teenage boys has murdered his family, shattering his dream of becoming a doctor. Driven to the streets with other homeless waifs, Dane’s new occupation is begging for food. Worse things await—misunderstandings, imprisonment, and separation from his pretty orphan friend, Tharyn. The gentle breezes of the country seem worlds away, but still they sigh the poor boy’s name. . .",
