  "title": "The Diaries of Adam and Eve",
  "description": "\"Good deal of fog this morning. I do not go out in the fog myself,\" notes Adam in his diary, adding, \"The new creature does. It goes out in all weathers. And talks. It used to be so pleasant and quiet here.\" Adam has a lot to learn about Eve, and even more from her, as she names the animals, discovers fire, and introduces all manner of innovations to their garden home. Mark Twain's \"translation\" of the diaries of the first man and woman offers a humorous \"he said/she said\" narrative of biblical events. The great American storyteller found comfort and inspiration in the company of women, and his irreverent look at conventional religion is also a thoughtful -- and humorous -- argument for gender equality.",
