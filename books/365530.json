  "description": "In these eleven searing stories, Jeffrey Thomas (Blu War, Deadstock) takes us on another tour of the infamous far-future colony known as Punktown, it streets rife with viloence and danger, its alleys stalked by aliens and muntants, its citizens struggling to retain their humanity, dignity, and and sanity in the oppressive shadows of its soaring cold towers. Mixing mind-bending science fiction with bone-chlling horror, Thomas again demonstrates which his initial collection Punktown was met with wide acclaim. \"Punktown is one of the best examples of SF horror currently out there.\" -- Ellen Datlow, Locus \"Punktown is searing and alien and anxious and rich, and it is human, and it is moving. Jeffrey Thomas has done something wonderful.\" -- China Mieville \"Thomas' stories...contain a world in themselves, stored in fragments and glances and details, and together they create a whole even greater than the sum of their parts-while remaining, individually, stories of great impact, a collection of which anyone would be proud to have written just one tale.\" -- Michael Marshall Smith",
