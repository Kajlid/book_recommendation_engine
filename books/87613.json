  "description": "In the #1 bestseller IT'S JUST SEXT, Lauren had the hottest weekend of her life with a younger man she met through texting. Marc was her naughty little wish come true. His new assignment to a ship working out of the port of Long Beach will have him sailing back to Lauren a few weekends a month. It's just enough time to act out the intensely erotic texts they share while he's at sea, but will it be enough to build something real? Alone in their seaside hotel room, Marc knows how to bring out the dirty girl in Lauren, though it's her trust he wants most. She will do almost anything with him--anything but bring him home.Warning: This short story includes more toe-curling dirty talk, and may lead to sex on a Ferris Wheel.",
