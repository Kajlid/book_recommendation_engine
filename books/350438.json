  "title": "The Undiscovered Island",
  "description": "Alarmed by her father Sebastião's unexplained disappearance, Julia Castro travels from California to the family's ancestral home in the Azores to find the mid-Atlantic islands abuzz with tales of ghost ships, seductive sirens and unknown islands emerging from the sea. As she pursues the search for her father, Julia gradually succumbs to the bewitching allure of the Azores—and to Nicolau, a fellow musician—eventually discovering a place where dreams lie just beyond the horizon, shrouded in mist. Kastin’s novel has received high praise from Gregory Rabassa, translator of One Hundred Years of Solitude, who calls the book “…a romp of detective story, epic, and family quest. What a great read!”Dramaturg, playwright and poet JoSelle Vanderhooft writes in her review that “The Undiscovered Island is a book of wonders¬ – a family saga, a chronicle of Portuguese history as it was and should have been, a scholarly text, a quixotic quest, and a beguiling mystery... I will call it a book that can stand toe-to-toe with the work of Umberto Eco, and a major work of the 21st century’s first decade.”",
