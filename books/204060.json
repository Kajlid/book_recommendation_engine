  "description": "Sometimes the only way to find yourself is to crash and burn. When Romarin wakes up in a foreign country with super-powers, a jumbled memory, and a taste for blood, her only chance at survival is to trust in strangers, who lend every meaning possible to the word. If she wants to learn to control her powers, Romarin must gain the trust of the misfits living in Whitham Castle, who are haunted by the aftermath of a horrible experiment which still casts a sinister shadow over London's supernatural underground. Can Romarin, the descendant of Countess Bathory, summon all of the reckless brilliance she possesses to find herself and unite her new friends? Or will their need for vengeance and taste for revenge put an end to them all?-----Editorial Review:\"The plot is intriguing and fairly well executed, the story is interesting with well-rounded characters and unusual twists. The way the paranormal story plays out keeps the reader guessing as to the nature of the main character, as well as the nature of several of the other characters. The story lines weave well into each other, creating an intriguing journey that keeps the reader turning the pages. Overall, it is a good read, and I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to anyone who likes paranormal adventures.\"- Kris Moger, Reader's Favorite",
