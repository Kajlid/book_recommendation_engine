  "description": "Deliverance is far from Colin’s reach…until Bash crashes into his life. Colin Sears’ life is a walking nightmare. Finally freed from the crutches of a controlling monster, Colin only wants to hide from the rest of the world. Trouble comes knocking on his door in the form of a ferocious yet unexpectedly kind biker bear. Taking one day at a time without completely falling apart is already a tall order for Colin. While Bash proves to be a wonderful distraction, Colin doubts Bash would want a damaged dragon like him for a mate. Betrayal is not a word Bash Saunders takes lightly. Double-crossed by his former clan, Bash forges a new life with the Moon Burrow Bears. He’s put down roots, loves his job but there’s still something missing. Bash had his eye on Colin from the first moment the broken omega dragon arrived in town. Colin is his destiny, Bash knows it in his bones. When a new evil threatens their future, Bash must journey to his old hometown and finally put old ghosts to rest. Bash is an m/m shifter romance and the fourth book in the Moon Burrow Bears series. It contains mpreg, plenty of action, a reserved dragon and an obnoxious biker bear who wears his heart on his sleeve.",
