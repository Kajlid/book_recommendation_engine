  "description": "You know you're addicted to adventure when you can't think of anything else. It's all you want do ... it's all you want to feel ... it's all you want to be. Imagine your life if all of your dreams of adventure came true. For some, that's exactly what happens. It can happen to you ... nothing is impossible ... as long as you let yourself imagine.Below ancient Egypt's peaceful surface lurks a danger ready to pounce. It silently waits for the moment it will end the reign of the Pharaonic blood-line, and take control forever.The very thing that legend says keeps the Pharaoh safe is in danger of falling into the wrong hands, and time to defeat the evil threat is running out fast. Wil, Linc and Rani must face their most dangerous challenges so far. The danger in this deadly new mission has been turned up a notch ... or ten. This incredible fast-paced adventure weaves its thrills and mystery through the very crossroads of time. From ancient Egypt ... to the centre of time ... to modern Paris, it's a ride that only the brave can survive. Who is the enemy?
