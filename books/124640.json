  "description": "For fans of Lower Decks, the Expanse, and a found family time travel adventure with humor, snark, and lots of heart.\nOne kickass immortal sailship captain.\nCaptain Karenna Yilmaz of the Earth Union Fleet has it all. Adoring husband? Check. The enduring loyalty of her crew? Check. Transformation into a beautiful ageless immortal? Check. Check. Check. But when a dimensional rift brings her low-down, dust-sniffing, no-good younger self hurtling into the present, Karenna's carefully-constructed life wavers.\nOne snarky dust-addicted loser.\nFlight Officer Ren Yilmaz is pretty sick of the hand she's been dealt. Her supervisor is an idiot. Her ex-husband is vindictive and has ruined her career. And now, here's her perfect future self, who everyone fawns over, while Ren is still ignored and alone.\nThey're the same person, 60 years apart \nBoth their ships are one in space, one in time. Karenna needs to get her crew home safe and sound. And Ren has to get back to her reality and out of Karenna's shadow. Working together would mean literally facing their pastâ€“including old traumas and transgressions best kept hidden. But if they don't, they'll be stuck with each other until the end of time.",
