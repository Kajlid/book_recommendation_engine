Later, when she's found brutally murdered, Detective Jackson thinks it's an open-and-shut case against the boy's ex-con father. Complications develop when new evidence points to a serial rapist who's becoming more violent with each attack. Raina's lover, Jamie, knows what the rape victims have in common, but won't tell for fear of revealing her own secrets. When Jamie disappears, Jackson must uncover the truth before the body count goes higher.",
