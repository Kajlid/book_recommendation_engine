She’s a walking disaster and can’t go a day without getting hurt- sometimes the injuries are minor nuisances, but other times they are more severe, requiring stitches, casts and stays in the hospital. She doesn’t understand why she suffers the way she does, until one terrible night she learns the truth. In a past life she committed a sin- a sin so terrible that she's cursed by the Three Fates to have horrible luck until she pays off her karmic debt.Meet Ryder Whyte, the 17-year-old boy next door who's always been a friend, and now wants to be more. But this isn't your typical love story, as every chapter has been woven by the Fates, who won't let their blossoming love go untested. For the truth will come out about her past sins, and in this incarnation she will have the chance to redeem herself, and maybe even for true happiness- if she lives long enough.",
