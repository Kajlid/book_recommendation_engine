  "description": "As a professional sex therapist, Jonathon Sinclair has heard it all. As a master of sexual domination like his brother, Jackson, he’s done even more. Incognito. He’s never allowed his two lives to cross. Never wanted them to, until he listens to Rachel Morrissey relive her \"orgasmic nightmares\" that have turned her into an insomniac. Rachel put her private life on hold to become a successful prosecuting attorney and a representative of female independence. Plagued by erotic dreams of submission that leave her confidence shaken, she'll do anything to make them stop. Even if that means living out the dreams.",
