  "description": "If someone told you they had a vaccine, medically proven to work and completely safe to take, that would both prevent and cure cancer of all types, would you take it? Briella was six years-old when her mother passed away from cancer. Five years later, C-Vac, the cancer vaccine, was announced. For most, it was considered a miracle. For others, like Briella’s dad, it was a suspicious hazard. Nonetheless, when people are offered a miracle, they’re not likely to pass it up. For eight years, cancer was simply a thing of the past. But once the side-effects of C-Vac start to emerge, Briella rapidly begins to understand that the world, as she knows it, will be forever changed. Now faced with new dangers she never thought possible, she’ll have to decide: hide away from anyone who could pose a threat or trust the one person she so desperately wants to let in?",
