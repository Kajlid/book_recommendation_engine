  "title": "Yoga and Vegetarianism: The Diet of Enlightenment",
  "description": "According to Sharon Gannon, the single most important part of your yoga practice is the strict adherence to a vegetarian diet - a diet free of needless cruelty, harm, and injustice. Gannon offers truth and wisdom from a tradition of spiritual practice thousands of years old and explains how to apply these practices to our modern lifestyles. Drawing upon her studies of Vedic traditions, Gannon explores how the practices of yoga are historically and structurally tied to an ethical vegetarian lifestyle. Integral to each another, both yoga and vegetarianism form a framework for physical and spiritual attunement, and when practiced as a whole provide the path not only to physical health, but to spiritual enlightenment.",
