  "title": "The Human Hive",
  "description": "A collection of poetry by the British poet John Looker that explores human work in all of its forms. There are sonnets, free verse, and a mixture of free verse and traditional forms in a unique collection that sings with the rhythms of work going on in the hive of humanity as it has existed over time. The book is presented in seven parts that explore archetypal modes of work found in human society, a global picture of a timeless day, a ancient and modern sequence organized as a business trip, tribal loyalties, states of mind faced through work, the ploughman, the baker, the long masterpiece \"The Night Shift,\" and archetypal activities taken for pleasure in conjunction with work. Looker is a major poet with a major new work to his credit.",
