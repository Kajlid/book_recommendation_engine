And by the time a desperate Ninian realizes he’s crossed the wrong person, it is much, much too late.In his frantic struggle to right his collapsing world, Ninian’s furious, bloody efforts are dredging up history he’d rather forget - the past is tired of being held at bay, and even fighting cannot protect Ninian from himself.So when he meets a crimson-eyed stranger, a boy so broken he refuses even to speak, Ninian does not believe he has the capacity to care.He is wrong.And that will change everything…Kindle Book Award SemiFinalist 2021(This title is a full length origin story to The Hidden King)",
