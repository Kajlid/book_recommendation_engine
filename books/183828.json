  "description": "Our Earth is on the edge of destruction, our cities are pocked with missile craters, and beneath the surface the alien factory queen lurks.Four women of power may be our saviors. The last is Talia. Gifted by earth magic with a mastery of edged weapons, she’s a katana-wielding, geek chick with a loathing of alpha men. Although mating enhances magic, she knows bonding with aliens must surely be wrong. Besides, her destined bond mate, Brask, is an Igrakk warrior of the caveman persuasion. One dominant male is bad enough. Dassenze, the alien man-god in the flesh, also desires her and no isn't a word he appreciates.As they near their target, Talia’s man problems become the lesser of many evils for the factory queen awaits them with her nerve chewers and her drills. The price for being avenging kickass bitches could be a messy death. Warning: Dominance and submission themes, dubious consent, hot aliens, and violence. Mild horror too if you're squeamish.",
