  "description": "Fairy tales never leave us. Romantic and sensual, dark and terrifying, old and new, these ten stories move beyond the old trope of prince and princess living happily ever.Sleeping Beauty, Indeed offers readers imaginative tales based on the classic works - Cinderella, the Pied Piper - but retold through the lavender lens of lesbian experience.With such talented contributors as Meredith Schwarz, Catherynne M. Valente, and Erzebet YellowBoy, turning a page is like taking a bite of that luscious apple. Sweet and dangerous but fated.",
