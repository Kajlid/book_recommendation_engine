  "description": "She's looking for a job, not a mate ... but fate has other ideas.\nLoretta Franklin hasn't paid much attention to Draconians, the dragon shifter aliens who've come to Earth looking for human mates. She's been too busy getting her MBA so she can take care of her grandmother and younger siblings.But when she comes to NYC from Alabama for an interview, anti-Draconian terrorists attack the building she's in. They want the dragon shifters to leave forever, and they don't care who they kill.Fortunately for Loretta, Draconian commandos come to the rescue. And their leader, General Mylash Shin, might be intimidating--but he's also the sexiest male, human or alien, she's ever encountered.Mylash is certain the curvy human is his mate, and urges her to take the DNA test to prove it. Loretta finds the seven-foot-tall warrior hard to resist ... but she doesn't want to leave her planet and her family. Can the general win his most important campaign ever, and persuade Loretta that he's worth it?",
