That commitment, along with their ingenuity, courage and resolve, will be tested along the most barren of stretches in California’s Mojave Desert.Someone is using the bleak highways to dump women’s bodies, but in a landscape where an inviting road can curve into a sand-choked mirage, and a true oasis can be invisible under a white-hot sun, clues can blow away in the wind.In this sequel to Devil’s Rock, Gerri Hill pits two remarkable women against the harsh and bitter desert and an implacable killer.",
