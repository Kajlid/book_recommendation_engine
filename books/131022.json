  "description": "Ethan Davis doesn't trust Tara Bartlett one bit. He's not sure how the voluptuous redhead managed to fool his grandmother into leaving her part-ownership of the family home, but he vows not to be taken in by Tara's seeming helplessness. He's already been burned by one gold-digging female; he refuses to be be influenced by yet another, no matter how strongly he is attracted to her. Tara Bartlett has lost everything in the wake of a devastating car accident. Inheriting a beach house on the shore of Lake Michigan seems like a dream come true -- even if it means sharing the house with the recently-divorced Ethan Davis. She doesn't trust him any more than he trusts her, and she has no intention of jeopardizing her one chance at home ownership by getting involved with him. But they are forced to share more than just living quarters when they have to work together to fight off the greedy developer who wants to make their home part of a modern-day resort. Can Ethan and Tara keep their living arrangement strictly business, or will they give in to their desire for each other?",
