  "title": "The Death of Grandote",
  "description": "Somewhere between A WALK IN THE WOODS and INTO THE WILD, a study abroad program turns into much more than marine biology, cultural anthropology, and surfing. Tripe soup, passion fruit juice, love and drunken basketball, eleven University students experience it all while weaving into one with their new environment, a fishing village in the heart of the Gal√°pagos Islands, Ecuador. This is a work of fiction.",
