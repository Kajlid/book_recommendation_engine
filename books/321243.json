But when your secret is this big…your burden this heavy…fate doesn’t hand over control so easily. A lesson Hannah’s about to learn the hard way.Will this too-good-to-be-true man’s overwhelming and all-consuming feelings for her go the distance while she endures more upheaval in her life? Or will he cut bait and run and prove Hannah was just another one of Elijah’s Whims?",
