  "description": "Designer and illustrator Jane Seabrook had a runaway winner with her first book, Furry Logic. Now here's her long-awaited follow-up title, Laugh at Life, offering another menagerie of cleverly rendered animals and the simple, yet-oh-so-deep ruminations that match these natural comedians. Seabrook possesses a wonderful gift for illustrating nature in incredible detail. Her artwork reflects a zoologist's understanding of animals matched with an illustrator's eye for color and human nature, and she deftly matches these appealing images with exactly the right quotations-and clever, funny ones at that-to convey the meaning she's after. Topics range from the challenges of relationships to the enjoyment of life's many and diverse pleasures. The result is a delightfully satisfying keepsake book that can be enjoyed on many levels and again and again. Just as Furry Logic did, Laugh at Life will captivate those who buy this book for themselves or as an adorable and cherished gift. It has a broad appeal, appropriate for multiple audiences and occasions.",
