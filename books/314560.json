At twenty-nine years old, she has dedicated the last decade of her life to helping other young people who are battling their own disorders and attempting to make a difference where she can.

She has certain dreams and goals for her life but struggles to achieve them with the invisible barriers she faces each day. When some big changes happen for Zara’s best friend, Quinn, Zara questions whether she’s allowing the best years of her life to pass on by rather than living them. When a handsome stranger comes crashing into her world, literally, she has the opportunity to have everything she’s ever wanted. There’s just one problem. Love doesn’t fix all that is broken; that’s something she has to do herself.Will she be able to embrace her flaws and strive for happiness? Or will her inner demons convince her she’s just too broken?",
