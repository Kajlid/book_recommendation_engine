It seems she's already lost the game, but she still has one winning card up her the Wild Horn, the one item of power that can summon the unstoppable Wild Hunt. With the balance between Seelie and Unseelie Courts in her hands, Lily must wisely choose her should she side with Cadowain, the light Knight who swore to help her find her missing grandmother? Or should she keep trusting Troy, the dark Trickster who has the power to command her at will through her True Name?Either way, Lily needs to keep her head and formulate a plan to find her grandmother before it's too late. She needs to remind the immortal faeries that she, too, is willing to play... and they're not unbeatable. When playing for the win, do not lose sight of what you're willing to sacrifice​The Faerie Sworn SeriesStory 0.5: Faerie Nights (available for free via the author's email list)Book 1: The Wild HuntStory 1.5: Faerie Oaths (available for free via the author's email list)Book 2: The Wild CurseStory 2.5: Faerie Hearts (Amazon B018ZZQOTM)Book 3: The Wild Herald",
