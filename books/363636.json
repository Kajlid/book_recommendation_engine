  "title": "Psychodynamic Techniques: Working with Emotion in the Therapeutic Relationship",
  "description": "Helping therapists navigate the complexities of emotional interactions with clients, this book provides practical clinical guidelines. Master clinician Karen J. Maroda adds an important dimension to the psychodynamic literature by exploring the role of both clients' and therapists' emotional experiences in the process of therapy. The book discusses how to become more attuned to one's own experience of a client; offer direct feedback and self-disclosure in the service of treatment goals; and manage intense feelings and conflict in the relationship. Specific techniques are illustrated with vivid case examples. Maroda clearly distinguishes between therapeutic and nontherapeutic ways to work with emotion in this candid and instructive guide.",
