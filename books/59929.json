  "description": "Interest in supernatural phenomena was high during Charles Dickens’ lifetime. He had always loved a ghost story himself, particularly at Christmas time, and was open-minded, willing tot accept, and indeed put to the test, the existence of spirits.His natural inclinations towards drama and the macabre made him a brilliant teller of ghost tales, and in the twenty stories presented here, which include his celebrated A Christmas Carol, the full range of his gothic talents can be seen.Chilling as some of these stories are, Dickens has managed to inject characteristically grotesque comedy as he writes of revenge, insanity, pre-cognition and dream visions, he indulges also in some debunking of contemporary cruelty.The books contains the following stories:The Queer Chair ~ A Madman's Manuscript ~ The Goblins who Stole a Sexton ~ The Ghosts of the Mail ~ The Baron of Grogzwig ~ A Christmas Carol ~ The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain ~ To be Read at Dusk ~ The Ghost in the Bride’s Chamber ~ The Haunted House ~ The Trial for Murder ~ The Signalman ~ Christmas Ghosts ~ The Lawyer and the Ghost ~ Four Ghost Stories ~ The Portrait-Painter's Story ~ Captain Murderer and the Devil's Bargain ~ Mr Testator's Visitation ~ A Child's Dream of a Star ~ Well-Authenticated Rappings.",
