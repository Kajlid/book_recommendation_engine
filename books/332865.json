  "description": "A heartwarming debut from author Caroline Huntoon about a young figure skater discovering who they are on and off the ice.Life isn’t easy on twelve-year-old Mars. As if seventh grade isn’t hard enough, Mars is also grappling with the recent death of their father and a realization they never got to share with him: they’re nonbinary. But with their skates laced up and the ice under their feet, all of those struggles melt away. When Mars’ triple toe loop draws the attention of a high school hot shot, he dares them to skate as a boy so the two can compete head-to-head. Unable to back down from a challenge, Mars accepts. But as competition draws near, the struggles of life off the rink start to complicate their performance in the rink, and Mars begins to second guess if there’s a place for them on the ice at all.Skating on Mars is a tender examination of grief and a hopeful middle grade tale of self-discovery.\"This timely, triumphant novel about figure skating, identity, loss, and love will move and entertain readers―and it might just inspire them to find their own ways to change the world. \" ―Laurie Morrison, author of Up for Air and Coming Up Short",
