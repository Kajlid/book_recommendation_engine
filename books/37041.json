After a frustrating evening at a speed-dating event, the three friends decide to do something different with their summer as they plan a weekend away to Whitby to search for the supernatural and have a few drinks and laughs on the way. Thus starts a summer of ghostly-themed mini breaks where they hunt for spooks, meet a whole bunch of weirdoes and encounter spirits, mostly from a bottle!As each of the women must deal with their own disastrous private lives and with all of the fun and frustrations that offers, will they ever see a dead real, dead as a doornail, dead and buried ghost?",
