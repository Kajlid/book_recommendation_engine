  "description": "Check out www.careyrobin.com for news on giveaways, contests and free books.  Naked in the Garden of the Serpent is mythology with a sense of humor. It's Christopher Moore and Tom Robbins, but from a female point-of-view. * * * Everyone knows about Eve and how she was tempted to eat the forbidden fruit, but no one knows about Bart the Serpent and just why he tempted her in the first place.  Everyone knows about Adam and how he named all the animals, but everyone forgot his first wife Lilith ever existed.  And absolutely nobody knows what happened to the forbidden fruit and what would happen if it were found.  But that is just what Harold Grey, an otherwise average attorney, must do if he is to find true love and save the planet.  A humorous, philosophical romp, Naked in the Garden of the Serpent tells the story of the fall in a way never told before, temptation, betrayal and all.",
