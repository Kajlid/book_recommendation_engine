  "description": "6 CDs & Writable PDF Workbook  A paradigm is more than a feeling or a belief. It is an entire way of being a fundamental universal conviction that reverberates out into the universe.  In The Abundance Paradigm, Joe Vitale shows you how to make the profound shift from a paradigm of scarcity in which you have \"not enough\" of the things you want and need to a paradigm abundance in which you have more than enough of everything, at all times.  When you make this shift, you move beyond the Law of Attraction to the little-known Law of Creation and step into a world where you:  *Align with the universe automatically instead of working to make it happen *Manifest your desires spontaneously instead of thinking about it *Get what you want immediately instead of waiting for it to show up  , Joe guides you, step by step, through a series of extremely powerful techniques that will facilitate nothing less than a complete paradigm shift that happens in real time, while you're listening!  You will:  *OPEN a portal that enables ideas to flow into your mind freely and effortlessly *DISSOLVE all of the limitations that are currently compromising your growth and happiness *RECEIVE guiding messages from your subconscious alerting you to the below-the-radar issues that need your attention most *EXPERIENCE paradise right here, right now *ERASE all toxicity from your interpersonal relationships *ELIMINATE destructive hidden beliefs automatically, without having to examine or revisit them *ACT from pure, positive inspiration, instead of old, faulty programming *PROTECT your paradigm from harmful outside influences and interference *CLEAR your consciousness of negative judgment of yourself, and of others",
