My family moved, my ex took my friends when he left, and my job is suddenly uninspiring. There's a silver lining in here somewhere, I'm sure...It comes, eventually, in a strange package; a last-minute job that's slightly outside my comfort zone, a long way away. Dealing with a movie star can't be that hard, can it?He's hot, of course. And a mess, no doubt. Hates me and wants to be left to self-destruct alone, apparently. But it's my job to turn it around, turn him around and when I find myself falling for more than just the job, it gets tricky.The lights are better here, more magical, and I'm not sure if it's his lack of charm or the prospects for the future but I can almost taste that lemonade... or can I?\nBetween Takes is a slow burn steamy enemies-to-lovers, boss-assistant romance. It is the first book in the Kings of Screen series. If you enjoy irresistible damaged heroes and take no-nonsense heroines caught in a workplace romance, you'll love Between Takes.",
