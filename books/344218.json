  "description": "Previous Book: Cat's Eyes. Series Note: Although part of the Department 57 series, this title can be read on its own. Someone is killing vampires with a new drug and the only people who can discover the source are Svetlana Yevchenko, top model, and Jasper, head and chief designer of the House of Lebec--as well as the head of Dept 57 in France. Svetlana wants Jasper, and he wants her. They can have hot, screaming sex, but they can never give in to love. Or Jasper dies. And Svetlana with him. Jasper is cursed and through all the lives he remembers, no woman has survived the curse. Svetlana is the greatest temptation Jasper has ever tried to resist. And as this latest Dept 57 assignment throws them together, their resistance weakens to the point of total, steaming breakdown. The more they fight the attraction, the deeper it gets. But when the assignment is over they must face their fate. Again. [Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Menage (m/f/m, f/f/m), voyeurism.]",
