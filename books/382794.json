That's why he maintains the Hyacinth Club, a traditional men's club with a twist. The sophisticated men of the Hyacinth Club find their pleasure in this series of bawdy tales. Each tale is full of heat and love, showing what those Victorians got up to behind closed doors. There's a Scottish earl, Low, who falls for Stephen, a Texas rebel. Low is determined to remain in control, but Stephen stirs his blood, and Low is constantly fighting his baser urges, only to give in to love. There's Caleb and Ethan, a pair of old friends who find each other again after years apart, playing an intimate game of one-upmanship. Bored noble Thaddeus finds innocent young scholar, Drummond, and instructs in the ways of dominance and submission. Even Devlin himself, who thinks he's too old and set in his ways for love, finds time to dally with his friends Repressed? I don't think so! Join the Hyacinth Club for a sexy romp through the Victorian era today!",
