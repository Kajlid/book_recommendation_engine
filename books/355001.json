  "title": "Trump: The Best Golf Advice I Ever Received",
  "description": "The host and coproducer of the megahit reality show The Apprentice presents a unique collection of golf advice. From Palmer and Player, Mickelson and Vijay to Pat Boone, Stone Phillips, and even Yogi Berra, these players, teachers, businesspeople, and celebrities will help you play better and score lower.Everyone who plays golf has that little nugget of information they turn to on the course. But never before has such an array of golfing advice been pulled together in one place. Donald Trump, himself an avid—and very good—golfer, asked his friends, colleagues, and playing companions to offer thoughts on everything from the mental game to the swing to putting to playing golf the right way. And golfers being what they are, none could resist sharing words of wisdom.So here we find Vijay Singh telling us about playing “You don’t need to get your golf swing by going through video cameras and stuff like that. Just kind of go out there and find yourself.” Baseball Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith talks about not “Just learn to allow the club to do what it’s supposed to do . . . because the ball is sitting still.” Actor Michael Douglas has a specific routine to slow his tempo—he says his wife’s name, and doesn’t even think of starting to bring the club down until he gets to “Jones.”Taken together, these more than two hundred entries create a unique handbook, covering every aspect of the game—and ranging from the lighthearted to the deadly serious. Donald Trump’s book of advice is certain to take its place next to Harvey Penick’s Little Red Book as the ultimate in golf instruction.",
