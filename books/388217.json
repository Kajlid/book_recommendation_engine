  "description": "see book trailer:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8yMhjA...The guide is fully illustrated by manga Artist Heby and is written in an easy to follow A - Z format explaining everything a teenage vampire girl would need to know about living life as a modern Vampire.* What is fashionable to wear when eating out?* Fang maintenance & how to keep your claws sharp.* Should you let a boy bite you on the first date? Easy to understand clear advice is given to every day problems.Example: When you get an urge to bite: We all get those normal urges to bite things, and I must point out it is very normal, Claws are all well and good in a fight but a bite gives the extra advantage of getting a refreshing drink at the same time. Lots of girls worry about showing their Fangs in public believing that to show your fangs is rude, but don't be shy they can be a girls greatest asset (ok second greatest asset) if a boy is being rude to you, don't just snarl at him, just bite him! You are a vampire why do you think you have sharp teeth if not for sinking them into a boy that is being rude to you. Watch the book trailer on YouTube!",
