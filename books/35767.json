  "title": "Back from the Dead: The True Sequel to Frankenstein",
  "description": "What if... this morning, when you opened your newspaper, the headline startled your memories back to childhood Mary Shelley's Frankenstein Creature Found...Alive! What if Mary Shelley's Frankenstein was really a true story? Back from the Dead is a contemporary telling of the finding and revival of the thought-to-be mythical creature. The story follows Sergio Carerra, the scientist who revives the creature and brings him into the family of man. Through the creature's dreams and flashbacks to the 1790s, we view a unique perspective on the original story. We learn how the modern world sees the creature, and how he feels about his resurrection. Now that he is back, there are others interested in him for reasons not so apparent, and they will do anything to get what they want. Finally, after 180 years, we are about to learn the truth.",
