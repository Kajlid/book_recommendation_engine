  "description": "What impact can various research methods have on consumer psychology? How can they help us understand the workings of the consumer mind? And how can the field of consumer psychology best utilize these methods? In the Handbook of Research Methods in Consumer Psychology, leading consumer psychologists summarize key aspects of the research process and explain how different methods enrich understanding of how consumers process information to form judgments and opinions and to make consumption-related decisions. Kardes, Herr, and Schwarz provide an in-depth analysis of the scientific research methods needed to understand consumption-related judgments and decisions. The book is split into five parts, demonstrating the breadth of the classic approaches, contemporary approaches, online research methods, data analysis, and philosophy of science. A variety of leading researchers give insight into a wide range of topics, reflecting both long-standing debate and more recent developments in the field to encourage discussion and the advancement of consumer research. The Handbook of Research Methods in Consumer Psychology is essential reading for researchers, students, and professionals interested in consumer psychology and behavior.",
