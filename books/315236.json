Now he's returned home a hero, eager to match a face to the words, never expecting to be attracted to the girl. Ferociously. Urgently. Dangerously. Lula is off-limits, but for the first time in Vale's life, he is breaking protocol and following the orders of his heart, no matter the consequences.",
