I’m taking what is mine.\n Kaylie  Wherever I went, I heard it: the sound of a purring motorcycle behind me. They never bothered me or said a word. But I knew they were there because of him. Devlin McRae, the head of the local MC.  Being followed all the time like this was disconcerting. And lately, the bikes had been getting closer, less secretive, more obvious. What would I do if Devlin ever caught me?  Devlin  The first time I saw her she was too young.  I had to wait. I hated it, but I’d promised her mother I would wait for her to grow up. The sweet little waitress from Mae’s diner was going to be mine.  She just didn’t know it yet.  Wanted By The Devil is a brand new second edition of the first book I ever wrote! It has been expanded and rewritten, with a gorgeous new cover by Mayhem Cover Creations! It is the first in the Devil's Riders series that can be read as a standalone novel with no cheating and a Happy For Now (read the rest of the series for the HEA!) I am so excited for you to read it.
