It will fester and infect everything else around it. No living being can thrive much less survive under those conditions.\"She drank a big swallow of her wine.\"I'll punish you, if you allow me to.\"\"I don't understand. Punish me how?\" she asked.\"I'll give you physical pain, a spanking to start for example, to help alleviate your guilt.
