  "description": "The ideal lady wears lace, speaks quietly, and never under any circumstances fixes her own automobiles. But Gwyn Ruthers has never cared two snaps for the ideal lady. With the war to end all wars exploding across the Channel, she leaves behind her restrictive life as a chauffer’s daughter to serve in an all-female ambulance unit in France. Rambling over bomb blasted roads is far from the exotic travel she had in mind, but not even a handsome captain can distract her from the purpose at hand. Most of the time.Slogging through mud and a despair that no man should have to witness, Captain William Crawford stumbles over a woman—quite literally—who has the ridiculous notion to enter a man’s fight along the Front. Why can she not sit patiently at home like all the other complacent women?Bound together by circumstances beyond their control, Gwyn and William must fight to survive the battle raging all around them. Can their love survive or will it become another casualty of war?",
