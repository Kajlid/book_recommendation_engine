  "title": "In the dark",
  "description": "Nothing is simple, and no man is totally straight – not when the dark strips everything away and only physicality remains. Captured and bound then plied with an aphrodisiac – a sexy young philosophy student is tested on reality. In the dark he experiences such highs and lows, incredible pleasure and hideous pain. Using sensory deprivation to further sharpen his responsiveness, his notion of sexuality is teasingly challenged during a night that will change his life forever. This book contains explicit gay m/m content and is suitable for readers 18 and above.",
