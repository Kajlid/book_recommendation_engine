  "title": "The Bear Prince",
  "description": "The Bear Prince (and other fantasy folktales) is a collection of three folktales from a fictional universe. When small magics are real, what stories do parents tell their children at night? What tales do storytellers spin, so their listeners will toss them a few coins? Come, and find out...In \"The Bear Prince,\" being kind-hearted brings rewards, but being sensible brings greater ones. \"The Princess and the Sheep's Wool\" implies the priorities of royalty, when magic potions are a real threat. Meanwhile, \"The Jewel of Moon and Starlight\" is a tale of vanquishing an evil dragon with cleverness, bravery, and compassion. An Afterword provides adults with thoughts on the fictional culture that could spawn these stories, but they can be read to children as easily as any traditional fairy tale.",
