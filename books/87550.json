  "description": "First in the Royal Dynasty series. William of Marlowe and Elizabeth of Hurley loved each other from childhood and swore to marry no other. Their fathers had more practical and profitable intentions. William was told Elizabeth had gone to Ilmer to be married to Mauger and in his pain and rage took Mary of Bix to wife. Elizabeth, who had withstood starvation and beatings, yielded at last when a priest swore to her William had married Mary. But Mauger had taken Elizabeth for more than her moderate dowry. Soon her brothers were both dead and Elizabeth was heir to her father's lands. When Elizabeth's father died, Mauger moved his family to Hurley. And when he saw the rich lands of Marlowe across the river, he decided to marry his son to William's daughter, be rid of William, and have Marlowe too. William should have seen through Mauger's false front, but his heart and mind were paralyzed by the horrible thought of Elizabeth in Mauger's arms. And he nearly, so nearly, also became Mauger's victim.",
