  "description": "Haylee Daniels has landed a role in a Broadway musical about a down on her luck dancer who'll do anything for another chance at Broadway stardom. The only problem is, Haylee has never danced a day in her life.Thankfully, she has Chase Nolton, her leading man, and Broadway's premier choreographer, Carmine Romero to teach her all she needs to know. When Carmine suggests she dance nude in order to better understand a dancer's body, Haylee fears she may be as desperate for Broadway stardom as her character.This is a highly erotic short story about three people who find love and make it on Broadway.",
