  "description": "Alena Langley has always believed that life in another planet exists. But what she didn't expect was that an alien would visit her anytime soon. On a bright starry night while Alena was looking at the constellations, something big fell from the sky. It turned out to be a spaceship, opening in front of her, revealing a pale girl about her age, the latters skin glowing radiantly, beautifully in the dark. As Alena gazed into the gorgeous girls eyes that reflected the sun with its orange color, she knew in her heart that life would never be the same again.",
