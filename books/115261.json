  "title": "Destructive Emotions: A Scientific Dialogue with the Dalai Lama",
  "description": "In this timely discussion of troubling emotions, Daniel Goleman, a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ushers us into a meeting between the Dalai Lama and some of the foremost scientists and philosophers. This rich exchange between East and West, spirit and science examines such questions as why seemingly rational people commit acts of cruelty and violence, what are the root causes of destructive behavior, and whether we can learn to control the emotions that drive these impulses. The group fuses the insights offered by sophisticated Buddhist practices for transforming negative emotions with cutting-edge research in neuroscience, education, and psychology. As scientific coordinator and narrator, Goleman also introduces us to the personalities behind the debates as they develop ideas for further collaboration and research.",
