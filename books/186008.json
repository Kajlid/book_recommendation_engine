  "description": "Ethan fills a part of me that I never knew needed to be filled before. I give him something that he never knew he was missing.   Rule #11 â€“ I want to make you feel ecstasy at least once a day. At least. Maybe twice. Three times. All day. I want to be with you all the time, near you, next to you, inside you. I need you...  We all have our strengths and weakness. We're all good at something and bad at something else. This is why we need each other. This is why it makes sense for Ethan and I to be together.  I'm the good girl, the careful, cautious one, who thinks before she acts. Ethan is the bad boy, the risk taker, the person who jumps into action regardless of the consequences. Sometimes you can't wait to think before you act, though. Sometimes you can't be careful or cautious. And sometimes you need to know when a risk is too great, and when you should reign in your recklessness and consider the repercussions.  This is why we're perfect together. I'm sure there's a lot more reasons, but I think that's one of them.  No matter what happens, we're going to find a way to be together...",
