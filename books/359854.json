  "description": "Bad Boy? They’re a dime a dozen…But a Good Guy who’s only bad for me? Well…I’m not exactly the ‘take home to Mom’ type. I’m too outspoken and have never met an expectation I didn’t want to challenge.And to put it bluntly, my professional career of being an intimate relationships counselor doesn’t make for polite dinner conversation.Not that I care. I’m too busy changing the world, one healthy ‘yes, yes, yes’ at a time.But Chance Harrington? He’s built his career and reputation on being the ultimate gentleman. Politeness and chivalry are his bread and butter, kindness and goodness are the foundation of his image, and he mentors young men to be their best, one podcast at a time.We make no sense.But falling at Chance’s feet in the most embarrassing meet-cute ever seems to be working out. We knew the rules - just a little fun, stress-relieving excitement for us both. Nothing more. But one encounter leads to another… and another, and no-strings-attached becomes dinners, dates, and heartfelt conversations.Let’s just say I never thought it’d end up like this.I never dreamed the straight-laced gentleman image hid a man who could make even me blush. But he wants more.He’s after my heart. And the scariest part? I may just give it to him.Never Give Your Heart To A Hookup is a full-length romance with a Happily Ever After.
