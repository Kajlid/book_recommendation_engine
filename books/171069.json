But when she arrives, things begin to happen. She discovers not only is she a powerful witch, but so are all the people on her tour. As if that’s not enough, they tell her she was once married to the sexy laird who lived there in the seventeenth century. While exploring Rosestone’s ruins, she’s suddenly whisked back to 1603 by an ancient time stone from the Fae, and there, her adventure begins. Will their sizzling love affair rekindle after five hundred years? Or will Katie fall prey to Duncan’s jealous lover, who’s out to kill her and keep the castle for her own? Travel back in time to seventeenth-century Scotland, where this amazing story begins. You’ll find yourself lost in a breathtaking world of ancient magic, shape-shifters, witches, and of course, sexy angelic warriors. This is the prequel to the Ancient Echoes Series and is not one to be missed!",
