A lone survivor of plague receives a mysterious visitor; a prison planet tortures political prisoners by methodically manipulating their memories; a young woman uncovers the ghastly truth about the cryogenically preserved ancestor whos been thawed; a ships officer struggles with his suspicions about a shy drab woman taking passage aboard a ship of sun-worshipers. Tanith Lee explores these and other scenarios in her ever intense sensual prose.",
