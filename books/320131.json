  "description": "Paisley One minute I’m sitting at the ballpark chatting with a handsome stranger, the next his lips are on mine and sparks are flying, while the whole world watches us reach first base on the kiss cam. As the daughter of a former professional baseball player, I know all too well what it’s like living in front of the lens. Which is why I chose a career behind the scenes and away from the spotlight—that included my love life. Post-kiss, I never expected to see Cameron Taylor again and certainly not playing for my team. I might want him more than my next breath, but I’m not willing to jeopardize either of our careers to make it to second base. Cameron A rare day of relaxing at the ballpark turns out to be so much more. I can’t take my eyes off the gorgeous brunette sitting next to me. The only thing hotter than her perfect pink lips is listening to her talk baseball. Life throws me a curve ball when I get called up to the majors and Paisley Monroe is introduced to me as the team trainer. She’s unlike anyone I’ve ever met—beautiful, passionate, driven, and off-limits. When the media goes into a frenzy over our relationship, the rules change. But the love I have for Paisley goes beyond my love of the game, I don’t need the kiss cam to tell the world that she’s mine. I can do that all on my own.",
