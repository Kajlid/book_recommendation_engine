  "description": "The fifth book in the Elodie Fontaine series finds the young sleuth with enough mysteries to fill a thumb drive. First, an old friend from middle school shows up at Tallahassee High with a new name and a very new look. Then Elodie's half sister Carol shows up unexpectedly with a treasure that may turn out to be stolen property. And finally, her friend Margo's father seems to be mixed up in a legislative plan that—among other things—will allow discrimination against Elodie and her LGBTQ family. And then there is the upcoming prom to consider—an event that Elodie and her girlfriend Kelli are determined to attend together, despite the disapproval of Kelli's parents.",
