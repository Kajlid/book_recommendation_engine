  "description": "FENCEnoun,often attributive\\Ëˆfen(t)s\\a : a receiver of stolen goodsb : a place where stolen goods are boughtTwo years ago, the villainous Dr. Moreau plummeted to his death from 20,000 feet in the air. It was agreed a superhero had to be responsible; it was also agreed nobody was terribly concerned with figuring out which one.Nobody except Cassidy Moreau.Unimpressed with justice's selective blindness, Cassidy adopted her own ridiculous cloaked persona and set out on a revenge spree that would make her father proud. As the Fence, she's perfected her dad's technology and uses it to strip heroes of their abilities....which she then sells to the highest bidder. So far, it hasn't gotten her any closer to unmasking her father's killer, but at least it keeps her credit cards paid off.It's strictly business when she targets Manhattan's literal golden boy, the teen heart throb formerly known as Kid Midas. Problem is, Midas turns out to be more than just a set of washboard abs when he uncovers Cassidy's secret identity. His brief spurt of brain activity is mitigated by his belief he can get his powers back by appealing to her better nature, but whatever. Cassidy's got bigger problems. The guy she sold his abilities to is a crazed nihilist intending to use them to destroy the city. Who knew changing things to gold involved moving atoms around, right?As the city counts down towards doomsday, its fate rests in whether or not one hero can convince Cassidy to give a damn - preferably before she takes the nearest bus out of town.Don't hold your breath, Manhattan. FENCE: Sins of the Daughter is a serialized superhero novel that will be released in five biweekly installments of approximately 20K (or 80 pages) each, beginning on November 13th.",
