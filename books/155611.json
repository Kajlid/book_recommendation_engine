  "title": "Bloody Sexy",
  "description": "In this anthology writers of horror and erotica come together to blur the boundaries between stories that arouse and those that disturb. Horror writing and erotica are tangled more closely than is easily explainable; the same sensuality that can describe a knife penetrating a victim can be used to bring to life other forms of penetration. Horror erotica embraces life and death in ways other genres do not. There is an art in mixing the two and providing titillation in the midst of trauma. For those who want a little fear with their fun, take a trip to the shadows beyond the rainbow.
