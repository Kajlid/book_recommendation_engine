  "description": "India. The world's largest democracy. A cesspool of corruption and apathy. The people helpless, the media ineffective, the government indifferent and the crusaders forlorn. But all that was about to change... In 2014, just before India's massive general elections, a Member of Parliament accused of being involved in multiple scams is shot right outside his residence. ACP Rajeev Shekhar, an honest, upright cop with a tragic past and ACP Digvijay Raut, a veteran legend of the Delhi Police are tasked with investigating the murder. However, more such corrupt officials begin to die throughout the country, expertly assassinated by a mysterious vigilante they call 'the Man in the Trench Coat'. As the political pressure mounts, the CBI steps in to work with the Delhi cops. The vigilante, aided by the shadowy man known only as Control, steps up his game. As the situation escalates, the investigating lawmen find themselves embroiled in a web of scheming and deceit. Nothing- and no one- is what they seem to be... Who is the Man in the Trench Coat? Why does he do what he does? Who is the master manipulator called Control? And above all, can they succeed in their mission to free India from corruption? Inspired by the notion of vigilantism in popular culture, The Man in the Trench Coat is a story about the fight against corruption in India.",
