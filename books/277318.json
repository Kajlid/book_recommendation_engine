  "description": "On the border between the World and Elfland sits Bordertown, a place of half-lit neighborhoods of hidden magic, of flamboyant artists and pagan motorcycle gangs. Bordertown is a hothouse laboratory for the return of magic to the life of the World--and the return of life to magic. It's an attitude and a state of mind. It's where magic meets rock & roll.NOTE: all the \"Bellamy Bach\" stories in the Borderland series were written by the editor/Borderland founder, Terri Windling.",
