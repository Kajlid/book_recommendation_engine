  "description": "Three times the outlaw, three times the danger.  I’ll never forget the night they kidnapped me.  Snatched from my bed by three dangerous, demanding, gorgeous outlaws, ready to auction me off to the highest bidder.  Three dominant, possessive, tattooed men who stir something dark in me that I’ve never felt before.  Men who want to make me theirs, who want to take me in ways I’ve only imagined in fantasy - and who want to make that wicked, forbidden fantasy very real. It’s my chance to leave my innocence behind and embrace the darkest, dirtiest part of myself.  If I dare.  But time’s running out, for all of us. And pretty soon, they’re going to have to make a choice between the job they’re sworn to do, and my sweet submission.  Submit, to the three filthy, tempting, and gorgeous stone-cold killers who stole me away?  Yes please.   Taken Three Times is a dark, steamy read involving a mfmm menage romance with three utterly obsessed alpha heroes. This is all about her – no m/m. If you love over-the-top, slightly unrealistic, and wildly dirty romance with plenty of steam, this one’s for you! HEA with NO CHEATING!  For a very limited time, this book now also features two other stories of mine. Professor and Legal are included in the back of this book as special thank you for picking up this new release edition!",
