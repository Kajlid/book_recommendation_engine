  "description": "“If you would not be forgotten, as soon as you’re dead and rotten,either write things worth reading, or do things worth the writing.”               – Benjamin Franklin, 1706-1790 Benjamin Franklin narrated, and lived, the Great American Success Story. As America’s prototypical polymath, he excelled – and even defined – a number of professions including printer, writer, postmaster, scientist, inventor, public citizen, politician, and diplomat. He was a cornerstone in the foundation of the United States. He discovered practicable uses for electricity. He was America’s first great satirist. He founded the University of Pennsylvania. He invented bifocals. He was a legendary ladies’ man. He was all of these things... and he was so much more. Ben Franklin For Beginners , written and illustrated by Tim E. Ogline, opens the book on Benjamin Franklin and tells the story of his life and times with wry wit and whimsical drawings.",
