  "description": "Just like everyone else in the world, Beth Fitz-Richards failed to accomplish her New Year’s resolution. Beth couldn’t honestly say she had done her best but she didn’t think it was a failure worthy of death. What’s worse than breaking your New Year’s resolution? It might be having a serial killer follow your progress then shame you for not only failing to get in shape like you said you would but also being too out of shape to actually defend your self against the killer. Her would-be killer offers Beth a second chance at life and the chance to prove it’s a life worth fighting for. Will she prove him right or die trying?",
