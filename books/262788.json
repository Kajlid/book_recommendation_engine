  "description": "This is an epic poem that takes place In England. In England there is a law that prohibits foxhunting, but it is not enforced. Foxhounds that donâ€™t want to hunt are killed and are used as fodder to feed the farm animals, including foxhounds. Bred to hunt and kill foxes, one hound refuses to do so. He is a royally bred foxhound and he is rubbing the hunt master the wrong way. So much so, he is on the verge of destroying this disobedient hound. On one morning, the pack went one way, and as usual, this rebellious hound went the other way. The helper huntsman, called a whip, is sent to find the belligerent hound, and is told to drag the hound back if he has to. There is no doubt that this hound is doomed. When the whip finds the hound, he has a choice. Should he drag the hound back, knowing that the hound will be shot, or take the hound home knowing that he will be shunned and can never hunt again hunt with any hunt clubs. Along with this, his circle of friends will be lost. What does the whip decide? And what are the ramifications of each choice?",
