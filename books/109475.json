  "description": "For years, Seri’s simple people have lived under the thumb of the Athonites, a regal, erudite caste. She wants no part of politics, though; she simply wants to live in peace. But when she’s given the opportunity to work at the enemy’s castle, she takes it, not realizing that she is sealing her own fate. Prince Graeme is surprised to see the wild girl at court acting as a servant. He’s even more surprised when, during an important ceremony, she is decreed as his chosen bride – his Betrothed. As his Betrothed, she will give something long denied those of his lineage: relief from his age-old secret curse. As kingdoms come to war and Seri’s people begin an uprising, she will have to pick sides. Will she choose her own folk…or the mysterious prince that is slowly stealing her heart?",
