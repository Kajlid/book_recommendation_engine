It's his daughter's first year at Tulane, and single father McKinney is having a tough time adjusting to being an empty nester. He heads down to New Orleans to lend a hand in the investigation, but when his own daughter is kidnapped the gloves come off. Now, the forensic scientist must put down his microscope and venture into the Louisiana swamps for a showdown with a crazed killer.
