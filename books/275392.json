  "description": "Hello everyoneA story I've started writing now quite a while ago. Transported to another world, pretty standard fantasy setting with my amateur attempt to make it a bit dark but funny. There are Litrpg elements here but I do hope it's not too heavy and annoying. The fights should be interesting and aren't just numbers vs numbers. Contrary to the title the protagonist will be quite an offensive fighter.Ilea Spears is your average sarcastic kick-boxing fast food worker and soon to be student. She will be transported to another world rather conventionally and will be confronted with survival in the wild. There's magic, monsters and some numbers.Give it a shot and let me know what you think. I'm a beginner at writing and my experience is incredibly lacking. If you find yourself hating it early on, do convey your anger in a detailed comment or review :) I want to get better but without any feedback it's simply quite difficult.Thank you for reading.Quick update June 2019: Many complaints regarding the formatting, specifically spacing in conversations and of course the usage of the present tense in the first 36 chapters have been addressed. I'm of course learning by the day but compared to how it was before it should be an improvement at least.Chapters usually 2.5 - 3k wordsCover art by Kevin Catalan",
