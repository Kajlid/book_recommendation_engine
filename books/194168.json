  "description": "\"Something HUGE flexes joy here! This is the suicide by cop where banging cymbals rip the portal open! Poetry is the daily political at every mouthful of Siegell as dots connect dimension to dementia! Tell the funeral director I d like my coffin lined with these pages, preventing a death of the sleeping! Careful, nutjobs, this is a brother of the Vibratory Order! THANK YOU, Paul Siegell, for making some real live fricking magic for us!\" - CAConrad , author of Deviant Propulsion (Soft Skull Press, 2006) \"Paul Siegell's are smart, rich poems. Spectacular, defiant iconographs of cells mid-mitosis, a b-boy mid-break dance move, and more. Nine-to-five frustration and transcendence, train rides, road trips, teen tours, rock concerts, and sudden tragedies. Paul Siegell's poems are full of unexpected significances, each one balanced like a tightrope acrobat always on the edge of ruin. Fluent, aware, visual, wholehearted, Paul Siegell clearly sides with pleasure in the making of poems. Prepare to be challenged, entertained and astounded.\" - Jeff Oaks \"Paul Siegell's the most original poet in sound and sight to break into print so far this millennium. Siegell owns a megaphone in the contest to be voice of a generation.\" - Charles McNair , author of Land O' Goshen and Book Editor at Paste Magazine \"I'm always thrilled by Paul's work, especially when I can understand it!\" - Elaine Siegell , Paul's mom",
