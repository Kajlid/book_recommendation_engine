  "description": "Barely south of the North Atlantic Ocean is a nation of great wealth and beauty: An archipelago known as Mount Palsa; infamous for its secretive mystique. Moses Carmichael, however, isn’t even a blip on the radar of this place; instead stagnated by a miserable life with his cruel grandmother in Texas. That is until Dad comes into the picture. Vehement about reconnecting with his long-separated son, he offers Moses a stay with him on Dilaailah — one of Mount Palsa’s twelve surrounding islands. Here is where Moses becomes a new man; experiencing a lifestyle like nothing he’s ever imagined. But it’s not all glamour and glitz, this place is secretive for good reason.",
