  "description": "Nineteen-year-old Georgia survived four years of forced prostitution and drug addiction by clinging to the false hope that her brothers—unaware of her existence—would one day rescue her. The last thing Blackie, Judd, and Rebel McCassey expect to discover when they catch a young girl loitering in front of their garage, is that she's their younger, half-sister. Immediately, they want to help Georgia overcome her addiction and bring her into the family fold, despite her adamancy that she isn't good enough to be a McCassey. Used to handling things their own way, the brothers soon realize that this time, they can't fix things by throwing powerful right hooks, firing semi-automatic weapons, or simply saying, 'no worries'. This time, they need an outsider's help. But Georgia's skeptical, and doubt consumes her as her strength and confidence falter. Georgia knows her brothers will fight for her...but will she fight for herself?",
