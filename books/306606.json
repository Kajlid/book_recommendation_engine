  "description": "Rediscover this lovable classic in a delightful new illustrated edition of these warm and witty cat tales, first published over forty years ago.Animal lovers Doreen Tovey and her husband Charles acquire their first Siamese kitten to rid themselves of an invasion of mice, although they worry about the cat attacking the birds. But Sugieh is not just any cat. She's an iron hand in a delicate, blue-pointed glove; an actress, a prima donna, an empress of cats, and she quickly establishes herself as queen of the house. Thus enslaved, the Toveys try to minimize the chaos Sugieh causes on a daily basis: chewing up telegrams, tearing holes into anything made out of wool, and screaming like a banshee. However things get more complicated once Sugieh decides she's ready to become the perfect mother. Then she and her adorable kittens devote themselves to tightening their grip on the household. You'll share Doreen Tovey's enthusiasm for animals and her infectious feeling of joy toward all the creatures in her household. Surrounded by the friendly astonishment of the village characters who populate the neighborhood, like Father Adams, the local rectorâ€”the Tovey household is here again with its deep though sorely tried love of animals and its splendid portrayal of the country scene.The affectionate illustrations by artist Dan Brown, who specializes in animals, truly capture the essence of the Siamese, helping to bring both the stories and characters to life.",
