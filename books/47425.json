  "description": "It's the 41st Century, Terra has been gone for more than a century, but mankind has already spread across the stars, encountering millions of species, and become masters of space, their military might and superior technology used in the name of peace and universal stability. But now a relatively unknown race has conquered a large sector of Terran space and slaughtered billions of innocent civilians. 4007AD, the insectoid race known as the Jalic have been entrenched in a sector in the Andromeda Galaxy for nearly 200 days, and every attempt to wrest control from them has been rebuffed. The elite Pathfinders are called in with the hope of breaking the deadlock. As the regiment launches for the final battle to decide the fate of the capital planet, Nano Rimmo, they are struck by a vicious ion storm. Within the storm, the Jalic's primitive fighter jets reap a bloody toll, and force the regiment back to base. But one of their dropships, the regiment's 15th Platoon, is missing, shot down during the battle and left behind. The survivors are led by combat veteran Staff Sergeant Deef Alcott, and they set out for home. But there's a problem: they're going the wrong way! When they realise, they're a hundred kilometres behind enemy lines with no way home, except to fight the final battle that the regiment couldn't. To escape the Jalic, they must utterly destroy them, or they will not survive",
