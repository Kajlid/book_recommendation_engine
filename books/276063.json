  "description": "Who said life was a fairy tale? Because I’d gladly slice that jerk’s head off. \n\nI’m Vicky, though that’s not really my name.I never expected to end up half-naked in the woods with my guts hanging out. I didn’t plan to stumble upon the most powerful shifter clan in North America and three of the sexiest men I’ve ever laid eyes on.\nDominic, the fun and reckless new wolf.  \n\nSam, the hot doctor with glacial-blue eyes.\n\nAnd Gabriel, the intense, secretive alpha who wants nothing to do with me.\nMy real name is a one-way ticket back to hell, and my secrets need to stay buried like the girl I used to be.Sleeping Beauty, Snow White, Red Riding Hood—I can be all three.  I can use my powers to earn a place in their werewolf town, away from the bite of my past mistakes. I can use them—and their bodies—to survive.\nThe only thing I can’t do is fall for them.",
