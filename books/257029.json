  "description": "A catastrophe has befallen Hell. The great and mighty Lucifer has fallen prey to the most wicked of spells. He’s become…nice. Just using that word makes Gaia want to gag. The demon she fell in love with is not some pushover, polite, candy-ass, nice guy. She wants her big, bad Lord of Sin back. Can she, along with the minions of Hell, find a way to break the curse? And will they do it in time to celebrate the wedding from Hell?",
