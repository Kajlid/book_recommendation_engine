  "title": "La Hasil-Hollow Pursuits",
  "description": "La Hasil is a tale of pursuits for all that is hollow, empty and void. It is a story of a man, who in the blind pursuit of chastity, gave up his loyal and pious wife. It is a story of a prostitute, who was rescued by her newfound faith in Islam. It is a story of a son who never met his mother but was a reincarnation of all the goodness in her. It is a story of a daughter, who rejected the humbling surroundings her virtuous but poor mother could provide for her, and left in the pursuit of luxury, wealth and fame - no matter what the cost. But when the truth is revealed, no life will remain the same, and Allah will tell each soul what they had bargained for.",
