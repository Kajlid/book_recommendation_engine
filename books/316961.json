  "description": "People spend their lives searching for meaning and then dying a decrepit mundane. Some are a little more prominent than others but all are boring. My life was an endless reel of days, hours, and minutes. Life passed in slow motion and each day bled into the next.I wanted to stop being mundane but nothing called to me and Whitsborough has a way of sucking the extraordinary out of you. Now I’m handed a legacy and I feel like I’ve found my meaning. My life is no longer mundane and nothing is strictly black or white.It’s all vibrant splashes of red and Black Slaughter.",
