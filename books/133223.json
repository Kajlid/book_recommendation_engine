  "description": "Abren is washed ashore along the Welsh river Sabrina Fludde, inexplicably alone. Who is she? Where did she come from and where is her family? As Abren seeks answers to the unknowns in her life, she encounters several other characters, mysterious in their own right. The thread that weaves their stories together is the mystical river and it is the same river that, in the end, will link Abren to her past. Expertly grounded in place and character, legend comes to life in this first of a three-book arc.",
