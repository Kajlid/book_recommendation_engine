  "description": "A title in the Bristol Classical Press German Texts series, in German with English notes, vocabulary and introduction. Thomas Mann (1875-1955), was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929, and \"Tonio Kroger\" occupies a central position in his spiritual and artistic development. A study of youth, it draws together many strands of his life and the duality of his parentage; his abhorrence of discipline; and the influence of Schopenhauer and Wagner on his early phase of writing.",
