  "title": "The Peasant Marey",
  "description": "\"The Peasant Marey\" (Russian: Мужик Марей), written in 1876, is both the \"best-known autobiographical account\" from the Writer's Diary of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and frequently anthologized as a work of fiction. This \"double encoding\" arises from its often self-contradictory framing as both short story, narrated by the fictional prisoner Goryanchikov, and evident reminiscences by Dostoyevsky himself, as a way to evade censorship",
