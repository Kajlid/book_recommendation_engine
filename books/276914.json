  "description": "My life on Earth was falling apart. I had just lost my mother to a short and sudden battle with cancer and was still struggling to recover when my husband decided to inform me that he was leaving me for another woman. Couldn’t get much worse than that, right?  Wrong. Because then I was abducted by aliens.  I got lucky though, my story had a happy ending. Me and the other girls, we got rescued and taken to a beautiful planet to live deep in an uninhabited rainforest. As far as alien abductions go, it was all fairly picturesque. And that’s how I got a fresh start in life. Fresh except for my baggage, of course. But I’m an optimist and this time around I’m determined to get things right, to find my own happiness in life… Hell, maybe I’ll even find a little romance.  When one sexy, golden alien takes notice of me I think I’ve found what I’m looking for. But then his brother becomes smitten as well and that’s when things start to get messy. I’m not looking to enter a love triangle. I know the pain of a broken heart and I refuse to be the cause of one—or two, as the case may be. The only thing? Sharing my affection doesn’t seem to bother these guys. As a matter of fact, sharing seems to be their goal.",
