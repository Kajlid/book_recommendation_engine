  "description": "Patrick “Trick” Stavros is a soldier in the Night Horde SoCal, and he was a soldier in the US Army, once upon a time—a sniper deployed to Afghanistan. The club recently tasked him to use those skills, and the job he did for his club weighs heavy on him, just as the job he did for his country does. He’s struggling under the weight, and he’s beginning to crumble.Juliana Dominguez is a single mother who has just moved with her young daughter, Lucie, into Trick’s apartment complex. Juliana and Trick know each other a little, and share a mutual attraction, but she has rebuffed his advances. She knows about the Night Horde, and she wants a safer, more secure life for her daughter.Circumstances conspire to bring them together despite Juliana’s reservations, and they learn that they share some kinds of pain and can make each other stronger. Then, just as Juliana realizes that, with Trick, she and Lucie can have the security and stability they need, and also have something even more important—real, deep, meaningful love—the consequences of Trick’s club life threaten to tear it all away.Note: explicit sex and violence.",
