  "description": "Calvin Sumner is just trying to find a job, pass his classes, get into college, and maybe kiss a few boys if he can manage it. He never thought he'd find himself working in a cupcake cafe, or falling in love with his brooding, ex-military boss who has more tattoos than he has words to give.But Cas isn't going to complain. Not when he's finally making some money, doing well in his courses, has a pretty good sports scholarship in his future, and gets to kiss Dresden Gibson as much as he wants (and he wants to, a lot).",
