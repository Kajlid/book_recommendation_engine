  "description": "One night. That’s all Julian Caine offered. And heartbreak is my only souvenir. The morning after the most unforgettable night of my life, I wake up minus the man and plus one note. With my head held high, I’m determined to move on without the two men who broke my heart. My former fiancé who let me go easily without so much as a glance. And the staggering, gorgeous Englishman who made me scream incoherent words… All. Night. Long. When tragic circumstances bring Julian closer than ever, it comes with unyielding passion anda new proposal… but not the traditional kind, the no-strings attached kind. Tensions flare. Life-changing truths are revealed. New sexual adventures are explored. But the question remains, will we ever be more than ... more than this Interlude?",
