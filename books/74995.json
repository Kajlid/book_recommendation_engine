  "description": "It is considered a great privilege to be chosen as a \"seer\", one who can wander through Dreamspace; but Anna knows different. Ripped from her home, drugged and starved, she must work endlessly along with Thayus and Aisha, to prevent the worlds natural disasters, kidnappings and assasination plots. But there is a secret the Teachers have not shared, a secret that will change all their lives, and the lives of her family, forever.",
