  "description": "The dead are rising. People are dying. Civilization is collapsing.When the end finally occurred, everything about it was cinematic. The dead came back and ate people, civilization collapsed, and no one could do a thing.But Cyrus V. Sinclair couldn’t care less; he’s a sociopath.Amidst the chaos, Cyrus sits back and contemplates the gore stained streets and screams of his fellow man with little more emotion than one of the walking corpses. With his cache of guns and MREs, he rather likes the idea of hunkering down in his Seattle apartment while the world ends outside.All is well and good for Cyrus… until he meets up with Gabe, a belligerent annoyance, and the other inconvenient survivors who cramp his style and force him to re-evaluate his outlook on life. It’s Armageddon, and things will definitely get messy.“As people turn into monsters, a monster learns how to be human.... The zombie apocalypse meets its match in sociopathic survivalist Cyrus V. Sinclair, the antihero of Eloise J. Knapp’s THE UNDEAD SITUATION.”—Craig DiLouie, author of THE INFECTION“An action packed trip through the ‘zombocalypse’ with a unique character as our guide. Eloise J. Knapp has delivered very strong entry to the genre and I can’t wait to see what she comes up with next. Highly recommended.”—Timothy W. Long, author of AMONG THE LIVING“A roller coaster ride through terrifying and sometimes disastrous events… Knapp has managed to introduce some fresh new scenarios into her zombie tale with some unexpected turns.”—ZombiesDrule.com",
