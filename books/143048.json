  "description": "A prophetic novel on the Antichrist. This novel, written in 1906, takes place around the year 2000. Msgr. Benson's prophetic insight is exciting and accurate and gives the reader a glimpse into the immediate future and the growth of Antichrist. Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen says \"The three great apocalyptic pieces of literature dealing with the advent of the satanic are Father Hugh Benson's Lord of the World, Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamozov, and Soloviev's Three Conversations on War.\" The author was a Catholic priest, passionately eager to spread Roman Catholicism and fiercely antagonistic to alien creeds, even when tenderly devoted to many who might hold them . . .\" - C.C. Martindale, S.J.",
