  "title": "Duncan",
  "description": "The dude is big, really big, but he should be since he's been pounding the weights since he's been thirteen years old. Good looking too and even a great personality! So why is the hot man still single? Well the dude does have some baggage in the form of a sick sister and a smartass nephew living with him. But athletic, sexy Coach Scott Newman, his nephewâ€™s high school football coach, doesn't think it's a big deal and neither does Jameson Bransard, the big shot corporate troubleshooter where Duncan works, who's there to fix the company or shut it down. Who also happens to be tall, dark and handsome and liking the view when he sees hunky Duncan walking the factory floor. Thinking he doesn't have room for a relationship, there's two hot men doing there best to convince Duncan otherwise. This book (as well as its predecessors) has explicit male to male sexual situations throughout the book.",
