  "description": "Welcome to The Odditorium of Vincent Gheist, a museum of the macabre, a repository for relics, a home for the horrific. Meet Vincent Gheist, a man equal parts antiquarian, rock star, psychopath, and weird uncle. Join Gheist as he escorts a curious visitor through his strange collection in this horror anthology. Distilled from the essences of such great predecessors as H.P. Lovecraft, Tales from the Crypt, Night Gallery, and Twilight Zone, this selection of stories takes the reader on a journey to the weird, the strange, and the grotesque, but makes sure to line even the grimmest tale with a bit of dark humor. Grab your ticket and step right up for your guided trip through The Odditorium!",
