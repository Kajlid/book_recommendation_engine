  "description": "In the wake of the battle with the Gothi, Elle is struggling. Insecurity and chaos have taken a toll on her, and her heart longs for just a few moments of uninterrupted peace with the man she loves. When, once again, the Lakes are faced with even more trials and tribulations, she comes to the realization that in her own despair—completely unaware of doing so, she has left her man in doubt. And yet, even when she resolves to assure him of her feelings she fears her ex-boyfriend’s memories, which are stuck in his head, may rise to the surface. Asher Lake sets out on a mission to find his predecessor Grant—who exists in his wolf form in the woods of Brokenridge, all the while knowing that there is no answer to the Raven’s curse on his own life—at least none he will accept.

The only thing he has to do in the meantime—other than continuing to strengthen his position as leader to the Union and keeping his family in line, is convince the woman he’s willing to sacrifice everything for of just how much he cares. However, even when his adversaries continue to haunt him and more and more questions rise up to torment him, his true quandary lies in this—knowing just how to go about popping the question…again.",
