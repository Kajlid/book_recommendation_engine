  "description": "Dinner with vegetarian gangsta-rappers? Temper tantrums over \"old school\" designer logos? A last minute curling-iron crisis? All in a day's work for 27 year old Grace Daniels, the unwitting guardian to Maddy Malone, Hollywood's next teenage it-girl. Plucked from her Chicago day job as an interior decorator, Grace is thrust into \"starsitting\" at a local movie shoot when her Aunt Lana begs off sick one day. On the set, Grace meets Maddy, the temperamental if talented young starlet. Somehow navigating the outbursts and mood-swings, Grace manages to endear herself to Maddy and Maddy's only-too-happy-to-be-absent mother. So Grace can hardly refuse when they ask her to go with Maddy to Los Angeles as her adult accompaniment. And neither can Grace's boss, Jake, who thinks it will be a great opportunity for Grace to scout out the interior design market on the west coast.Once in LA, a bewildered Grace tries to keep her Prada-toting charge happy as she shepherds her through photo-shoots, radio interviews, and morning hangovers. When Grace isn't shielding Maddy from her \"fans\" or helping her dodge calls from her publicist, an exhausted Grace finds herself catering to the every whim of her almost A-lister. As Grace grows more accustomed to Maddy's ways, she begins to understand that despite all the celebrity stuff, Maddy really is just a kid struggling to look cool in front of her friends without getting crushed by the pressures of Hollywood. Inspired by a true story, StarSitter depicts how handling a young celebrity may be more hazardous than glamorous to one's mental health.",
