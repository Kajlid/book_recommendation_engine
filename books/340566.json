  "description": "In The Ministry of Motherhood, author Cheryl Lacey Donovan tackles the issue of single parenting with raw emotion, insightful lessons, biblical references and relevant life changing inspiration for mothers of all ages. It will minister to women who are living the life that Cheryl has overcome. The empowering refreshing messages will challenge mothers to look inside themselves for change. It will help them to identify the strongholds in their lives; public assistance, lack of education, abusive relationships, and tear them down with the help of the creator so that they can in turn take the steps necessary to build a better life for themselves and their children. Cheryl's transparency in The Ministry of Motherhood tears down all of the excuses for why single mothers can't succeed. It breaks away at all of the lies that are told about why single mother's are in their current situations; and it defies the statistics that say the children of single mother's will never amount to anything. The Ministry of Motherhood is Cheryl's journey from being a teenage parent to being a successful mother, author, talk show host, and inspirational speaker. It tells of Cheryl's transition from the devastation of an abusive marriage which left her with two sons at an early age to her testimony of deliverance and release. It gives an insightful look into what it means to be a \"mother\"; the hard choices, the sacrifices, the dreams deferred. The Ministry of Motherhood is more than just a mere book. It is a testimony of God's ability to do exceedingly and abundantly more than we could ever ask.",
