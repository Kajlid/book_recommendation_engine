The use of Magik has consequences, especially when Time is manipulated. Will the LightBringer’s Magik be powerful enough to heal the escalating tear in The Continuum?  As the Cosmic Dimensional Council intervenes to negotiate a new treaty, new allies and old enemies declare allegiances as sides are chosen in preparation for war. Ewallea, The Watcher struggles to contain prisoners to the Ent Realm and protect Earthling victims subjected to Lord Haydron’s wrath. While educating her new apprentice, Ewallea stumbles upon a long forgotten, ancient Magik truth. Can this Magik break the Curse forever, restoring her former life force and releasing Amellea from her fate as the next Watcher?  Meanwhile, Maleek, the RealmWalkers and Amellea forge onward to recover her three missing brothers rumored to be prisoners of TriMeNot, a vile TreeHopper with a weakness for a sticky-sweet, prissy little Nymph. Is she the secret weapon that can free the Triplets?",
