  "description": "Combining biting satire with a rare lightness of touch, cult webcomic Crocodile in Water, Tiger on Land holds up a mirror to our times - and to all those who live in India, complicit in the muddle, whether we stand to the left or right of the economic and political debate. Sometimes angry, sometimes funny but always insightful, CWTL is a strong, new critical voice. This volume contains their work from 2010 to 2014.",
