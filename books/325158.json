  "description": "Peter Carrot-Top is an adventure series novel that takes its readers into the land of Baja, where battles takes place between the mystical wizards of the forest and a boy by the name of Peter Carrot-Top. Peter Carrot-Top was the first ghost child to be born on earth when his parents were exiled from Baja eleven years ago. Peter developed extraordinary powers with the ability to make things disappear into a black hole. His parents tried to hide his powers and where they were originally from; but as Peter got older he started asking question about who he really was. His parents could no longer hide the fact that Peter was different from the other children, with his orange hair and extraordinary gift. Peter and his parents went to the secret forest to talk to the oracle and ask if they could enter back into Baja. Peter's parents told him of a time when the Carrot-Tops were considered royalty in Baja; of how Baja is a child's favorite place, with fields made of popcorn and plants that produce honey milk. Peter and his family were welcomed back only to learn that they had to save the world that once exiled them by battling twelve headed monsters, seven deadly wizards, and a host of mystical creatures to preserve and save the fantasy world every child should see.",
