  "description": "Ayo, bro, have you heard about, um, Clyde Clark and how he ingested the Biflocka psilocybin? It’s nuts, boyo. Became the biggest thing in South Florida since plastic pink flamingos. All people and everyone usin’, abusin’ that dope like madmen, addicted as all hell, yo. But it’s weird because Clyde isn’t even the type of guy to be involved in something like that. His friend Edgar, who he supplies, sold the drug like cray to everyone and made hella cash-flow, and I think Edgar’s old supplier, Tony-something or other, wanted to get back at them for it. Crazy, yo. Even the dang principal of Clyde and Edgar’s highschool was in on it, but it’s probably ’cause the principal showed Clyde botany and maybe adopted him after his mom died in an act of abuse toward whatever, whatever. Little does everyone know, though, aside from probably Clyde, is that this lil’ drugy McDrugersmith causes hella sickness to all of its users, including Clyde, the first one to try the dang thing. . . . A stunningly philosophical, coming-of-age debut novel by award-winning artist Kevin Klix. A fresh, new voice for the 21st-century generation.",
