  "description": "Two years have passed since the battle of Sangwa. The war between dragol and humans has ravaged all seven kingdoms of Terrianus, with Angweleth falling under the command of the most powerful dragol, Omni.  When Vannera, now a leader of a multi kingdom army, closes in on the principal Viritania, the latter deduces that Davydd must be on Teinerus searching for Feona's weapon, and that a certain fallen red star, may not be what the dragol thought it was all along.  In the meantime, two kings of Terrianus join forces to pursue the dragol, who have braved treacherous waters in search of an ancient box of power, created by a long forgotten deity - Order.",
