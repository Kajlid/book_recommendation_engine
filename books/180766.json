  "description": "Sparks fly when a charming rogue and a no-nonsense scholar struggle against an ancient evil in the Amazon jungle.  Time and time again Royce Storm has paved the way for Storm Industries' energy projects. But he meets his match with the elders from a South American tribe who refuse to grant him the water rights to build a power plant. After months of fruitless negotiations, an expert arrives familiar with not only the tribe's language but its customs as well. Problem is, the expert is a woman. She's beautiful, smart, and has \"No\" written all over her.  When Cataleya Wilkinson offers her expertise to Storm Industries, she's cautioned against succumbing to Royce's charming ways. But she needs the experience as translator and cultural expert to procure a teaching position at an eminent British university. So during the interview she hints at a lack of interest in men, even though it couldn't be further from the truth.  After weeks of daily contact with Royce Storm, her defenses start to crumble, and she struggles against an attraction she can no longer deny. But when an ancient evil threatens not only her virtue but her very life, she's forced to join forces with the charming rogue, even if it destroys everything she's worked hard to achieve.",
