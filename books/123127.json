  "description": "Wealthy orphans Adam and Cressida Bloom couldn`t be less alike. Adam can`t seem to help being exceedingly ordinary whereas Cressida, his glamorous sister, has a magnificent talent â€“ when she sings, even the birds stop to listen. Then Cressida is invited to perform at Fortescue`s festival of young talents and Adam tags along. But once the children arrive at the festival, in a mountain-top hotel, their terrific talents begin mysteriously to disappear. A piano virtuoso suddenly forgets how to play, a maths genius finds she can no longer multiply. There`s a sinister shadow that only Adam ever sees, a strange glow emanating from behind closed doors... With the help of an erratic ex-racing driver, dashing Amy Swift, Adam and Cressida rip-roar off through the mountains in Amy`s shiny racing car, the Silver Swift. They are in perilous pursuit of the dastardly talent thief! But from a hair-raisingly close shave with an avalanche to crash-landing a plane on a runway the size of a table, Adam never gives up. Perhaps he isn`t as ordinary as he first thought!",
