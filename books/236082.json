  "description": "He wasn't a gunfighter, just a young lawyer. They kidnapped his wife to force him to give them the map to the Iron Door Mine and the gold hidden there. She told the kidnappers that her husband would kill them. They laughed and made fun of him. Weeks later, on a fateful day in the Sonoran Desert, the young lawyer sat his horse and watched the kidnapper come toward him with a white flag on the barrel of his rifle. The kidnapper stopped and demanded he turn over the gold from the Iron Door Mine. The young lawyer told the kidnapper the only thing he would get was the bullet his wife had promised. The kidnapper made his play, and the young lawyer planted two bullets in the kidnapper's chest. The gold the Jesuits left in the Iron Door Mine has been sought for hundreds of years, but the truth is the young lawyer found it and took it away.",
