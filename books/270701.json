  "description": "Every road is the wrong road when you’re driving 291\n\nThis was not the first-time that rookie cop Michael Chambers had found himself stuck in this broken-down police vehicle while the rain bucketed down outside. In fact, this kind of ‘bad luck’ had happened almost every time he’d been assigned car 291. Usually, he’d get a flat, or the locks would jam or the damned onboard computer would freeze.291, though, had a bloody and tragic history which might explain why this piece of metallic crap seemed so intent on driving him crazy—excuse the pun. At first, he jokingly called it the demon car, but now he realized he may not be far off the truth. Something lurked inside this car and whatever it was, it meant him harm. He was beginning to seriously believe that if he didn’t fight back soon, this car might be the death of him. And he wasn’t about to let that happen. From international bestselling suspense author Susan May, comes a story of possession, desperation, and one man’s battle against an unknown enemy.",
