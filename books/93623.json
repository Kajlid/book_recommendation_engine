  "title": "Meatonomics: How the Rigged Economics of Meat and Dairy Make You Consume Too Muchâ€•and How to Eat Better, Live Longer, and Spend Smarter",
  "description": "Few consumers are aware of the economic forces behind the production of meat, fish, eggs, and dairy. Yet omnivore and herbivore alike, the forces of meatonomics affect us in many ways.Most importantly, we've lost the ability to decide for ourselves what - and how much - to eat. Those decisions are made for us by animal food producers who control our buying choices with artificially-low prices, misleading messaging, and heavy control over legislation and regulation. Learn how and why they do it and how you can respond.Written in a clear and accessible style, \"Meatonomics\" provides vital insight into how the economics of animal food production influence our spending, eating, health, prosperity, and longevity\"Meatonomics\" is the first book to add up the huge \"externalized\" costs that the animal food system imposes on taxpayers, animals and the environment, and it finds these costs total about $414 billion yearly. With yearly retail sales of around $250 billion, that means that for every $1 of product they sell, meat and dairy producers impose almost $2 in hidden costs on the rest of us. But if producers were forced to internalize these costs, a $4 Big Mac would cost about $11.",
