Obsessed with memories of his father’s sad life, John becomes even more depressed. Mindy Wertimer is the neighborhood outcast, an awkward girl who dares to fight back when the bullies taunt her. When Mindy attempts to be friendly to John, he is drawn to her odd personality; but he isn’t quite sure what to do about it. This is a coming-of-age short story about death, music, motorcycles, and bullying. Emerging author C.C. Alma has once again written a story with full of heart, humor, and drama.",
