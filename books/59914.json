He's been dead a year and a half though, and she's beginning to consider the possibility of dating again. She sticks to vanilla at first, but quickly realizes she's going to need more. As she's considering the idea of finding someone who would enjoy hurting her without requiring her submission, her life is complicated by a Dom who pushes all of her buttons.Safeword: Davenport is the first half of Dana's story, it's the personal part of her journey, and has a Happy for Now ending. Safewords: Davenport and Chiffon is scheduled for release August 3, 2012, and will give the rest of her story.Warning: This title contains graphic language, consensual BDSM, bondage, intense sensory deprivation, extreme electrical play, and the use of toys including clamps, canes, plugs, cages, paddles, whips, and floggers.",
