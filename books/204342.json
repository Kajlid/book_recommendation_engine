But an accidental meeting with an earl changes everything.... Soon, beautiful Bree has established herself in Society. She hopes no one will discover that she once drove the stage coach from London to Newbury...or that she returned unchaperoned with the rakishly attractive Max Dysart, Earl of Penrith. Bree's independence is hard-won: she has no interest in marriage. But Max's kisses are powerfully--passionately--persuasive!",
