  "description": "Survival was just the start…we’ve got a way to kill off every zed in the world. We just got to find a way to get it out there.Now I know why commanders all look like old men. Surviving ain’t easy; staying human is even harder.Some gave up. We came across a female gang called the Cock Blockers and their “choke point” still gives me nightmares. We fought a biker gang that call themselves the Mongol Hordes and make ol’ Genghis look like a pussycat. And we met a group of Amish who have extreme ideas on damage control.We got a new problem now. Ella said to me, “When the world died, we all became family.” Guess that applies to the zombies as well.Because Cindy’s been having strange dreams ‘bout a guy who calls himself King Death. Guess it’s a psychic connection, because we got reports of this guy heading out east, with his Queen and a nightmare in her womb. Yep, the unborn undead are coming to Snareville.The fight’s coming to us. Coming home, to Snareville.“D. M. Youngquist’s SNAREVILLE sinks its teeth into the reader’s jugular—a horrific, mordant, lean, page-turning ride dissecting the denizens of a backwater burg besieged by a zombie plague. The best part—aside from the gruesome action—is that you come away caring about these people in unexpected ways. Bite off a chunk of SNAREVILLE today—you won’t be disappointed.”- Jay Bonasinga, National Bestselling Author of PINKERTON’S WAR, FROZEN, and PERFECT VICTIM.",
