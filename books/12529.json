  "description": "Beck revisits territory familiar from his debut novel, He's the One (2003), a romantic comedy in which his protagonist, Daniel, a sometimes drag queen, gardens by moonlight in the hope of attracting the attentions of handsome neighbor Blaine. Now in the aftermath of their romance, ex-lover Daniel (who's very out) is busy acting straight in the soap opera Secret Splendor, while Beck presents the Manhattan milieu from the point of view of closeted ad executive Blaine, who's adjusting to the breakup while working on a key cosmetics account with signature model Sheila, his ex's best friend. While he's preparing to head up his client's new in-house agency, Sheila's trying to make time in her photo shoot-filled schedule to get married, and in the middle of all these major transitions, Blaine decides to father a child with his best pal and learns that gay fatherhood is a man-magnet.",
