Hill, The Zero Bomb is a startling science fiction mystery that what do we do when technology replaces our need to work?\nThe near future. Following the death of his daughter Martha, Remi flees the north of England for London.

Someone is leaving coded messages for Remi across the city, and they seem to suggest that Martha is not dead at all.Unsure what to believe, and increasingly unable to trust his memory, Remi is slowly drawn into the web of a dangerous radical whose '70s sci-fi novel is now a manifesto for direct action against automation, technology, and England itself.The deal? Remi can see Martha again - if he joins the cause.",
