  "title": "Mana Pounamu: New Zealand Jade",
  "description": "Pounamu is the beautiful green stone that traditionally served Maori as tool, weapon, adornment and currency. More recently it has been the subject of dispute between Ngai Tahu and the Crown. That dispute was settled with the return of the resource to Ngai Tahu in 1997. Under Ngai Tahu, a long term management programme is now in place that includes research into all aspects of the stone. The initial results of this research, conducted by Russell Beck and Maika Mason, are incorporated in this book. Other aspects, such as origins and natural occurrence, names and varieties, human history, both Maori and Pakeha, Maori myths and legends associated with pounamu, physical properties and the methods evolved for processing and carving it are also discussed. This book looks at jade in all its aspects. For carvers, jewellers, rockhounds and students it will be invaluable -- and for all those who are interested in New Zealand's history, it tells a turbulent and fascinating story. Mana Pounamu is the fully revised and updated edition of New Zealand Jade, first published in 1984.",
