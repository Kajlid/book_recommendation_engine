  "description": "Nina's twin sister Sher has been groomed to be an Inherited Servant since she was six years old. At twenty-eight, she will be given to a vampire of the Council's choosing and serve him up to 300 years. While Sher insists that Nina is no less service-oriented than herself, Nina does not see any correlation between her own desire to pursue a career as a nurse and her sister's to be the slave of a blue-blooded vampire, where she is allowed no will or dreams of her own.It's 1941 and Nina signs up to serve with the Australian Army Nurses Service in Singapore. What happens to her when the city falls to the Japanese will shatter Nina all the way to the soul. But fate seems determined to give her more than she can bear. When her sister dies in a car crash, Nina is informed that she must take her place as an InhServ. She will be given to Lord Alistair, a vampire who sees Nina as his property, to do with as he pleases.Even as she rages against her fate, she is baffled at Alistair's insistence on having her as his servant. Especially when the Council offers the Queensland Region Master the option of another InhServ with all the proper training to support his political needs. But that's not the most confusing thing about her new Master. The ways in which he commands her surrender to him leads her to a terrifyingly different understanding of her will and her dreams. By binding herself to him, can she become whole again, but in a way she never expected?",
