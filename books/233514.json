  "description": "I am not, nor have I ever been, nor will I ever be, a good man. If you are hoping for a story with an asshole hero who is basically good, close this book, go find a Veronica Del Rosa novel, and quietly forget about me. My name is Nefarius Judge. I had a mother and, I assume, a father who did not give me their surnames or a family name. Instead, they named me according to my destiny. So let me put this to you as indelicately as I can, and let you judge if this is a story you can consume. I have murdered men, women, and children. I have stolen, beaten, raped, tortured, and terrorized. And I do not feel regret or remorse for anything I have done.Content Warning 18+ Explicit violence, taboo erotica, rape. M/M and M/M/F.",
