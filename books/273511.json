  "description": "Book Summary Beasts or Men. Friend or Foe. Truth or Lie. Everything has a counterpart. There’s always another side to a coin and to a person. Though, with these boys, I’m not sure if there’s any light left in them. Maybe once upon a time they had a tender side. One that allowed mercy to lead their judgment… But that didn’t exist within them anymore. Something snuffed out their brighter side and I wanted to know what it was. They were the most stunning kind of men within the world’s standards. But I saw what the jaded eyes didn’t. Under their beauty lied beasts of suffering. I noticed, so my bullies made me their target. They lashed their anger out on me. My pain excited them. I should’ve ran. I should’ve been smarter than this… Yet, I couldn’t back down. I couldn’t let them win. With how messed up I was, part of me craved their cruelness. Longed for their attention—even if it was only negative. Whether this mistake ends me or not, I’ve never felt more alive. Now, it was just unraveling their secrets to help me win this sick and twisted game.",
