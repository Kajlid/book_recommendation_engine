  "description": "Blind dating for the digital age. What could go wrong?When my best friend asks me to test his new dating app, I'm not sure it's a good idea. After all, I'm moving out of the country in six months. What's the point?But he insists it's just to help him out, so I give it a shot. Plus, the mystery of it is kind of fun. There are no photos until you've been talking for thirty days, so it's all about the connection.What I didn't expect was to immediately hit it off with a bookish charmer on the app at the same time as someone pretty similar in real life. Two women? Why couldn't this happen when I wasn't about to leave?Now that I thought about it, BookishDreamer from the app reminds me a lot of Claire from the real world... wouldn't it be crazy if they were the same person?Nah. What are the odds of that?Fans of You've Got Mail will love this mistaken identity rom-com! Get ready for loyalty, laughter, and happily ever after in the second standalone book of the First Comes Love trilogy!",
