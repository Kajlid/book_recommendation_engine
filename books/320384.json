  "title": "Dr. NO: The Discovery That Led to a Nobel Prize and Viagra",
  "description": "In 1998, Dr. Louis J. Ignarro was awarded a rare and coveted Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking discovery of nitric oxide (NO) and its many critically important biological actions. But his work goes far beyond the development of Viagra. It has never been more urgently relevant to the world than it is today, as clinical trials are underway that involve using inhaled NO to treat patients suffering from COVID-19. Most Nobel laureate books have focused on the science. But in this fascinating and timely memoir, Dr. Ignarro opens up and shares intimate details about himself and his journey, his amazing accomplishments and heartbreaking setbacks, both in science and in life. This isn’t just a scientist’s story, it’s a quintessentially American story. Only in America could the child of uneducated Italian immigrants start out a struggling student barely able to speak English, and go on to win the Nobel Prize.",
