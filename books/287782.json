She’s uptight, controlling, and impossible to please. The worst part? Faith can’t stop thinking about her.  When Faith discovers a side to her new boss that she never expected, it becomes clear that behind Eve’s strict facade is a passionate woman bursting to break free and make Faith hers. Faith knows all too well what it’s like to keep part of herself hidden. And she finds Eve and the sweet surrender she demands irresistible.  But as they confront their long-suppressed desires, Eve and Faith must keep everything between them secret or they risk losing everything. Eve is locked in a custody battle with her ex-husband, and he isn’t afraid to play dirty. As the stakes rise and fear threatens to drive them apart, will Faith and Eve find the strength to stand together?  Freeing Her is the fourth book in the bestselling Irresistibly Bound series.
