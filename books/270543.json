  "description": "A Nice Place to Live.  A Nice Place to Die.  Someone is killing old people. The quaint and quiet Sunny Side Up Retirement Home is known as the last stop on a life journey before entering the pearly white gates of Heaven – but now it has become the doorway to Hell. On a cold and rainy night, an evil, soulless Killer roams the Retirement Home hallways, forcing intended victims to share their life story before he decides whether they live or die. Their stories unfold with many twists and turns, revealing their innermost secrets of lives filled with happiness and sadness, joy and pain. As the number of murdered residents increases, it becomes apparent that the Killer is treating death like a game. Each killing has a beginning, middle, and end story as the killer plays “cat and mouse” with each person. Acting as both their Judge and Jury, is this some sort of a random murderous game, or a night of planned and bloody revenge? Or maybe something else? And why old people? For the elderly people living in the Sunny Side Up Retirement Home who are part of this blood- filled nightmare there is only one ending – death. Written by Joe Janowicz, Creator and Writer of the BLACK MAN-WHITE MAN comic book series and soon to be released The DREAMER comic book. Edited by Elly Stevens.",
