Her entire life is wrapped around caring for her twin, Kylie.As the New England winter sharpens both sisters know that Kylie will not see the spring. New neighbor Aurora Lowell is immediately sympathetic, helpful … and alluring. But Hayley has no time for that either.It’s a completely different side of Aurora that Hayley experiences when she chances to open the mysterious book near the firelight and muses aloud the vaguely familiar words that appear on the old pages…Karin Kallmaker combines a cat named Bast, a magic book, and new romance in an unforgettable story of loss, love, and hope.",
