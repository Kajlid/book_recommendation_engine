  "description": "Tracing runemagic as a Pyromancer is a lot like being burned alive. So why does it feel so amazing?  Jaxon is an elite Warrior who has lost the most precious thing in the world.  Dionna is an average Pyromancer — a fire-wielding sorceress — hoping only to pass her Academy Assessment.  But all of Dionna’s concerns become trivial when the Academy is attacked by the Silithik Hivemind: a race of monstrous insects that kill most of her fellow students in a savage sneak attack.  As one of the few survivors, Dionna is thrust into a Dragon Quintelaide, an elite fighting unit made up of each of the fighting professions. She knows she’s not ready for such a drastic promotion — and the men she’s with, led by the massive Warrior Jaxon, know it too.  Yet Jaxon feels strongly protective of Dionna. And he can't shake the feeling...  As the war against the Silithik is reignited, Dionna needs to convince her Quintmates to trust her… while first learning to trust herself. Can she prove her worth as a Pyromancer? Or will Jaxon and the others abandon her for their own selfish mission?  DRAGON ORIGINS is the new Reverse Harem Dragon Shifter Romance series from Ruby Ryan. The prequel series to the GRYPHONS VS DRAGONS series, it has heart-stopping medieval warfare, an exciting and unique magic system, and all the steamy romance you’ve come to expect from a Reverse Harem. With five dashing men to choose from — the mighty Warrior Jaxon, the thoughtful Frost Mage Arthur, the precise Ranger Harry, the easy-to-smile Tinker Maze, and the sly and cunning Shadow Ryon — who will win Dionna's heart?",
