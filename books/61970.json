Then again, she never imagined waking up in a medieval tower with her fairy godmother hovering over her.Hope’s been given a new lease on life – if she can figure out the curse on the maiden Rapunzel, she’s free to live out the rest of her days in Scotland in her new body.There’s a few problems, of course. For one, her hair is enchanted to grow at the slightest hint of sunlight. And her handsome prince? Not so handsome. But he’s accompanied by a big, burly Scotsman who makes Hope’s new heart flutter wildly. And with Callum’s help, she just might lick this curse thing.Once she stops licking Callum’s muscles, of course…This novella (26,000 words – about 100 pages) contains explicit scenes, a strange fairy godmother, and some unusual light bondage play.",
