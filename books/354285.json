  "description": "HIGH HOPES AND SOUR NOTESAfter Momogaoka Music University’s festival, Classic Life magazine runs a big story on Shinichi’s amazing conducting performance. But since graduation, he’s feeling frustrated–and not because he still has a fear of flying (despite the work of a determined hypnotherapist!) Shinichi wonders what the future holds. Then a chance meeting leads the music prodigy into a whole new direction . . . in Japan. Meanwhile, when Nodame visits Shinichi’s family, no one escapes unscathed. Maybe that’s why the friendship between Nodame and Shinichi is threatened–and could mean the end of Nodame’s Cantabile!",
