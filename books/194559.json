  "description": "Kolson Hart and Gabriella Martinelli...destined to be together, fated to be torn apart. After avoiding his father for years, Kolson knew asking his father, Langston Hart, for a favor would be like selling his soul to the devil. Only the devil wants more ... more than Kolson is willing to pay. But some promises can't be broken, not without losing what's most important. For Kolson, that's Gabriella Martinelli. Left with two choices-pay up or risk everything-Kolson's only way out is to do something drastic, something so monumental not even Langston will be able to interfere. The question is: Will it be enough to guarantee Gabriella's safety from his father? Kolson freed Gabriella from her past, and now he's risking everything for her again. Will she be able to save him from the demon that hunts him? Or is fate too strong for them to fight?",
