  "description": "An atmospheric story about violinist Grace and her immoral passion for her friend's new girlfriend. Sphinxlike Bonds portrays Grace's struggle against her feelings, along and alive with music and sensuous detail. “Hailey was doing things to her body Grace couldn’t understand. The images of her assaulting Grace’s vision were enough to prove that Hailey was dangerous to her peace of mind. She didn’t know what Hailey’s play was but her eyes lingered a little too long on Hailey’s messy hair and pouty lips. She knew then that she was a goner.” @firouzmedia",
