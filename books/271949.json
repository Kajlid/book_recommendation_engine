  "title": "Never Go With Your Gut: How Pioneering Leaders Make the Best Decisions and Avoid Business Disasters",
  "description": "Avoid terrible advice, cognitive biases, and poor decisions. Want to avoid business disasters, whether minor mishaps, such as excessive team conflict, or major calamities like those that threaten bankruptcy or doom a promising career? Fortunately, behavioral economics studies show that such disasters stem from poor decisions due to our faulty mental patterns—what scholars call “cognitive biases”—and are preventable.Unfortunately, the typical advice for business leaders to “go with their guts” plays into these cognitive biases and leads to disastrous decisions that devastate the bottom line. By combining practical case studies with cutting-edge research, Never Go With Your Gut will help you make the best decisions and prevent these business disasters.The leading expert on avoiding business disasters, Dr. Gleb Tsipursky, draws on over 20 years of extensive consulting, coaching, and speaking experience to show how pioneering leaders and organizations—many of them his clients—avoid business disasters. Reading this book will enable you to:Discover how pioneering leaders and organizations address cognitive biases to avoid disastrous decisions.Adapt best practices on avoiding business disasters from these leaders and organizations to your own context.Develop processes that empower everyone in your organization to avoid business disasters.",
