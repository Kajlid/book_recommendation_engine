  "description": "From ghosties and ghoulies and long leggity beasties…Something evil stalks Commercial Street on a festive Halloween night. Private investigator Alex Peres, however, has her mind focused on fun and perhaps romance. Only in the cold light of morning does word spread of a gay man’s murder. Worse yet, the guilty perpetrators could be one of their own.…And things that go boomp in the night…Beset with her own worries, Alex trusts local law enforcement to investigate. They are, after all, the professionals. But when the detective-in-charge turns his attention to Alex’s friends, she agrees, reluctantly, to do a little poking around of her own. It doesn’t take her long to find more questions than answers.…Mae the guid Lord protect us! Greed, passion, hatred, fear: which human failing explains the crime? Just as matters begin to make sense, a second killing in the night sends Alex spinning in unexpected directions. Her own topsy-turvy affairs don’t help. If she doesn’t think fast, she may not be able to save a third victim: herself.",
