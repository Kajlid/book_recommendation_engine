  "title": "Forget the Glory",
  "description": "Because of a scandal back in England, Captain Rowan DeMayne, son of an earl, was forced to join the 43rd Light Dragoons, whose seven years in India were mainly spent parading in splendid uniforms on matched chestnut horses. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Mary, widowed twice, is determined to improve her lot, and will eventually become lady's maid to Rowan's \"beautiful shell\" of a wife. Then at last--the 43rd is going to war! Rowan joyfully announces this on horseback to a stunned ballroom. While the over 600 men and 750 fine horses journey through exotic and dangerous terrain to relieve the decimated troops in the Crimea, there'll be a cholera epidemic and sandstorms, deaths and one pathetic desertion, and Rowan will battle storms within: marital disillusion; nightmare guilt about his (honorable) refusal to prevent the torture death of a bandit's girl; doubts about the glory of war; and his inexplicable attraction to the lowly Mary.",
