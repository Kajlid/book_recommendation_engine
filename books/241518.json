  "description": "I have a secret …   I don’t care if you like me or not.    Insatiable lust for power and control runs thick in my veins. My father served as President of the United States of America—and his father before him. Montgomerys are born to lead and rule, to fear nothing and cower to no one, to make allegiances, not friends.    But I digress.   With a senate campaign about to launch and presidential aspirations at fever-pitch intensity, imagine my dismay when my strategist tells me I need to “settle down” with a “nice girl” in order to appeal to my constituents.  Enter Rowan Aldridge, a head-turning stunner with a charm school walk, Jackie O. refinement, and a well-connected family.    She’s perfect.   So I’ll do what I have to do, make her believe what I need her to believe, and as soon as the campaign’s over and I’ve secured my senatorial seat, I’ll release my pretty little butterfly back into the wild.    But this isn’t about all of that.    This is what happens when a villain falls in love.    AUTHOR'S NOTE 1: This book is SUPER LIGHT on politics. Like ... extremely. All characters and parties are 100% fictitious and not based on anything you currently see on TV or read in the news. Promise!  AUTHOR'S NOTE 2: Dark Promises is a full-length standalone romance and a spin-off of Dark Paradise. You do NOT need to read Dark Paradise first. However, for a limited time, I've included Dark Paradise + Bachelor, books in which the hero of this book has showcased his delicious villainy. :-) All books are full-length standalones. Rest assured that if Dark Promises ends around 30%, it is still a full-length novel.",
