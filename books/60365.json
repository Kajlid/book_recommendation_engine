  "description": "Second in the epic paranormal trilogy, this has all the heat, atmosphere and feudal background of Fallen, and a love triangle to rival Twilight.Katelyn had only been in Wolf Springs a few weeks before she was attacked by a werewolf. And now she carries that creature's curse in her veins.But she's not alone. Wolf Springs is home to werewolves. And they swear that it wasn't any of them who bit her. Changing humans without permission means the death penalty, and they're none too happy about Katelyn.The only explanation is that there's a monster on the loose - something wild and uncontrollable. Because Katelyn has some of its power.And two guys want Katelyn: one dark and mysterious, yet perhaps the perfect confidant; the other ferocious and forbidden - a werewolf that she can't keep her hands off of.",
