  "description": "Charlie is just your average teenage boy living a normal life. Until it flips upside down. Learning you're adopted is hard enough but learning that your parents are genius scientists that are labeled crazy for their work? That's an entirely new level of insane.Add on the bombshell of learning that what you've been taught to believe about the universe is wrong, and you've got one heck of a headache.When Charlie gets an opportunity to meet with his real parents and get his answers, they not only change his life and world view, but they also give him a choice. A choice that will irrevocably change his life.*Charlie's New Life is the first book in my YA Sci-fi series where you go on adventures in space and follow our teens through struggles, disappearances, and then watch them come up with amazing plans to solve big problems. Young people can do some amazing things when given the opportunity.*",
