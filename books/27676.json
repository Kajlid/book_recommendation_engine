There is one thing that could make it better, a strong, warm, male body to help her make it through the occasional lonely night. No strings, and no relationship, thanks. Just a little fun with a perfect stranger. And there's no more perfect a stranger than Rand. He's tall, blond, unattached, smokin' hot, and looking for the same thing Rachel wild, abandoned sex with no limits, no last names, and no complications-until Rachel's eldest son gets in trouble in class.
