Bragg to Harvard Business School, the NFL to Fortune 500 companies. Moawad’s mission is clear: motivate the motivated. Now, for the first time ever, Moawad shares the formula he has exclusively used to help these elites with everyone. It Takes What It Takes shows you how to deal with even the most challenging circumstances—and thrive. Moawad reveals how top performers hone their competitive edge by effectively managing both negativity and failure as well as positivity and success: Neutral thinking is the key.Neutral thinking is a high-performance strategy that emphasizes judgment-free thinking, especially in pressure situations. It acknowledges that the past happened. However, the past isn’t predictive. If you can absorb and embrace that belief, everything can change.Down-shifting your brain into neutral takes practice. But once you get the hang of it, you can go to the truth on a dime. You can deal with the facts at hand. You’ll feel calmer, more aware of the situation as it unfolds, moment to moment. And the athlete—or employee, or spouse, or parent—who’s calmer and more aware succeeds.",
