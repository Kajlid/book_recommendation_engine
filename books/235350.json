  "title": "Magic for a Rainy Day",
  "description": "Set in Scotland, Ireland, and the Pacific Northwest, these five stories share three things: a little rain, a little fantasy, and a lot of heart.In “Sidewynd,” Sky Patel balances life between Edinburgh and its mirror in the faerie realm. Until the balance breaks.In “The Flat Above the Wynd,” Sky’s inherited responsibilities double when past mistakes come back to haunt her.In “Banoffee Pie and Black Pudding,” Alyssa Granville’s troubles begin with a strange gift from a stranger Irish man.In “(Not a) Fairy Tale,” a bullied teenage girl learns a startling truth. But fairies don’t go to high school...do they?In “They Stole My Love Last Night,” Celtic music, fairies, and ghosts collide, turning a bitter story sweet.And in these pages, a rainy day might bring excitement with a whiff of danger. Or the kind of magic that brightens your week.",
