  "description": "Pioneer, big-game hunter, socialite, and lover, Bror Blixen was a giant in a land of giants. As the subject of much gossip and misinformation, Blixen was painted as a ruthless and indiscriminate philanderer; the letters in this volume reveal a man endowed with a keen wit, great courage, and a deeply felt love of the Africa that became his home. Blixen arrived in British East Africa with his young wife, Isak Dinesen, in 1913 and carved a farm out of the wilderness, going on to become one of the truly great big-game hunters of his generation.",
