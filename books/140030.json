  "description": "Welcome and good tidings, ladies, gentlemen, and all manner of upstanding, sentient beasts.The book you hold in your hands (pinchers, tentacles, paws, etc.), is a guide to avoiding the more common pitfalls that appear after parting ways with lady luck. You need not be duped by a collection of rats in an elaborate costume, dressed as a handsome suitor, or experience the embarrassment so many have already endured after bringing their ordinarily well-behaved, large sea mammal to an art gallery only to see cultural treasures defiled by inadvertent clumsiness arising from a frame better built for the confines of Poseidon's realm. More than five hundred unfortunate results of the manifold paths our life may offer have been helpfully diagramed for you along with positive affirmations of this veil's wonders and much more!Alexander the Great once remarked that \"upon the conduct of each depends the fate of all\" and his words may be taken as injunction to obtain this volume for your very own to ensure the continued security of our very civilization.Benjamin Dewey's The Tragedy Series is an addictive collection of funny-sad comics based on the popular Tumblr blog.",
