  "title": "No Going Back: The Truth on What's Wrong with Politics and How We Move America Forward",
  "description": "The New York Times bestselling author, governor of South Dakota, and former congresswoman shares eye-opening realities of DC dysfunction, lessons from leading her state through unprecedented challenge, and how we seize this moment to move America forward.    Any elected official can talk about how broken our government is. But their solutions always seem to involve more money, new programs—and reelection to another term. Few offer an unfiltered glimpse into how government actually works, empowering citizens with the knowledge to be part of the solution.   Governor Kristi Noem never planned on being in politics. But her concern for our nation compelled her, on a local, national, and global level. Because she took a different path into public service, as a concerned mom and rancher, her insights help every citizen understand how positive change really happens, despite the dysfunction in Washington DC. Governor Noem explains how the country is not going back to the Republican party of the 2000s. And that’s a good thing. This book is packed with eye-opening stories and practical lessons from the front lines of the battle. And she names names.  ​ A lot has changed since 2016, and based on her accomplishments in Congress and as Governor, no one is better equipped than Kristi Noem to explain the tremendous opportunities this opens up for every American.",
