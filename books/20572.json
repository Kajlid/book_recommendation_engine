  "title": "Letters to Louise: The Answers Are Within You",
  "description": "The beloved New Thought leader and author of You Can Heal Your Life offers hope and wisdom to readers navigating mental health issues, difficult relationships, and more   This book is a collection of letters I’ve received and answered over the years from people all over the world. The letters express deep concerns about 20 different topics—including addictions, disease, family relationships, the inner child, and parenting, just to name a few. Almost all of the people who have written to me have wanted to change themselves—and their world—in some way. In my replies, I’ve tried to be the catalyst that helps these individuals accomplish their goals. I think of myself as a stepping-stone on a pathway of self-discovery. Perhaps you will see some aspect of yourself in these pages. It is my belief that by reading about other people’s challenges and aspirations, we can see ourselves and our own problems in different ways. Sometimes we can use what we learn from others to make changes in our own lives. I hope this book will allow you to realize that you, too, have the strength within to change, and to find solutions on your own—that is, to seek the answers that are within you.   —Louise L. Hay",
