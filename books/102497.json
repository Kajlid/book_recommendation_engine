  "description": "Legend says Niagara Falls has magical powers…Selina LeClézio is no stranger to making mistakes. Sometimes she even seeks them out and makes them knowing full well what they are. But dating a tourist has never been on her list of mistakes to make. Even working on a boat tour of Niagara Falls and therefore seeing her fair share of prospects none have ever seemed worth the risk … none that is until Nathan Lawson stepped onboard. Nathan Lawson is only in Niagara with his two best friends on vacation. He planned for a carefree time enjoying local brews, fishing, and of course a tour of The Falls. What he couldn’t have foreseen was meeting Selina. He could feel himself being drawn to her and not just because of what a beautiful exotic stranger she is. Something deeper pulled him in. The two of them fall into a hot easy fling. Neither of them are seemingly bothered by knowing it could not last, until the moment tragedy strikes and they are torn apart much too soon. Nathan is forced to return to the states just as Selina is thrust into her own personal struggles. Yet neither can forget the connection made between them. But even if they can overcome their own individual misfortunes will they decide to chase their dream of being together or will it be left to the magic of The Falls to show them their destiny?",
