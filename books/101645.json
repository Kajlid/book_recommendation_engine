  "description": "He's loved her for thousands of years, but in this lifetime she doesn't remember him... yet.This prequel of the Crow series is focused on giving readers a glimpse into one of Pia's past lives and to show Beylin hard at work as a Memory Stealer and Soul Bearer. If you haven't read any of the Crow series, start here. About the Series: Cassiopeia \"Pia\" Alexander is floundering. She can't pick a college major, her love life is virtually non-existent and the only thing good in her life is her job as an Animal ER Nurse. Even that doesn't feel like enough, though. Beylin Callaghan belongs to the Brotherhood, who give souls a winged-ride from one life to the next and remove the memories from each soul so that they have a fresh slate in their new incarnations. But he's keeping a secret-- a secret that when exposed, will bind Pia's fate to his own. For better or worse. Crow: The Prequel is novella length (approx. 11,000 words) and is the first installment in this new adult fantasy series. The episode release schedule can be seen below... and fans are encouraged to visit Alex's website to influence the outcome of the overall story.",
