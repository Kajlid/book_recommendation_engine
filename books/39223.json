  "description": "Holly Winter the malamute trainer knows she's not the only Holly Winter living in Cambridge, Massachusetts, but it would be so much nicer if Holly number two weren't a dog-hating academic... and if a third woman calling herself Holly Winter didn't happen to be dead. Holly number one can attest to this unfortunate fact, having discovered the gunned-down body while searching for a missing Siberian husky.Another missing dog-this time a blue malamute- is somehow tied into this tangled web. With her husband Steve away on a camping trip and her other human housemates otherwise occupied, Holly and her prize-winning pups will have to bring the case to heel on their own-before a killer sniffs them out.",
