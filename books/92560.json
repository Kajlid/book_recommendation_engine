  "description": "“…Ruthie, I have tried to forget the past and this book for many years.” “Please remember for me Daddy,” I begged……The next day I saw our synagogue in ruins and I cried. Burned prayer books were everywhere. When no one was looking, I hid this one in my coat. I wanted a reminder of the place where I had been so happy.The Tattered Prayer Book is a gentle introduction to the Holocaust for children ages 6-10. Ruthie discovers a secret about her father, while looking through a box of mementos from the “old country.” As her father tells his surprising story, Ruthie learns a piece of her father’s story, a slice of Jewish history and the circumstances under which the family fled Nazi Germany. Sharing the story with Ruthie, allows father to heal and daughter to grow.",
