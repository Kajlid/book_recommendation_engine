  "description": "The Chieftain's Daughter is the story of a young boy who is fostered on a remote Irish tribe some 1500 years ago. In simple and often striking language, it tells of the boy's involvement with local feuds, with the ideas of the wandering Christian missionary, and with his beloved Fran ... the chieftain's daughter. The plot has lots of twists and turns, the characters are deeply fascinating, and a sense of period is evoked with the sure touch of a prize-winning author.",
