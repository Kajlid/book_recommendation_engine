  "description": "\"HESITATION, ANXIETY, DISSATISFACTION ARE TO THE TAOIST WHAT SIN IS TO THE CHRISTIAN TO DISPEL THEM AND CLEAR THE MIND AND HEART THE I CHING IS DEVOUTLY CAST.\"For centuries the Chinese have consulted the I Ching both as an oracle and as a means of self-understanding. the moral and psychological depth of its wisdom has been celebrated by scholars, psychologists, poets, and scientists. In this clear, immensely readable interpretation, Sam Reifler eliminates the obscure and dated references of previous translations to provide an accurate and accessible version of the ancient Chinese classic for the contemporary seeker. With easy-to-follow instructions for using both the yarrow stalk and the coin-toss method, this new interpretation of the I Ching reveals the hidden forces at work in our relationships, our careers, and our emotional lives - and suggests new directions and choices for the future.For everyone who seeks to better understand themselves and the world around them, this new translation of the I Ching is a practical and remarkably effective pathway to enlightenment.",
