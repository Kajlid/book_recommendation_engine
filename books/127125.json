She had shelter at night, fresh water, food.So stupid to let him in, to risk all that!A man. Just a man.In a world destroyed by plague, a world where viruses could change your very nature, where beasts roamed the night and nothing was safe, the most dangerous creature of all was man.An explicitly erotic story in the Shifters' World setting, from the author of Lone Wolf and co-author of paranormal erotic romances Seduced by Moonlight and The Touch.\"He put a hand to her face then, his knuckles brushing along her jaw and then he buried his fingers in her hair, tipping her head back. His mouth came down on her neck: hard lips and then the wet heat of his tongue and the delicious pain of raking teeth, dragging across her skin to that point where too hard is exactly hard enough.\"",
