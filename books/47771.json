  "description": "Praise for Tom Molloy's The Green Line:\"Molloy's style is impressive in its tense self-control, conveying impacted emotion with a bare minimum of words. . . . The characters are vividly drawn, the whole thing is painfully realistic, and Tom Molloy has made an impressive debut.\"—Publishers WeeklySet in Northern Ireland, Rebel Streets takes an unblinking look at what happens when ordinary people are thrust into a world of violence, extremism, and betrayal—where options are few and consequences severe. Without resorting to caricature or stereotypes, Tom Molloy invites the reader back to a time of religious violence known as the Troubles.Tom Molloy has driven eighteen-wheelers, served as a volunteer firefighter, de-iced commercial jetliners, worked as a social worker, and accompanied IRA fighters during street battles while covering the Troubles in Northern Ireland as a freelance journalist. On several occasions Molloy was detained by British security forces, and was once sent on a brief stint to the infamous Castlereagh detention center, where his novel Rebel Streets opens. Other books by Molloy include The Vandal and The Green Line. A native of Boston, Massachusetts, Tom lives in South Portland, Maine.",
