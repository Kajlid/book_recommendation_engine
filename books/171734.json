  "title": "Death by Cannibal: Minds with an Appetite for Murder",
  "description": "Peter Davidson, the author of Homicide Miami, the true crime story that inspired the film Pain and Gain, compiles the true stories of some of America's most notorious cannibal murderers.  THEY VIOLATED ONE OF CIVILIZED SOCIETY’S MOST SACRED TABOOS. They’re an anathema even in the twisted world of serial murder. More frightening still, the cannibal killer has hidden behind a mask of normalcy, as witnessed in these shocking profiles of five American men who ate their victims . . . Gary Heidnik, the financial wizard whose Philadelphia home was a dungeon of sexual slavery, torture, and diabolical feasts. Albert Fentress, a mild-mannered schoolteacher who lured a teenage boy into the inescapable darkness of his secret obsessions. John Weber, a country boy who found an outlet for his sick fantasies when he ate his teenage sister-in-law for dinner. Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, a portly gourmand and aspiring chef who allegedly shared the remains of his prey with unsuspecting friends. Marc Sappington, a high school dropout who aspired to outdo his idol, Jeffrey Dahmer, by embarking on a three-day feeding frenzy. Drawn from revealing interviews with family members, authorities, and the killers themselves, Death by Cannibal exposes the secrets behind the most fiendish compulsion of them all. Also—where does desire end and true crime begin? New details on the unprecedented case of Gilberto Valle, the New York City cop sentenced to life in prison for harboring only fantasies—of kidnapping up to a hundred women and of eating “girl meat.” INCLUDES PHOTOGRAPHS",
