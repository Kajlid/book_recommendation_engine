  "description": "I wasn’t always the Desert Aces MC President. When I was 20 years old, tragedy struck when my parents were killed by a drunk driver. I was young and stupid and decided to prospect for the Desert Aces MC in Las Vegas.At the time, I didn’t care about its lawlessness. I liked the drinking, the fighting, the fucking. It helped to numb the pain. But as time went on, I began to realize the club was on a dangerous path to destruction. And that if we didn’t clean up our act, our club wouldn’t survive.  I couldn’t let that happen. I’ve given everything to my club and it’s time I take a little something for myself. I need to find a woman and settle down. My mind drifts to Diana, all those years ago. I regret letting her walk away.  But that all changes when one afternoon, she drives up to the compound gates, looking gorgeous as ever. Instantly, my feelings for her re-surface, igniting inside me. This time, I won’t let her walk away. I’m making her mine.",
