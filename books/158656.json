There is no way Seth can resist. And now hell has to be paid by Seth's heart. Again.Marc has only dated women...okay, bedded them. But after taking to bed yet another woman from his office and getting slapped this time--hard--for not being able to even \"perform,\" he realizes something has to change. Yet Marc has no idea that \"change\" would be in the gender of the partner he'll take into his bed...or into his heart... Gay / Contemporary / Romantic Comedy",
