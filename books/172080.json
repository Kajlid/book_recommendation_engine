  "title": "MAD Spy vs Spy: An Explosive Celebration",
  "description": "MAD Magazine's iconic Spy vs Spy comic strip--now in full color! One of the most celebrated comic strips in MAD's history has a deceptively simple concept: twin spies, one clad in black and the other in white, outdoing each other in elaborately stupid plots to achieve the other's demise. Now, for the first time, MAD is colorizing the best of the original Spy vs Spy adventures and presenting these classic strips with a new modern look.  Bonus material created exclusively for this book includes new interpretations of the Spy characters by acclaimed artists--including Frank Miller, comic writer-artist and blockbuster filmmaker, and Nathan Sawaya, internationally recognized Lego artist--and a biography in comic-strip form of Spy vs Spy creator, Antonio Prohías, by award-wining MAD artist Sergio Aragonés. Additional special features include dynamic charts and graphs to deconstruct and quantify which spy has \"won\" the most through the comic strip's volatile history, the most popular weapons and ploys used in the strip, means of death, and more, plus a beautifully printed endpaper featuring David Anson Russo's interactive maze, where readers can play as either white or black spy.",
