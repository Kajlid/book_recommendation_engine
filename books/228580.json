  "description": "Stevie Diamond. Age 12. Female. Private Detective. She and her partner, Jesse, have already cracked their first case. Now the pair is visiting Stevie's father at his tree-planting camp in the Rocky Mountains -- but how can they have a fabulous wilderness holiday when six-year-old Alexander, armed with a loaded squirt-gun, is trailing along? In this Stevie Diamond Mystery, when an international smuggler starts snooping around Alexander's house, baby-sitting suddenly becomes an occupation worthy of the Diamond and Kulniki Detective Agency.",
