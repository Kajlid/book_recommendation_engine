  "description": "A song, a lady and a wish. Peter Hopkins was tired. The extra thirty pounds he carried, mostly in his midriff, made his back and his knees ache. Even his mind ached. Each step he took seemed to be a painful reminder that the “big five-0” was right around the corner and he wasn’t looking forward to it. For the first time in his life Peter felt old and he yearned to be a kid again in Cleveland, Ohio. He wished to be \"small\". He wished to go back to simpler times and be with his friends. Could a song and a lady make his wish come true and have him travel back in time to 1976?",
