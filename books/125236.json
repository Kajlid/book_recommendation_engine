  "description": "Jake explores his super-smart, sneaky Jackal side in the final installment of this high-octane, page-turning series! After all the excitement and danger he and his friends survived in California, Jake just wants to chill out and ride his bike. Then he gets an offer he can’t refuse—the chance to train and race with his friends in China, where a committee is building a world-class cycling team. But he soon finds out that trouble can follow him even all the way to China. When an old enemy chases him through Shanghai and the Chinese countryside, Jake may miss out on his chance to lead his team to victory. In the last book of the Five Ancestors Out of the Ashes series, Jeff Stone delivers an action-packed adventure perfect for bike racing fans, readers of the popular Five Ancestors series, and anyone who loves a fast-paced page-turner.",
