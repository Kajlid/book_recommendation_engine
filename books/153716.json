  "description": "**NOW AN AMAZON BESTSELLER** Straight-laced Kelsey loathes the college party scene, despite her best friend's efforts to help her \"let loose\" and live a little. But one night, under rather unpleasant circumstances, she meets Mark and finds herself falling for him despite his involvement in the very lifestyle she so vehemently despises. While wrestling her own personal demons, Kelsey’s capacity for forgiveness is tested—repeatedly—as Mark plunges in and out of the treacherous waters of self-destruction and unpredictability. In time, she begins to question whether his behavior is just typical of someone living the “college experience” or if perhaps a deeper problem exists that she is not equipped to handle. Will love see them through to calmer shores? Or will their fractured fairytale ultimately leave them feeling empty?",
