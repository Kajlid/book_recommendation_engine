  "description": "When a young girl named Aya loses her confidence to dance, she fears she'll never set foot on the stage again. But then she sees Akira and the COOL ballet troupe perform, and everything changes. Akira inspires her to pursue her dream and dance again. Soon, her primary goal is to join the COOL ballet troupe. She's never wanted anything more in her life! There's only one problem: COOL is an all-male dance troupe, and Aya is 100% female. But so what if she's missing a Y chromosome? Aya's got spunk, skill and passionâ€”and, in the end, she hopes that her undying determination will help her beat the odds.",
