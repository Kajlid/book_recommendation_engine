Sparks fly, senses are rezzed, and passion can take you by surprise...Three months ago, amber tuner and independent prospector Lyra Dore made the find of the decade in an underground rain forest: amethyst ruins. But the very man she was dating stole her claim -- and her heart. At least she has her artistically talented dust bunny, Vincent, to comfort her...Amber Inc. CEO Cruz Sweetwater never meant to hurt Lyra. His affinity for obsidian amber gives him the ability to sense that she is his true love. But the ruins have mysterious powers, putting everyone involved with the project in danger.
