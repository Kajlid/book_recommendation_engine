  "description": "In Keltor, we know very little about the powerful sorceress named Ratha of Westmeath. She is a 1200 year old mortal who just so happens to be one of the most powerful sorceresses to ever walk the earth and her part in Keltor is so small but her connection to the main characters is so large. We have no idea where she was 1200 years ago or what brought her to the cave in Ireland where we meet her for the first and only time in Keltor.Who was Logan’s father? How did Ratha of Westmeath stay alive for so long in her mortal shell and why was she concealed from the Guardians? What was her path and who was the lover that she remained faithful to through all of the centuries? Who was Ratha? We find out all of this as well as where we are heading in Dante. This is an erotic tale of love that defied the worlds and universal laws in general. Don’t miss this journey packed with sizzling heat and revelations of epic proportions. Books 2 and 3 (Dante) are scheduled for release in the fall of 2014.((60K words, inclusive of the prologue and 1st Chapter of the next Guardian Archives novel, Dante.))**This book is book 1.5 in the Guardian Archives Series.
