  "description": "“The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” A couple thousand years ago Lao Tzu said that and it is just as true today as it was then. That journey only becomes a journey when you follow that step up with another, and a third, and one more beyond that. A life spent following Jesus is the greatest and most adventurous journey one could take and I am glad to have the opportunity to walk that journey with you.Let us walk together, following in the footsteps of our Savior as told through the pen of John, one of His best friends. This is the fifth of a series of twelve devotional books that will take us down that road. It will pick up in John 6:13 and carry us through to John 7:24.",
