  "title": "How He Won: What Happens Now & What to Do Next",
  "description": "Millions of Americans still wonder what happened. How did Donald Trump pull off the seemingly impossible? Was it cyber-interference from foreign powers? Was it a meddling FBI Director? Was it misleading polls or voter suppression? Or was it simply the case that Trump ran a superior campaign against a flawed opponent?This book asks those questions and seeks to answer them with hard analysis and fresh insights. It also looks ahead to the implications of Trump’s presidency and posits thoughts about the normalization of Trumpism. The critique is tough but fair and includes assessment of the candidates, their strategies and tactics, the role of the media and the prevailing attitude toward domestic and international trends and events.How He Won concludes with prescriptive advice for young progressives and would-be change makers taken from the Trump playbook. In the end the book declares that although Trump’s presidency is a current reality, it need not be either an effective or a long-lived one. Progress is possible if the emerging generation of American leaders will take control of the means to define its own future.",
