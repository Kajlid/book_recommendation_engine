  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B077QGF56L.) All is lost. All. I don't recognize myself in the mirror anymore. My thoughts are filled with hatred and dripping with rage. I've lost my soul. She took it to the depths of Hell with her and haunts me with images of what could have been. Sixty lives are mine to take. Sixty lives stand in the way of my vengeance. Sixty lives plus one more. Mine. When the last drop of blood falls — mine will be spilled. Only one person stands in the way. She doesn't realize I'll kill her too. I don't own a heart. And even if I did — I wouldn't fall prey to its lies again. I am Chase Abandonato. Heir to a legacy of betrayal. And I will kill them all. Even if it means pointing the gun at myself. A life for a life. A soul for a soul. Now I lay me down to sleep… I pray the Lord my soul to keep. Blood in. No out.",
