Women must let go of the past, stop comparing themselves to others, forget the material things, and start embracing God’s plan for their life. This is good, pleasing to Him, and perfect! With the truths of this book in place, every Christian woman can remove the veil, find new freedom, and claim God as the Lord of her future!",
