The message of this book enables children to be aware of potential danger as well as how to communicate and respond in a time of crisis.” —Darrell Scott, Founder and President of Rachel’s Challenge “All schools are safe havens for students but it is critically important for students to report threatening behavior from classmates and to take proper steps when their safety is at risk from outside intruders. This book shares some ideas on how to make school environments safer.” —Michael Kehoe, Chief of Police Newtown, Connecticut “While we continue to work on building a safer and more aware society, this kind of book is important. The Bad Guys begins teaching kids what is normal to see at school and what is not, and what they should do if they hear or see something that does not seem ‘normal’ in the context of school safety.” —Laura Fronckiewicz, Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, Colorado Chapter Co-Leader The Bad A Student’s/Teacher’s Guide to School Safety and Violence Prevention is a much needed guide to promote school safety and violence prevention.
