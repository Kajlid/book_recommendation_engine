  "description": "Have you ever suspected that an unfortunate event such as a flat tyre on a dark and deserted country road could send you tumbling into a strange world where substantial objects appear invisible, where you can fly past the moon in a train carriage, where deadly creatures aren’t necessarily the ones with big teeth and sharp claws, and where you can finally appear to be more intelligent than your older sibling?Believe it or not, this is what happened to fourteen-year-old Evie Bamford when she bumped into a tall, mysterious, sometimes-invisible stranger who claimed he could save her older brother and close friend after they’d completely vanished without trace on this dark and deserted road I mentioned.Of course, all these exciting things happening at once gave Evie an appetite for adventure, but throw in a giant, unearthly creature that is prowling the halls of a satellite 17 million light years from Earth and sucking the life out of its victims to get what it wants – not to mention a virtual time-bomb, a restless crowd of people and a long-repressed secret that is slowly simmering to the surface of Evie’s conscience – and she’s having second thoughts about keeping the acquaintance of this so-called Captain, who seems to go looking for trouble for a hobby.Desperate times call for drastic measures. The fate of so many lives is uncertain. But all along, the Captain seems to think everything is under control. The question is, under whose control? And just who is this mysterious friend he keeps mentioning?",
