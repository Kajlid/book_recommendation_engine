  "description": "Gina won’t have anything to do with that guy who played with her heart the night of her sister's wedding—he’s a heartbreaker—no matter how much her niece and nephews adore him now. The two come from different worlds--Gina’s a workaholic career woman; he’s the irresponsible flirt. Whenever they meet, there are fireworks--and not the good kind. That is, until her sister wins a cruise to the Caribbean, and Gina is thrown in the path of that frustrating “player” to share the responsibilities of watching her niece and nephews for 2 weeks. Everything goes topsy-turvy when their two worlds collide, but considering how much each of them turns the other’s life upside down, could they actually be RIGHT for each other?",
