  "description": "The twilight of the buccaneers is richly re-imagined for adult, contemporary tastes in PORT ROYAL. The year is 1681, and Charles, King of England has a scheme to make his fortune from Jamaica, flooding it with slaves to fuel a sugar boom. But his outrageous Royal Governor, the former buccaneer commander Henry Morgan, has planned a ruthless coup to seize the Island for himself behind a force of privateers. To set the stage for his ambitions, Sir Henry thrusts the celebrated Captain Michael Scot into a lucrative but daunting expedition deep into the jungles of the Darien - exposing him as much to danger from his own resentful allies (English, French and Indians) as from their common Spanish enemy. Morgan also pulls his shrewd Chief Justice into service in a war against a radical, ambitious politician bent on democratic government. But Judge Dawkins has his own agendas, and his own entanglements with Island woman - including both a vain plantation heiress and her haughty and exotic slave.",
