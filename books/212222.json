  "title": "The Blackwater Curse",
  "description": "There will come a day when the destiny of those above the waves will be determined by the whim and folly of those beneath.  Under the black water surrounding the island of Mahala, a nation of cursed creatures dwell. Damned to the inky seas, they deal swift death to all those who dare impinge on their domain. Miraculously, a vessel named Enigma survives their hellacious storms and shipwrecks on Mahala. However, she is way off course. Her intended destination lies far to the west, in the land of Esseria, where a devastating invasion looms. Only Enigma and her crew can stay the hand that is poised to strike Esseria. And seventeen-year-old Duncan Atwater alone can point the way.  A reluctant accomplice on a secret mission he does not fully understand, Duncan knows all too well he will be with Enigma when she eventually departs Mahala and tests the malevolent seas. Imbued with critical knowledge, he cannot separate himself from the expedition. But he escapes temporarily as the ship undergoes repairs. Ignoring instruction to avoid the locals, he becomes involved with an alluring young woman named Ellie. When Duncan discovers the deadly endgame to his mission, he is forced to decide where his allegiances lie. As time runs out, he and Ellie press to find a solution to the conundrum of the impassable black waters, but arrive instead at a terrible moment of reckoning.",
