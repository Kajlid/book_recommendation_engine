  "description": "The retelling of the Burke and Hare story from the point of view of Burke's skeleton which hangs in the Anatomical Museum of Edinburgh University. The skeleton muses on Burke's motivation during their serial killing spree of 1828 to provide the Doctors with subjects for anatomy lessons. The second half of the book is the research that under pins the telling of the story in this way. The most thoroughly researched book on Burke. The research uncovers many previously unknown facts about Burke.",
