  "description": "School counselor Sean wants to fix the world, or at least he’s willing to bear the weight on his slim shoulders. No social justice slouch himself, Sean’s medical researcher husband Isaiah is exhausted by one assault to decency after another. Their world is crumbling, their marriage is in trouble, and Isaiah suggests they run away from it all, but Sean balks. Will they honor the vows they made to one another or will their relationship be another casualty of the world gone mad?  **Please note, this story was previously published in the Rogue Affair anthology, and this edition contains the first chapter of Thrown Off Track, Book 1 in the License to Love series.**",
