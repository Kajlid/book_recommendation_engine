  "description": "The sun is dangerous. It sun can burn you, give you cancer, and eventually kill you. Laney learned that lesson the hard way when her mother died. But even in Arizona, sunscreen can keep you safe. So can keeping others at a safe distance, because Laney is too terrified to suffer the pain of losing someone so close again.  But that all changes when a mysterious pulse of light, brighter than the sun, fills the sky on the day of the big Physics field trip. It's followed by a deadly wave of radiation from space.  Laney and her friends only survive because they're visiting an underground science facility. When she and the other nine survivors emerge from the underground, Laney finds a world of corpses, red smog, and tight supplies.  And worst of all, no ozone layer.  But even as Laney learns the cause for the apocalypse that is her new reality, a new danger rises. Another survivor is taking over their group and he's willing to kill to get to the top. Staying alive and finding her father means that Laney must face her deepest fearsâ€”fears that may be too powerful to overcome.",
