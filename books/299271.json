  "title": "There's a Customer Born Every Minute: P.T. Barnum's Secrets to Business Success",
  "description": "Among his many incarnations, P. T. Barnum always maintained one that of the greatest promoter of all time. He added mystery and dazzle to every project he touched, sending the public into a frenzied stampede -- straight through his doors. How did he do it? What business secrets can we learn from him today? Here is the first book to explore Barnum's extraordinary genius for making money. It follows his fascinating and wildly varied career as a newspaperman, a politician, an entrepreneur, a promoter, and the founder of both America's most popular museum and its most famous circus -- revealing the business tactics he employed each step of the way. As the book shows, it's not enough just to advertise, or set up an ordinary table at an annual trade show, or hand out pens and coffee cups. These are shown to be the hallmarks of mediocrity, of a business doomed to stagnate -- even fail -- in today's competitive environment. By following Barnum's lead, readers will learn to stretch their minds, grow their businesses, line their wallets... and have some fun in the process.",
