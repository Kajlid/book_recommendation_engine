  "description": "Dante Muccino’s wolf is restless. After watching all his friends and family pair up with their True Mates, the animal inside him wants what they have. Children. Family. And a woman to call his own. When he runs into rival Holly Taylor, his wolf is intrigued, but the frosty chef won’t give him the time of day.  After a disastrous blow to her career, Holly has one last chance to prove her skills as a chef de cuisine and earn her stars. Her life is complicated enough, and she doesn’t need more distractions, especially not in the form of sexy celebrity chef Dante Muccino. But there’s something about the easygoing chef that’s melting the icy walls she spent years to build.  Holly Jolly Lycan Christmas is a paranormal romance novel that's a standalone novel with a HEA, hot and sexy scenes, Lycan action and no cheating. It takes place in the True Mates Universe but works as a standalone novel.",
