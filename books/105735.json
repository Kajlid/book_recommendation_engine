Vampire Cullen Blackhawk gets caught helping a wolf-shifter rescue his human mates from the Colony. Now he's forced to accompany the fugitives to Arcadia and spy on the pack. Cullen figures the humans will be his blood donors, but the shifter leaves Arcadia and takes Cullen's only food source with him. Then the unthinkable happens. Cullen finds himself attracted to an omega wolf. Mika Hill's role in the pack has always been that of submissive slut, but Cullen treats him like an equal and Mika shows his gratitude by offering Cullen blood. A starving Cullen can't help himself, and now he's forced to confront his escalating feelings for an omega who's mated to someone else. Mika falls hard for Cullen, but he knows there's no future for a wolf and a vampire. Or is there? Mika will do anything to keep Cullen--even if it means forcing a blood-mating. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
