  "title": "Moody Forever",
  "description": "After his release from a mental institution, Scott Moody is taking steps toward getting his life in order. Still moonlighting as a cabbie, he has given up his brief, hallucination-inspired career as a P.I. and landed a part-time reporting job at a Spokane suburb's newspaper. And amazingly, at least for a guy on Thorazine whose broken nose gets comments from everyone he meets, he finds himself dating Xanthia, the rich, beautiful daughter of prominent local businessman Andrew Welch. Even if he's not getting any sleep, things are looking up - until Moody finds himself the sole witness of Welch's murder, and the prime suspect.",
