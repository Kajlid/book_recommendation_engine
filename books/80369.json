  "description": "Even though Sarah Dawes is only dressed like an angel, acting like a saint isn’t easy. Especially not at her company’s Halloween party, where hedonistic desire is the name of the game and the Devil is her partner.Playing with dangerous pleasures, she follows him to Hell, where he shows her he is more than the monster society has deemed him, and he offers her a chance to become his queen. Should she stay at his side, where her days will be filled with pain, but her nights with pleasure? Or, should she return to earth and the dream of a man who may or may not even know her last name?",
