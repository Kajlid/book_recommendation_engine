  "description": "What do you believe? The stranger yelled as he grabbed my hand. There I was. The stage was set. I was up to bat. This was the opportunity I had been trained for, right? The made-up scenario from seminary that was now actually happening. My missionary moment. My mind raced but all I could focus on was, What DID I believe? The Articles of Faith, our quick go-to-for what we believe, starts at number one with faith in God the Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost. But what does that mean for us today, walking down the halls at school or out on the field? Who is God exactly? What does He look like and sound like? What does Deity mean to me? Some of the most foundational doctrines surround the character of God and our relationship with Him. But who exactly is He? Does He know me? Can I know Him? Almighty is an interactive book designed to help youth discover the answers to those questions and more. Come closer to God the Father by learning about His identity, His character, and most important, how He feels about you.",
