That was until she collided with him in the conference room at her office building and found out just how real he actually was and he's made it very clear that he is going to be her Master. Reed bought \"Bean Me\" with the intention of claiming Mia as his sub a dream he'd had since he picked her up off the sidewalk at his club \"The Dungeon\" three years ago. But that dream is blown away when his manipulating ex-wife comes back into the picture with every intention of staying there. And his ex wife has a few nasty surprises that will leave Mia and Reed reeling and wondering if there is anyway their fragile budding relationship will survive.",
