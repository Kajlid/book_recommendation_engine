When he happens across the Sacred Amulet of Rhol he suddenly finds himself in a strange world and soon learns that he is at the forefront of a quest to save the Balance of Five. On Rhol, unlike Earth, Deke can see his outer soul or Paladin and soon discovers that everyone was created with two souls that act independently of each other, yet are one. Neither can survive without the other. Through the teachings of his Paladin, Deodatus, Deke learns that he can manipulate the powers within the Amulet in his quest to save the Balance of Five. These powers can come at a cost however, drawing him into dark places that become increasingly difficult to return from. As Deke discovers each new world throughout the series, he learns the secrets of the Universe, secrets that one could only imagine.",
