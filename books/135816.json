She may be single, have only one true friend, and live alone… but she doesn’t need a man… or more friends… or anything at all.Wes Anderson boards a flight to Sydney intent on escaping the cinders of his life—the dreams that have all gone up in smoke. One year. One year of freedom to be anyone he wants; that is, anyone but the man he always thought he'd be.When Joss and Wes’s worlds collide, he steals her breath—in more ways than one—and she seems to steal all the space in his already full head. Now, life is determined to throw them together and what starts as an awkward dance of unlikely friendship—each trying to contain their own emotional landmines—turns into something they never saw coming.But can two people with enough baggage to bring down a plane help each other heal? With their pasts lurking around every corner like airport security, Joss and Wes must decide: Is it safer to fly solo or would a life together be worth all the risk?On a Flight to Sydney is the first book in the Love Along the Way series. It’s a swoony, laugh out loud, tug on your heartstrings, romance filled with friendship, surfing, and two people doing their best to navigate this thing called life.",
