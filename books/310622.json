Infiltrate my father's college, force out the charity cases his investors are so fond of and burn this place to the ground. I was starting to enjoy myself too, bringing misery to those who had worked so hard to be here. But I never could have accounted for her.Harper has wormed her way into my soul, exposed my secrets and forced the darkness to turn on me. With Clayton finally gone, I should be celebrating. Instead I'm firmly on the path to self-destruction. Nothing feels as sweet as before, now that I'm subjected to hiding away with my demons. Sleep evades me but as I lie in the dark, I hear her soft voice ripping my façade to shreds in one sentence. 'Rhys Waversea is nothing and he knows it.'This is a M/F/M ménage story which is a part of the contemporary dark bully college romance genre. Trigger warning: dark love-hate themes, sexual scenes and bullying. Not suitable for under 18's.",
