  "description": "ASIN moved from less recent edition here(Clotheslined Edition 1.04: Many spelling and grammar fixes. – 04/23/2014) An entire planet is going to die and Earth’s mightiest hero, John Rockman, isn’t going to take that lying down, but he could if he wanted to. He once single-handedly won the Plaxion Wars of 2433 AD with both legs broken just above the femurs. The few surviving Plaxions still recall the hairy mass of man-terror crawling across the battlefield, a laser pistol in his mouth, death in his eyes and blood in his urine (an unfortunate side-effect to having his pelvis mangled.) With the help of his delicate femaiel cohort, Maria Ozone, John Rockman must deliver precious cargo to the citizens of planet Pergos in order to save their lives, but the evil Prince Pilletus of planet Galactar has other plans for our hairy hero and his curvaceous comrade. Join Rockman on his biggest adventure yet! Gasp in awe as he uncovers a Blort-Blart cheating ring! Pump your fists in glee as he kicks an invisible assassin robot in the chest with his 5-inch stiletto heels! Gag on your honor as he brutally kills an old blind man! And scream a primal scream as John Rockman takes on the largest gladiator trials in the Universe in: John Rockman and the Trials of Galactar!",
