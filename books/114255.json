  "description": "A string of break-ins leaves Inspector John Broden of the Michigan State Police feeling a bit perplexed. In an era where this type of crime is frequently committed by junkies looking for things to sell or trade for their next fix, these crimes are unusual because nothing is taken from any of the homes. Broden feels that the victims of the crimes are hiding a terrible secret, and that the person entering the homes is looking for something specific. When one of the victims is found dead of an apparent suicide, John pushes harder to find the truth. Time is of the essence, and John is about to be shaken to the core by this case.",
