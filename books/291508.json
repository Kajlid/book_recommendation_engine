  "title": "Foxtrot: Assembled With Care",
  "description": "Assembled with Care is a colorful compilation of cartoons from FoxTrot demonstrates that few entertainers in any medium are better at finding humor in everyday family life than Bill Amend. At the core of much of the strip's wild humor is 10-year-old Jason. He tortures his parents and two teenage siblings Peter and Paige out of their minds with his computer and his pet iguana, Quincy. In this treasury, parents Roger and Andrea again have their hands full. In one strip, Jason boldly bursts into their bedroom in the middle of the night to announce that it's \"2 A.M. and the lights still work.\" In another, Jason surprises his mom with a new beep for her computer known simply as \"Defcon One.\" Jason also holds his own with his older siblings, spelling \"My Sister Is Ugly\" with the carved faces of 14 pumpkins. FoxTrot continues to demonstrate its timelessness with its always fresh, irreverent, and zany brand of family humor. Assembled with Care captures the humorous side of the trials and tribulations that come with daily family life like no other strip today.",
