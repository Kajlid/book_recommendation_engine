  "description": "Call it the \"Survival Guide to Human Evolution\" Roberts has you riding shotgun as he roams Nairobi's littered chasms to Kenya's volcanoes, forests and desert lakes. Saints, scholars and scum trample through the workdays. Anthropology cavorts with dysentery, transportation terror, unsafe sex, street fights, back-biting and organizational politics. Amid shrieking escapes from marauding beasts and the quest for Human Origins, he loses himself amid East African wonders; falling in love with the country, the science and maybe a girl...or two. With its cache of dangerous and crazy events in exotic, alien locales Jackass on a Camel is a memoir as thoughtful as it is profane - and hilarious. It captures the human capacity for humanity as well as our deeply etched shortcomings in a style thatâ€™s tawdry, hallucinatory and intelligent. Throughout the provocative narrative Roberts bares all, revealing himself as a jackass struggling to evolve into less of one.",
