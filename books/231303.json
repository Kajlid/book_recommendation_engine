  "description": "Chandlerville, Kentucky's plans for its annual Kentucky Derby celebration come to a grinding halt when local newspaper editor, Rachel Blakely, discovers the scoop of a lifetime. She learns that her new friend’s husband, Mayor Fitz Manning, is at the center of what appears to be an illegal land investment operation. Rachel’s journalistic spirit sags as she wrestles with the win-lose decision of blowing the whistle on the mayor. When a local detective appears unannounced at her office with evidence suggesting town businesses are under attack by unusual outside forces, Rachel postpones plans to confront the Mannings. Rachel rejects seductively mysterious businessman, Jairo Aquino's offer to apply his unorthodox skills to help discover what's what and who's who. The partnership is one that Rachel is petrified to accept and afraid to refuse. Can she trust him? Does he possess the answer key? Or just the key to her heart?",
