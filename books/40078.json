  "title": "Transforming Capitalism: Improving the World for Everyone",
  "description": "Public opinion surveys worldwide reveal declining trust in business corporations – capitalism’s primary institution. As capitalism struggles with questions of social responsibility, corporations increasingly realizethat they do not and cannot exist in isolation pursuing self- interest. Hence, business leaders are increasingly reflecting on the changing role of business in society and the values that drive business.In this book, Maira examines the contract between business and society and argues for the need for a broader dialogue about the values that govern and guide corporations and other institutions of capitalism. He argues for the need to evolve a new contract between society and business – one in which business can engage society beyond profit. This book is a radical argument for changing the role of business corporations in society. Arun Maira’s insightful essays and well-written case studies present a wellconstructed argument for reevaluating the purpose of business. His unique perspective is invaluable as capitalism and its impact on human development is being questioned across the world. It is a book relevant not only to leaders, managers, and students but to everyone concerned with the need for transforming dominant paradigms of reckless capitalism to make growth more inclusive.",
