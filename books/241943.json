  "description": "\"I am my haint. I haunt my own body.\" In  The Through , Adrian and her partner Ben navigate the strange and dangerous magic of The Through, an African American ghost town that exists somewhere between Tuscaloosa, Alabama, and the other-world of the flying slave ship Yemaya , peach Nehi sodas, and mothers back from the dead. Ben and Adrian are not in an ideal partnership--Adrian survived childhood sexual abuse and Hurricane Katrina, whileBen listlessly adjuncts at the local university. The Through, as folk call it,used to be called Okahika, a black community that existed without street names or formal recognition. Okahika exists in every Southern state, connected by energy and history, come and gone, waiting and leaving. Yemaya leads Ben and Adrian on a journey into The Through that ends in healing - but at a very high cost.",
