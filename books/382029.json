  "description": "In all Chaos, there is a cosmos, in all disorder, a secret order. Now, imagine if the Horsemen were already among us, and imagine if the Fourth had a name. This is the story of an immortal soul. It is the story of a lot that had been cast, a story of heartbreak, pain, and acceptance, and ultimately, it is a story of redemption through love. From war ravaged 9BC Germania to modern day London, it is the story of three people whose lives will be forever changed by faith and fate . . . This is her story; her name is Selena, and she is the sword in the Shadows.",
