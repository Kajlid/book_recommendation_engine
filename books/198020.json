Not so long ago, Jake’s life wasn’t perfect. The unexpected and untimely death of his best friend, Jonny Creed, sent an already out-of-control Jake spiraling down further.  Drug addiction. Alcohol. Women.  Jake was in the fast lane to following Jonny to the grave until Tru Bennett walked back into his life and changed everything.  But now, the past that Jake left behind has come back to find him. And what the past brings with it is going to be one of the biggest challenges he has ever faced.   Note: The Storm is a novella following on from the international bestselling Storm series. It is advisable to read The Mighty Storm and Wethering the Storm before reading The Storm. Taming the Storm does not need to be read to understand the novella, but if read, it will enhance the reading element.  Recommended reading age 18+",
