  "description": "Sometimes, working at a ski resort feels more like a vacation than a job, especially when the big bosses spend more time on the slopes than in the office. As much as she loves her job, Tru wishes she could air out her human resources expertise more often. Her colleagues are happy to skate by, but things start to change when the new CFO arrives. Not everyone is happy about Renske’s budget tightening measures. It doesn't help that her stoic demeanor makes them believe she’s a cold, unfeeling android. Always willing to think the best of people, Tru sets out to discover if Renske is really as imperturbable as she seems.",
