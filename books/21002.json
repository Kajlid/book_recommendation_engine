  "description": "What would drive Sierra Montgomery to board a dilapidated airplane in a blinding snowstorm and parachute onto a partially frozen lake knowing if the plane didn't crash from the weather, she would most likely die in the icy waters? Paul Bronson is about to find out. His family has housed defectors ever since General Reginald Rawlings ousted the monarchy in the neighboring country thirty years prior. The latest plane load of refugees brings a beautiful young lady with a bounty on her head and a claim on Paul's heart. The struggle to keep her safe and out of the enemy's hands will be the toughest thing Paul has ever done, for one cannot defy Gen. Rawlings and come out unscathed.",
