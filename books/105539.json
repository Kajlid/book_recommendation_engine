Now all that is left is to pick up the pieces and move on. Easier said than done, that! Kae only wants to be left alone to live or die in peace, Issa makes plans she can't realize, while Alet and Ardnan are drowning in guilt over their past mistakes. Yet someone must rise to wake them all, rouse them and let the past truly become the past. Only, can any of them still pick up the pieces of their old lives?",
