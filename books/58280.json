  "description": "Enjoy this picture book celebration of diverse childhoods, and the essential things that make us all the same. \"A compelling exploration of the differences between children that make them unique as well as the common humanity that unites them.\" (Publishers Weekly) Every day all over the world, children are laughing and crying, playing and learning, eating and sleeping. They may not look the same. They may not speak the same language. Their lives may be quite different from each other. But inside, they are all alike. Stirring words and bold paintings weave their way around our earth, across cultures and generations and remind children to accept differences, to recognize similarities, and—most importantly—to rejoice in both.",
