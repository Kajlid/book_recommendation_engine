  "description": "California girl Pam heads off to Africa for a 3 month backpacking journey in the 1990's. She then accidentally continues traveling around the world SOLO for years. She backpacks through South Africa, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, all throughout Indonesia- Sumatra, Java, Bali, Lombok, and the smaller islands- and continues on to work in Australia and New Zealand. Follow her adventures as she fumbles her way into EVERYTHING. Sarcastic and optimistic at all the wrong moments, she will keep you laughing as she learns things that you probably already know. She sidesteps dangerous situations from wacky weirdos to wild animals, from mother nature to social awkwardness. She gets caught in cultural awakenings at the most inopportune of times. She explores the globe as she explores new sides of herself with extreme sports, mind altering intoxicants, quirky fun friendships, and even in romance. Pam knows nothing when it comes to world politics, religions, science, ancient ruins, even conspiracy theories, the paranormal, and yep, UFO's. Pam is open to all cultures- the good, the bad, and the ugly. And most importantly the wonderful, the mysterious, and the magical. Does she learn about herself? Does she learn about the world? Does Pam learn ANYTHING at all? Come adventuring with her...",
