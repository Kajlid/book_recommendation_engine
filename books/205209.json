The whispered rumours of brutality, fear, and hopelessness turn out to be only the beginning of its cruelty.  One man is trying to protect his family by uncovering the worst of Bedlam’s hidden secrets. One woman is following in her late husband’s footsteps to try and help those that can’t help themselves.  They will both find that looking for evil does not necessarily make one prepared to find it.",
