  "title": "Your Brain on Love, Sex and the Narcissist: The Biochemical Bonds That Keep Us Addicted to Our Abusers",
  "description": "This is a short essay regarding the biochemical bonds victims of narcissistic abuse develop with their abusers. Featured on the Self-Care Haven website, the extended version of the article is now available in Kindle format. Many survivors of narcissistic abuse are confounded by the addiction they feel to the narcissist, long after the abusive relationship took a toll on their physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Make no mistake: recovery from an abusive relationship can be very similar to withdrawal from drug addiction due to the biochemical bonds we may develop with our toxic ex-partners. Learn how these bonds create an addiction that is difficult to break. All proceeds for this e-book go back into supportive services for survivors through Self-Care Haven.  What mental health professionals are saying about this article:  \"Brilliant article on trauma bonds and recovering from narcissistic abuse.\" - Andrea Schneider, LCSW, MSW.  \"A must read! Perfect article to help you understand the biochemical changes in abuse.\" - Shannon Thomas, LCSW, Southlake Christian Counseling",
