  "description": "This novella takes place at the same time as events in Fallow (Whyborne & Griffin 8).  Shy secretary Maggie Parkhurst knows there’s nothing special about her. She’s neither sorceress, nor fighter, nor scholar. What could she possibly have to offer Persephone, the chieftess of the inhuman ketoi—and the woman Maggie’s fallen in love with?  After Maggie’s friend Irene goes missing under mysterious circumstances, she has no choice but to turn to Persephone for help. When the trail leads to a shadowy acting troupe, they discover a plot that stretches much farther than a single vanished woman.  But when a dark truth is revealed, Maggie must choose between a man from her past…and the impossible yearnings of her heart.",
