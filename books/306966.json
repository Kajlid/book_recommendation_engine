  "description": "Never let it be said that ex-soldiers don’t know what to do with their hands… When it comes to men, Christina isn’t just gun shy, she’s downright terrified. Her abusive drunk of a father, plus bad experiences in high school and college, have cemented her belief that all men are the same—ruthless and violent at the slightest provocation. She tells herself she couldn’t care less about her lack of a love life. Yet lately she’s been having seriously erotic dreams about two of her bosses. And oddly, those dreams make her body tingle, not seize up in a panic attack. TJ and Jon have shared women since their military days. Somehow it makes them feel whole. From the first glance, Christina has been the object of their desire, but getting close to the prickly female hasn’t been easy—not when she holds men off with a psychological pitchfork. They’ve waited a long time to ease their way into her life. Time’s up. Unleashing her libido is magic made in the dark. But by the light of day, a face from her past threatens to destroy This title contains the Blindfolds and bondage and sex—oh my. Ooh, and let’s not forget about the m/f/m ménage and the graphic language.",
