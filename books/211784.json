  "description": "“Eric Parmenter’s generous and wise guide will show you how to remove the deadwood and make room for new life to grow!”-MARSHALL GOLDSMITH, PhD, Best-selling author of 'What Got You Here Won’t Get You There' and 'Triggers'“All too often, we seek happiness by adding new actions to our calendars when we should be subtracting them. STOP! looks at our frantic lives with fresh eyes, offering guidance to help us focus on our top priorities.”-ADAM GRANT, PhD, New York Times best-selling author of 'Originals' and 'Give and Take'STOP! is not a book about health, wellness, stress reduction, diet, and exercise. There are thousands of books on those topics. STOP! is not fundamentally a business or a self-help book. Eric Parmenter’s STOP!, based on the latest behavioral and brain science, is designed to help you figure out what you can STOP doing to create more space in your life to enhance your joy, your wellbeing and productivity, so that you can live a life on purpose. Parmenter, a top healthcare consultant, candidly shares his personal experiences that prompted him to write this useful book, an easy, but thought-provoking read.",
