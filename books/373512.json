  "description": "Like a bull in a china shop, Janie Smith tumbles through the paranormal world making mistakes and not keeping her sharp tongue in check. Pretending to be normal is what she has spent her whole life perfecting.  But when her best friend, a witch named Mia, gets tangled in a murder investigation, Janie tries to stick to her guns and solve it without any “extra” help, be it supernatural or sexual.  The hitch is that Mia is suspected to have murdered a vampire...and how do you prove you haven't killed someone who has no pulse?",
