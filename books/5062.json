  "description": "Alt Cover for ASIN: B006YGEAAU This highly-anticipated third in the award-winning Rogues Club Series, is the story of Reed Gilbride, and his quest for the proof of his birth, and Chastity Somers, the annoying, but desirable, obstacle in his path. Reedâ€™s proof is said to exist on the Sunnyledge estate, which Chastity occupies and expects to keep. Sparks fly when the alleged heir arrives to begin his search. As with all the rogues, the underlying theme is sensuality and seduction. Readers can expect a particularly emotional journey, as UNMISTAKABLE ROGUE has more than its share of romance, sex, laughter, and tears.",
