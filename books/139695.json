  "title": "Reckoning",
  "description": "Robin has finally come into her own, and with full access to her psychic powers goes after the Renaissance figures wreaking havoc with the world. But chasing them down quickly leads to twists and complications she didnâ€™t foresee. Some of the ones who pose the greatest danger to the planet switch allegiance, while others take their game to the next level, threatening not just the planet, but the multiverse, and in more than one timeline. Note: Books 1 through 5 of Renaissance 2.0 are part of a single story arc and so are meant to be read in sequence. Book 5 is the culmination of that story arc. With book 6 comes the opportunity to jump into the series anew as it will begin an entirely new story.",
