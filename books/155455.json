  "description": "On a distant moon a festival is taking place that promises its guests a remarkable gift; they will be allowed to re-create moments from their past. Under the watchful eye of those who inhabit the moon and organise the event, the visitors will become tourists of their own memories. Among those attending The Passing festival is Nate, a human who has decided to take a break from his hectic life as CEO of Earth's largest space mining company, and is seeking relaxation. Though, he soon realises that this will not be possible. With the chance to experience physical re-creations of moments from his past he is thrown into a world of possibilities. Times, good and bad, are eligible to be brought back to life for people to explore and to enjoy as they see fit. He starts with a childhood memory of playing with his friends. What he experiences is beyond anything his own mind could have conjured from his memory. Down to the tiniest detail, thought long forgotten. But things don't quite go to plan as a mysterious intruder decides to bring Nate's vacation to an abrupt and almost fatal end. With the help of his local guide, L'Armin Hes, they must uncover the truth behind the unknown man's intentions, before he strikes again. Along the way Nate and L'Armin form a strong bond that will be tested to near destruction as they search the past. This will be a trip none of them will ever forget. If they survive.",
