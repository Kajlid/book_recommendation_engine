  "title": "Medicine's Strangest Cases: Extraordinary but True Tales from over five centuries of Medical History",
  "description": "Medicine's Strangest Cases is a choice prescription of medical oddities, featuring an Essex man who kept getting pregnant; the physician who gave syphilis its name by writing a poem about it; and the future Lady Hamilton's training as a courtesan through giving lectures on healthy living. We also meet nineteenth and twentieth century doctors whose response to people having fun was to warn of danger - they condemned bicycling because it could stimulate the 'sexual system' of 'women of a certain temperament'; and protected young men from the dread disease of masturbation by blistering their penises with iodine (ouch!). Laugh out loud and wince in sympathy with this rundown of the most bizarre medical cases in history.ï»¿  Author Information Michael O'Donnell practised medicine for twelve years before becoming a writer. He was editor of World Medicine, has published two novels, and written and presented over one hundred TV documentaries in Europe and the US. At Radio Four he was chairman of 'My Word', presenter of the award-winning series 'Relative Values' and a regular contributor to the programme 'Stop The Week'.",
