  "description": "All Arianna wants is to be left alone. She’s finally got life working out for her. She got her own seamstress shop, her customers pay well and appreciate her attention to quality, and most of all, she is finally on the books—a real citizen. A taxpayer and everything. And that’s when everything goes wrong. A dark and deadly knight on a black horse shows up outside her shop, asking for her. Her past, in the form of a roguish, handsome thief wants a dangerous favor. And her dreams…those are the worst part. Why would a forgotten and forbidden goddess want to talk with her anyway? Now Arianna is on the run, and the past is close on her heels. The Sable Knights want her dead, believing she’s the center of a prophecy foretelling the doom of their Order, and their Father God. Beasts of legends have been summoned to kill her, and her friends are collateral damage. But enough is enough. Arianna isn’t without her own power, and she’s willing to go up against just about anything to take her life back. It’s time to kill a god.",
