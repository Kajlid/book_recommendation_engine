  "description": "There are new rules governing the country--namely, no magic. But Fiona Forzese has never been good with rules... After a ghostly army terrorized Boston, the Ranulf family say they'll help Fiona and her classmates finish up junior year. They say their old Virginia plantation is a safe haven. All Fiona and her secret coven have to to do is show up to a few math and English classes. It should be a perfect solution. And it would be, if the Ranulfs weren't members of a witch-hunting cult. As Fiona digs deeper into the Ranulf's past, she learns a dark truth that shocks her to her core. But it isn't only the Ranulfs who are keeping secrets, and as the witch-hunting cult closes in, Fiona is forced to confront the demons of her own past.
