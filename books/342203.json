  "title": "Rohypnol",
  "description": "Fact: bad people do bad things. In the new age of money, drugs, and instant satisfaction, you make your own rules. You take what you want—not ask. There is no responsibility. There is no guilt. If someone burns you, you should do the same to them. It's an issue of equality. Andrew Hutchinson brilliantly portrays a disturbing reality in which cold and disillusioned youths assault the comfortable middle-class world around them. This provocative, jolting novel examines the mind of a self-made monster—and questions the direction of modern life.",
