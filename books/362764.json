  "title": "Just Food: Where Locavores Get It Wrong and How We Can Truly Eat Responsibly",
  "description": "We suffer today from food anxiety, bombarded as we are with confusing messages about how to eat an ethical diet. Should we eat locally? Is organic really better for the environment? Can genetically modified foods be good for you? JUST FOOD does for fresh food what Fast Food Nation (Houghton Mifflin, 2001) did for fast food, challenging conventional views, and cutting through layers of myth and misinformation. For instance, an imported tomato is more energy-efficient than a local greenhouse-grown tomato. And farm-raised freshwater fish may soon be the most sustainable source of protein.Â Informative and surprising, JUST FOOD tells us how to decide what to eat, and how our choices can help save the planet and feed the world.",
