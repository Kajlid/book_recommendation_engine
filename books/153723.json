  "description": "“Happy Birthday, Charlie Scott…”   This is definitely not how Charlie thought she’d be spending her nineteenth birthday; bunking with her fugitive lover in a cheap hotel room. But he’s got a surprise for her…  Blue knows two things: he’s the luckiest guy in the world, and she’d be better off if she never met him. He blames himself for the life she was forced to leave behind, but tonight he’s planned her a birthday party that she’ll never forget.  With one foot on the pedal, it’s only a matter of time before they find themselves on the run again. But for now, even if it’s only for one night, they’ll set everything else aside and party amongst a sea of neon lights.   “Everything can change in just one night…”   Carnival Nights is a novella that bridges the time between Carnival and the upcoming Amusement. This book contains sexual content and drug use.",
