  "description": "Amanda Wilson can't decide between murder, insanity and another glass of red wine. Facing 50 and all that it entails is problematic enough. What's the point in minking your eyes, when your husband would rather watch 'Russia Today' than admire you, strutting in front of the television in only thigh boots and a thong? Her son has managed to perform yet another magical disappearing act. Could he actually be buried under the mountain of festering washing which is strewn on his bedroom floor? He'll certainly be buried somewhere when she next gets her hands on him. At least her mother knows how to enjoy herself. She's partying her twilight years away in Cyprus. Queen of the Twister mat, she now has a toy boy in tow. She really shouldn't have pressed that send button. The past always catches up with you sooner or later. Still, her colourful past is a welcome relief to her monochrome present; especially when it comes in the shape of provocative Todd Bradshaw, her first true love. Soon Mandy has a difficult decision to make; one that will require more than a few glasses of Chianti. Featured in Woman's Own, Yours and Choice magazine Winner of four awards for humour including 2012 Reader Views \"Mini Skirts and Laughter Lines\" was a feel-good book and one that I would highly recommend to any woman who is even remotely battling a mid-life crisis. If Amanda could do it, we all could! Olivera Baumgartner - Jackson for Reader Views Packed with humorous adventures and witty observations, this modern day novel has subtle tones of Bridget Jones's Diary and kept me gripped from start to finish.
