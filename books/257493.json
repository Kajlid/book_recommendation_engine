  "title": "Their Honeymoon",
  "description": "Audrey's husbands take her on a surprise honeymoon vacation and as always, things get hot, hot, HOT.This was meant to just be a short story, but like normal, these characters tend to steal the show when I start writing them. A short story turned into chapters and then became long enough to be termed a novelette (13,500 words, or around 45 pages). Gah, I'd missed these guys!!!Chronologically, this novelette is set in the middle of the events of Book 2 but can be read any time after Book 1. Enjoy :)",
