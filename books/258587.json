  "description": "Jessica was grateful. Lauren had arranged this business trip to Scotland. But Lauren's friend Kelsey was beyond weird. Why did they need to be in costume to tour the castle ruins? What did Lauren need that dagger for? And Lauren kept zoning out on the tour bus, mumbling to herself and making Jessica and Katherine exchange worried glances.Leif had assumed Father's duties as Laird of Cresh Manor four months ago, when the fever took both his parents. Druids had sent the fever to his town, so the people said. Druids from the mysterious Druid castle to the North. They also said Druids sent the three beautiful women who had wandered into town, but Leif didn't believe a word of that.",
