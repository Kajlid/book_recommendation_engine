  "title": "The Cobb Legacy",
  "description": "Cagney Nowak is writing a novel around the 1905 shooting death of baseball legend Ty Cobb's father, William, by his mother a week before Ty was called up by the Detroit Tigers. Although she was acquitted by an all-male jury on the grounds that the incident was accidental, the townspeople of Royston, Georgia, thought otherwise. Gossip had it that Amanda Cobb, at age thirty-three - and twenty years her husband's junior - was having an affair and that William, having told her he was going out of town on business, returned to catch her with her lover. At her trial, the questions were never raised as to why she had locked her second story window on a hot August night, or why she'd shot twice - surely she knew, after firing the first barrel of her shotgun, at whom she was shooting? A boyhood friend of Ty's was first on the scene that night, claiming years later that he knew that Amanda had had a lover with her that night, and that he even knew who it was... When Cagney begins to relive the night of the shooting in his dreams, more than a century later and in the guise of Amanda Cobb, he is led to discover his father's deepest secret. More than a mystery, The Cobb Legacy is the story of a man's efforts to connect with his dying father, a World War II veteran suffering from what today is known as Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, and to come to terms with his obsession over the Cobb legacy as well as his own adulterous affair and impending divorce, while doubting that love with an old friend can be his.The Cobb Legacy is available for download for Kindle, Nook, eReaders, PCs, laptops, and smart phones.",
