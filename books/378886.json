  "title": "Gene Tierney: A Biography",
  "description": "Called the most beautiful woman in movie history, Gene Tierney starred in a number of 1940s classics, including Laura, Leave Her to Heaven and The Ghost and Mrs. Muir. Her on-screen presence and ability to transform into a variety of characters made her a film legend. Her personal life was a whirlwind of romance (she married a count, was engaged to a prince, and was courted by a future president) and tragedy (her daughter was born with severe retardation and Tierney herself struggled with mental illness). After years of treatment, including electroshock therapy that erased portions of her life from her memory, she triumphantly returned to Hollywood in the biggest comeback of any star in history. This, the first complete biographical work since the actresses' death on November 6, 1991, covers everything from her birth in 1920; through her rise to fame, turbulent love life, fight with mental illness, and triumphant return to Hollywood; to her retirement in her 40s and death. Beginning with a foreword by her daughter, Christina Cassini, an extensive filmography provides the cast and crew of each film and television appearance, production and release dates, running times, and a brief synopsis. Additional information covers locations, box office take, awards, behind-the-scenes details, and memorable quotes. The work includes many rare photographs from both on and off screen.",
