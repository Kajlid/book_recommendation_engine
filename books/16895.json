Working cases is hard enough in the busy Hollywood Division, fighting the resentment and bias of the male detectives assigned under her make her job that much harder.When a serial killer strikes in the Hollywood area; it falls to Alexandra Hunter and her team to solve the case. Men are being murdered and horribly, sexually mutilated, who appear to have nothing in common other than being similar in appearance and age. The murders are committed brazenly, out in the open, escalating in number, each more horrific than the last. As panic begins to envelope the city, political pressure is brought to bear as the powers that be find themselves under intense scrutiny and pressure by the media and the people they are sworn to protect. The serial killer is careful, smart and thorough, leaving little evidence, which makes finding this killer a daunting task. Alex and her team race against the clock trying to prevent more deaths as the bodies continue to pile up. Alex is a striking looking woman with the eyes of a lioness, and she uses her unusual instincts (some have called her a witch) to guide her, Alex fights to motivate her team and work the case. Alexandra and her team finally discover that even hardened cops can be shocked at what they uncover.",
