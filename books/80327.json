  "description": "Vicky is happy young lovebird with a great life as the Johnson family pet. When her human Marie starts making Valentine’s Day cards for her first grade class, Vicky is definitely intrigued. \"Valentine’s Day is very special,\" Marie explains. \"It only comes once a year, and when it comes, you have to tell everyone how much you love them. But most of all, you have to find a special friend to be your Valentine.\" A day about love? That’s fantastic! Now who can be Vicky’s special Valentine? A search begins as Vicky asks anyone who will listen to be her Valentine. Unfortunately, the pretty dolly ignores her, and so do the people in the glass box—and she's not sure she can trust the family cat's intentions. Will the day come to a close before Vicky can find a Valentine? There’s only one way to find out. Join Vicky in her hunt for love in this special holiday edition of the color-illustrated Bird Brain Books series for children.",
