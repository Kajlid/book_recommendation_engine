  "description": "Harlan turned his back on the siren world a long time ago.  Resigned to living an ordinary life, Harlan settles in the human world. And then his new assistant arrives. Smart, efficient, gorgeous… and a werewolf. Keeping Sam on is a risk Harlan can’t take. If he discovers what Harlan is, they’ll be in for a world of trouble.  Sam always wanted a knight in shining armor but he has a secret that can’t be told.  As an omega, Sam learned long ago not to draw attention to himself, but even that doesn’t save him when he catches the eye of the Alpha Prime. Knowing he has to keep the truth about his origins secret, he runs from the mating his pack has planned for him. He enjoys the chance to finally be himself, especially when that means flirting with his handsome boss, Harlan. Until his pack tracks him down, with deadly consequences.  Harlan’s armor does shine… but only when wet.  Harlan knows he should leave the business of wolves to the wolves but he can’t stand by and watch them drag Sam away. But now that Sam knows he isn’t human, Harlan has only one option: to bring Sam home, to the Cove.  The truth will bring them together.  Sam finds himself thrown into a new pack, his secret on the verge of being discovered. If they figure out the truth, he’s certain they’ll kill him. But then, these aren’t ordinary wolves and the Cove is no ordinary place. And Harlan, well, Sam just can’t take his eyes off him.  Hidden is a novel-length read, featuring office flirting, a secretive wolf, a stubborn siren, mpreg, and scenes not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen.",
