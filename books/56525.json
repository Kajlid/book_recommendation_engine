  "description": "As a schoolmaster in South Wales, folklorist W. Jenkyn Thomas was dismayed to find that his students — who took such delight in the fairy stories of other nations — knew nothing at all of their own country's rich heritage of fairy tales. To fill the need for a collection of Welsh fairy tales for young readers, he compiled this definitive treasury.Abounding in phantoms, fairies, witches, magical spells, and other time-honored fairy-tale ingredients, the 83 fascinating stories include \"Lady of the Lake,\" in which a young country boy falls in love with a beautiful girl who agrees to marry him under very strange conditions; \"The Adventures of Three Farmers,\" and \"The Fairy Wife,\" in which fairies outsmart mortals; and a wealth of other fanciful, imaginative tales. Among these are such favorites as \"Elidyr’s Sojourn in Fairy-Land,\" \"Pergrin and the Mermaiden,\" \"The Cave of the Young Men of Snowdonia,\" \"Goronwy Tudor and the Witches of Llanddona,\" \"A Strange Otter,\" \"Nansi Llwyd and the Dog of Darkness,\" \"The Bride from the Red Lake,\" \"Lowri Dafydd Earns a Purse of Gold,\" and many more. Overflowing with charm, whimsy, and authentic Welsh flavor, this stimulating collection is sure to delight not only children but also fairy- and folk-tale lovers of all ages.",
