  "title": "Stripped, Paddled, and Bound",
  "description": "Jason is eighteen, young and innocent and only “a little bit” bi. Little does he realize just how much he's going to enjoy being initiated into his chosen fraternity. Every step of the hazing only makes him more determined to stick out the entire process, though of course he knows he can leave at any time. He's blindfolded, stripped in front of countless unseen men, then paddled mercilessly down a gauntlet and finally tied up on the porch in full view of the neighbors. There, in this 3,500-word erotica in the Quickies line, the men give him a taste of what the fraternity is all about—from both ends at the same time.",
