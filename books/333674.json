I don’t know where I’m going.”I came home to find a woman asleep in my cabin. She’s alone, injured—mine to care for until the storm passes. A shot at redemption I don’t deserve after what I’ve done. She says she doesn’t know who she is—is she lying to me? In the end, it doesn’t matter. I don’t have to trust her. I just need her to trust me.But the more time she spends here, the more the cabin’s shadowy corners reveal the secrets I’ve been keeping while a dark threat looms in the forest beyond.She says a life with me is all she wants, but I know that can’t be true. When she finds out the truth about herself, will she stay? Or will she try to run once she realizes not everyone leaves these woods alive?Author’s Note: Edge of Woods Road is a spicy modern gothic romance set near Seattle and a complete STANDALONE in the Driven by Despair Series.
