  "description": "It’s 1984, and there are lots of things the family of Helen Blumenstein, age 14, doesn’t talk about. Her cousin is gay. Helen’s best female friend may have a crush on her. Helen wants to learn about kissing girls, but she’s scared of being different. Helen will have to find her own voice and decide if she is brave enough to be exactly who she is supposed to be, even if that means being a little bit queer.",
