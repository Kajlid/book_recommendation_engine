  "title": "Samsara - the Wheel of Birth, Death and Rebirth: A journey through spirituality, religion and Asia",
  "description": "Travel with the author on a fascinating journey exploring Nepal, Bali, Cambodia and India, where samsara, the cycle of birth, death and rebirth, is at the core of their rich cultures and the religions of Buddhism and Hinduism. What insights into suffering, life and death, and what happens after death, could the idea of samsara offer to people outside of those cultures? Does spirituality mean anything in a twenty-first century world and can it exist without religion? What clues might quantum physics, parapsychology, mysticism or psychedelics give about samsara, consciousness and ourselves? This book will get you thinking about your own beliefs, life and death, and where they might fit in to the bigger picture as you travel with the writer in extraordinary cultures of astonishing variety.",
