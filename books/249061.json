  "description": "In these sixteen stories ranging from the dynamics of family life to the worldwide confusion of human values, Nadine Gordimer gives us access to many lives in places as far apart as suburban London, Mozambique, a mythical island, and South Africa. In \"Some Are Born to Sweet Delight, \" a girl's innocent love for an enigmatic foreign lodger in her parents' home leads her to involve others in a tragedy of international terrorism. \"The Moment Before the Gun Went Off\" reveals the strange mystery behind an accident in which a white farmer has killed a black boy. \"Once Upon a Time\" is a horrifying fairy tale about a child raised in a society founded on fear.",
