  "description": "A Christmas in Last Stand brings unexpected gifts to two very different people…Detective Sean Highwater may be one of the famous Highwaters, but he has always felt a half-step off because of the way his agile mind works. Only learning to focus has enabled him to not just survive, but thrive.Elena de la Cova is from a respected and highly regarded founding family, brought up with rather stringent expectations, but right now she is a widow trying to raise a son she doesn’t understand.If Last Stand had royalty, in Sean’s book it would be elegant Elena. He’s willing to help her son as he had been helped, but being that close to Elena scares him to death since he’s been in awe of her for years. Elena is impressed both with the way Sean gets through to her son, and with his appreciation for the Christmas customs of her culture as much as his own.Their perceptions of each other shift, but will the passion that strikes between them be enough to overcome their perceptions of themselves?",
