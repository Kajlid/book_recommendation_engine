  "title": "Song of Latvia: A Novel of the Latvian Resistance",
  "description": "With her husband's name on a hit list, the fight got personal. It is 1940 when World War II invades the lives of history teacher Mija Adamsons and her husband: Aleks, a Latvian colonel, has seen his name on a Soviet execution list. Aleks narrowly escapes when a black car pulls up at their house, but he fears for Mija and their two children. Germany plays the hero when it ousts the occupying Russians and ends their reign of terror, and a grateful Aleks trades one form of hell for another and joins the German Army, a move Mija does not support. She joins a group of resistance fighters, saving Jews from the ghetto, even as Aleks is pulled deeper and deeper into the Nazi killing machine. War has torn apart their family, physically and ideologicallyâ€”will Mija and Aleks ever find their way to a new beginning?",
