  "description": "Just what is reality? These five stories, set in various locations and with very different characters, prove that things are not always what they seem. In Comedy Hour, Angela is frustrated with her employer, the querulous Miss Crabtree, until one day a golden opportunity presents itself. Beautiful Land, set in the suffocating heat of Africa, tells of an unlikely friendship between Jake and the village elder. Does Philip experience an encounter with the supernatural in Night Reception: or is it all a dream? The twist at the end of Cliff Hanger's Homecoming is heart-stopping, whilst the strange events in Neighbours leaves Debbie fearing for her husband's safety. With twists and turns, these five short stories will keep the reader guessing.",
