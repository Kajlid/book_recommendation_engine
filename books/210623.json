  "description": "I’m sorry I didn’t slit your throat,” Cree growled. “You’d be a heck of a lot quieter right now if I had.”Faeries are supposed to be nice, aren’t they? At least that’s what Ben thought. Then again, according to some, he was the last Gatekeeper. Charged with closing the portal between his world and the world of Em. But Ben entered this magical place by mistake, and all he wants is to go home. It's not as if he doesn’t have enough trouble in his life already. His alcoholic step-father is out to kill him, and his abused mother never seems to know when enough is enough. Ben’s plate isn’t just full - it’s overflowing. The last thing he needs is the added responsibility of becoming the Gatekeeper. Cree, however, has different wants. The primary one being to snuff out the life of the interloper laying claim to her late fathers’ role as the Gatekeeper. Sadly, her mother won’t let her do that, so she has no choice but to settle for escorting the child of man out of Em forever. As the journey progresses, however, Cree finds herself coming face to face with something even scarier than her. Love. In the company of an exiled dwarf, a fawn, a satyr with performance issues, a goblin imp and a rhyming bridge troll, the two teens embark on a series of adventures unlike anything you’ve ever seen before.Will Ben leave Em? Or, will he fulfill his destiny as the last Gatekeeper and close the gate between the worlds? More importantly, will he survive the volatile purple-haired half-breed faerie out to end his life in the most violent manner imaginable?You’ll be hooked on this tale from page one. After-all, who doesn’t love an adventure with a foul tempered faerie in it?",
