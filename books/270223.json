  "description": "Lieutenant Kel Ramsey is an officer on the Coalition space ship Leviathan, looking for some peace and quiet after fighting in one of the galaxy's most brutal wars. Kel has spent ten years of her life hating and fighting the Coalition's number one enemy, a warring alien race called the D'Jaja. She's also spent the past ten years running from her past and Ari, the only girl she ever loved. During a routine mission Kel's ship intercepts a distress call and finds renewed D'Jaja activity on her former homeworld, putting into question the supposed peace. Suddenly Kel's ordered military life and her volatile past are doomed to collide. With Ari's life threatened by a D'Jaja virus and the entire Coalition endangered by the alien threat, Kel and a cobbled-together team must go on a chase through the galaxy to avert the crisis. Can the team avoid D'Jaja detection and follow the trail of clues to complete the mission and protect the Coalition? More importantly, can Kel and Ari put aside their contentious past and save the galaxy?",
