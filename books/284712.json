But when her brother gets cold feet and goes missing before the wedding, Ayana must team up with Jackson to find him. And when a freak snowstorm strands her with Jackson in a secluded mountain cabin, Ayana must do all she can to protect her heart from falling once again under his spell.  *Tuscan Nights originally appeared in Hot Christmas Nights, an anthology published by Harlequin Kimani Arabesque, 2014  *Second-Chance Christmas originally appeared in A Very Merry Christmas, an anthology published by Harlequin Kimani Arabesque, 2013",
