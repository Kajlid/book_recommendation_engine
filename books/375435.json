But there are no substitutes in Halley 's life for his two great loves: his beautiful, bitchy ex-wife., and thoroughbred racing.And they're both in trouble ..trouble that has led him into a battle of nerves with an elegant, vicious aristocrat -- where losing could be worse than the loss of his hand, his career or his wife -- and where surviving means a desperate confrontation with his own worst fear.",
