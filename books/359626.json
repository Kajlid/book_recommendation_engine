  "title": "Moonlit Tours",
  "description": "Moonlit Tours is the story of three metropolitan cab drivers with diverse backgrounds that pool their resources to create a get-rich-quick scheme of questionable legality. Their enterprise, Moonlit Tours, offers deluxe, safari-like excursions into the city’s soft underbelly where decadence, moral oblivion, and depravity are close enough for their jaded, affluent patrons to witness in vivid detail. Despite careful planning, however, the three are unable to insulate their clients from this spectacle of sin. By providing a bridge between cultural poles the naïve trio inadvertently sets a catastrophic equation into motion. Densely populated with quirky characters from all walks of life, rich with dark comedy, and fueled by a crime story reaching out in all directions like a spider web, this social satire is a tale of incremental evil; a thoughtless, lazy fall from grace, and the terrible price of redemption.",
