  "description": "How was the world made and how did we get here? All human cultures have ancient accounts of the creation of the Earth, and people, that have been passed down through an oral tradition of storytelling, until they were eventually written down. These traditional cosmological stories have universally they define our place in the universe and gave meaning to our existence. Journey to The Science of How We Got Here reveals a new cosmological story that is based on the evidence and skepticism of science. It explores and explains the science itself, from the physics of stars and the formation of rocky planets, to the evolution of life and the epic journey of humans out of Africa to nearly every continent the Earth. There has never before been one creation story that was shared by all the people of the world. Today, however, nearly all of humanity shares the methods and products of science. Science has become a universal language across all cultures; and thus the new creation story produced by science is the story of all the people of the world. It is the common ground upon which we all stand. Journey to Civilization is written for the non-scientist in clear, straight-forward language, and is richly illustrated with diagrams, charts, and beautiful color graphics and photographs. It will enrich the readerâ€™s understanding of science, and it will change their view of humanity and our place in the universe.",
