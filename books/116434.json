But to Bob, a struggling artist, life with Rosalind was torment, for she had artfully destroyed his faith in himself. Then Elsa appeared, with her beauty and he impassioned eagerness, and suddenly Bob knew he needed to be free. With her arrival, life also takes a new turn for Shawe Delancey, Bob's friend, who hates his own rich, shrewish wife, Josephine.When Rosalind drowns and murder is hinted, the resulting undertow of conflict and suspicion drags them all down a dark trail of terror. Delancey follows this trail further than most, as he twice dreams Josephine dead--dreams that prove to be a death wish! \"Swift action and crepitating conversation. Dangerous.\"--Saturday Review of Literature",
