Everyone knows it, but no one knows how long or how many generations they've been in the ship. Nia, a ship board engineer finds out in the confines of the ship, society has become too conformist and the leaders too powerful. It is not in their best interests that the ship should arrive or that their charges should ever leave. Which is why it's a good thing that Nia and her friends can read the clues left in children's rhymes about an old secret deep within the ship.",
