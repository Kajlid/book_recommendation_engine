  "title": "Proud and Determined: a History of the Stockbridge Mohicans 1734-2014",
  "description": "Two Mohican villages and the remnants of other Algonquian-speaking tribes coalesce around a Christian mission in Massachusetts. Hard times force them to make a number of westward removals. The bulk of the action takes place in present-day Wisconsin. For these \"civilized\" Indians, the tribal church is not separate from the tribal government, not until a time comes when the United States tries to dismantle the tribe. Will the Stockbridge Mohicans maintain their tribal identity after federal Indian policy sets them against each other? Will they be able to avoid the bottle and other temptations after their philanthropic mission society pulls its support? Can a long-suffering, proud and determined people make a multi-faceted comeback?",
