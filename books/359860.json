  "description": "Trusted surgeon. Loving wife. Murderer?Before my world came crashing down, I had it all. The successful career I dreamed of. The beautiful red-brick home where I could relax in front of the fire. The handsome, devoted husband whose blue eyes and charming smile always made me feel safe.As I call time of death, my voice is steady. My colleagues stand hushed around me, their eyes on me, confused, concerned.I have never lost a patient until today.My hands tremble inside their gloves. I slide down the cold tiled walls, my heart racing in my chest.I have never hated a patient until today.But what choice did I have, once I recognized him?And what will I do to protect myself, if someone learns the truth?",
