He is distracted by a married Russian countess, whose criminal brother Nicholas Rokoff is a real villain for the series. Tarzan is set up for attack by a dozen Paris muggers. Tarzan fondly recalls his foster ape mother to D'Arnot:\"To you my friend, she would have appeared a hideous and ugly creature, but to me she was beautiful -- so gloriously does love transfigure its object.\"",
