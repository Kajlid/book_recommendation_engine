  "description": "This is the complete set of the Amazon top 10 best selling Dark Legacy series. Includes Broken Wings, Broken Trust, Broken Legacy, AND a brand new bonus epilogue They rule my new town, my school, and with more money than God, thereâ€™s very little out of their reach. Four gorgeous, perfect, scary boys. There used to be five, but one of them died, leaving a fifth position that I now fill. I didn't ask for this. I didn't want to be part of this billionaire-boys-club. But no one cares about what I want. Sebastian Beckett is the worst of them. Their leader. He draws me in, and strips me of every defense I have. He calls me Butterfly, but it's not a pet name, it's a threat. Beck wants nothing more than to break my wings, pin me to a board and watch me writhe. He wants to see me broken. Body, heart and soul. And what these elite want, they get. Only they've never met Riley Jameson. Let the battle begin. *This dark contemporary romance features one girl and four sexy, dangerous boys but is NOT a reverse harem.*",
