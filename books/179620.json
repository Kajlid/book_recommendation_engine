He has no friends at college, can’t pick up a guy to save his life, and his annoyingly hot jerk of a TA just gave him a crappy grade. But Parker’s bad day suddenly becomes a deadly night. In a blink, he’s surrounded by screaming and chaos and so much blood. People are transforming into zombie-like killers. Parker’s fighting for his life—and without Adam, that muscle-bound jerk who gave him a C-minus, he’d be dead meat. But Adam has a secret…Kick at the Darkness is a steamy gay romance from Keira Andrews featuring enemies to lovers, forced proximity, werewolves, the zombie apocalypse, and of course a happy ending (eventually).",
