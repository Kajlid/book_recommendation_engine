  "description": "PART 2: Shifter/Vampire Serial Stolen by the Alpha Wolf is a follow on to Chosen by the Vampire Kings. It is strongly recommended that you read this 6 part serial first.  Ever since Stephany's return from the wolf’s clutches, she’s felt like her veins were on fire. What the hell did he do to her? What poison? What form of potent witchcraft was this? If only the explanation were so simple, then she could take an antidote. Find a cure somewhere, somehow. What she can't do is erase her memories of Ward or her burning need for him. What she doesn’t know is that things are about to become infinitely more difficult for her…so bad she’ll be forced to call the alpha to her side with dire consequences.  Deliberate Theft is Part 2 of a 3 part serial and is approximately 23,000 words/94 pages. Make sure you read Chosen by the Vampire Kings first for the most enjoyment. The Story Contains strong sexual themes/language and is not intended for readers under the age of 18.",
