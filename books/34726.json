Not that anyone cares...least of all his boss. The tiny Caribbean island of San Esteban seems harmless enough-at first blush, it resembles a latter-day Margaritaville as much as anything else. But Paul soon finds out that there's more than a touch of Casablanca-style intrigue about the place too...complete with friends who don't want his help, enemies who are all too willing to help, and an international playgirl who's got him in her sights. Nice work if you can get it...",
