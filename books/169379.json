  "description": "Clay Jacobs harbors a dangerous secret. Evie, the object of his teenage obsession, isn’t human. But instead of destroying the supernatural threat, as he’s been instructed by the Rain—the organization he belongs to—he let her escape.The memory of the one who got away not only haunts him but holds him captive and assaults him nightly. Unable to escape the visions, and the guilt, he races across the country to locate her and correct his mistake. Instead of the monster he expects, he finds a woman who ensnares him with her charms. In her embrace, Clay dares to imagine a different life. One free of the constant need to kill. His family—and the oaths he made to them—is not so easy to escape though. When the past catches up to him, it won’t only be his happiness but also the life of his lover at risk. What will it take to free himself from the grip of the Rain?",
