  "description": "Crowded girl bars, shady chat rooms, lesbian parties, women’s soccer. You name it and Adrian Edwards is there, prowling like the fiercest of hunters, focused on a perpetual search for that ever elusive four letter word called ‘love.’ From woman to woman she goes, relentless in her pursuit. Tamara, her best friend since high school, is always there to lend an ear or to roll her eyes as Adrian once again casts aside another woman, ticking off all the things that were ‘wrong’ about her. So used to the game, Tamara gives her gifts for the ‘hunt’ like safari hats, compasses and old fashioned looking glasses. Only problem is, they don’t seem to help.Searching as if truly blindfolded, Adrian continues on her quest, going from a young, troubled go-go dancer, to an obsessive mail carrier, to a tweaked out tomboy, to a lusciously aggressive accountant with way more than numbers on her mind.Until one day Adrian realizes she has to learn to be with the person she’s been resisting all along. Herself. It is while on this inner journey that a special someone truly steps into view and shakes up her world for good, proving once and for all that love is never elusive… as long as you love yourself.Chasing Love is a heartfelt journey, one full of humor, sex, startling frankness, gripping reality and hard learned life lessons.",
