  "description": "Some stories should never be told. Others have to be—it’s the only way. Since moving back to my hometown of Hastings, Texas, I’ve been called a whore, tramp, and homewrecker. And maybe I’m all of those things and more. But those people don’t know me. They don’t see me. They only see my mistakes. My little brother is my entire world, and if I can give him what I never had—love and security—then returning to the town that hates me will be worth it. I’m prepared for the whispers and stares, but the moment a knight in a black truck crosses my path, it’s clear that I’m not ready for kindness. As he, my brother’s sexy teacher, and the town’s golden boy work to break down my walls by standing between me and the hate, I find myself beginning to hope again. Maybe redemption is within reach...if I share my story.  **Love Notes is a series of interconnected, reverse harem standalone novels. Though cheating is a theme throughout Scarlett XOXO, there is no cheating between the main characters.",
