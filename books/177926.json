  "description": "The Sufi poet Rumi says: \"When you feel a peaceful joy, then you are near the truth.\" Every page in this book is aimed at creating some form of peaceful joy. Have you ever wondered what is the purpose of life, or how to stay sane in a mad world? Why do bad things happen? What happens when we die? What can we learn from our children? How can we find relationships that actually work? How can we learn to love ourselves? These are some of the many questions asked in this book along with the resulting answers as discovered by Melissie Jolly on her colourful journey as a seeker. In this series of questions and answers she invites you to join in the conversation and find your own truth.  In truth, you ask questions not to find answers, but to reactivate the light within you, the true light which fear has kept you from fully knowing and living. As you reactivate that light within, as your light expands, fear has no choice but to dissipate and dissolve and as it does, you find yourself living more and more from light and from the place of love inside you. This book is a reminder for you as a seeker that the truth always lives within you. It will help you remember who you really are, what youâ€™re really here for and how and why you exist at this time, in this place.",
