  "description": "A sparkling social comedy from the author of Somebody. What happens when you finally get a chance, and your confidence shrinks to the size of a peanut? What happens when your clever, successful family, who have always rejected you, suddenly find themselves under threat? What happens when the roles you play begin to take over your life? Tarra Cameron is surprised to be asked to a family reunion, particularly since it takes place in the strange college owned by her most alienated sister. But understanding dawns when she discovers that all the members of the family have been receiving sinister approaches. It seems that they have confused her real self with her most successful acting role, and cast her as a detective. The family and their hangers on, the college staff and students and the promise of doom create a wonderful cast of characters and likely suspects. And Tarra seems more likely to win a coffin than an Oscar.",
