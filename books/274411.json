  "description": "For years, Arden McMillan has been hiding his phobia in plain sight. People can believe whatever they want to believe about him so long as they never learn the truth. It’s easier to lie than to be seen as a coward. Besides, it’s no one’s business but his own.It’s been ten years since Ignatius Rojas—or Iggy—has seen Arden. Their reunion doesn’t suit either of their families, but their connection is hard to ignore.The problem is, Iggy sees behind Arden’s masks. He sees the way Arden is slowly killing himself, and he can only ignore it for so long. If he can’t break through Arden’s tough shell and convince him he needs help, he could end up burying the man he’s growing to love.",
