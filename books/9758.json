Leading up to the point where the personal entity is increasingly fused with the political identity, it ends with a prayer for peace in times of political conflicts and social turmoil plaguing the violent homeland.Uddipana is Assamese literature editor of 'Muse India', a literary e-journal. She has been addressing issues of ethnicity, nationalism, migration, displacement, conflicts and reconciliation in Northeast India through her writings",
