And while Blake doesn’t remember handsome, arrogant Declan MacKenna from their ill-fated encounter ten years ago, Declan remembers him. And he wants payback.Declan offers Blake a humiliating, degrading deal he has no choice but to take even though it's all kinds of wrong. While Blake may be an alpha werewolf, so is Declan—and he out-alphas Blake at every turn. Blake shouldn’t enjoy what Declan does to him. He shouldn’t crave things no alpha should ever accept. Declan’s turned him into someone he doesn’t recognize: helpless, needy, and out of control.Declan wants to keep hating Blake, but he can't. Blake wants to trust Declan, but that’s impossible. When magical and mundane attacks threaten them both, Blake has nowhere to turn. Will Declan realize his feelings run deeper than desire in time to save them both? If not, they could lose everything…even their lives.The Alpha’s Gamble is part of the Mismatched Mates series, but it can be read as a standalone.
