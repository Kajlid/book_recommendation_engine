  "description": "A.D. Winans talks candidly in his won words about his friendships with such literary luminaries as Alvah Bessie, one of the Hollywood 10, Bob Kaufmaun, the beatific poet of the San Francisco Renaissance, Jack Micheline, poetic raconteur of the greatest magnitude, and Charles Bukowski, the legendary poet and novelist whose legendary shadow still causes much debate to this day. The history and storytelling are richly textured and masterfully woven into one book of magical nuances that come from being there at the time and in the moment.",
