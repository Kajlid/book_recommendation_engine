  "description": "The Narratives is collection of short introspective essays written by an average guy in an effort to better understand himself, his life, and his relationship with the world around him while traveling the road of self-discovery. These works can best be described as the author's unique brand of journaling, encompassing both self-reflective entries, and an expression of thoughts and opinions surrounding social issues of the present day.The Narratives III: Fanning The Flames departs from its predecessors, taking a more cynical personal tone and presenting a more pointed, indignant, view. Half the essays are a further examination of the author's innermost thoughts, while the remaining pieces are lightweight \"op-ed's\", touching on issues that are front and center to our national discourse.The Narratives III: Fanning The Flames, is the third volume in The Narratives series.",
