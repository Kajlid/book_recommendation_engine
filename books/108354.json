  "title": "We Were Flying to Chicago",
  "description": "In this striking debut collection, characters find unexpected moments of profound insight while navigating the monotony of daily life. Here we find a man who drives to the wrong mountain, a hubcap cleaner who moonlights as a karaoke star, and a deliveryman whose urgent letters have no willing recipient. While lulled by the deceptively simple rhythm of the ordinary, Kevin Clouther offers the instant before momentous changeâ€”the view over the cliff, the intake of breath before a decision, a glimpse of stark vulnerability, of faith and hope.",
