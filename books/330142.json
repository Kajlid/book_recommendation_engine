  "title": "The Illustrated Christmas Cracker",
  "description": "For over 30 years, in lieu of Christmas cards, the distinguished historian John Julius Norwich has been sending friends his Christmas Crackers—personal collections of quirky quotes and literary odds and ends. Every decade, these have been collected into an anthology. Now Quentin Blake has made a selection of his favorite pieces, illustrating them in his own inimitable style. From curious dictionary definitions to Benjamin Franklin’s account of inventing bifocals, this cracker is stuffed with surprising, offbeat, often hilarious gems.",
