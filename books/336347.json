It starts with a serious reality check and an unlevel, highly competitive playing field: high school. You need skills to reach the peak of the high school A-list now, and making varsity cheer isn't even a start.  So step behind the velvet rope with this powerful and hilarious field guide. Unlock the secrets of popularity and personality.  Go on, embrace the Climb.",
