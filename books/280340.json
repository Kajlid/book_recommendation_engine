  "description": "Gemma was always searching for a cause. She was never afraid to risk something if it meant benefiting the greater good.   But what happens when that risk becomes more than she can handle alone?  Is she willing to risk those around her if it means protecting hundreds of innocent lives?  Lincoln was always searching for Miss Right.  He was never afraid to fall if falling meant he'd land in love.  But what happens when Miss Right turns out to be someone he shouldn't want? Is he willing to risk the relationships he has with his friends and family if it means winning the love of a woman he can't be without?",
