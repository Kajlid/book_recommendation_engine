  "title": "A Splendor of Letters: The Permanence of Books in an Impermanent World",
  "description": "In A Splendor of Letters , Nicholas A. Basbanes continues the lively, richly anecdotal exploration of book people, places, and culture he began in 1995 with A Gentle Madness (a finalist that year for the National Book Critics Circle Award) and expanded in 2001 with Patience & Fortitude , a companion work that prompted the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and biographer David McCullough to proclaim him \"the leading authority of books about books.\" In this beautifully packaged edition, Basbanes brings to a close his wonderful trilogy on the remarkable world of books and bibliophiles.",
