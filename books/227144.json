At nineteen years of age, Willow is old enough to know the difference between right and wrong, but her illicit affair with her father's business partner blurs the lines between both.

Soon, the truth behind her captivity comes to light, and neither Willow nor her captor will ever be the same again. Sordid is the first book in a trilogy. Sordid is a dark, erotic, taboo, romance.
