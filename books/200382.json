  "description": "Jacynda Lassiter s latest assignment is a double-edged sword: find the greatest of all Time Rovers and send him to 2057 without his consent. If she returns Harter Defoe to the future, she ll be branded a traitor to her kind. If she fails, the punishment is a decade in prison. As Jacynda searches her conscience and the back alleys of Whitechapel, Sgt. Jonathon Keats presses his hunt for an Irish anarchist and the missing explosives. Unable to use his shape-shifting abilities, Keats troubles are just beginning. Unless his good friend Alastair Montrose can uncover who framed him for murder, Keats might be next for the hangman's rope.",
