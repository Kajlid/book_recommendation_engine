  "description": "She opened her front door and knew he wasn't going to be selling her cookies... Adam \"Cypher\" Stonecypher's black ops for hire organization barters goods for services and wants for nothing. He boasts a confidence rating of over 97% on every op he chooses no matter how technical or dangerous, but a small favor for his mother, the Governor's wife, requires a woman's touch. When he blackmails scout mommy Alexandra Hamilton into assisting on what should be a low-risk case, he learns too late for both of them he's been betrayed. His professional future, the safety of world leaders, and Adam and Alexandra's lives are all on the line. His \"easily manipulated\" new helper is tougher than she looks and MacGyvers her way out of multiple sticky situations, proving to be far more than even Adam imagined as they hunt for stolen G-8 Summit security specs and the ruthless predators who will kill to retrieve them. Even worse for Adam's peace of mind, Alexandra is a woman who has loved and lost. She easily sees beyond his emotional firewall to what the ultimate tactician secretly wants most and poses a clear security threat to his carefully guarded heart. Not only can his underestimated new partner help him save the day, Alexandra is the answer the well connected loner has been seeking-- --if they will just choose to take the greatest risk one... more... time.",
