  "description": "With the ink still dry on her new veterinary license, Rodeo Queen Ruth Davis returns to Angel Springs as the new town vet. It seems her plans to save the world as a veterinary missionary are on hold. But, when her first patient arrives in the arms of battered rodeo man, Dodge Atwell, she realizes God has bigger plans than she ever dreamed possible.The last thing Dodge wants, or needs, in his life is Ruth. Her annoying habit of quoting Scripture only serves to remind him that she's everything he's not-Pure, innocent, good.When Dodge returns to her clinic, with yet another rescued dog, Ruth cannot help but become fascinated with the man and his scars-the physical ones there for the world to see, as well as spiritual ones she senses lurking beneath the surface.Could the reluctant animal savior be the hero she's been waiting for all her life?",
