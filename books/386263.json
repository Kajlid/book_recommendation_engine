  "description": "Firefighter paramedic Mallory \"Ice\" James commands a crew of smokejumpers—twenty women and men who eat together, sleep together, and parachute into the face of raging forest fires together. Discipline and teamwork mean the difference between life and death on the line, and she's earned her reputation as cool and controlled in the face of danger. \"Hot Shot\" Jace Russo never met a rule she wouldn't break and doesn't plan to stop just because the woman setting the terms is drop-dead gorgeous and hotter than the blazes they're supposed to be dousing. Mallory and Jace may not like each other much, but lust isn't something either can control—and they soon discover ice burns as fiercely as flame.",
