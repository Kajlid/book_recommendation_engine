  "description": "The U.S. debut of an incredible new illustrator introduces two everyday friends whose closeness endures no matter how far apart they are.\"If I call Amy really loudly, she'll hear me, won't she?\" Louie asked his mom. His mom shook her head. \"Amy is half a world away.\" Amy and Louie are the best of friends. They build towers as high as the sky, they look for magical creatures in clouds, and they always greet one another with their special call: \"Coo-ee!\" But when Amy's family moves far across the ocean, the color drains out of their lives---until Louie finds a way to restore their special bond. A perfect book for any friends separated by a move, this is the unforgettable story of a friendship lost and found.",
