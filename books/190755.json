He is also an ace sales leader at the local Mercedes Pre-Owned dealership. However, as his surrogate sister, Juliet soon discovers while snooping through Frank's closet one day, he is a Presidential Medal of Freedom winner. And as his scrapbook reveals, her patient has also collected an array of other national accolades that no used-car salesman, or any average guy named Frank, should ever possess.Can the drop-dead sexy Juliet help Frank to overcome his estrangement with his real sister? The romantic, erotic and downright hilarious twists and turns that lead Frank Knox up to that point--along with the jaw-dropping climax of the story--is sure to keep you in stitches, turned-on and flipping the pages for more.",
