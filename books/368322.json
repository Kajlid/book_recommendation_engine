  "title": "Life and Death: The Story of A Hospital",
  "description": "No institution has so captivated and intrigued Americans as the hospital. It is where the miracles of modern medicine meet the mysteries of the human body. It is where life begins-- and often ends. It embodies our hopes and fears, our capacity for heroism and compassion. Now, based on an unforgettable series of first-person narratives, LIFE AND DEATH takes us behind the scenes for an intimate and inspiring look at one of the best hospitals in the country, New York's Columbia-Presbyterian.We witness the pressure-packed decision-making process of the hospital's elite heart transplant team; spend a morning in the delivery room as twelve new lives enter the world; share the emergency staff's struggle to care for one midsummer night's wounded in New York City. From the ravages of AIDS and cocaine to the rigors of internship to the remarkable redemptive powers of our great healers, LIFE AND DEATH captures the entire range of human experience -- the poignancy, pain, and humor that are all part of a day's work at this extraordinary institution.",
