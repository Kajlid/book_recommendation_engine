  "description": "The Jamange line was designed in 2017 and has helped thousands of women around the world change and better their own lives. The Jamange Line believes self-help guru's are pointless, it doesn't promote things like body positivity and even has one or two issues with people who obsess over chakras. Relationship issues, confidence building, healing, bedroom advice and hormone release, no matter what you need, the Jamange line will cover it all for you. With guidance, scenarios, real life stories and challenges to complete, this will be the last book a female will need to make a real and positive change for herself. The Jamange Line doesn't repeat what other self-help articles and publications print all the time, it deals with never heard before facts â€“ Facts that are all backed up and proven as the book unfolds, whilst having quite a bit of fun along the way. Fashion, your star sign, diet, love, even true liberation will be explained, before finally arriving at full tantric pleasure and inner peace heading into the last chapter together.The Jamange line doesn't do theory, it does you and you can make this positive change for yourself today, fact!",
