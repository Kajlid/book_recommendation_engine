  "description": "Jaxon King is a work of art—beautiful, unique… priceless.I meet him when he admires my artwork at a hotel opening.He’s older, sophisticated… a gentleman.At least he is with his clothes on.Out of them… well, that’s a masterpiece in itself.But even a connection as strong as ours means nothing once the champagne wears off.A promise to call me.Then… nothing.When he turns up as my new boss on the biggest project of my career, I try my hardest to turn the page and leave him in the past.Only, he isn’t a memory I can simply erase.No matter how hard I try.We have this pull to one another… two colours that merge and create something heavenly.But he screws up the paper and leaves me crumpled… torn.Maybe it’s all an illusion and I should erase him from my heart once and for all?If only we could draw our own path through life. Start over.But it’s never as simple as erasing the past, not when you’re drawn to Mr. King.",
