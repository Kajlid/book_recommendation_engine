  "description": "A Dragon Mechanic? Unheard of.Unless you're Magnus Ironside, a metal dragon who just awakened in the modern world and happens to be obsessed with cars and their inner workings. Add in the fact that his mate just walked in to hire him to work at her auto shop, and Magnus is one happy dragon. Now he just has to flex his pecs, show her his huge 'axe', and everything will work out, right? Wrong.Lindy Dunn doesn't have time for a relationship, not while she's working herself to the bone trying to make ends meet. She doesn't have time to notice the huge muscles or gorgeous, jade-green eyes of the oddly sexy handyman she just hired. No matter that he's seriously good with cars, and fun to be around. With someone sabotaging her dad's shop, it's not the right time to fall into any man's arms, even if it's someone as capable as Magnus.Magnus knows he can win over Lindy, as long as he doesn't move too fast with talk of dragons and destiny. The heat between them is too blazing to deny. But though Magnus thought he'd left the past far behind him, one big storm is still approaching, bringing a dark figure that threatens to destroy everything the iron dragon holds dear.",
