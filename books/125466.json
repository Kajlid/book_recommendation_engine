  "description": "Courtney Larson is a lobbyist for the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids. Eric Morrison is a U.S. Senator from a North Carolina tobacco family. They’re entrenched on opposing sides of a new tobacco tax, with the vote slated for Valentine’s Day. As if that weren’t enough to have them running in opposite directions, Courtney is a virgin who delights in sexual innuendos, and Eric has a framed riding crop in his office that Courtney thinks he uses for sexual pleasure. Their mutual misreading of each other’s intents and desires makes for mixed signals politically and sexually. Can they find common ground on the Senate floor, and more importantly, in the bedroom?",
