  "description": "I always believed that girls like me didn’t find happily-ever-afters. But despite my sordid past and personal demons, the Miami Hush Club promised to make my every fantasy a reality.  With a membership, they could gift me my dream job, dream car, dream house, and the perfect life for me and my little family. They easily sucked me into the madness and twisted me inside out, caging me until I didn’t know right from wrong.  The steep price of entry? My darkest secret.  There’s only one problem. Some secrets destroy. Some crush. Some fragment. Some even endanger the ones I love, and the one man I never imagined I would. Because some secrets, when shared, give power. And power is a dangerous thing. Especially when the one pulling my strings, playing god, has the terrifying means to destroy me.  And worst of all, after I’ve given my secret away, I find the only thing that’s left is my wrecked and tortured soul. But guess what? Nothing’s safe. The club can take that too.",
