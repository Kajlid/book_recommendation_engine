  "description": "18+ for language and sexual situations...  Logan ‘Mack’ Reed loves women. Really loves women. He’s an equal opportunity player, happy to oblige just about anyone looking for a good time, but when a beautiful red-headed pixie walks into his club, he finds himself unable to think of anyone but her.  Darien Aherne and her sister have lost both of their parents, but create a comfortable life for themselves. Darien, however, is sheltered and overly curious, which is a dangerous combination. When Darien breaks away from the protective bubble her sister has created, she finds herself falling for a man who could break her.  When the chance of a lifetime pulls Darien into a provocative world she has no experience in, will she trust Mack enough to tell him all of her secrets?  Will he be able to protect her, even from herself?",
