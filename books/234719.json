  "description": "I don’t know where he lost his way, but we’ve been made to pay the price.To bear the burden of his … love.A sickening feeling stirs deep inside each time he looks at me because I know what it means.I have to follow the rules; be his good girl.It’s the only way to survive in this house.Being in the dark never scared me, being alone was something I used to cherish until he began to use it against me.Against us.I just want to find the light now.The place where I know his darkness can’t reach.A place where maybe everything will make sense one day, but for now, I have to be strong.I won't fall down again.I can't.Not before I find my peace there.I have to do it soon because I'm not sure how much more I can take.The original, unabriged version of Inferno can be found on my website.",
