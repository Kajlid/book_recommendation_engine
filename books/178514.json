  "description": "It's been six months since Jacque Lupei was imprisoned in the dark forest with her female pack mates, wondering if they would ever see their mates again. Six months since she and Fane found out that Jen and Decebel would not be the only couple adding a new pup to the pack. Six months of peace and quiet. Jacque doesn't know it, but the reprieve was about to be over. She and Fane thought his demons had been dealt with, but the nightmares are back and the In-Between is once again ripping a hole inside of her mate. Jacque can't stand to see him hurting. She can't stand knowing that in some way she was responsible for his struggle because she, after all, was the subject of his pain from the In-Between. She'll do anything to stop his turmoil. So she makes a desperate decision to do what she thinks her mate needs, or doesn't need. She knows that if Fane has any idea of what she has planned, he would chain her to his side. So, naturally she does what any female Canis lupus would do in her shoes--she shuts down the bond and prays that no one gets in her way. She knows he might never forgive her, but then, if her plan works, he won't even remember her name. Contains mature themes.",
