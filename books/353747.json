  "description": "This beautiful narration of the author's growing love and understanding of his master, a uniquely simple yet spiritually profound man. P. Rajagopalachari (born in 1927) was raised in the rich cultural heritage of the East, although educated extensively in the Western tradition. As he approached the questions of life with an occidental sense of doubt and a scientific mind, he was stunned to find this simple unworldly man who held the answers to human existence. Thus began an unparalleled relationship built on the wonder of the Diven and the essense of pure love. Sahaj Marg (the Natural PAth) is a system of practical training in spirituality of the Shri Ram Chandra Mission. It is in essence the well-known Raja Yoga (yoga of the mind) remodeled and simplified to suit the needs of modern day life. Its goal is inner perfection - God realization. According to the teaching of P. Rajagopalachari, God is infinite, yet simple and therefore the way to reach Him must be as simple. By proper regulation of hte mind through meditation, under the practical guidance and support of a spiritual master, one can evolve to the highest. This support is made possible through the use of Pranahuti (yogic transmission). It is defined as transmission of Divine energy for the transformation of the self. This transmission is capable of being felt by anyone who practices this system for a brief period. The nnes to live a simple and pious life as a family member is encouraged in Sahaj Marg. One is asked to accept the problems and difficulties of daily life as Divine blessings, as this environment is considered ideal for spiritual development. There are no fees charged to practice this system and all are welcome, the sole qualification being willingness to participate.,",
