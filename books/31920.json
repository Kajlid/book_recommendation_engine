  "description": "Through shock and laughter we are propelled towards understanding as we encounter a whole range of characters: the guru who preaches that 'nobody's anything'; the rich white lawyer who wants a teenage sex slave; the old comrade in anti-sexist struggle who reveals that the feminist she most admires is Scarlett O'Hara; the expert lover whose virtuosity depends on the stimulation of pornography; and the 'Emperor of Rock and Roll' whose failure to understand the songs he sings - the songs of a black woman - haunts his gold-plated empty life.In these fourteen stories, Alice Walker's truth triumphantly breaks through the taboos and contradictions of modern America, to celebrate the vitality of black women and their energy for change.",
