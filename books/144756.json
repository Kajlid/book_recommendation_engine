  "title": "Courage Under Fire",
  "description": "Courage Under Fire provides a road map of how to reclaim your life in the face of a life-threatening illness, with ways to cope with constant changing circumstances-from relationships with family and friends to the way you see yourself. Courage Under Fire goes well beyond the author's personal struggle as she fights for her survival when confronted with cancer. The intensely personal story leads us from the cancer diagnosis, through the sometimes painful process of treatment and through to a surprisingly successful outcome-which doesn't have to do with overcoming cancer, but overcoming fear and uncertainty through faith. Yilda Rivera provides ways in conquering our fears, accepting our flaws, and tapping into our potential. Courage Under Fire is not only an open and honest account of someone's life and journey through cancer; it is a compelling story of strength, courage and faith in the face of fear and adversity. This story will help readers discover the confidence they need to stand and prevail in the face of fear and hardship, and to discover that despite uncertainty and chaos, there are still choices we could make. Courage Under Fire is heartwarming, uplifting and yet astonishingly life-affirming. It will take you to the very edge.",
