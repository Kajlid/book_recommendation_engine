And died there.To Fiona’s delight, she does make good friends with the other girls, as well as with the spirit of an attractive eighteenth-century gentleman, and the charming estate manager. However, Fiona finds herself tested as the deeper secrets and mysteries of Wyndriven surround her. Will she be able to help those who truly need her? What will become of their lives—and their souls—if she is unable to overpower the mysterious evil that refuses to die?",
