  "description": "Jack knew all about secrets. The government trusted him to keep them, find them, exploit them. Home for a short rest from that world, he hadn't meant to overhear his sexy neighbor's darkest desires. Being the focus of those wicked wishes was news to him.Introducing Carmen to the fantasy of being a submissive was a mission he didn't expect to last long. He certainly didn't expect her to show him natural sensuality that brought him to his knees.A lifetime of looking at the other side of the fence brought a man to this. Investing more than he could afford and it wasn't cash. Carmen came with a dangerous price. One he'd willingly pay to keep this woman safe in his arms.",
