  "description": "At the tender age of sixteen, Nadia Morales loses both of her parents in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. Growing up as a ward of the state of Texas, she was shy and painfully introverted. Against all odds, Nadia became one of the youngest CEO’s in the state of Texas. She learned the hard way that putting her trust in the wrong man, an insider in the business world, sometimes gets you nothing but pain and heartache. But sometimes, karma has a way of straightening out those curves life throws at you. Meet Drake Thompson-business owner, Wall Street guru, and good ole Texas playboy- he’s got the requisite amount of ladies fawning over him to prove it. Since the death of Nadia’s parents, he’s watched out for her, and always kept a keen eye on her business proceedings. He’s never been more proud than when she was named President for the Browning Corporation. He believes his soft spot for her is purely innocent…as that of a family member…but is it?But each of them is hiding something life altering from the other. Nadia…her obsessive love for a man that treats her like a kid sister, and Drake, well, he’s not wholly human. While their secrets marinate in mystery and denials, the pressure builds, culminating in a final revelation of barrier breaking truths.Will Nadia finally be able to have the man of her dreams, or will Drake’s true nature destroy this couple’s chance at love?",
