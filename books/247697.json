  "title": "Encounters with Nigel",
  "description": "Nigel Jenkins – poet, encyclopaedist, psychogeographer, campaigner, teacher, performer and superb prose stylist – was a man of Gower, of Swansea and, in the deepest sense possible, of Wales.Published in the year of his untimely and all-too-premature passing, Encounters with Nigel gathers critical essays, creative pieces and tributes from fellow writers, former students and family members. Together they explore the many sides of a fascinating man, who had an uncommon generosity of spirit, not to mention the best reading voice this side of the Urals.Among the many contributors are John Barnie, D.J. Britton, Fflur Dafydd, Stevie Davies, Menna Elfyn, Peter Finch, Steve Griffiths, Edwina Hart, David Hughes, Anne Lauppe-Dunbar, Robert Minhinnick, M. Wynn Thomas, and Daniel G. Williams.",
