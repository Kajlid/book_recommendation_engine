And when Kirk and his colleagues get close to the truth, can they unravel the mystery before they become the next victims?John Blackburn (1923-1993) was the author of more than thirty popular thrillers in which he blended the genres of mystery, horror, and science fiction in unique and often brilliant ways. Although recognized as the best British horror writer of his time, his works have been sadly neglected since his death. This new edition of Broken Boy (1959), Blackburn's third novel, includes a new introduction by Greg Gbur.\"Our only current writer who can induce such terror as the Grimm Brothers did.\" - Times Literary Supplement\"A real chiller. . . . The book moves rapidly from beginning to end and Hitchcock ought to be advised. It would make a heck of a movie.\" - Evening News\"He is certainly the best British novelist in his field and deserves the widest recognition.\" - Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural",
