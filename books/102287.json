  "description": "Corrie Black, owner of the Black Horse Campground, hopes for a successful start to her summer season but the discovery of Marvin Landry, a long-time guest, shot dead in his own RV, along with $50,000 in cash missing, does not herald a good beginning... especially since the victim's handicapped wife and angry stepson seem to have little interest in discovering who murdered him. Was Marvin's murder planned or just convenient? And is the appearance of a mysterious biker with a shadowy past that includes a recently deceased wife merely a coincidence? Despite opposition from former flame, Sheriff Rick Sutton, Corrie is determined to find out who murdered her guest. But will she find out who is friend or foe before the murderer decides it's the end of the road for Corrie? About the After her son was born in 1994, Amy Bennett stayed at home for two years (after having worked as a cake decorator, a clerk for a medical supply company, and retail sales clerk for her in-laws' religious gift shop) where she began to study the craft of writing fiction. When she first heard of National Novel Writing Month in 2004, she began writing in earnest. Currently, she works at Wal-Mart of Ruidoso Downs (not too far from her fictional Bonney County) as a cake decorator and at Noisy Water Winery (where you can find some of the best wines in the state of New Mexico, including Jo Mamma's White.) She and her family lives in a small town halfway between Alamogordo and Ruidoso.",
