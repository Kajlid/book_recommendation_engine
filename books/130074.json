  "title": "A Second Life: A journey into traditional Judaism",
  "description": "John Bergman is a successful Jewish attorney, married to Ronni Katz a licensed dietician, and father to Betty. He was never given a Jewish education. His father, a disgruntled Holocaust survivor, was angry with God for being silent during the Holocaust, and determined to strip himself and his family of any connection to his birth religion. Faced with a life threatening illness, John makes a promise to God that if he recovers he will commit to traditional Judaism. This is a story about an intellectual and spiritual journey told through vignettes that portray the everyday experiences of the traditional Jewish family. A story of faith, family and friendship.",
