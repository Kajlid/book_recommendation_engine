  "description": "Kids love sweets! And they'll love this funny and kind book about donuts, jelly beans, cakes, and pastry for sure! Their parents will love this book too because these sweets explain to children why it is so important to eat vegetables, and how not to mix up their days of the week. What can be more important for parents than their child's health? Little girl Eliza Eclair confused the days of the week waiting for her friends Chandra Chocolate Cake and Lindsay Lollipop. Instead of them, the Jelly Bean twins come for their piano lesson. Eliza's mother Dorothy Donut helps her little daughter, buys a calendar, and explains how to use it never to mix up her days of the week. The funny story, life lessons and amazing watercolor illustrations make this picture book one of the best children's books about healthy eating by age 2-5 of all time!",
