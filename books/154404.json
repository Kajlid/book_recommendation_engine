  "description": "\"Charts a faithful theological middle course through complex sexual issues\"How different are men and women? When does it matter to us -- or to God? Are male and female the only two options? In \"Sex Difference in Christian Theology\" Megan DeFranza explores such questions in light of the Bible, theology, and science.Many Christians, entrenched in culture wars over sexual ethics, are either ignorant of the existence of intersex persons or avoid the inherent challenge they bring to the assumption that everybody is born after the pattern of either Adam or Eve. DeFranza argues, from a conservative theological standpoint, that all people are made in the image of God -- male, female, and intersex -- and that we must listen to and learn from the voices of the intersexed among us.",
