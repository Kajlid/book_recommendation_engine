  "title": "Lilith Rising 1969",
  "description": "The roar of a hundred Harley’s electrifies fifteen year old Lilly . She has run away from home in search of adventure. When she catches the eye of Leader of the toughest motorcycle gang in Chicago, Lilly is flattered. But what she doesn’t realize is that she is no match for a man twice her age who has just finished serving time in prison. Danger surrounds her at every turn and young Lilly might just find that the journey she has embarked upon could cost her dearly, perhaps even her life. Travel back in time to 1969, when the world was in a state of transformation. War raged in South East Asia, while students in the United States protested the draft. The civil rights movement had begun to take hold. And the innocence of the America of the 1950’s was shattered as it witnessed the assassination of Political and Civil Rights leaders. Motorcycle gangs terrorized the streets as they combed the countryside. And young people from all over the world hitchhiked along the legendary route 66 on their way to San Francisco and the district known as “The Haight.” It was a time of learning and a time of change. And no one who lived through these turbulent times would ever forget them. Please be forewarned that this book contains explicit sexual scenes and harsh language, which were necessary for the authenticity of the story.",
