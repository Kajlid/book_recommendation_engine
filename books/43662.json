  "description": "Red Lust, the sequel to Purple PassionStella likes to get a flogging now and then at a local BDSM club, and she knows how to play the game of submission well enough to make sure the tops give her what she wants. She keeps her professional life as a physical therapist carefully separate from her life of kink until the arrival of Evan, a hot and skilled Master with a whipping arm that needs her professional care.But Evan wants more than a doctor and a willing target, and he sees through the role Stella plays to a woman who hasn’t met the right master -- until now. While he’s happy to indulge her penchant for floggers, he has his own set of sensual games he’d like to teach her that will leave the curvy redhead hot with lust -- and maybe love.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find objectionable: anal play/intercourse, BDSM theme and elements (which may include scenes of bondage, spanking, and other elements practiced within a BDSM lifestyle).",
