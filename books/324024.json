Yeah, I'm going to rule her world.I might be a billionaire, but I'm a Montana rancher through and through. I lead a simple, quiet life. I don't care about contracts and mergers.Then why do I want the feisty, pint-sized lawyer from New York?She's everything I'm not, a workaholic with something to prove.When I get her separated from her cell, her laptop-and her panties-she'll see there's more to life than the corner office.Except I might find there's more for me than riding the open range.",
