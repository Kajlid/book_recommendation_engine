  "description": "Tick tock  The time for my release is approaching  But my hopes of making it out of here as a free woman are diminishing with every passing second.  Men can do beautiful things in the name of God or love- I've seen it.  But they can do evil things for the same reasons too.  And those who suffer not from love, but obsession? They're capable of the most heinous acts.  And all a girl, who is the source for both conditions- love and obsession alike- is pray that someone- anyone- is watching over her.  That someone is guiding them.  That one person in this world will put her needs before their own.  I'm not hopeful that someone is watching over me.  But I am praying.  Every day.  In Book #2 in the True Eden Chronicles, sixteen year-old Larkin Whittaker has a choice to make, a risk to take, a heart to give away- and the repercussions of all of the above to live with after. She knows that if she stays focused and untouchable, that she could end up living the life that she's dreamt of, since Kohl Barachiel first introduced her to romance novelsâ€¦ But she also knows that there's something, some force inside Eden or within herself, that is blackening the Barachiel men's pristine souls, and forcing them to each tighten their grip on hers.  One of them is destined to crush her, but which one? The one who holds her hand, her heart- or her contract? Only time, and strength of character, will tell. In fact, the only thing that she does know for sure, is that only a miracle will be able to extricate her from paradise unharmed now.",
