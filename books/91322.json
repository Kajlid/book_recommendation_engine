  "description": "Retta Barre's not the first 12-year-old girl to travel the Oregon Trail, and she won't be the last. But for something that's supposed to be the grandest adventure of her life, the days sure are dull! Thick dust, vindictive bugs, and picking up buffalo chips--not exactly the stuff of the action-packed penny novels she loves to read. When things change in Retta's life, though, they change fast! A simple trip into the prairie, mixed with Retta's enthusiasm and timing, brings adventure and trouble--all at the same time! Soon Retta is the talk of the wagon train, and her friends don't want to miss the next caper she's sure to stumble into. And Retta certainly won't let them down.",
