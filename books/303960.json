  "description": "Lennon:Adventure. Passion. Freedom.I want it all. After spending two years with a man who treated me more like his personal maid than his girlfriend, I won’t let anyone tie me down again. I’ve always been a free spirit and I’m ready to make up for lost time. When Dalton Kelley walks into the bakery where I work, promising me every single thing my heart desires with one look, I jump at the chance. And, boy, does he deliver. Being with Dalton is like jumping over fire, dancing in the rain, and falling from the sky. As scary as it is exciting, I’m determined to ride the lightning for as long as I can. I just hope I don’t get burned in the process.Dalton:Reckless. Hothead. Asshole. I’ve heard it all before. They say I have an anger problem and they’re right. My story is the same one you’ve heard a hundred times - a terrible childhood and neglectful parents - but I survived. I’ve just never had anyone or anywhere to call my own - until her. Lennon stole my focus the moment she walked into the room and I couldn’t stay away from her. She’s not looking for anything serious and neither am I, but I can’t deny that there is something between us - something special and something I’ve never felt before. Now, I just need to convince her of that.",
