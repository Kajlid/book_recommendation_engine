  "description": "For the majority of us, life runs a normal course of ups and downs. For some, it’s a career that makes us happy. For others, it’s family. For the lucky ones, it’s both. Everyone goes through times when something will throw you off course. But what happens when life doesn’t merely throw you a curveball, but a bomb?This is the story of an average woman who was thrown not one bomb, but two and how her extraordinary well of good humor and positivity got her through the loss of two daughters over a five-year time span. The author takes you on a journey laced with humor and wit through a life that normally wouldn’t have distinguished itself from anyone else’s but gave her the strength to get through any parent’s worst nightmare -- twice.“This isn’t a book which tells you how to get to the other side.This is a book which tells you that you can.”",
