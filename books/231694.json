  "description": "Phoenix-native Skyler Doucet’s plans with her BFF are ruined when her mom and Japanese stepfather move the entire family to Nagoya, Japan for the summer before her senior year.

Prepare to fall in with Sky, with David, and with all of Japan!\" ~Tera Lynn Childs, award-winning author of OH. MY.
