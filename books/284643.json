  "description": "The first edition of The Gospel According to Jesus won wide acclaim in confronting the 'easy-believism' that has characterized some quarters in evangelical Christianity. This expanded edition deepens the debate over 'lordship salvation' and the biblical understanding of faith and works in adding three new chapters and an appendix. The new chapters: - The Vine and the Branches - The Promise of Justification - Tetelestai! The Triumph is Complete -- The appendix contains answers to the most often asked questions on the subject of what Jesus really meant when he said 'Follow me.'",
