  "title": "The Chalet School and Richenda",
  "description": "Richenda Fry has been sent to the Chalet School as a punishment. Her father is a specialist in historic porcelain and Richenda cannot resist handling the beautiful items, especially the rare Khang-he vase, even though she has been expressly forbidden to go near his valuable collection. She arrives at the School sulky and determined to hate everything about it. This lasts about a day and a half, after which she decides to enjoy life to the full in order to render the punishment null and void. She teams up with the Maynard triplets, particularly Len and Con, and it is at their behest that she agrees to have her name shortened to the more friendly 'Ricki'. As a new girl, Ricki is invited to tea at Freudesheim, and Joey Maynard quickly senses that all is not well between Ricki and her father. Being Joey, she determines to get to the bottom of the matter before Ricki goes home to England again.",
