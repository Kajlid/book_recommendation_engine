  "description": "This gift-sized guide has delicious recipes for savory and sweet treats, from sandwiches and tart to cakes, scones, macaroons, shortbreads and preserves. Some are classic, some have a twist, such as cucumber sandwiches with minted cream cheese, toasted farmhouse bread with anchovy butter, the classic Victoria sponge, brandysnaps, cream horns or the classic scone. Plus there’s everything you need to know to brew to the perfect pot of tea (not to mention the odd cocktail and bowl of punch).  Sample menus help you to plan your tea, whether you’re looking for a lively party, the last word in elegance or a hearty winter tea by the fire. Food historian Laura Mason also includes some fascinating and amusing historical recipes that reveal how afternoon tea was taken in times gone by and the origins of some beloved dishes. Includes dual measures.",
