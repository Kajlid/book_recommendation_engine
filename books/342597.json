  "description": "The small south-west Australian town of Tillbrook has a secret, one that has been kept for over a hundred years; the Dervish Carnival, which has been there for a century, is run by people who are neither human nor animal, but live in the woods and howl at night. But when David Hampden, a journalist on the downward slope of his career, visits the town with his younger brother, unemployed photographer Paul, that secret is threatened. When Paul is seduced unknowing into their world, David will get him back, whatever the cost. And the cost may be both their livesâ€¦ and possibly even more.Carnies is a contemporary Australian supernatural thriller by debut novellist Martin Livings, and is described by the author as \"an old fashioned horror novel, harkening back to the days when scary books were fun.\" Containing equal helpings of horror, action and humour, Carnies is a sideshow haunted house of a novel, with dark twists and turns, sudden drops, surprises, shocks and delights.So roll up, come to the carnival. You'll never be the same again... if you survive!",
