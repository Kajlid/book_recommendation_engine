  "description": "US Senator Elizabeth Warren has long been an original thinker and a powerful voice for the common man. Having worked her first job at the age of nine and witnessed first-hand the economic struggles of the American middle class, Warren never hesitates to tell the truth about the US economy. She has been a strong advocate for consumer protection; her work has led to the creation of the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.Discover in her own words the woman who has been called “a New Sheriff of Wall Street” by TIME magazine, and “the plainspoken voice of people getting crushed by so many predatory lenders and under regulated banks” by the Boston Globe .“There is nobody in this country who got rich on their own. Nobody. . . . Part of the underlying social contract is you take a hunk of that and pay forward for the next kid who comes along.”“Hardworking men and women who are busting their tails in full-time jobs shouldn’t be left in poverty.”“If you’re caught with an ounce of cocaine, the chances are good you’re going to jail. . . Evidently, if you launder nearly a billion dollars for drug cartels and violate our international sanctions, your company pays a fine and you go home and sleep in your own bed at night.”",
