  "description": "This NYT Best Illustrated artist makes his Scholastic Press debut with a poignant picture book about loss and renewal. Brian Karas has always been moved and inspired by the haiku poetry of Issa, whose work is taught in schools and loved by children around the world. Here Karas has selected 22 of his favorite poems to tell the story of a year in the life of a family—a year in which they will experience the loss of their beloved grandfather, and also the renewal that comes from healing after loss. With stunning mixed media artwork that represents a major breakout for this acclaimed artist, Today and Today offers an authentic, reassuring look at life's many cycles—and the small miracles that occur each day.",
