  "description": "When it came to Romeo and Juliet, a kiss was never just a kiss.The Brotherhood. There was only one way in and one way out: death. Power.That was the code we lived by. It was like a religion in our world. Men would fight for it. Die for it. Kill for it. Sacrifice.It was a way of life. Family. Freedom. Our very souls. Everything we had came at a price. Love.That was the biggest illusion of all. I f*cked up and fell in love with the enemy. She's too good for me, too good for this world I've been bred to conquer. But I couldn't stay away. When I was near her, the monster beneath the surface begged to be set free. She was untainted. I wanted to desecrate her. She was flawless. I wanted to ruin her. She was light. I wanted to drag her into the darkness. She was forbidden. I took her anyway. I crossed a line and started a war. Both of our families were out for blood. The only question is, who will bleed first?Coming January 20, 2022",
