  "description": "As love blossoms, twenty year old secrets threaten it all... Becca and Hunter have always tried to make sense of a tragedy, but they never fully asked why. Why were they on the same plane? Where were they going or coming from? Recent events force them to find out everything they can about the plane crash and the events that led them there. Becca's always been strong. She's always found a safety net in Hunter, the man who saved her as a child and always stuck by her, giving her reason to go on when no one else gave her a chance. Now she fights to keep her strength going, but her fears begin to get the better of her. The facade she tries to hold up threatens to crack. Hunter is learning to fight his demons and put them to rest, but he can't help but worry about Becca and the future they've just begun to build. She's become the withdrawn person he'd been for the past few years and he doesn't know how to help, unless he finds the answers they both are desperate to know. They've always battled every storm together, but a new storm could sweep in and blow the foundation right out from under them... The second installment of the Masterpiece trilogy is full of twists, turns, and secrets that come unburied... WARNING: This story is not a standalone. This is the second in a trilogy that follow the same characters. A Masterpiece Of Our Love should be read first.",
