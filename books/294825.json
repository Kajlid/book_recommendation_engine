  "title": "Accidental Activist: Justice for the Groveland Four",
  "description": "This book will take you through my incredible four year quest for justice for The Groveland Four and teach you how to pursue your own causes, whatever they may be. It is a primer for positive action, a journey through Florida's past as well as its future. Some of the things you will learn: everything takes more time than you think, nothing ever goes according to plan, help can come from unexpected places, time is on your side, everyone is connected to everyone else, you can reach your tipping point for success and not even realize it, your goals can change along the way, and flexibility is key. Let's get started, shall we?  ***Proceeds from the sale of this book will be used to establish \"The Charles Greenlee Memorial Scholarship\" to benefit a child with an incarcerated parent.",
