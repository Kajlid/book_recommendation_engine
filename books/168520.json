  "description": "Cartoonist Alexis Rhodes is well-known and very popular in his small community. Not only is he a gay activist, but he also teaches art at the local elementary school. A freelance artist, Alexis works from his home, and when he gets bored watching and drawing cartoons he cooks for his friends and visits the bars near the beach. It's on one of those occasions he meets the very attractive Madison Alleman, and has a one night stand. Things get complicated when Madison moves into the building Alexis lives in, but one-night-stand or not, the attraction is still strong. Will the fact that Madison has a six year old son make a difference in Alexis's pursuit?",
