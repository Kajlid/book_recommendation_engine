  "description": "Acclaimed by critics worldwide, With the People from the Bridge is a unique distillation of literary genres, an all-in-one densely layered poem, play, postmodern epic, a small-scale wide-scope apocalyptic tragedy. An immersive experience where voices issue from characters in a state of trance, drift crackling out of a TV set or a cassette player and the contours of reality begin to darkle and shift while trains still pass up overhead, audience members get up to leave, performers creep out through back-exits. This is the day and the place for the imminent return of the dead and the reader sees them approaching as he peeks through the gaps of Lyacos's elliptical storytelling.",
