  "title": "Fightback!: The American Workers' Movement in the 1930s",
  "description": "The 1930s were a turning point for the American working class movement. John Newsinger examines the key year of 1934, which saw mass struggles by Teamsters, dockers and car workers; and 1937 - the year of the sit-down - centred around car workers in Detroit and Flint. Finally, he seeks to understand the defeat of the most powerful working class and its political leadership, leading to red-baiting and the formation of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Including large quantities of original research, this book will appeal to the specialist and general reader alike.",
