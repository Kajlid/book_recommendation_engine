  "description": "She was first introduced at the dawn of 2013 with a collection of vehement poetry that captured the souls of many. Two years later, upon the birth of 2015, Tammy returns with a new collection of poetry. With Each Brush Stroke relays the story of celebrating life while wallowing in the turmoil of toxic relationships. We witness growth in Wilkinsâ€™ motifs as she slowly begins to drift from the pain that had captivated her audience in the very beginning. It is said that every paint-clad canvas has its own story to tell. With each verse paired together in this compilation, this saying rings true.",
