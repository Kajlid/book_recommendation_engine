The survivor, Isabelle, is left to pick up the pieces, not only of her own life, but of the lives of the devastated husband and fragile son that the other woman, April, has left behind.

As these three lives intersect, the book asks, How well do we really know those we love-and how do we forgive the unforgivable?",
