  "description": "A game for young children allows them to create funny, composite faces by copying parts of faces from any of a dozen models. You've probably seen those split-page picture books that invite kids to line up unmatching tops and bottoms to create unheard-of creatures, faces, landscapes, or whatever. Emberley makes a more complicated game of this pastime by asking groups of \"players\" to fold a paper in four, then take turns drawing the first, second, third, or fourth quarter of a face.What each player draws is determined not by his or her own whim but by the number he or she draws: thus the first player might draw number seven, turn to the \"first player's pages\" in the book, copy the designated seventh pate from a total of twelve step-by-step drawings of head tops (rabbit ears, a Viking hat, etc), then pass the paper on to player number two. . . and so on.",
