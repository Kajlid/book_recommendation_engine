  "description": "Boys, cars, listening to the right music and trying to fit in. These are Danielle's main concerns in life ... apart from protecting her sister from her wicked stepfather. Then her school is invaded by demons and Danielle is dragged kicking and screaming into the eternal struggle between bad and not-so-bad. She joins Longinus, the 2500 year old Roman soldier who used to be her history teacher. He tells her she is a Guardian, an immortal offshoot of humanity, charged with guiding the progress of civilisation and fighting the demons who threaten to bring forth another Dark Age of ignorance and superstition. They are joined by Vlad the Impaler, who may or may not be a vampire, Joan of Arc, who may or may not be Longinus' girlfriend, and a demon named Stanley, who may or may not be Satan. The Guardians are the stuff of legend, but this is Danielle's story. She will learn to use her newfound powers, she will learn to fight, and finally she will decide where she stands in this struggle.",
