  "description": "My boss, Mr. Chen... sucks.He’s the biggest grinch that’s ever plagued the earth, and not even his pretty face or his Black card can make up for his crap personality.I can write a book about all the ways I hate him and his alluring dominance that somehow attracts everyone, including me. But instead, I’ll settle for being a pain and continuing to defy him in any way possible while still keeping my job.The only problem is that he likes to ruffle my feathers as much as I do his, so he’s forcing me to attend the annual Christmas party.It was on the tip of my tongue to deny his demands, but instead, I found myself enjoying his order. I also like the way his eyes lock on me, following my every move.They say it’s the season of giving… perhaps I should see what my boss has to offer.",
