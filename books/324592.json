  "description": "Nash Richards was my first everything. First boyfriend, first time, first love. First heartbreak, too.In a former life, I used to religiously attend Lakeside U's hockey games. Then my ex-who-shall-not-be-named—the team's top defensive enforcer—cross-checked my heart into the boards, and I haven't set foot in that arena since.But when fate conspires against me, I’m assigned to complete my senior athletic training internship with Nash's team, and forced to work closely with the only guy I've ever loved. You know, the one who skated out of my life freshman year without looking back.After what happened last time, I know better than to fall for Nash again. Not to mention, there’s a strict no-fraternization policy between trainers and their athletes. Problem is, our chemistry is hotter than ever—and he’s determined to convince me to give him another chance.Before we know it, the boundaries begin to blur until we can’t see them anymore. But with so much on the line, I'm risking a lot more than just my heart this time.*THE ENFORCER is a steamy second chance college sports romance with a HEA and no cliffhanger.",
