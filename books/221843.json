Thirty-three dynamic posters and several classics from our government's archive— accompanied by text from one of our leading pundits and cutting-edge comedians— make this the perfect book for this time in our nation's history, the zeitgeist of post-9/11 America. This is the book that will help Americans make the connections between what we do and how it can help our troops and ourselves.",
