  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author KL Grayson…  Abigail Darwin needs one thing in life: consistency. Okay, make that two things: consistency and order. Tired of being shackled to her obsessive-compulsive mind, Abigail is determined to break free. Which is why she’s shaking things up.  Fresh out of nursing school, she takes a traveling nurse position. A new job in a new city every few months? That’s a sure-fire way to keep her from settling down and falling into old habits. First stop, Cunningham Falls, Montana.  The only problem? She didn’t plan on falling in love with the quaint little town, and she sure as heck didn’t plan on falling for its resident surgeon, Dr. Drake Merritt  Laid back, messy, and spontaneous, Drake is everything she’s not. But he is completely smitten by the new, quirky nurse working on the med-surg floor of the hospital.  Abby puts up a good fight, but Drake is determined to break through her carefully erected walls to find out what makes her tick. And sigh and moan and smile and laugh. Because he really loves her laugh.  But falling in love isn’t part of Abby’s plan. Will Drake have what it takes to convince her that the best things in life come from doing what scares us the most?
