  "description": "Self styled \"serial-entrepreneur\" Max Levine has failed at every business he undertook. When Max comes up with the idea of selling lingerie to men at tupperware style parties, he finds that he doesn't have cash to hire models. Your wife has been best friends with Max's wife since college and the two upper-middle-class, professional women reluctantly agree to help Max out and model lingerie for a group of strange men. However when billionaire Reginald Witherspoon shows up, the playful exhibitionism that spiced up your dull love lives quickly escalates out of control. The deep bonds of marriage are challenged in this graphically erotic novella about infidelity, big money, and sexy underwear.",
