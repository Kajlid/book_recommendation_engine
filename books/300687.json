  "description": "To Clementine Wicke, there is no greater tragedy than tearing down a historic building. So when Prince Edward Ashton asks for her assistance restoring an old country castle, she’s beyond eager to help—even though Edward’s love of modern architecture and disdain for everything old is more than a little annoying. The upside is that this is the job of a lifetime, one that will really boost her family’s architectural salvage business. The downside? Working beside an infuriatingly attractive billionaire prince. Nothing can divert Clementine away from her goal to restore the castle. Not Prince Edward’s total hotness. Or his searing kisses. Or the fact she’s starting to fall for him. Big time. Though Clementine is gorgeous, she’s also the most stubborn, opinionated, frustrating woman Edward has ever had to deal with. Yet when she’s not at the castle working by his side, the place feels decidedly…empty. When their mutual attraction ultimately becomes impossible to ignore, the two succumb to their growing passion—and a new understanding of each other’s perspective. Edward finds himself doing something he’d never expected: learning to appreciate the past and the woman who inspires him. But when an unforeseen problem with the remodeling puts their new relationship to the test, both Clementine and Edward will have to discover just how much they mean to each other, or risk giving up the love they have forever…",
