  "description": "Note: If you have not gotten an updated copy of this book from Amazon, Simon invites you to message him directly and he will ensure you receive a copy. Do I even know who I am?Ross was the jock that I worshipped in high school. The guy that I thought about for years afterward. And when he and Cal first called me up on video chat, I thought I would die when they wanted to do more than just talk about old times...Now, with the order lifted, I'm seeing them regularly. And they've brought out desires in me that I never knew I hadâ€”desires that make me feel safe and vulnerable at the same time. I'm not even out of the closet. No one knows who I am. No one but them. It's my one chance to let myself become what I think I'm supposed to be.I think... I'm supposed to be little.But it can't last, right? Because Ross might have to go far, far away. And he'll take Cal with him. If I want to have my happy ending, I might have to give up everything.And if I do... will I just be an accessory? Or could I discover what it means to have a real Daddy and a Big Brother to take care of me?A little bit Sheltered is the sweet, sexy second book in the unplanned \"Shelter\" series by Simon Strange. It involves low-protocol explorations of age play, bdsm with punishment, denial and chastity, milking, urination, and a plethora of other kinks, all of it consensual and fun. Shelter is now a three book series, so while there is a HEA, there will be a third book as this precious family grows. Best read in order!",
