After his victory, Shivanna is condemned to his care. However, Ben does what he can to make her sentence bearable by introducing her to his world while teaching her the means of independence and self-reliance that she craves.Against her better judgment she falls in love with him and they start planning their own futures away from the kingdom together. However, a tragic event threatens to shake apart their world and Shivanna is thrust into a role that will change her and her paramour's life forever as she is faced with the decision to forsake her lover or let her kingdom burn to ruin.",
