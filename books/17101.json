  "description": "When Pollyweena Grubble's parents go away for a week, Great Aunt Mabel comes to babysit. Polly can't wait for Auntie to meet her best friend, Gertie. But when Auntie discovers Polly and Gertie have chewed filthy bubble-gum they collected from the pavement, she bans them from playing together, ever again. Polly's miserable enough without having to eat Auntie's disgusting cooking. But if she throws it in the bin, she'll be in even more trouble. Well, no way is she eating that slop. When Auntie leaves the room, Polly stuffs the yucky food in-between the clean sheets in the lined cupboard. Nothing gets by mean Aunt Mabel. She discovers the filthy mess and sends Polly to bed with no supper. But the next morning, Polly sneaks off for a joyride on Gertie's new bicycle. As she sits in the basket attached to the handlebars, Gertie whizzes down the hill. Trouble is, Polly spots someone standing on the footpath, she yells at Gertie to stop. But Gertie never listens to anybody and ends up running their headmistress onto the road. Yipes! If Mrs Godbolt recognises them, they'll be in even more strife. 'Cause she's even stricter than Auntie.",
