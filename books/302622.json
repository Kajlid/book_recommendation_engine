  "description": "I’ve heard blood is thicker than water, but those people must not have ever been stabbed in the back by their family.At least water made rivers.All blood did was stain.My brother was a stain on my damn life.No matter how hard I scrubbed, his betrayal was still there.He set me up to take the fall on one of the biggest jobs we ever did together, and I did five years behind bars for fraud and money laundering.I’m out of prison now, and I’m ready to turn the river red.No one messes with me and gets away with it. I’m going to take everything that belongs to me.Including her. His ex-wife that he kept under lock and key like an animal.Last I heard, Gabriella Regio has the bite of a beast, and I can’t wait to set her free.",
