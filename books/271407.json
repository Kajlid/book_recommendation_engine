  "description": "I'm the Gilroy your mother warned you about.  I'm a simple creature. I drink. I f*ck. I fight. If you're looking to do any of those things, I'm down. But I never do the same woman twice so if you're looking for something a little more long term than the time it takes us to both get off then don't blame me when you get hurt because you've been warned. I'm not a return to the scene of the crime kind of guy. I like my life. I like my freedom. At least I did. But that was before she came back into my life and ruined it all. Ruined me. As much as I want to blame her though, I can't. Because the simple life I've built myself, really isn't simple at all. It's a fortress I've constructed to keep her out. To keep her away because Henley O'Connell is dangerous to me in ways I can't even begin to describe. A life without her is easier. Cleaner. That's what I keep telling myself and I'll keep saying it, over and over, until I believe it. Because Henley is the only woman I've ever really wanted. And she's the only woman I can never really have.",
