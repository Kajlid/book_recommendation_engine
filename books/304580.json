  "description": "The easiest way to get over someone is to never see them again, right? So when my ex stomps on my heart and throws it into the sewer…I decide to spend my summer on the opposite side of the country.  And this summer is all about me. Mending my broken heart (screw all men). Figuring out what I want to do with my life (a life that thankfully does not include my ex). And trying to better myself (does eating ice cream count?).  But all my perfect planning comes to a halt when the sexiest lifeguard in existence asks me out. I have to say no. It doesn’t matter that he’s built like a Greek god, has eyes the color of the ocean, or is hotter than a summer night. I’m going to say no, I swear. He’s going straight into the friend zone. Although, I’m pretty sure he’d be more delicious than any flavor of ice cream. Can’t I put him in the friend zone after just one taste?",
