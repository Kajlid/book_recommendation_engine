  "description": "Set near modern-day Cleveland, Ohio, Glimpsing Infinity follows a ragtag team of misfits as they search for a magical staff said to be able to alter space and time. Brixton Weber is just a normal, underachieving guy who wants something more out of life than roleplaying games and lonely nights. He meets a man that offers just that in the form of a quest he can't refuse. Along the way, they team up with Brixton's high school friend Amanda and her new girlfriend, who are also caught up in the excitement about this mythical staff. But they are not the only ones looking for it. The Infinite Hells are abuzz with news of the staff's imminent release, and so an army is amassed in order to retrieve it. Unbeknownst to our heroes, of course. They find that out too late. Chaos ensues as Brixton and crew fight to keep the staff to themselves, and also as they fight amongst themselves. Glimpsing Infinity is a violent romp across the human realm, or Earth, as we call it, that shows you nobody is quite what they seem, and that magic is actually real. And that devils and demons are not nice. You will laugh, you will cry, you will cringe. You will say, \"WTF?\" and, \"Oh, that was cool,\" a few times. But most importantly, you will enjoy the ride that Glimpsing Infinity takes you on, and you will be left guessing up until the last minute what is actually going to happen at the end. And then when it happens, it's one of those times you'll say, \"Oh,",
