  "description": "Jen Connor has withstood violent rape, a near-fatal illness, the loss of a husband, and the smashing of all her dreams. But that was only the beginning. Unappeased, fate has dealt her a new set of challenges. As she rises from the ashes to achieve renown in the theatrical world, she must face what awaits her in Los powerful, vindictive former in-laws who are determined to fight for custody of Jen's young son at all costs. What she doesn't know is that an ancient enemy will surface, firing her desire for retribution. She has an arsenal of formidable friends-a Russian ballet instructor with shadowy contacts, an acid-tongued critic, a new man in her life, and a long-lost sister. Together they stand against Jen's adversaries, but will they be enough?",
