Emperor Maxxiloth has decided he won't be embarrassed a second time and sends every ship available in his empire as part of the new invasion force.When a ship carrying the admiral assigned to replace Captain Jenetta Carver as commander of the GA's most forward base is attacked, and the surviving crew kidnapped, all forces in the sector are immediately put are on alert. A search for the missing crew and their attackers begins in earnest, but with thousands of square light-years of space to cover around Stewart Space Command Base, the task is a daunting one, and some might say impossible. When Jenetta learns of the new plot by the Milori to conquer the Galactic Alliance, locating and rescuing the crew of the Lisbon must receive a lower priority.Months later, a shuttle touches down on a primeval world far inside the Frontier Zone, where Admiral Vroman and the senior officers from the GSC destroyer Lisbon are to be marooned by their Milori captors. As the rest of the crew is being shuttled down to the surface, the officers quickly draw up a plan of survival. Left with only the most basic of supplies and equipment, the spaceship crew must learn how to exist in a hostile, planetary environment.While the forces at Stewart are preparing for an imminent attack by the Milori, the crew of the Lisbon are learning that they have some rather large and particularly nasty neighbors with voracious appetites and predacious habits.",
