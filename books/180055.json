  "title": "Radical Walking Tours of New York City",
  "description": "Traditional walking tours of New York enshrine the wealthy and war heroes by emphasizing what they’ve left behind. Rarely seen are those buried in their wake—those who fought the power, pushing for a better world. In Radical Walking Tours of New York Bruce Kayton leads us to monuments of those other heroes.Through Kayton’s lens, the history of all hitherto existing neighborhoods is the history of class struggles, civil rights battles, and labor movements; these twelve tours provide as many exciting, provocative, and educational afternoons.You can visit, for instance, Emma Goldman’s long-time home in the East Village, Langston Hughes’s house in Harlem, the site of Mabel Dodge’s salon o the apartment in which John Reed worked on Ten Days That Shook the World, and the site of Margaret Sanger’s first birth control clinic.From Battery Park to Harlem, from the Lower East Side to Central Park, Bruce Kayton’s tours provide a new perspective on the history of both New York City and American radicalism.",
