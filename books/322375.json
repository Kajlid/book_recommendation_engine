  "description": "Alexander Hunt holds onto two secrets: both could ruin his life, but one could end it.The sudden move from Calgary, Alberta to the outskirts of Jasper during his senior year leaves Alex isolated in a cabin with bickering parents. He copes by taking daily hikes along the shores of Maligne Lake until he meets a young man named Amulii. He’s huge, unkempt, and speaks broken English, but there’s something else uncanny about him Alex can’t quite place.What starts as a frightening first encounter escalates the moment Amulii gives Alex a strange gift and reveals there’s something much wilder about him than meets the eye. Unbeknownst to Alex, this sets off a series of devastating events that sends both of them fleeing from an aggressive, well-armed militia in the forest.As Amulii and Alex escape into the mountains, their bond strengthens as they learn from one another, and what was once distrust evolves into something much deeper. Despite that, there are only two questions burning Alex’s waking thoughts as they traverse the harsh wilds of western Alberta, waiting for salvation: will he be caught and killed, or will he lose the rest of his humanity to Amulii’s mistake?Content Warning: This book is *NOT* erotica but is intended for those over the age of 17. It contains explicit sex and graphic violence. While those themes are not prominent in the story, they pop up from time to time. This is a gay-centric paranormal romance with real biped werewolves. This is *NOT* A/B/O",
