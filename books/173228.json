  "description": "A post-apocalyptic epic revolving around a bounty-hunting wastelander with a penchant for bad behavior and being a disagreeable cuss. The catastrophe of the old-world has left America a desolate and barren land populated with criminals, drunks, gamblers and feuding corporate-organizations. WIth the seperation of the planes from one another, the white or the ether is left between them, a worm-hole passage for those brave enough to enter and travel through. The planeswalkers are a dark bunch, but their services are often called upon for sensitive tasks. Walter Roche is a bounty hunter and a walker, and his next job may be his last.",
