  "description": "Excerpt from Trif and Trixy: A Story of a Dreadfully Delightful Little Girl and Her Adoring and Tormented Parents, Relations and FriendsRixy was not a babe, for she had passed her seventh birthday and was as wise and irrepressible as the only child of a loving father and mother usually becomes.
