  "description": "Lily thought she had her hands full with her conflicted feelings over her quickly progressing relationship with Arruk’s wild twin, Drrak, the uneasy truce with the tribe leader, and trying to prove she’s trustworthy to a people who want nothing to do with her. But all that pales in comparison to what’s coming.  When Lily and her mates are sent into the forest to investigate the intruders closing in on tribe territory, they find something so horrifying it shocks Lily to her very core. But more than that, it pisses her off.  Driven now by the need to protect a people not her own and to stop the monsters that hunt them, Lily gathers the tribe to her cause, enlisting them to help her. But will they be ready in time or will Lily lose everything in the fight for survival?   Tribe Protector is the epic finale in the Chosen Series.",
