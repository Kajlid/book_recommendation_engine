  "description": "1989: The Irving Titans reached an all time low: 1-15. The glory days of NFC Championships and Super Bowls were a distant memory. That was about to change as the collapse of the S&L’s would force the current owner, Bum Reason, to sell the storied franchise to billionaire oilman, Reuben Weitzman.Weitzman would initiate sweeping changes: eliminate the current collection of players, revitalizing the fan base with the promise of returning to the glory days and fire the most beloved coach of the NFL—Steve Osburn. He would replace him with Marshall Jankowski, an old classmate chum and top coach in the collegiate ranks. The one player he’d like to cut but can’t, is veteran quarterback, Jimmy Stone. His occasional lover, Charlene Rivers has more dirt on Jankowski, Weitzman and other NFL notables, than a dump truck could haul-off. Strap yourselves in for the most raucous, rambunctious, risqué ride in sports history!",
