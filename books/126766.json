  "title": "Adin's Adventure: How to Ruin a Rescue",
  "description": "When his older brother Ocen goes missing, Adin bravely leaves his home world to find him. Young and inexperienced, he still manages to follow his brother’s trail to an exotic bar where all trace of Ocen ends. Worried his brother may be in trouble, Adin starts to ask questions and finds out firsthand what happened to Ocen—kidnapped and confined in a white cell with no hope of escape. Now Adin is the one who needs saving, trapped in a bewildering erotic behavior study. But when he meets Neeri, the stunning female in charge of his testing, interspecies relations takes on a whole new meaning. Maybe rescue is overrated… Warning: “Adin’s Adventure” is a 14,000+ word erotic short story intended for mature audiences only, with explicit sexual content, graphic language, and sizzling alien/alien scenarios that may be shocking to some readers. Enter at your own risk!",
