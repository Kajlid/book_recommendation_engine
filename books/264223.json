To do this, she must train and learn to summon the Adamantine Gates.But Influence isn’t Anora’s only enemy. Valryn from all over the states begin to protest her freedom. Not to mention, Roth DuPont, the current head of the Order, is essentially holding her hostage.Then a prominent Elite is found murdered, and all evidence points to the Eurydice.Shy Savior knows Anora didn’t commit the crime, but proving her innocence becomes difficult when he discovers she’s been conspiring with death-speakers—an act that is considered treason by the Order. As he searches for the real murderer, Shy uncovers threads that lead him to truths that will change his—and Anora’s—world forever. Alliances shift and a different kind of chaos ensues.",
