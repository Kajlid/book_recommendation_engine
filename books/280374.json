  "description": "Does God use circumstances as signposts to guide us, or does He use them as obstacles to be overcome? Does God have a specific will for our lives? Why does God allow us to face more than we can handle? In God's Plan and God's Hornets, we read a love story about a young man who is pursuing both God's will and a young lady's heart. While doing so, he battles circumstances and difficulties that are too big for him to handle. Through his journey, he goes down a path that first tests his faith and then transforms his faith. The journey teaches him the - God sometimes wants to work despite our circumstances to show Himself strong and to grow our faith. - God does have a specific will for our lives. - God allows us to face more than we can handle because He wants us to come to the end of ourselves so we will have to trust Him. - God blesses us when we trust Him and obey His leading. - Some obstacles are only overcome by God supernaturally removing them. This is the LORD'S doing; it is marvellous in our eyes. -Psalm 118:23",
