  "description": "The world taught her that sex has rules. HE teaches her to ask why...Damian Bryant has it all – intelligence, charm, a flare for fun, and a highly successful self-run graphic design business. Katalina Avery – an ambitious, fiercely independent graduate student – knows it’s wrong to date him the second she meets him on a Philadelphia bus.At heart Katalina is a “good” girl, molded by her conservative rural upbringing, and has never considered venturing beyond the safety of her humdrum relationships. But there’s something about Damian’s authoritative ways and strange delight in being called “sir” that tempts her to break what she believes are unbreakable rules. While she’s swept away by the most sinfully passionate relationship she’s ever had, she’s also tortured by the question of how a modern woman could fall for a man as controlling and sexually aggressive as Damian.Bombarded with the opinions of seemingly everyone she knows (and doesn’t know) on what sex and relationships should be, Katalina is tormented by growing guilt about her newfound submissive and – dare she admit – kinky inclinations, until it threatens to destroy everything she and Damian have. It’s then that Katalina must consider whether “right” and “wrong” might be blurry concepts that every couple, including her and Damian, must define for themselves; if she doesn’t, she’ll risk losing the greatest love she’s ever known.PLEASE NOTE: This novel is published in two parts (think of the end of part 1 as an intermission, rather than a cliff hanger), and contains light BDSM.",
