  "description": "Danny Lee Ingram -- PAPERBACK -- Dangling from a rope in an Appalachian cave or trembling from vertigo on a canyon ledge, wrestling a chain-scarred boulder or arguing with a wily Leprechaun, Ingram's short story characters bring to life humor, challenge, regret, and hope. After decades of procrastination, a field worker finally decides to attend his high school reunion. Another character seeks understanding of a journey into the Southern river wilds to evict its backwoods inhabitants. In contrast, some stories deal with the laughter in life, such as a frustrated student who never seems to have the correct time and an inebriated musician tackling an unfamiliar delta dish. These stories are sure to bring chuckles and tears, reflection and foresight, and you'll find yourself reading them, sharing them, again and again.",
