  "description": "Dear Mr. Brisken,How do I hate you?Let me count the ways.>I hate your smug, sexy millionaire face.>I hate your cocky, skirt chasing, playboy ways.>I hate working as your secretary—but, I love the pay. It almost makes dealing with you worth it.>I hate how my friends call you a BILF, when really BILK (Boss I’d like to kill) is more appropriate. >I hate that I need you to be my date for my best friend’s wedding because my ex-boyfriend, the King of Heartbreakers, and his new busty blonde girlfriend will be in attendance.>But mostly, I hate how once the charade is over, I might not hate you at all . . .it was so much easier when you were the Boss I Love To Hate.",
