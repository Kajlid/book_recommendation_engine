  "description": "HE TOUGHT HER ABOUT DESIREThe widow Glorianna Johnson was plain old Anna to the town of Greene, Wyoming, but to Grant Brookington, the golden-eyed temptress couldn't be anything but Glory. Her creamy skin and lush curves could lead a man straight to heaven! Still, glorious though she was, she couldn't possibly run the spread she'd inherited-she didn't know a shotgun from a skillet. It was about time to convince the stubborn beauty that her ranch needed a man's touch...and so did she! He would persuade her by awakening her own hidden desires, and remind her of the pleasures surrender could bring!SHE LEARNED ABOUT LOVEThe last thing Anna needed was help from the likes of her rugged neighbor. Her new found independence was thrilling, and no one was going to rob her of it. So why did Grant's visits make her shiver with anticipation? She tried not to stare at his lean, muscular frame, but somehow she kept wondering how it would feel to be embraced by such overwhelming strength, caressed by such powerful hands. And before she knew it she was yearning to yield her pride to Grant's tender loving and let him scorch her soul with passion's sweet flames!",
