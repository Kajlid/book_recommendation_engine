  "description": "When, in the course of her travels, Valentine went to stay with Reverend Mother's sister, Aunt Irene, in her little house in Chelsea some funny things started happening.Mrs O'Connor, the fence, had her own theory. She agreed with the dipsomaniac Major Mason that those pigeons round the church were probably devils, and went on to explain that they'd been lured out of Hell by the infuriating spectacle of perfect goodness. It was the one thing, she said, that they couldn't stand.Set in London in the 1950s, The 27th Kingdom is a fairy story with echoes of Old Russia and glimpses of tropical islands. Valentine is the princess on a quest for the treasure beyond price, and the people she meets are the witches and warlocks of modern times.",
