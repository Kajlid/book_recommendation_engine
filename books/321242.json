  "description": "Stolen. Missing. Erased. I’m a headline in the town of Maywood Heights and known by a name I’ve never heard. They tell me I was taken, stolen, but none of this makes sense. I’m not who they say I am. I’m not a… twin, but even those close to me seem to believe the rumors swarming around me. Tiny.Dark. Deeds. With my universe suddenly imploding, I find myself at the center of a history with more darkness than could ever be imagined. My entire existence has been a lie, and those I should be able to trust hold just as many secrets as the ones who destroyed my entire world. Dorian Prinze isn’t who he said he was. He’s a liar, and I find myself in a town of the same. Maywood Heights appears to be the city of the damned, and if I’m not careful…It might just claim me as its next victim.Warning: Tiny Dark Deeds is a dark high school romance that contains dubious content and situations some may find triggering.
