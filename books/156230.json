  "title": "Human Anatomy: From the Renaissance to the Digital Age",
  "description": "Lavishly illustrated anatomy books have long been prized by artists, physicians, and other educated readers. Human Anatomy is the first authoritative history of anatomical illustration to include the most recent scientific discoveries and digital imagery. The book includes concise biographies of the great anatomists of history, as well as superb reproductions of anatomical renderings by Leonardo da Vinci, Vesalius, and many others, showing how science and art worked harmoniously to disseminate an evolving understanding of the human mechanism and how it operates. Spanning five centuries, Human Anatomy is an invaluable addition to the libraries of artists, doctors, and general science readers everywhere.",
