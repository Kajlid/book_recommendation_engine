  "description": "A magical, adventurous love story. Deep in the dark woods, seventeen-year-old Leira Sky mourns the death of her mother, with only the trees around her for company. But when those trees begin to change, alerted by the presence of a peculiar boy named Tristan Harper, Leira finds herself propelled into a strange new world-one that's home to bizarre bark-covered creatures, invisible beasts, and a demented king who waits in his dark tower, curling his fingers at the sight of foreign blood. But Leira quickly realizes that it may be too late to undo what she's done. Because now-they know she's there. And when Leira's fate is sealed, and her life begins to unravel, Leira and Tristan must race against time to see if love is enough to change her fate.",
