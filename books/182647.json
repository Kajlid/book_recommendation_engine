  "description": "The eyes of the world are on Finland in November 1939, as its war with Russia turns into a classic David and Goliath struggle. When Tom Henderson, a North American journalist, goes to Finland to cover the war he has no idea how far the assignment will take him. His relationships with Tina, a young Finnish woman, and Paul, her fiancé fighting at the front, escalate quickly and change all their lives. Tina must examine her priorities and emotions, and Tom’s journey takes him from the Berlin Olympics through wartime Helsinki to a place he had long since lost–his own heart. The backdrop for these stories is a tiny nation’s struggle for survival against massive odds.",
