  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Lenna James goes to church, attends youth group, and hangs out with the \"church geeks\" at school. At least, she did. Enticed by a chance with the boy she's had a crush on for years, Lenna abandons her values and her lifelong friends to hang out with the popular crowd. What she gets in return couldn't be further from her expectations. Feeling used and alone and facing an unexpected pregnancy, Lenna struggles to regain control of her life, her parents' trust, and the love of her best friend, Will. But when her pregnancy takes an unexpected turn, taking away what little control she thought she had, she must find the strength to make the most heart-wrenching decision of all. A beautiful story of love, faith, and forgiveness, The Day We Met will make you laugh, make you cry, and touch your heart forever.",
