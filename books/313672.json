But is Jayne willing to betray the lessons in the journal when the words no longer align with what she wants the advice to say? How can she decide if running away and risking it all for new love is worth the price of losing her last connection to her Mom and Dad? And what about the unexpected new caretaker role Jayne now plays for her younger cousin? Can Jayne ever outrun her destiny? And if so, is love the right reason why Jayne should try?Songs from the Other Side is a wrenching story about love and loss written with comedic characters who bring laughter, optimism and insight into this heartbreakingly beautiful tale.",
