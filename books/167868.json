  "description": "Blend in. Ignore my impulses. Look, but never—under any circumstances—See. These are the rules I live by.For ten years, I’ve been able to keep my secrets buried. Or at least I had, until a foul, half-human creature showed up and tried to kill me. Now my entire world has been thrown upside down. They say I’m the Keeper. A sentinel, destined to battle a newly risen sorceress who’s dead-set on claiming dominion over both the supernatural realm and ours. To succeed, I must learn how to fight like a warrior, harness the powers I’ve always run from, and locate an ancient relic that’s been missing for two-thousand years. Yeah, no pressure.In a world filled with seductive immortals, deadly magic, and forbidden desires, there’s no time for second guessing. Not when the fate of everything I’ve ever cared about is at stake.The first of a series, Dark Summoner is a New Adult urban fantasy filled with twists and gripped by a complicated, butterfly-inducing romance. Fans of Shannon Mayer, Ella Summers, Dannika Dark and Rebecca Hamilton will love this series!*FIRST PLACE WINNER, 2015 IDA Awards for Paranormal Romance** Nerdy Girl Book Reviews HOT READS FEATURE, RomCon Magazine August 2015*",
