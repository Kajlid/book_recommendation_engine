  "description": "As bouncer, it’s Paulie's job to protect pole dancers, break up brawls, and pat down the illegal farm workers and drug dealers who patronize Insanidád, a roadside “gentlemen’s club” on the outskirts of Modesto, California. But Paulie won’t rest until he finds out who killed his brother, Lloyd, a young pharmacist gunned down in his prime.  By day, Paulie inhabits a camper where he talks to Lloyd’s ashes, lusts after his ex-girlfriend, and indulges an unbalanced neighbor who believes her father’s spirit is haunting her. By night, Paulie fends off the cagey Colombian drug lawyer about to marry his beloved ex (the bartender) and take over her father’s club. Unearthing the guarded secret between his unhinged neighbor and soon-to-be boss leads Paulie down a calamitous path of jealousy, recklessness, and unexpected redemption.  Sheryl Sorrentino’s fifth novel exposes strip club life through the eyes of a street-smart “everyman” struggling for kinship and closure.",
