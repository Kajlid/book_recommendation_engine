  "description": "Well, this is a damned mess...Dax was so close to leaving the hero business behind him. He'd done his duty, saved the galaxy a time or two, and made out like a bandit with the movie and merchandise rights.Now, Alliance HQ is forcing him to be the poster boy for their \"ten years of peace\" hoopla. If that's not enough, a disgraced alien general-turned-war-criminal with an unpronounceable name has escaped from an inescapable prison planet, and he's got Dax in his crosshairs!Scrambling to avoid the madman's swath of destruction, Dax finds himself stuck with a crew comprised of an overly enthusiastic fanboy cadet, an aging physician, a suspicious and tough-as-nails lieutenant, and a possibly malfunctioning AI. And they are all looking at Dax to save the day... whether he likes it or not.",
