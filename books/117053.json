  "description": "Stephanie knew that Eric liked her. He was a nice guy, fairly good looking and funny. Stephanie liked him too - just not in that way. Besides, she already liked Anne Delaney. But isn't it crazy to have such strong feelings for a girl? Still, Anne is all Stephanie can think about. S.P Likes A.D. is an honest and straightforward account of a young woman coming to terms with her sexuality and exploring possibilities within herself.",
