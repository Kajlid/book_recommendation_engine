  "description": "The era of the tycoon has reached its climax in China. The lives of a snack food heiress, a hair extension magnate, and the nation’s most cherished goose collide in this satirical debut novel.*Corporations rise quickly in today’s China, and none are more successful than the Bashful Goose Snack Company. Founded by the self-made Papa Hui, the company is a national treasure, as is his beloved pet goose. Meanwhile, Papa Hui’s daughter, Kelly, is desperate to prove herself to her father, and take her rightful place as the heir to his empire. But Lulu, the woman with the most lustrous hair in China, and Wang Xilai, the disturbed celebrity hair-stylist farming Lulu for extensions, stand in Kelly’s way—not to mention that infernal goose!From a middle school mogul to a talking turtle, a grotesque “fat camp” for children to a mythical settlement of ex-millionaires, Carly J. Hallman’s vision of a fragmented Chinese society is brimming with bawdy humor and sharp wit. In the absurdist tradition of the great contemporary Chinese author Mo Yan comes a searing, yet whimsical portrayal of wealth and ambition in an ogliarchical, tabloid-driven society, not so unlike our very own.",
