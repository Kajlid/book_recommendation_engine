  "description": "Hedda GablerA Doll's HouseThe Wild DuckThe influence of Henrik Ibsen, often called \"the father of modern drama,\" on the world theatre can hardly be overestimated; in introducing a serious intent, where previously the major purpose had been entertainment, he established the spring-board for a whole new concept of dramatic art.Ibsen \"problem plays,\" with their theme of the individual in conflict with contemporary society, first showed the potentialities of the stage as an agency for social protest; and it was Ibsen's daring use of idiomatic prose which paved the way for the dramatic realism of today.Yet his plays are as vital and moving today as when they were first enactedâ€”their characters as real, as dramatically verifiable, as ever. THE WILD DUCK, HEDDA GALBER, and A DOLL'S HOUSE are three of the best.",
