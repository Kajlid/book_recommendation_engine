  "description": "Robert James, a recently deceased family man, decides to take an adventurous flight to Heaven, by way of the South Pacific. Unaware he is in the hands of a greater force, he unexpectedly comes across a magical world called Heaven's Wait and the isolated valley of Vowella. R.J. encounters a community of quirky cartoon-like beings, the Vowellans, as well as some unexpected faces from his past. He becomes infatuated with the Vowellans, a crazy mix of five unique clans: the jolly Ham Bats; the greedy Net Kens; the quiet Fig Wigs; the intelligent Fog Bobs; and the rowdy Rug Bums. R.J. learns that the Vowellans seek help in finding their purpose in Heaven's Wait. As R.J. ventures beyond Vowella Valley in search of answers, he discovers new truths about Heaven's Wait that may well affect the Vowellans' destiny as well as his own.R.J's Story was originally the preface to the Tales from Vowella series. But over time, it became clear that there was much more to R.J.'s story than had previously been written. Now it stands as the first book of the series, with much more to follow.",
