  "description": "“As long as you’re here, by my side, we can get through anything.”  Conner is an alpha with a secret. He’s not running from his past though, he’s looking forward to his future with Pippen. From first sight, Conner was attracted to Pippen’s rough yet lithe exterior. As likely to stab you as anything, Pippen’s trust is not easily given and Conner will do everything he can to gain it. Because despite his past, he knows Pippen belongs in his future.  “I don’t want to be that person anymore.”  Pippen’s childhood taught him how to be hard, how to hurt before you got hurt. Except, Conner makes him feel like there could be a different life for him, one where he is protected and maybe even loved. But the past never stays in the past and Pippen’s has returned with one thing on his mind, dragging Pippen back to the life of violence he thought he left.  Now that Conner finally has Pippen in his arms and in his bed, he can’t imagine a life without him. No matter what, he’ll put it all on the line while protecting Pippen.",
