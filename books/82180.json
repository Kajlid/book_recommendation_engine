  "description": "On a foggy morning in January, the pale body of a young woman is discovered adrift in an errant swan boat on Lake Eola in the middle of a jewel-like park in Downtown Orlando. The cause of her death is a single, deep slash on her right wrist, and the knife - with her clear left handprint - is found beside her. There is no sign of anyone else having been at the scene and her car is parked by the lake. After a fruitless inquiry, the police conclude that successful and beautiful Dianna Wieland, 28, took her own life. Body language expert, Julie O'Hara - who was out running in Eola Park that morning - isn't buying it. She volunteers to help Joe Garrett, a private investigator hired by the family. And that makes Dianna's killer very nervous, indeed...Since Julie O'Hara is the one person most likely to figure it out.",
