  "description": "Waking up in Vegas was always a gamble... but the last thing I expected was to find myself in bed with Hollywood’s latest bad boy.Or that Jenner would be my husband, as in happily ever after — till death do us part.He also happened to be my newest client.Behind closed doors we couldn’t stand each other, but for the world we were forced to play the part of happy newlyweds.The longer we pretended, the more real it felt. The tension, the desire... the slow fade from hate to love.It wasn’t just his reputation on the line, it was my career as a publicist.He had an affinity for bad publicity; I was hired to fix that, but what happened if I fell in love with my fake husband?",
