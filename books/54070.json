  "description": "Andy-Roo is the proud recipient of the 2013 Kart Kids Book List Award for Creative Storytelling. Andy-Roo is a young puppy who grew long legs and feet quite different from the other kids at the playground. This book tells his story, especially how he overcame his differences ad became a popular player in little league games. Andy-Roo's experiences are captured in short picture stories that will appeal to the young reader in the 3-7 year age bracket. A moral is imbedded in every tale that will not be lost on the young reader but will be remembered in context with Andy-Roo, the character. Most of all, his tales always make children smile!",
