  "description": "The sexually-charged interstellar adventure begun in the best-selling The Dracons' Woman ramps up the action in Book Two of the Soul-Linked Saga, Lariah Daniels, newly-bonded Princess and pregnant soul-mate to the three Royal Princes of Jasan, has invited her best friend from Earth, library security guard and martial arts practitioner Saige Taylor, to visit her on that distant planet. What was planned as some pleasant girl-bonding time catapults Saige into a series of perilous adventures involving kidnappings, conspiracy, spaceship hijacking, galactic intrigue, a plot by the evil aliens known as the Xanti to destroy the peoples of the Thousand Worlds, and—not to mention—finding out that she may be fated to be joined spiritually and physically with the Lobo brothers, three incredibly gorgeous, nearly identical triplets who shape shift into enormous black and white striped wolves. Saige must call upon her wits, her skills as a fighter, and all the resources of her spirit and heart to meet these challenges and, perhaps, to fulfill her destiny as the Lobos’ HeartSong.The Lobos’ HeartSong is a full-length 115,000 word novel, a fitting follow-up to The Dracons’ Woman, and is chock-full of the drama, excitement, and erotic energy that fans of Laura Jo Phillips have come to expect.",
