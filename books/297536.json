He’s rough, gruff and quite possibly, dangerous.So why can’t she keep her mind off him? Or her body from reacting around him? Or her Little side from wanting to appear and beg him to cuddle her, kiss her, spank her. . .Duke barely notices his neighbor. Until she becomes a convenient target for his bad mood. Afterwards he feels awful. In fact he starts to notice her in a completely different light.He might be a biker with an attitude, but all he’s ever wanted is someone to love and protect. Someone to dominate and cherish. And it seems to him that Sunny just might give him everything he needs.",
