  "description": "Originally published as Crosswalk, The Sun Thief is a thriller, a story whose dramatic arc runs razor-close to current events. A murdered woman's daughter, Christina, falls down a truly black and greasy rabbit hole in the wake of her mother's death that leads through bio-engineering, weather manipulation, Naval Research and Weapons, Atmospheric research connected to DARPA and through London, Virginia and Hawaii. The birthplace of her mother's murder, when she finds it, lies within the circle of Operation Paperclip scientists still working in London in the 80s and 90s. Christina and those she joins with along the way struggle on to find answers despite being chased by Blackhawks, run off roads, betrayed by allies...her comrades include a Canadian civil rights activist who styles himself 'Amistad, ' an old Brazilian psychic emigrated to Australia, and a chemist-turned-activist also on the trail of these psychotics; half a dozen ancient men who form a sinister cabal. The Gatekeepers are scientists, liaisons with the Joint Chiefs, a global industrialist of unmatched power and wealth, a US Secretary of Agriculture. While Christina is on her own mission to flush out those who murdered her mother, Tim Verzet, firebomber and ex-military pilot infiltrates the very nerve-center of the global poisoning operation trying to make it implode from the inside. One very well-placed traitor just about brings the whole effort down but in the end, the Achilles heel of the entire campaign, a campaign which has actually been in place for decades, is a very small group, led by one pilot on the inside.",
