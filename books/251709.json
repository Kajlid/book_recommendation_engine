  "description": "Glitch escaped from Eyes in the Sky with blood on her shoes and a broken watch. It should have ended there, but mere hours later the faceless corporation that hired her is suddenly, inexplicably out for her blood. Driven deep into the underbelly of Neosaka, Glitch is caught up in a fight between the city's gangs and a Runner relentlessly searching for answers. Haunted by the deaths of her crew and dogged by her past, Glitch will have to push her already-exhausted body and mind past their limits to survive and pay off her debts to the dead.  Overclocked is the second book in The Glitch Logs series. Overclocked is a novella-length book. It is approximately 136 pages in print.",
