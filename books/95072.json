  "description": "Amber Hewerdine has been suffering from chronic insomnia ever since her best friend's tragic death. As a last resort, she visits a hypnotherapist, doubtful that anything will really change. Under hypnosis, Amber hears herself saying, \"Kind, cruel, kind of cruel.\" The words awaken a vague memory, but she dismisses the whole episode as nonsense. Two hours later, however, Amber is arrested for the brutal murder of a woman she’s never heard of, and the only way she can clear her name is by remembering exactly where she’s seen those words before.Married detectives Charlotte \"Charlie\" Zailer and Simon Waterhouse are once again on the case, as the investigation unexpectedly reveals a shocking insight into Simon's psyche, in another gripping page-turner by Sophie Hannah.",
