  "title": "History Of The Conquest Of Peru",
  "description": "\"\"The History of the Conquest of Peru\"\" is a comprehensive account of the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire in the 16th century. Written by William H. Prescott, the book details the events leading up to the conquest, including the arrival of Spanish explorers and their interactions with the Incas. Prescott also explores the political and social structures of the Inca Empire, as well as the military tactics employed by both sides during the conflict. The book covers the major battles and key figures involved in the conquest, including Francisco Pizarro and Atahualpa, the last Inca emperor. Prescott's work is highly regarded for its detailed research and engaging writing style, making it a classic in the field of historical literature.But little is told of Francisco's early years, and that little not always deserving of credit. According to some, he was deserted by both his parents, and left as a foundling at the door of one of the principal churches of the city. It is even said that he would have perished, had he not been nursed by a sow.3 This is a more discreditable fountain of supply.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
