  "description": "Dr. Fell would rather do just about anything than go to the mall, but somehow that's exactly where he ends up, doing Ben's shopping. He doesn't expect to run into anyone he knows, but when a certain Santa's Elf reminds him of their past acquaintance, Dr. Fell finds his carefully ordered world rocked on its axis. Interested as he is, family problems make it difficult for Dr. Fell to explore his attraction. Things come to a head when Dr. Fell realizes the solution to both his family issues and his new relationship lie in his past - and in the one person he's been avoiding for years. Is redemption just a plane ride away? Will Dr. Fell muster the courage to face his demons? Will the time away allow Dr. Fell to claim his Forever Boy before it's too late?",
