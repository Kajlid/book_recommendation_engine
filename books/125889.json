  "description": "You’ve never, ever read a story like this. Ashley Young is stuck in an unsatisfying marriage and a dead-end job. But when a sexually transmitted plague breaks out in her small town—one that slowly transforms everyone infected into crazed zombielike sex fiends—everything about her life changes. Facing quarantine, National Guard barricades, the onset of winter, and a rapidly spreading, mysterious sex plague, Ashley and everyone else in her small Colorado town find their deepest feelings for one another surfacing…both amorously and violently. When everyone in Ashley’s life begins taking comfort in one another’s arms, no one really knows who’s infected and who’s not. And because the disease perpetuates itself as an aphrodisiac, sex—the very thing that offers comfort—only contributes to spreading the plague. In a crumbling world with little to lose, Ashley begins to discover a resilience she didn’t know she possessed and a strength she’s never had before. Her newly acquired agency may come at a price, however, when Ashley must ultimately choose between her own survival and saving the people she loves. DEAD IN BED by Bailey Simms delivers a tour-de-force series that’s as emotionally incisive as it is shockingly sexy, as heartbreaking as it is hilarious, and as frightful as it is impossible to put down.",
