  "description": "Mikki Daneen, a successful interior designer, is living the life she’s always dreamed, but she hides an extraordinary gift; the ability to psychically perceive her clients’ most intimate desires. After an old boyfriend from the FBI asks her to use her psychic abilities to glean details on a suspected kidnapper, Seth Harkinson, she learns more than she bargained for. She uncovers the secret of a hidden culture and discovers that she may be the subject of a chilling, age-old prophecy. She runs for her life from a demon-possessed beast, hell-bent on hunting her down and killing innocent children who possess magical gifts. While she struggles with the forces that seek to destroy her, she discovers a connection with Seth that runs deeper than she ever imagined.",
