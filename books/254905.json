  "title": "Shameless: A Case for Not Feeling Bad About Feeling Good",
  "description": "\"Nothing gives church folk anxiety quite like the subject of sex. And that's why in Shameless, Pastor Nadia sets out to reclaim the conversation for a new generation. In the spirit of Martin Luther, Bolz-Weber calls for a reformation of the way believers understand and express their sexuality. To make her case, Bolz-Weber draws on experiences from her own life as well as her parishoners', then puts them side by side with biblical narrative and theology to explore what the church has taught and about sex, and the harm that has often come as a result. Along the way, Bolz-Weber reexamines patriarchy, gender, and sexual orientation with candor but also with hope--because, as she writes, \"I believe that the Gospel can heal the pain that even the church has caused.\" As with her previous books, Bolz-Weber offers an honest, affirming and intellectually robust experience on the pages that speak to skeptic and believer alike\"--",
