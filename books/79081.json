  "title": "The Pebble",
  "description": "In the dawn of a Winter Solstice, two sets of lovers caressed. One caressed lips and skin in a hidden forest, the other, a sun caressing stone carvings inside the burial chamber of Newgrange. And both lined eternity with their actions. One day an orphan found her family, and soon discovered wings, Hybrid blood and a hidden chest of inner talents. Talents so dark, they could stop a breath. In the world of creations, a half-angel, half-human Hybrid played the air with her fingers like a classical pianist. Entangled between her fingers, on laced strips of leather, hung red Pebbles that could unlock whole worlds.  Alex tumbled into a snow lapped graveyard. Wounded, bloodied and now lost in her identity. She could but make one choice, one decision. However, how far would she go to find herself, and what would it cost? The cost would be more than she ever dreamed!",
