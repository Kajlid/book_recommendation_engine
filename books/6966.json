  "title": "Sex, Drugs, and Being an Escort",
  "description": "My name is Ashly and for the past several years I have worked as a female escort. I started out by advertising in the now extinct Craig's List \"erotic services\" section. Having lived with my grandparents for most of my childhood, moving to Portland from the Oregon Coast gave me a chance to spend some time with my mother.Like her, I'm a drug addict with a decided preference for crystal meth or \"uppers\" in general. In an odd and unexpected way, it was our addictions that brought us \"together.\" It always seemed to be a man that ended up forcing us apart again.Many new experiences were waiting for me in Portland, some of which I would never have imagined. Moving to Portland is where it all started.This book is a scattered personal journal chronicling the last several years of my very unconventional life.",
