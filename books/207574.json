  "description": "I'm young to have so many enemies. The Skinners, Dark Walkers, Wood Mist, they all want me for their own reasons. But those were enemies I could fight. Now the disease that changed me forever is back.  It’s reaping death and havoc everywhere it strikes and I’m nearly helpless to stop it except for one chance. There’s a rumor of a cure. But Dax, my ally here in the Wilds, has vengeance on his mind. As I prepare to fight the Bloody Death by any means I can, I might have to leave behind the only man who has ever stood beside me.",
