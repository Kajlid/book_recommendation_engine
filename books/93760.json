  "description": "When Felicia dies, she doesn’t expect to wake up alive, and minus the multiple stab wounds she received before her death. With her other memories gone, she’ll have to rely on her rescuer, Pax, while she figures out what happened that fateful night. But why does he seem to know more than he’s letting on, and who is the mysterious Ariel?It’s mere weeks until the angels’ plan of spreading healing and prophecy begins, and Pax is ready to lead them to victory. That is, until he rescues Felicia. He’s already at fault for her death, and now he’s responsible for her life. It’s simple—make sure she’s okay, and then she leaves. And yet, her very presence brings questions with no easy answers, and challenges his presumed life.",
