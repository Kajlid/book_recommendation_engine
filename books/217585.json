  "description": "Rusty Jackson spent years crafting the perfect life with his high school sweetheart, Jenny; his own construction company, and a house he built with his bare hands. When an oddly intriguing police officer named Jason Lane shows up bearing tragic news, Rusty’s world is turned upside down. Months later when he encounters Jason again, both men find themselves in a surprisingly different spot. While Rusty doesn’t fully understand his attraction, and Jason fears falling for a confused straight guy, they play an electrifying game of push and pull, hoping to find their way to happily ever after. When they run into a family foe in Las Vegas, Rusty’s confidence is tested. Can Rusty wrestle down his insecurities for Jason or are some habits too powerful to break? Tender, wise, and provocative, Follow Your Heart shows what happens when friends band together in the face of profound tragedy, and the excruciating pains we must take to follow our destiny …and leave our worn-out dreams behind.",
