  "description": "James Andrews finally appears to be catching a break. After six summers of searching for Genghis Khan's tomb, he unearths a bone during a dig on Burkhan Khaldun, Mongolia's holy mountain. After tests suggest the bone belongs to Genghis Khan, Andrews and his colleague Abbey Conrad follow the strands of the bone's DNA back through time and begin to unlock the secrets of thirteenth century Eurasia. Meanwhile, as the world's superpowers vie for control of Mongolia's vast resources and open lands, the country is struggling for its independence. When Andrews's quest takes center stage, past and present collide, revealing ancient truths along with a web of deception that tears Andrews's life apart and pushes the world to the brink of war. Part historic fiction, part archaeological mystery, and part political thriller, The Baljuna Covenant tells stories of a poor boy's rise to the heights of world power, of two friends and unimagined betrayal, and of a secret kept for over half a millennia. It tells stories of romance, loyalty, and perseverance. Most of all, however, it tells the story of a promise between Genghis Khan and his people, a promise kept until this day.",
