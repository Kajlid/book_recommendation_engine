  "description": "“I told you not to do that,” he said, a lustful look of intensity in his eyes...Winthrow Financial. The fastest growing firm on Wall Street, and I had been lucky enough to land a job there right out of college.Despite being the youngest woman on the floor, I quickly made waves in the company. Even the CEO, Carter Winthrow, took notice of my mathematical skills. When he came to meet me personally, he also took notice of my body as well.Within days, I was promoted to Carter's personal assistant, second guessing his stock moves and checking his managers' work. While the job itself was fantastic, the best part was getting to work with Carter himself. The suave and sexy billionaire playboy managed to exude charm and confidence every time we spoke. And as I proved myself great at the job again and again, he became more and more comfortable with me.As I saw him giving to charities and holding his niece, I realized he was the ultimate alpha male. Those strong, chiseled abs and huge arms was all that the “Sexiest Bachelor” lists saw, but I saw the real man. A family man, just waiting for someone to give him that family.I knew that what I wanted, more than this job, more than a career, more than life itself, was Carter's to give. I would do anything to get Carter to give it to me. And I had a feeling that he felt the same way. He wanted to give me something that would keep us together for the rest of our lives.A baby.",
