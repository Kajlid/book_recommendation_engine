  "description": "Nancy Mitford was one of our most gifted writers and her novels continue to entertain and enthral generation after generation. Yet her journalism, while not being so well known, is full of fizzing humour and sharp-eyed observation. A Talent to Annoy spans Nancy Mitford’s career and includes her most famous essay, ‘The English aristocracy’, in which she introduces the ‘U’ and ‘Non-U’ theory of English usage, as well as loving descriptions of France, her dismissal of St Peter’s, Rome and an account of a visit to Ireland that prompted one reader to comment: ‘Hell would be a more suitable place for you than Ireland.’",
