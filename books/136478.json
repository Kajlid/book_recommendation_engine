  "description": "\"thanks for the Reiki attunement included with this book\" \"full of inspirational tools. I refer to it daily\" \"Thank you for writing Soul Process. Because of it my beliefs around healing expanded to new levels of understanding\" M.D. Liske \"Some 30 years ago when I first started on this journey I'd have given anything for a central point of reference that would point me to easily accessible tools of enlightenment. While the search I embarked on proved invaluable to me for many reasons; the time has now come for Man to take a quantum step forward in development. It is my hope that by sharing what I have learned, I may be able to ease your load and shed some light on the truth of who you are. However the journey is one that each soul must undertake and complete alone.\" Paul E. McAtarsney",
