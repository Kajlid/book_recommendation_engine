  "title": "A Cry in the Night",
  "description": "Georgian England, at the start of the Industrial Revolution, just four years after the Battle of Waterloo. Two children, from poor families and in dire circumstances, each have good reason to run away and seek better life. Brought together by chance; staying together from loyalty and the need for human companionship. Developing into loving young adults with strong sense of justice and humanity, the two are appalled by the plight of the common workers. It is August 1819, and they journey to Manchester to attend a meeting. There, at St Peter's Field, the radical orator, Henry Hunt, is to address the crowd. A rude shock awaits them and not all return safely to their homes - there is blood on the field. A compelling love story set in the atmosphere of oppression, class division, hatred and violence that accompanied the Industrial Revolution in general, and the 'Peterloo Massacre' in particular.",
