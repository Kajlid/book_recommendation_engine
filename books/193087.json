  "description": "You lack any manners and exhibit even less discipline. I know your type â€“ the so-called genius, always let off the hook because the regulations don't apply to you. There will be no more of that. In this classroom, I set the rules and if you don't comply there will be consequences, little miss.\nScarlett.She is my wet dream, my nightmare... my only weakness.Glitter nail polish, crimson lipstick, mini skirts.Those red curls, arrogant green eyes and luscious curves wake up the beast in me.Her sarcasm and disregard for authority make me want to bend her to my will and teach her a lesson.She called me a pathetic old man with too much power.Would she give me that attitude if she had any idea of what I wanted to do to her?I long to consume her, to break her bratty defiance and punish her.Revel in her beautiful suffering.I want to see the crimson stripes along that pale skin to match her hair and lipstick.She'll surrender, lost between pleasure and pain, on her knees and at my feet.Where she belongs.Scarlet is my sin and my last temptation...... and perhaps my destruction.",
