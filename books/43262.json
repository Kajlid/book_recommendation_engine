Thrilling conclusion.\"---Kirkus ReviewsWINNER of the 2021 Independent Press Award for science fiction.A deadly mix of plague and environmental disaster forces a small group to seek refuge in an underwater facility. Located off the coast of California, Pacifica was originally conceived to study alt energy systems as part of America’s continued effort to go green. Who knew that its greatest service would be as sanctuary for the human race. Jesse Baines is one of the fortunate few to make it down to Pacifica—although Jesse doesn’t feel all that lucky. Unlike most, Jesse finds Pacifica confining and bleak. And after his parents are lost to the hazards of the sea, he wants out more than ever. But leaving Pacifica is easier said than done. When a recon team back to land is authorized Jesse finally gets his chance. And what they find is startling and strange, the environment so vastly altered as to be another planet entirely. Every step upon the cauterized soil brings new adventure, the obvious threats of cannibalism, disease, and searing radiation turn out to be only the beginning. Why do the majority of survivors have dark skin? What caused the deadly pandemic and global decline? Come face to face with a creature of impossible origins. Discover the secrets of a strange new world. And most of all, find out if you have the Darwinian vigor to survive.*Revised and upgraded in 2021, Unnatural Selection is a sprawling adventure with an embedded message, timely as it is important… “The strength of a species lies in its diversity.”",
