  "description": "By the general law of their species, once a royal fae hit one hundred, the fae was to spend a year touring the four kingdoms. However, for Prince Radisq, it would be his first journey away from all he was familiar with. The celebration held in honor of his hundredth birthday marked not only his sojourn into the other kingdoms but also marked his first foray into finding his mate, with the mating call only occurring once every hundred years, and only lasting a few months.For Aaeren, the firstborn son of the fire kingdom, he had never known love of the soul mate kind. In fact, he didn’t believe in it, nor want it. After all, what need had he of someone constantly underfoot when he could enjoy the camaraderie of other sports. He had no desire to partake in the water prince’s celebration, but during their first meeting, sparks fly and resistance is futile.",
