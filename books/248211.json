  "title": "Death on the Drive",
  "description": "When the body of Steven Powers, author of a modest (by Florida standards) Ponzi scheme, turns up on “The Drive” in the gay village of Warren Beach, the police face a dilemma. Did the old fraudster simply drop dead crossing the street after some late-night kink with a hustler in a back alley? Or did an enraged \"investor\" place the corpse on dramatically public display?  Detective Frank Salino reluctantly accepts the task of determining the cause of death. Aided by his Lesbian partner, Detective Carmen Rodriguez, and young CSI John Lytle, Salino puzzles fruitlessly over the conflicting scenarios leading to Powers' last end—until Frank's former boyfriend, Bureau Agent Mark Barrington, finally provides some crucial evidence.",
