  "description": "Just as the aliens promised, a ship has landed and taken away those who took up their invitation to a new, better life. But when the pioneers wake aboard the vessel there is no welcoming committee to be seen. All the watches have stopped, except for one old-fashioned pocket watch which reveals two and a quarter hours have passed unawares. And then a scream rends the a pacemaker has stopped and there's nothing anyone can do to restart the ailing heart. When the US Special Forces squad radio also malfunctions, it's clear that something on board the alien ship is decommissioning everything electronic, no matter how mundane.",
