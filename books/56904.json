  "description": "Cough-syrup junkie and emotionally insecure intellectual snob, Arti, believes that rock bands help her get centered better than shrinks. In Bombay now, on her domineering mother's orders to get a job or else marry a loser hand-picked from the matrimonial columns, Arti's one objective (apart from bombing her Super-Bitch Boss's office) is to keep alive her unrelenting search for the man with whom she can live happily ever after. But Arti has the unique talent of always falling for the wrong men. And as she stumbles from one disastrous relationship to the next, she realizes that men only want you when you don't want them any more.",
