  "title": "Blockade: The Quarantine of Cuba",
  "description": "This intriguing story follows the adventures of the United States Navy sailors who enforced the quarantine of Cuba and neutralized the Soviet Union’s submarine threat as the 1962 missile crisis developed. Chief Gunner’s Mate Mike Stafford, recalled to active duty after a career that took him from World War II and Korea to the Bay of Pigs invasion is now aboard the U.S.S. Boyington (DD 953) and headed into what could be WW III. He teams with Bosun Paul Jones, the ship’s senior petty officer, to battle the Soviets, a saboteur, a Russian freighter that tries to run the blockade, and the seedy denizens in the back alleys of old San Juan as they search for a missing crewman. The period involved, while short, is nonetheless of historical importance. During these few weeks of October and November 1962, the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialists Republics, the two most powerful nations on earth, prepared for what might have been a nuclear holocaust. Weapons were unsheathed and aimed as President John F. Kennedy and Premier Nikita Khrushchev faced off in the most dangerous political-military confrontation the world had ever known. Kennedy had backed down at the Bay of Pigs and Khrushchev bet he would do so again. The stakes were unimaginable",
