  "description": "Have you ever sensed someone was watching you? But nothing there? Do you wonder about what happens to you or a loved one after death?I want to assure you that your loved ones know what you are doing in your daily lives after they are gone. Through all my experiences I have had since I was a child until today, I truly believe the spirit never dies. I have documented many encounters with spirits from sensing them, seeing them, hearing music, voices and experiencing dreams from 2012-2018. This book also shares with you a true account of my memories in a past-life regression hypnosis technique and how it directly affects my life today. You will learn steps on how to meditate properly and what I see during my meditation. Being an empath and medium has been an enlightening experience. I have spent years researching and learning many things to help me embrace and expand my gift. The biggest blessing is seeing how communicating with spirits can heal oneâ€™s heart and soul knowing their loved one can see them after they have passed away. My abilities are a gift from God.",
