And can never have.Ophelia Bradley's favorite client is the gruff, sexy carpenter she speaks with on the phone every day. Talking to Logan is easy--they're basically best friends. But that's all they can ever be.The chemistry between them is easy to resist...so long as they stay on the phone.--Author's Note--Touching Wood is a standalone steamy short read connected to the Jewel Lakes Series with strong Pam & Jim vibes (if TV could be this sexy). This book is a complete standalone, but for sticklers to reading order, this story could be considered a prequel to the series.",
