The other long buried secret has surfaced with it in the name of Lord Jetten, the lost lord who went into exile and left his people to the wolves so to speak.The factions are joined more than they have ever been in the history of the supernaturals and it won’t be long before the humans are involved. Stace has the power to end it all...or so she’s told. If she can keep them together and even gained the trust of the Elves who side with the enemy, hope is there. It may be buried deep, but every group has its weak spot.",
