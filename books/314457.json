  "description": "Since my wife died four years ago, my daughter, my professorship, and the students in my literacy program have kept me focused. There is no room for distractions. But a stop-off at the new bakery brings me face to face with the owner, Vivienne Cross. Now I can’t get her sexy little smile out of my head. Her desserts are in my house and I see her “cupcakes” all over town. It’s been a long time, but I feel alive again. My world is not as dark as it once was. I even fantasize about frosting. But she lied to me. Even if I can forgive her, I don’t know if it would work out? She’s an heiress and I’m an old-school kind of guy. I like to take care of the women I love. Do I even fit into her world?What can I offer her that she doesn’t already have? Will she be happy with me or want the bigger life within her grasp?",
