  "title": "Taken for Granted: How Conservatism Can Win Back the Americans That Liberalism Failed",
  "description": "A deeply personal book from Fox News political analyst Gianno Caldwell about how the status quo of American politics, culture, and self-identity has failed those who need it most.Gianno Caldwell, raised by his grandmother on the south side of Chicago, saw firsthand how lawmakers have failed African American voters on issues like poverty, welfare, and education. As someone who beat the odds of growing up in poverty under a fear-based mentality that limits what people can achieve, Caldwell believes there's another way.Throughout the book, Caldwell weaves his personal journey into a cultural exploration about how the status quo came to be in America and casts a hopeful vision for a nation that is no longer beholden to identity politics. Trapped within the expectations and traditions of our community, family, political party, faith, race, and gender, we fail to challenge our politicians and ourselves to create real change. Now more than ever, we need to challenge preconceived notions about the two parties, public policy, and American history.From the obstacles facing urban communities today on issues such as crime, education, and social mobility, Caldwell digs beneath the statistics, showing the moments that defined his rise to success and the steps that can help more people overcome the odds--whether through policy reform or the heroic efforts of men and women who are already working to make a difference in their communities.",
