  "title": "Are You Sure You Want to Love God?",
  "description": "When we think about our love relationship with God, we tend to focus on HIS love for us: God created us in His image. God sent His only begotten son to die for our sins. God will send His son once again to take us home. But what about OUR love for God? WHAT exactly does it mean to love God? WHY is it so important? And HOW do we love Him? Tony Yang answers these questions through a Bible-centered approach, weaving in his personal testimony with his unique storytelling style. His conclusion is one that he least expected-the \"O\" word. In his highly anticipated debut book, Tony Yang presents key questions and answers them with such simplicity, using easy-to-follow practical applications. With a solid Biblical foundation, it also educates, encourages and inspires, leaving the reader to desire a deeper relationship with God.",
