  "description": "Twin sisters Laney and Leela return from a camping trip to find their small town completely empty; everyone has vanished, including their parents and Laney’s boyfriend, Hollister. The news headline will refer to their friends and family as the missing. But where are they really? Besides strange marks on the ground caused by a lightning storm, there aren’t any clues, and without any leads on the disappearances, the police leave the town isolated and closed off. The twins and their two siblings hide from the authorities, determined to figure out what really happened. Just as they begin to lose hope, a mysterious young man arrives, claiming he can help them, and when he reveals the truth about the missing, the twins must decide whether to trust him and his rescue mission—or be separated from their loved ones forever.Described as \"the perfect young adult sci-fi novel\" by the Midwest Book Review, Struck is a fast-paced, character-driven book about one family's resolve amidst loss and uncertainty.",
