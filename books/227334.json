  "description": "I love to swim in the sea, which keepstalking to itselfin the monotone of a vagabondwho no longer recalls exactly how long he's been on the road. Swimming is like prayer:palms join and part,join and part,almost without end.--from \"On Swimming\"Without End draws from each of Adam Zagajewski's English-language collections, both in and out of print--Tremor, Canvas, and Mysticism for Beginners--and features new work that is among his most refreshing and rewarding. These poems, lucidly translated, share the vocation that allows us, in Zagajewski's words, \"to experience astonishment and to stop still in that astonishment for a long moment or two.\"",
