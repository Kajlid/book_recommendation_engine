  "description": "Let's face it: telemarketers can be annoying. Even \"telemarketers\" hate getting telemarketer calls. Whether they're legitimate businesses, pollsters, or unscrupulous scammers, one fact is universal: when people repeatedly call at all hours, day and night, it can be maddening. After a friend pranked Haven Riney by signing him up for tons of college-recruiting forms, he began receiving up to a hundred phone calls daily. He put his number on the Do Not Call List... he told pesky callers to put him on \"their\" lists... he yelled, screamed, begged, and pleaded... but nothing worked. Finally, he decided to waste \"their\" time instead.Riney's lightning-quick wit, sharp comedic timing, and endless patience culminated in the hilarious collection of transcripts presented here. Every call is real, each funnier than the last. Getting mad does no good. \"Messing With Telemarketers\" shows why it's better to get \"even.\"",
