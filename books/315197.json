Need a sitter for Sunday night? I’ll be there.Need someone to man the phones at my mother’s Inn? I’m on it. Need an extra hand at my brother’s winery? I thought you’d never ask.Problem is, I have an actual job that expects me to show up and work actual hours. And I have a fiancée I’m not sure I really love, who my mother absolutely adores. When saying yes to what everyone else wants means giving up my dream of becoming a professional photographer, the word suddenly sticks in my throat. Until George Gregory shows up in an RV like a knight on a steed and offers to take me away from it all.",
