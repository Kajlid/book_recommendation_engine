  "title": "Playing Defense",
  "description": "Scoring a coaching job with the Rebels was supposed to be a dream come true, a step toward achieving my goal of being the first female NFL head coach. But when three sexy-as-hell players blitzed their way into my life, I got distracted. I took my eye off the ball. And I’m at risk of losing it all, even the sport I love.   Now, the one thing that’s kept me grounded, kept me focused, is the last thing that could possibly bring me comfort. Because when it comes to Xavier, Colt, and Tristan, the lines are blurred. The rules—questioned.    I may be their coach on the field, but in matters of the heart, I’m playing defense.  **Playing Defense is the second book in a slow-burn reverse harem series.**",
