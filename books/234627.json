  "title": "From Boy To Blue: Becoming One of America's Finest",
  "description": "In today’s world, especially following police controversy, it’s rare to hear from the officers themselves. Usually, we hear prepared statements from department heads, lawyers, union representatives, victim’s families, and others only tangentially involved. With a current war being waged on law enforcement fueled by public controversy and misunderstanding, “From Boy To Blue” combats this false narrative by revealing the street cop’s mentality, training, and thought process. Steve does this by bringing you along with him through his career while sharing his deepest thoughts and craziest experiences. Steve hopes to help heal the relationship between police and citizens by taking the reader through his psychological transformation from a sheltered suburban boy to becoming a highly decorated police officer. If you have a loved one who is or plans on becoming a police officer, this book from an award-winning author will help you to better understand and support them. Steve is a two-time Heartland Emmy Award winner and a four-time Regional Edward R. Murrow Award winner for his work communicating officers’ stories to the world. After 15 years of dedicated service with the Denver Police Department, Steve continues his important work for the good of our community. Steve has also been featured on multiple media outlets as a police expert.",
