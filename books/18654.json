  "title": "The Ecology of Commerce Revised Edition: A Declaration of Sustainability",
  "description": "“The first important book of the 21st century. It may well revolutionize the relationship between business and the environment.”—Don Falk, Executive Director, Society for Ecological Restoration   The Ecology of Commerce is the provocative national bestseller that addresses the necessity of merging good business practices with common sense environmental concerns. Nearly two decades after its initial publication, this controversial work by Paul Hawken has been revised and updated, arguing why business success and sustainable environmental practices need not—and, for the sake of our planet, must not—be mutually exclusive any longer. An essential work, Hawken’s The Ecology of Commerce belongs on the bookshelf of every concerned citizen—alongside Capitalism at the Crossroads by Stuart Hart and Al Gore’s Earth in the Balance and An Inconvenient Truth.",
