  "description": "An unexpected journey into the wilderness can test even the strongest bonds...Nearly a year has passed since the slaughterhouse raid. Eureka should be happy now that he and Baltan are Azzie and Lleuwellyn's legal guardians, but he can't shake the feeling that a storm waits on the horizon.When Eureka's brother arrives with news that Kwoltan Gera was attacked and asks for help, Eureka knows he can't turn away--especially after the search for their missing tribe leads them to a reclusive Azure village where trust is hard to come by and war looms overhead.Old grudges and past failures follow close, and they may have deadly consequences for Eureka's family.",
