  "description": "Jen's stable relationship is thrown into turmoil after she picks up a stranger in a bar—when videos and demands for money start to arrive, she has to find her blackmailer and rescue her relationship Jen is neither happy nor sad, yet she feels dissatisfied, and doesn't know why. She has a stable job as a press officer with the police; a stable relationship with Dan, a recently appointed police inspector; and, after 10 years, they are about to enter into a stable marriage. A telephone call from a woman changes everything. Is this proof of an affair? Could it be the excuse Jen needs to leave the stifling normality of her life? After an uncharacteristic argument, Jen travels to the Welsh coast to stay at a prebooked romantic hotel. Full of self-pity and sadness she drinks too much and flirts with Justin, a handsome and charismatic charmer. A second meeting sees her back at his cottage where she wakes the following morning with a pounding headache, an empty bed, no memory, and two used condoms. Guilty and chastened, she reconciles with a contrite Dan and continues with wedding plans—when a video of her having sex with Justin surfaces. She is about to lose everything unless she confronts her blackmailer but where will he stop? Will her body be exposed to members of the Surf Sluts website? As she uses her skills as a press officer and emulates her police colleagues to find her extortionist, darker secrets emerge. Does she know Justin? And how much does she know about her husband-to-be? Gripping and witty, Jones' lightness of prose carries her readers to an unanticipated revelation.",
