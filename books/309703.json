We can only plan for things that we know and understand.Fate takes care of the rest.After years of being an Army Ranger, military life was all I knew and understood.I planned on being a Ranger for as long as I could be, climbing the ranks and being a hero to my country.Nothing else mattered.Then fate came along and I fell in love. She became the one thing that mattered more to me than army life, which meant the plans were no longer mine to make.They were ours. Unfortunately, we waited too long to make those plans and tragedy struck. My guaranteed happily ever after was gone. Leaving me broken. Unpredictable. A liability to my team.
