  "description": "A romantic thriller set in present-day New Zealand, In the Shadow of Trees covers a period of several weeks in the life of Regan, a nationally acclaimed sculptor, who is renowned for her work in wood. Fleeing a disastrous relationship with a much younger man, Jason Sullivan, Regan retreats to an isolated house on the Sullivan estate in the remote forests of Northland to prepare a series of sculptures for a major new exhibition. As she works she begins to fall under the spell of the trees and experiences strange recurring dreams and lapses in time, which seem to be related to an ornately carved wooden mirror in the cottage. When a reserved Irish handyman on the estate, Liam, is directed to carry out repairs to the cottage, a relationship slowly develops. But as the shadows deepen around Regan, Liam becomes increasingly concerned about her growing obsession with the trees. And what they find out about the bizarre history of the Sullivan women, whose graves are secreted away on the estate, alarms him even further. Building to an enthralling climax, this beautifully written novel is haunting and compelling, and signals the arrival of a significant new talent in contemporary fiction.",
