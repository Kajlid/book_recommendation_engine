  "description": "Damon Kallis is always in control, whether in his VP position for his family's toy company, captaining his men's rec league hockey team, or taking care of his friends. There isn't any room for romance in his well-ordered life. He made that mistake once, and it nearly cost him everything. Work, family, and friends are all he needs. All Emily Lombardi needs is a job. After her ex poisoned her reputation as a reporter and left her last boss questioning her integrity, no TV station is willing to give her a chance. When the job as Damon's executive assistant opens up, she's in the right place at the right time. Landing the position is simple compared to dealing with Damon—the stubborn man won’t let her in. Working in close quarters leads to accidental touches, lingering glances, and simmering passion. Soon, they can’t deny their attraction. With the holiday season under way, Damon's ice starts to thaw and Emily sees someone caring and real, someone she could count on. But their past experiences are hard to forget, and when their new-found love is tested, only a Christmas miracle can give them a happily-ever-after.",
