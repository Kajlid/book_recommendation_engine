  "description": "Jordan Gates isn’t easily flustered—or easily scared.When his boss asks him to accompany him to Italy for a family wedding, Jordan agrees. He’ll get paid handsomely for his trouble.There’s a catch, though. Several catches.1. He’s there as bait: Jordan has to pose as his boss’s real boyfriend, who looks a lot like Jordan.2. Someone in his boss’s mafioso family wants to murder them.3. That someone is probably Damiano Conte, a cold, ruthless bastard who has no right to be so hot.Everyone says Damiano is a sociopath with no capacity for real emotion. Jordan believes them. But he can’t seem to stay away, fascinated with the man despite his better judgment.When the family visit turns into a nightmare of betrayal, kidnapping, and murder, Jordan has to rely on Damiano to keep his sanity. Can he trust a heartless, manipulative sociopath? Can he stop craving him after he returns to his normal life?Can a man who doesn’t feel fall in love?This book contains explicit MM content, hurt/comfort, codependency, an emotionally stunted control freak who doesn’t know how to express his affections in a healthy way—and a man who loves him anyway. Book 13 in the Straight Guys series, but it can be read as a stand-alone.",
