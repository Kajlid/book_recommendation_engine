  "description": "When mixology meets biology, it's pure chemistry!Todd Nelson and Tucker Thompson both know what it's like to feel abandoned, lonely, and afraid. Since ending up in the same foster family together, they've been as close as brothers. Now in their early twenties, they still have each other's backs, sharing an apartment and working at The Other Team. Tuck avoids hook-ups while Todd constantly indulges in one-night-stands. Watching Todd go through a string of conquests in their home is brutal on Tuck, who wants Todd all for himself. What he doesn't realize is that Todd has strong feelings for him, too. Tuck has always trusted Todd to have his back, but can he trust him with his heart?",
