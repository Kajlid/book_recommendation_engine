  "description": "From flying daredevil combat missions over Nazi Germany and shattering records as test pilot to his annual trip into California's rugged sierras, General Chuck Yeager has always been a restless adventurer in search of new challenges. Now General Yeager is back in the cockpit in a book that exemplifies his special brand of living--full out and straight ahead.Like Yeager, his record-breaking best-selling autobiography, Press On! is chock-full of the general's own brand of rugged individualism. In Press On! you'll roam the world with Chuck Yeager in search of adventure: from a close brush with death in a remote corner of New Zealand to backpacking at 14,000 feet in the high sierras and flycasting in Scotland to deer hunting in Texas and catching a 267-pound Alaskan halibut--on a forty-pound test line! And you'll travel back with him to his roots among the rough-hewn, honest mountain folk of West Virginia and the remarkable people and experiences that influence him to this day.Here is life as only Chuck Yeager can live it, with anecdotes and insights from his best friends, flying buddies, family, and his wife of more than forty years. Here is the real Chuck Yeager, a man in his sixties who still lives life on the edge, facing new challenges and risks with an indefatigable spirit of adventure that can be summed up in one simple phrase: Press on!",
