  "title": "Jasper & Gabriella",
  "description": "Jasper spends his days looking after his brother and his nights working in a bar. He’s never had time for girls and is way too shy to make a move on one anyway, especially a girl as gorgeous as Gabriella. Gabriella is leaving town, going to college, and never coming back. There is just one handsome man that she would really like to spend some time with before she goes…Jasper & Gabriella is an 8,500-word M/F coming of age short story. It can be read as a stand-alone story but is also a prequel to the Johnson Road trilogy, three full-length novels charting the lives and loves of Jasper and his friends at university in England.",
