  "title": "Vaughn's Story: A League of Ascenders Short Story",
  "description": "This short story takes you back to the beginnings of one of your favorite ‘League of Ascenders’ characters. Vaughn wasn’t always a powerful Ascender with a loving family. Take a trip back to where it all began—when he was still an awkward young boy with no friends and a seemingly hopeless future. Learn how he and his horse, Eli, met, and about the life-changing event that took place that very day as he discovered his true potential. With a little help from above and one magnificent black stallion, Vaughn will embark on his first adventure that will far exceed all his dreams; he will be free of the horrible place he was forced to call home, and never have to look back. Experience the moment Vaughn realizes his supernatural gifts; engages in his first battle to overcome the darkness; and finds the courage to begin his God-appointed journey.",
