  "description": "f stealing a half million dollars from the Mafia is a bad idea, then using the money to pay off a homicidal Russian loan shark is an insane idea.  Elliot Becker realizes this a little too late as his well-intentioned South Florida real estate scam starts to fall to pieces. He needs a Plan B—and he needs it now—because when Ponzi schemes fail, they tend to fail fast.  Complicating matters is Logan Treverow, an aspiring sculptor and newly-returned veteran from Afghanistan trying to figure out who took out a $200,000 loan in his soon-to-be-ex-wife’s name—and why all signs are pointing to Elliot Becker.  Add an ex-Spetsnaz assassin with dreams of owning a boutique hotel in Palm Beach, a Mob fixer in a midlife crisis, and a budding arsonist with a skin condition, and you’ve got just a few of the characters in Palm Beach Blues, a black comedy in the spirit of Carl Hiaasen and Tim Dorsey.",
