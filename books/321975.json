  "description": "Have you ever lost yourself in a fantasy world you created?That’s how I’ve survived the years alone in a reality where humans cower in fear of supernatural creatures hiding behind the veil.All I’ve ever had is my pen, my notebook, and the world I created to make it through the days as a ward of the state, suffering at the hands of the real villains of the world...Humans.The pages of my notebook hold five sinful, feared monsters. Ones that I certainly shouldn’t be pining over since they aren’t even real.I question my grip on reality when real life and fantasy collide as my words suddenly come to life. Out of the pages climb each of the beautifully twisted monsters I created with my ink.Magical factions fight for control over me and my monsters, claiming I have the potential to topple empires with my power to create.Dark Imaginarium Academy claims to want to help me learn about my new powers. The Headmistress says they can protect me, but I’m not so sure about that.The one thing I am sure about? I’ll destroy the world if they try to take my monsters from me.Because my creations aren’t just monsters—they’re my soulmates.***Monsters Within is book one in The Creatures We Crave series, which is set within the shared universe of Dark Imaginarium Academy.
