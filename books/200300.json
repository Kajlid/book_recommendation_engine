  "description": "I’ve spent my whole life hiding in the shadows, only coming out when music is involved. It’s my escape. My happiness. I never thought the feeling I get when I play would vanish. Until it did. It only took one moment, one person’s actions, for my quiet life to shatter and break into a million pieces. Every day is a reminder of what I want to forget. I need to get out. I never thought I’d be the person leaving but staying here, breathing in the same air as the people who torment me, suffocates me. I’m dying, slowly fading away with every word, every lie, spoken about me. At the end of the day, Emily Spencer is no one and I don't know if that's a good thing. I need to know who I am. I can't live like this anymore. I need to hear the music again. I can’t survive listening to this silence. I need to drown myself in the sounds of yesterday.I need to know who Emily Spencer is again.WARNING: Due to heavy subject matter, involving rape, strong language, and some sexual situations this book is not recommended for anyone under the age of 17. ***Dear Reader, this is NOT a continuation of the Enough trilogy. This is what I originally envisioned Emily's story to be without the paranormal elements that occur in the trilogy. If you have read the trilogy, reading Sounds of Yesterday will be confusing because of the new content. The story is not the same. Please proceed with caution. If you have not read the trilogy, you have nothing to fear.This is a standalone novel!***",
