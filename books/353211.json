First he brings her home. Then he checks in on his patient, and finds not a cat, but a gorgeous, very naked woman. Aliyah Carter spent the past six months trapped in cheetah form, a prisoner of the poachers who took her to use in an illegal exotic-game hunt. Finally she’s escaped, but now she faces another problem. A devastatingly sexy sheriff who knows her secret. Amber EyesThe beautiful, timid cougar that appears at Hunter and Jericho’s remote cabin breaks their quiet routine, warms their hearts—and rouses their curiosity.

Now pregnant and alone, Kaya’s only hope is that the men who love her will find their way home. Warning: This title contains explicit sex, adult language, sweet lovin’, multiple partners and ménage a trois.",
