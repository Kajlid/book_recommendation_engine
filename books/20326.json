  "description": "Autumn Wysocki isn't like other girls. Yes, she is intelligent, beautiful, and talented, but she can also practice ink. Autumn is a Daughter of Sagacity, gifted with the ability to feel and see emotion through written word. With just one touch to a mother's journal, Autumn can actually experience the joy of a newborn entering the world. But when that same finger grazes over a headline in a newspaper, she can feel the terror and despair in a deadly flood. After being abducted from her family as a child, she was sent to live in the Institute, where she was trained to harness her gift for evil purposes. But when her captors hatch a plot that could threaten the world, Autumn vows to use her gift for good. Armed with her promise to save the world, she escapes from the Institute bent on saving mankind. And then she runs into Tucker Mitchell. Tucker knows there's something different about Autumn. He just can't shake her. And when he finds himself helping her battle strange creatures, rescuing her from drowning, and busting her out of hospitals, he knows there's something she's not telling him. Will Autumn reveal her secrets and risk Tucker's life? Or will she stay true to her purpose and leave Tucker behind? Find out what will happen next in Rachel Loepker's Bleeding Ink.",
