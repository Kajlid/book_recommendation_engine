  "description": "Everyone dies, but there are times when those who leave the world in particularly violent ways are so focused on the injustice of their deaths that they're unable to accept their own passing. These souls are then left as angry, bitter spirits, forever bound to a world with which they are almost completely incapable of interacting.Seth Kierney, a man with the ability to perceive and communicate with the dead, occasionally finds himself possessed by such spirits. During periods of dormancy, he attempts to piece together the memories of their deaths to find those responsible. The departed then assume control of him, taking their vengeance and passing on. Aiding him in this are Lilli, a former earthbound soul who chose to remain by Seth's side after seeing her own murderers brought to justice, and Nolan, a psychic who sees merit in Seth's mission, as well as a chance to find redemption for the crimes of a life he's left behind.When David Klein, a young doctor responsible for saving Seth's life, is found brutally murdered in his home, the trio assume that Klein is earthbound and opt to do whatever is necessary to lay the man's soul to rest. Things become difficult, however, when an organization responsible for overseeing the world's psychic population targets Seth, who they believe to be responsible for the death of the very person that Seth and his friends are trying to help. Meanwhile, Klein's murderer still stalks the streets of Cincinnati, free to continue his bloody crusade.",
