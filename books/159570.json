  "description": "Fletcher Bell is confused after his mother’s death. He’s also bored with his new home in rural Scotland. That is until he and three new friends break into an abandoned house, flip an innocent switch, and end up in Necropolis, the City of the Dead. It’s a cold, harsh, “snow globe world,” where being dead is normal, and the Living “warmbloods” are freaks. Fletcher and friends become caught up in the eternal battle between dark angels who would destroy all worlds to tear down the gates of their former home, and the Archangels and their Dead allies. Can Fletcher and friends help stop the Fallen from passing through the veil to destroy Necropolis? Is he the special soul some think him? Is there a way back to Scotland for the Living Souls, or are they trapped forever in the City of the Dead?",
