  "description": "With wit and candor, Hollie Hardy writes for her life. \"Break up your own little tedium,\" these poems remind us. With their riffs on existing literature and recurrent crises, Hardy's poems show us what can be gained from trying old tricks in new ways. Hardy shows us how to survive a life lived just over the edge. These poems are playful in the way tussling wolf cubs are playful. They are physical and practical. They are recognizing and revealing strength. Camille T. Dungy, author of 'Smith Blue' and 'What to Eat, What to Drink, What to Leave for Poison'",
