  "title": "Equations of a Being: A being who gathered moss",
  "description": "If you have a penchant for both reason and abstractness, this intriguing piece of literature shouldn't be missed. Equations of a Being beautifully coalesces the author's thought pieces pertaining to the existential spectrum. Never has there been a book that blended emotions, intellect, and imagination so seamlessly, to celebrate a being in totality. The author depicts his artistic persuasion, the enriched and disintegrated fragments of his existence, and the conclusions based on his interactions with the physical and abstract elements of life in a compelling and unbridled manner. It's a book for the ages that will let you trace the complete trajectory of a being and realize that a being has been and will always be a convergence of his tryst with abstractness, his acceptance of vulnerability, and his surge for virtuosity.",
