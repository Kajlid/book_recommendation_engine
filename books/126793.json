  "title": "Hot Wet Touches: A Stranger Encounter",
  "description": "Claudia is a regally beautiful young woman, but she doesn't really believe it. Today, she and her two friends have only a relaxing day at the spa in mind. The girls frolic, chatter and unwind as planned, sampling all steamy, watery features on offer. They're naked, as is the European way. Then Claudia's friends leave her alone in a sauna with a male stranger, and the sexual tension begins to build. The viewpoint alternates between those of Claudia and Jake, as their paths slowly converge, until lust finally overcomes them both. WARNING: EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT",
