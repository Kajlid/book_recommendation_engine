  "description": "Told from the perspective of the sluggish employee of a \"Zombie Bed & Breakfast\" tourist trap, this horrific love letter, and middle finger, from the zombie capital of the world, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, chronicles the daily workings of a staged zombie assault and the rehearsal of an end-of-the-world scenario. The question of whether the cast are really attacking hotel guests, who is dead, alive, or just annoying as hell is answered in a satisfyingly gruesome manner, sparked by an undead love triangle and a tipping point of post-modern, pop-culture references. Trivia note: Author David James Keaton first attempted to finance and run a Zombie Bed & Breakfast similar to the tragedy depicted here. However, this misguided get-rich-quick scheme ended in disaster. So read this thinly veiled, fictionalized account of one tiny apocalypse, and do not let those poor souls dine in vain. (also includes the utterly irresponsible \"Send More Paramedics: The Zombie Movie Drinking Game,\" which you can play while you read, drink, drive, and die, over and over again!)",
