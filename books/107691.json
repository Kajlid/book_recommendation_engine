So, hitching a ride to Sarasota, where her daughter is staying, seemed like a good idea at first. That is until she realized her Good Samaritan is clearly suffering from the recent loss of his wife. As the miles go by and they get closer to Sarasota, she comes to suspect that this crazy widower may in fact be a murderer and they're transporting a body in the trunk of his car. With the police hot on their trail, Tess isn't about to let a little murder stand between her and her daughter -- no matter how many bodies start piling up.",
