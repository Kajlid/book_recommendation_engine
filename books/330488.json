  "title": "Heaven on Earth",
  "description": "This is the fourth book in a series of four fantasy novels about best friends Eddie and Len. The boys now enter a ghost world, and whatever adventures they experienced previously become nothing when compared to the fun and excitement of their new roles. Free to roam, with no human failings, fears or hindrances, they 'live' in a world that is literally a 'Heaven on Earth'. The first book in the series, 'The Fantastic Journey' is available from www.arimapublishing.co.uk or Amazon; the second, 'Anywhere and Nowhere' and the third, 'The Haunting of Eddie Compton' are both available from www.lulu.com. All four books are a good family read, suitable for grandparents and grandchildren alike.",
