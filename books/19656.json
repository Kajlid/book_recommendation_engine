A compelling account of political and religious developments from the advent of the Tudors in the 1460s to the death of Elizabeth I in 1603, his authoritative study discusses the far-reaching changes in government and the Reformation of the Church under Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary, and Elizabeth, and is enriched with illuminating character studies of the monarchs and politicians of the era. Taking into account new debates on the progress of the English Reformation and the strengths and weaknesses of Tudor Government at a local and national level, the book includes contextual analyses of the Tudor English economy, society, and political culture.",
