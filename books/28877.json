  "description": "Another Trestle Press Digital Short “Granny Weaver is praying for five women in her Old Order Amish community in Smicksburg, PA., but nothing seems to be happening. Spinning wool one day she ponders the fact that fibers wrapped around each other make a yarn that’s hard to break. Maybe the women she sees unraveling need to be spun together so they don’t break.So Granny starts a knitting circle to make items for tornado victims in Joplin, MO. She invites Maryann who looks too tired and needs a break from her eight children. Ella seems mighty down since a doctor told her she can’t have children. Emma feels she’ll never get married because of her weight. Ruth has been depressed since the day she got married and won’t tell anyone why. Elizabeth never married to take care of her handicapped father, but others suspects she has a broken heart over a broken courtship.Over the course of a year these women open up at the knitting circle. Their hearts are encouraged, being knit together in love as they face trials and troubles…together.”About Karen Anna A trusted English friend among Amish in Western PA and Western NY, my four grown children call me an ‘Amish Addict.’ My husband of thirty years shares my addiction. Our Old Order Amish friends have taken us back to a time when life was slower. Slow enough to enjoy our faith, family and friends. Slow enough to make me relax and join a knitting circle and learn to spin wool. Wanting to share what I’ve learned from these gentle people led me to write Amish fiction.",
