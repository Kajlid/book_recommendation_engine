She was too vulnerable; somehow he had to convince his heart to let her go. His life would chew her up and spit her out.To My…Viddy couldn’t get the man out of her head. Just the thought of Trance put a smile on her face. And when he walked into the same room? Words couldn’t explain. God help her, but she was even in a relationship with another man.
