And when he puts on a special pair of specs, his experiences are anything but common.Using his Dream Trekker X-5000 goggles, Peter can be anyone he wants to be, go anywhere he pleases, and interact with anyone (or anything) he desires. He is limited only by his own imagination—and by one other fact. All of the magnificent things Peter experiences occur only in the world of dreams. And in these lucid, realistic dreams, he is an active participant, not a mere observer.Peter Wilson’s Dream Theater: The Dream Master follows Peter’s epic tenth-century quest to rescue a kidnapped maiden. Pitted against fearless Vikings, dragons, demons, and the undead—all in one night! Rich with history, lore, and all things alarming, this novel is sure to set readers’ minds spinning and leave them wondering where Peter’s dreams will take him next…and how they’ll impact his waking hours.",
