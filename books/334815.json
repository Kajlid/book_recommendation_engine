Or will it only add fuel to the fires of war?-----Book 1 of 3 in The Cosmic Honor Trilogy - inspired by the Chinese myth, Mulan.Some of this story was published under the title Cosmic Honor as a MF standalone romance, since then, it has been altered, expanded and changed into a slow-burn, slow-building, why choose / polycule romance where the FMC has more than one romantic interest, with two of them together. This book ends on a cliffhanger.",
