  "description": "NEW ADULT/ADULT CROSSOVER ROMANTIC COMEDY NOVELLA A martini glass of sizzling romance, a jigger of suspense and crime, perfectly shaken with a twist of wacky humor.  Where would you draw the line between love and trust?   When Colin’s feisty great grandma Helga mysteriously disappears, Natalie and the gun-toting Svetlana rush to the rescue. With the help of Russian mafia goons and Natalie’s girlfriends, they get more than they bargained for. Natalie invites trouble into her life all over again. She could find herself questioned by the police, or worse, her relationship with Colin could become rickety once more.  And so the race begins: with grandma Helga on the loose, Colin turns to the police for help, and Natalie is a stiletto heel tip outside of the law. But being in the wrong has never felt so vindicated.  Warning: due to sexual situations, nasty language, and a high dose of sarcasm this book may not be appropriate for readers under 18 years old. Not intended for prudes who get easily affronted   **Almost Too Far is the last installment in the Almost Bad Boys series. The books in this series should be read in order. They are not stand-alone books.** Reading Order: Almost Matched Almost Broken Up Almost Too Far",
