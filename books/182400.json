  "description": "Dear Author,As you can see we’re in Scotland. The year is 1745 and the Jacobite rebellion spells disaster for the Highland clansmen who followed Bonnie Prince Charlie into battle against the English.It’s so not the right time for this man to fall in love which of course means that, inevitably, he does. But with who? A fellow rebel? An English soldier? A man from a rival clan?Photo Description: In a wood, a young man wearing a green tartan kilt sits astride a dark bay horse. His brown hair is messy and he stares intently at something out of sight; he doesn’t look happy. In his left hand he holds a claymore, horizontally, the blade above his knee. You can see that his knee is bare between his riding boots and the hem of his kilt.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.
