  "description": "Cancel your dinky little roomette on the train. I’m booking us two of the big bedroom suites. I’ll cancel it AFTER you’ve booked the other sleeper rooms. And reimburse you. Don’t worry about it. Just cancel your tickets. I got this. Round trip. I’m on the Amtrak website right now. You don’t have to leave NYC when I do! You’ll hardly be able to spend any time with your Instagram girlfriend that you've never met! It’s fine. She’ll be fine with it. Cancel your tickets. You aren’t going to stop texting me until I’ve canceled them, are you? Damn right I’m not. Just do it. You can thank me later.*** Um. Did you cancel your tickets? Yes, Edward. I canceled them. Okay, because it turns out they only had one Family Bedroom from LA to Chicago. But the good news is I booked it for us. It’s the biggest room they had. The bad news is I booked it for us. And it’s the only sleeper room they have left now. In related news, there was also only one room left from Chicago to New York. Hands up if you’re excited! *man raising hand emoji* I am so mad at you right now.*** I’ve compiled a list of ground rules re shared train bedroom. Check your email, please read carefully, and refer to it again on the ninth of February. Thank you. *nerd face emoji* Received. I have some notes.***This is a 55,000 word very low angst friends to lovers standalone novel***",
