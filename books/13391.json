  "description": "Dara is a cocky blonde tomboy working as a deputy sheriff for her Uncle, the Sheriff of Kainlen County. In rural Mississippi, that meant speed traps, boredom, and her uniform sticking to her skin as she tries to avoid the worst of the sweltering summer heat. And then she meets Emery, a mountain of black flesh, his body rippling with muscles, glistening in the hot sun, his face sullen with anger and resentment. In an instant, she becomes obsessed, her body aflame, her mind overpowered by her own uncontrolled lust. What a wicked, wicked thing it would be to have sex with a Black man! And not just any Black man, for Emery was just out of prison, full of rage and violence. As her obsession batters down her pride, Dara is used, brutalized, and humiliated again and again, given to other Black men, and made the focus of all their revenge, anger and lust. Yet like an addict, she revels in her own abuse, her mind and body wild with the heat it brings her. And if she can't figure out how to control her addiction she might wind up in prison, or dead.",
