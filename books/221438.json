  "description": "Hollywood hath no fury like a woman scorned. In this fun, flirty second-chance romance from New York Times bestselling author Sawyer Bennett, an aspiring starlet reconnects with her first love.  Eden Goodnight went to Los Angeles to make it big, not to be publicly humiliated by her cheating fiancé at a red-carpet premiere. But when Eden returns to her hometown to put the scandal behind her, she can barely find a sympathetic shoulder to cry on. Turns out the locals are worse than the paparazzi, and they all think she's turned into a spoiled brat. But in a strange twist of fate, the one person who seems to understand what Eden's going through is Cooper Mayfield . . . the boy she left behind.  Small-town charm is no match for the glitz and glamour of Hollywood. At least that's what Coop's been telling himself all these years. As Eden's old flame—and the landscaper for her family's historic home—Coop feels some responsibility for getting her out of her funk. But as soon as he sees that million-dollar smile, he’s a goner. Soon they’re making out like teenagers again. But when a life-changing role falls into Eden’s lap, Coop just hopes she doesn’t give up on a love that’s meant to be.",
