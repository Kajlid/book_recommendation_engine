  "title": "Understanding China: Learning from China's Past, Present, and Future",
  "description": "China is quickly proving to be an important global player. Acknowledging its inevitable growth, understanding China has become as important as ever. Over the last decade, we have witnessed Chinese businesses expand outside the country's borders and how China’s influence is spreading around the globe. This might leave some Is China's success due to Deng Xiaoping’s opening-up policy or is there something else that can be credited? In this book, Stefan Piech takes the reader on a journey through China’s history, present, and future to answer this exact question. While Chinese society is now infused with innovation and dynamism, America has seen the foundations of its economic model shake after the 2008 financial crisis. With the global rise of China, the US is now facing a political challenge that it has never seen before. As a consequence of this, politicians and business leaders all around the world have an increased interest in understanding China. At the end of the day, it seems possible that China will replace the United States as the world's dominant power. In doing so, it will not become more western but the world will become more Chinese. Consequently, it is important for us to understand this rising power not through western terms but through its own unique history and culture. “Probably in 2035 we will pass that mantle on to China. It will be the biggest economy in the world, and it will go way past us and way past India. Given the growth, the size, the opportunities, I don’t think there’s any other place in the world that can match it.” – David Rubenstein",
