For Sarah Connolly, this invokes beautiful memories of her son Jack. A talented athlete destined to represent Ireland in the Olympics and loved by everyone who knew him. While out training early one morning, the sixteen-year-old was killed when Desmond Shanahan lost control of his car. Jack's death crushing Sarah, as her only child, he was the very essence of her life. Losing a child in tragic circumstances, leaves a bitter taste in your mouth, a sense of unjust.....Now, five years after the tragedy, Desmond's early release from prison leaves Sarah feeling let down by the justice system and she makes sure he knows this. Even if it means losing friends in her quest to remind the close community of Kilmer Cove, of Desmond's guilt. What Sarah fails to realise is, nothing will bring back her son. However, Sarah is not alone in her angst over Desmond's release, and a web of lies soon becomes untangled over the events which lead to Jack Connolly's death.Can Sarah find it in her heart to forgive Desmond? A Sweet Smell of Strawberries takes in a beautiful Irish setting along the coastline of Donegal and The Wild Altlantic way. A story of love, heartache and retribution which makes you realise no one is perfect!",
