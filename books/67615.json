  "title": "Dorked by the Rings",
  "description": "An over-the-top parody of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, where the main characters record, in a diary, their personal stories, as they battle to destroy SourDong’s evil Ring. Some of the wacky companions include: Frydough and Bilballs Saggin, Hamwise Spamgee, GoneGolfin the Magical Gizzard, GimmeLick the Dwarf, and Airofcorny the Dangler from the North.The hairy little pair of ankle biters, Bilballs and Frydough, wake from a riotous birthday party to learn their simple life in Middle-dirt has turned to schmutz. All because the evil spirit of SourDong has returned for his magic Ring, one powerful enough to scare the sauce off a pizza. The fate of the realm is then left to Frydough and The Dudeship of the Bling, who, ever onward, leave chaos in their wake, bungling through preposterous plights, sinister skullduggery, and the mayhem of epic nutty battles, only to face, in the end, absurdities worse than death. Can these loony heroes survive, where no one else would dare? Will the madness never end?For anyone who loved J.R.R. Tolkien’s fantasy masterpiece, and enjoys a raucous parody, the personal dairies of Dorked by the Ring Bling will make the reader glad their purchase contributed to the author’s desperately needed frontal lobotomy.",
