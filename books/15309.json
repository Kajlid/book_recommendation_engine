  "title": "Digging Deep: A Writer Uncovers His Marriages",
  "description": "Lemon moves from a lifetime in California to live platonically with a 24-year-old female college student. He takes us with him on his journey to uncover his role in the destruction of his three marriages. With brutal honesty, courage and insight he uncovers and exposes his conduct and attitudes about women and marriage that had been profoundly influenced by his place on the cusp between the moralistic generation of the 1940's and the next generation that embraced sex, drugs and rock 'n roll and greater independence and equality for women. Deeply troubled by his career choice as a corporate lawyer, he nevertheless, used it for years to avoid his marital issues. Lemon's story will guide you in resolving your own relationship problems.",
