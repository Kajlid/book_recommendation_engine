  "title": "Bitter Eden",
  "description": "This frank and beautifully written novel draws heavily on the author's World War II experiences as a captive in North Africa and a prisoner of war in Italy and Germany. Three men who see themselves as \"straight\" must negotiate the emotions that are brought to the surface by the physical closeness of survival in the male-only camps. The complex rituals of camp life and the strange loyalties and deep bonds between the men are compellingly depicted in this tender, bitter, powerful tale of lives inexorably changed and a war whose ending does not bring peace.",
