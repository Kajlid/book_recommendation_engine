  "description": "When the Militia entered the peaceful village of Nyanyar Ngun, South Sudan in 1992 - amidst the backdrop of a bitter civil war - it wasn’t in peace.Soldiers of the SFL committed untold atrocities in that small farming village and from a line of terrified children, boys were chosen to become recruits of the Militia, whilst girls were taken for selling within a market of odious buyers. Those who weren’t selected were either left to perish or murdered where they stood.In a field of high maize next to the village, sixteen-year old Jada lay hidden and afraid, witnessing the merciless slaughter of his parents and the capture of his sister Kiden; powerless to stop it, too frightened to try.But now - tortured by grief, consumed with shame and driven by guilt - Jada must embark on a long & arduous journey to rescue his sister from a sinister world and earn his absolution … or die trying!",
