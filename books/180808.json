  "description": "I wanted best friends forever and calls from a boyfriend, but my phone only rings when some guy can't get what he wants from his girlfriend. And knows he can get it from me. I am my mother's daughter.It wasn't always like this. At first it was just one guy, but when someone new drove me home, whistling and saying, \"Damn, girl, you're hot,\" I knew what I was becoming, what I was doing.I was going to let anyone have me until someone wanted me for more.But then I found out I was pregnant. And I hoped everything would change.Hope. The word carries so much. Because what if it doesn't work out or show up and come through? But what if it does?",
