He likes his new North Beach apartment, steps away from his Chinatown roots. Running, tai chi, women who are attracted to his exotic looks. Life is good. Then, Lee is ordered to cover the unexplained deaths of a local judge and prosecutor. Intrigued by the connection, and the judgeâ€™s attractive niece, Sarah Armstrong, Lee begins to uncover a biotech scandal whose perpetrators will kill to conceal. When Lee and Sarah become targets, the question becomes whether the pair can evade their hunters and piece together the story before their time runs out. By a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.",
