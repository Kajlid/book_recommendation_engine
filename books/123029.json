  "description": "Have you ever saved up for a rainy day, had your head in the clouds or generally felt under the weather? The British obsession with weather and the words we use to describe it have come to define us. We talk about it endlessly ­– five whole months of our lives to be precise. We use it to start conversations with complete strangers. It affects our moods, shopping habits and even how we vote. This book is packed with information you’ll want to share about this most important subject – quirky history, surprising facts, folklore, strange words and even stranger people.",
