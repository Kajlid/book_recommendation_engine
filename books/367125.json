  "description": "It has been over 100 years since the Null War, and the Irids are still dying off. The only hope of survival is to find the the only person who can weld the Prism power. However, their kind had all been murdered before the war, and popular belief is that only a Zircon can find a Zircon. Yet, Tarah's grandmother believes that Zircons still exist and claims to have discovered the key to finding one. But there is one problem; Tarah's grandmother is insane. It's up to Tarah to convince her hebdomad (the seven who weld each of the special power of the Irids) that they have no choice but to delve into the past and find a way to save their race. To do so, Tarah must break every rule of Irids, be seduced by the power of darkness and learn the harsh realities of light.",
