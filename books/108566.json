  "title": "Yom Kippur Readings: Inspiration, Information and Contemplation",
  "description": "A powerful collection of writings about Yom Kippur that will add spiritual depth and holiness to your experience of the Day of Atonement. As Rosh Hashanah ends and you look ahead to Yom Kippur, what do you think about? The familiar melody of Kol Nidre ? The long hours of fasting? The days of self-examination? You know that the Day of Atonement is the holiest on the Jewish calendar, but sometimes it just feels long, tiresome and devoid of personal meaning. The readings in this book are for anyone seeking a deeper level of personal reflection and spiritual intimacy―and a clearer understanding of just what makes Yom Kippur so holy. Drawn from a variety of sources―ancient, medieval, modern, Jewish and non-Jewish―this selection of readings, prayers and insights explores the opportunities for inspiration and reflection inherent in the themes addressed on the Day of sin, forgiveness, repentance, spiritual growth, and being at one with self, family, community and God. These readings enable you to enter into the spirit of Yom Kippur in a personal and powerful way while they uplift and inform. They will add to the benefits of your High Holy Day experience year after year.",
