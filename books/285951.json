  "description": "\"Day had broken cold and grey, exceedingly cold and grey, when the man turned aside from the main Yukon trail and climbed the high earth- bank, where a dim and little-travelled trail led eastward through the fat spruce timberland...\"\nA man alone on the Yukon Trail—save for his dog—is planning on meeting friends when the day turns for the worse and he encounters severe cold reaching 75 degrees below zero. His luck only goes downhill from there when he falls through the snow, getting his legs wet. Now, his only hope of surviving is to build a fire, but his lack of supplies, the extreme elements and his own diminishing senses prove to be an impenetrable barrier to his existence.First published in 1902, 'To Build a Fire' is one of Jack London's most beloved short stories. A heartbreaking tale set in the vast wintry landscape of the North, it endures as one of the greatest adventures ever written.\nJack London\n (1876-1916) was an American novelist, journalist, and social activist. A pioneer of commercial fiction and American magazines, he was one of the first American authors to become an international celebrity and earn a large fortune from writing. His most famous works include \n'The Call of the Wild' (1903)\n and 'White Fang' (1906), as well as the short stories 'To Build a Fire' (1902), 'An Odyssey of the North' (1900), and 'Love of Life' (1905).",
