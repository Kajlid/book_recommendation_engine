  "description": "A prosecutor fights a drug trafficker ― and his own heroin addiction ― in this thriller from a Dashiell Hammett Prize– and Arthur Ellis Award–winning author “Deverell has a narrative style so lean that scenes and characters seem to explode on the page. He makes the evil of his plot breathtaking and his surprises like shattering glass.” ― Philadelphia Bulletin “Spell-binding, first-rate.” ― Buffalo News Lawyer Foster Cobb’s objective is to bring down the mysterious Dr. Au, responsible for the drugs that flow through Vancouver. But under the pressure of a disintegrating career and marriage, Cobb himself has taken up a long-abandoned heroin habit. With a racing plot and dramatic twists, Needles plunges into a seedy 1970s underworld of crooked cops, Asian drug lords, and tense courtroom scenes. A winner of the Seal First Novel Award, it’s a riveting tale of crime and justice with “surprises like shattering glass,” from an author who has sold over a million copies ( Philadelphia Bulletin ).",
