  "description": "In the Middle of Nowhere is the compelling true account of 18-year-old nurse Terry Augustus and John Underwood, a young born-and-bred cattleman she found flat on his back in Ward 3 of St Vincents Hospial, nursing a serious spinal injury sustained while mustering cattle. John was itching to get home to his family's cattle station in the Northern Territory. He promised Terry he'd write.After five long years of corresponding, John and Terry married and moved to their new home - a tent and a newly drilled bore in the middle of nowhere. Their love for each other was only matched by their love for this 'last frontier'in the heart of the Territory. Modern-day pioneers, they built their cattle station, Riveren, from scratch and raised and educated a new generation of Underwoods there, on the headwaters of the Victoria River, 600 kilometers south-west of Katherine. Times were tough and there was heartbreak, danger and struggle, but the power of love and the strength of family ties helped them overcome every obstacle.In the Middle of Nowhere is their story. It's a story of beating the odds, told with warmth and a genuine knowledge of the Outback. It's a real story of the Territory, and is as vast, dramatic and inspiring as the land that lies at the heart of this unforgettable book.",
