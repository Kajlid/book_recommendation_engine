  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Fantasy Romance, M/M, shape-shifters, fairies, HEA] What do you do when your mate is a shape-shifting feline? Well, I don't know about you, but I emanate extra pixie dust. That's what I did when I first met Victor Frankenstein. Of course, back then I thought he was going to eat me, but that's beside the point. Currently, I'm looking forward to him eating me - in an entirely different way. Alas, I've always been somewhat small - I'm a pixie, damn it, don't laugh. Therefore, he's ten times my size. Worse, my poor mate is under a curse from an evil witch. To complete our bond, we have to embark on a quest to defeat her and make me human-sized. I suppose it could be worse. He could be changing into a slug, not a cat. At the very least, his fur makes for nice bedding. What? Don't glare at me. I have my priorities in order. I will succeed. After all, I am Larue, pixie of Frankenstein. This book is written in first-person point of view. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
