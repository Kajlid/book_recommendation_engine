  "description": "There are two new boys on campus, and their sexy and scintillating looks have drawn all the girls' attention. However, Kort and Seth have a secret... Faith is a shy girl who's withdrawn from the happy-go-lucky social settings of typical college life--still grieving the recent loss of her somewhat crazy father--when she's pulled from her mournful daze by the attention she keeps getting from the two hotties on campus. A strange encounter with Kort and Seth reveals their secret..., an otherworldly truth beyond Faith's wildest dreams, and she's left with startling questions about the death of her father, her family's bloodline, and a destiny she never imagined possible.",
