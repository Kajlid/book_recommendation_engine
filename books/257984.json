  "description": "The Acere have foreseen; through him the quintessential powers will mend the broken man and dispel the Tyrant. In the wake of devastation, the guards of Roan face their next test. Away from their foes to the south, they plan to evade the war. But bondage soon greets them on the Eader plain, as the magic of Haff grows strong in Banyan. This God turns away from the howls of the enslaved to honor the hearts of brutal men. But soon their voices are heard by the Lady who strives to learn the meaning of rule. In the end, not war-- but victory, compels Pyrus to fulfill the prophecies of the ancient ones. And in the wake of peace, he finds recompense in the form of his beloved. The debut epic Duology The Cry of the Acere, from Arisawe Hampton, is a new addition to the fantasy tradition of Brandon Sanderson, Raymond Feist and K.F. Breene.",
