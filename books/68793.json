  "title": "The Frank Ritza Papers",
  "description": "Cult cartoonist David Collier has fans such as Chris Ware, R. Crumb and Joe Sacco patiently waiting for his next comic. This new 192 page Collier trade paperback will deliver all expectations and beyond with a quirky collection of stories about his family, living life in the army and the search for information on a local artist he discovers, Frank Ritza. Along with the story, Collier provides over 100 sketch book pages from London, Los Angeles and Saskatchewan. This book is a natural companion to the entire D+Q line (especially Seth’s It’s a Good Life and Joe Sacco’s Notes From a Defeatist.)",
