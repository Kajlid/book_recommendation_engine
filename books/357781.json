Recruited as a gardener, Brenden suddenly finds himself at the wizard's school in Kelior, where every potential mage is required by law to serve the Kingdom of Numis.  But unknown to the rulers of Numis, Brenden is far more than he seems-and his presence just may tip the balance of power back into the hands of the wizard community.",
