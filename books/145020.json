  "title": "Rabid: The Pacific Crest Trail. 'Cause therapy ain't working.",
  "description": "Libby Zangle, the heroine of Rabid, fled her mildly-dark past to tackle the second-most-dreaded trail in the United States: the Pacific Crest Trail. (The Continental Divide Trail is scarier.) There, she faced the icy winds of the Mojave Desert and the brutal heat of the snowless High Sierras, the choking smoke of Oregon and the vicious marmots of Washington. Rabid is a semi-fictional account of the weird and wonderful world that Libby found on the Pacific Crest Trail, a world where time is measured by distance from Mexico, where poop is a casual conversation topic, and where hikers are stalked by the worshipful followers of their trail blogs. Darkly humorous, Rabid tells of the beautiful, high-energy, technology-permeated, sometimes-overcrowded, modern thru-hiking experience.",
