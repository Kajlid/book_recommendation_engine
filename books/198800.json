  "description": "Free Fall is a novel written as a series of journal entries chronicling the strange, yet intertwined, events involving Michael Cardazia, a quirky high school science teacher, and his longtime spy girlfriend, Erika Nirvona. Life for the couple proceeds routinely until strange and unexplainable events begin to creep into their lives. Michael is one day catapulted into a world beyond anyone’s imagination. In this alternate universe, he befriends some of Earth’s most well-known individuals including Abraham Lincoln, Elvis Presley, Walt Disney, and Marilyn Monroe, but in starkly different roles from the ones we earthlings remember them for. This whirlwind journey takes the characters from the streets and monuments of Washington DC to a world in which scientists strive to secretly create more perfect human specimens. Full of history and trivia, yet also offering lighthearted humor, this book follows Michael’s free-falling nonstop journey to get back to the woman he loves on Earth. But she too is caught in a series of mysterious events, and Michael soon realizes that, despite the most valiant efforts of his newfound friends, his journey back to Earth has become more complicated than anyone could have foreseen.",
