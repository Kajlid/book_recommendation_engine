  "description": "The King of Iron Hearts Is a fable now A tale they tell children About a man made of metal Whose heart burned so boldly It melted him from the inside out This is a book about a man who feels too much and the woman who loves him. Divided into four parts, it explores the journey he takes from a young man with a wild, restless soul that yearns for something more to the wise man who understands the intricacies of love and loss. The last section shifts to the point of view of his woman to witness their love story from both angles. *This can be read as a stand-alone book of poetry, but it does tie into Lessons in Corruption (The Fallen Men, #1) and After the Fall (The Fallen Men, #4), two books in a series of stand-alone romance novels.*",
