  "title": "The Practice of Lojong: Cultivating Compassion through Training the Mind",
  "description": "A comprehensive guide to lojong , a Buddhist practice used for centuries to develop lovingkindness and compassion, made popular by Pema Chödrön and Chögyam Trungpa For many centuries Indian and Tibetan Buddhists have employed this collection of pithy, penetrating Dharma slogans to develop compassion, equanimity, lovingkindness, and joy for others. Known as the lojong —or mind-training—teachings, these slogans have been the subject of deep study, contemplation, and commentary by many great masters.In this volume, Traleg Kyabgon offers a fresh translation of the slogans as well as in-depth new commentary of each. After living among and teaching Westerners for over twenty years, his approach is uniquely insightful into the ways that the slogans could be misunderstood or misinterpreted within our culture. Here, he presents a refreshing and clarifying view, which seeks to correct points of confusion.",
