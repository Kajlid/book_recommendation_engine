Mel Morris, a snow leopard and self-proclaimed recluse, finds herself in more trouble than she can imagine. All she was doing was heading to town for supplies ... but ... catching the eye of one of the money hunters' spotters, Mel walks into a danger that she didn't realise had been following her all along.  There’s a secret, though. These money hunters aren’t just looking for criminals … they were looking for her. A shifter caught in a race, and she is the prize.",
