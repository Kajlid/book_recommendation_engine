  "description": "\"In the seventh standalone title in the American Novels series, Ellen Finch recalls her time as an assistant to Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, heroes of America's woman suffrage movement, and her friendship with the diminutive Margaret, one of P. T. Barnum's \"eccentrics\" in his circus. When Ellen's infant son is abducted by the Klan to punish her for serving the cause of women, Ellen, Margaret, and the two formidable, if elderly, suffragists must travel aboard Barnum's train from New York to Memphis to rescue the child from death at the fiery cross. American Follies is a savage yet farcical adventure story exploring the roots of America's women's rights movement as well as the depths of our nation's violent and shameful history of prejudice\"--",
