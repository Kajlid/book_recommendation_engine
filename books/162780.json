  "description": "SAS officer Aidan Snow is in charge of training a new Polish unit when he is called to lead the barely-trained men into an operation to foil a bank robbery. Disaster strikes when the criminals blow the convoy to hell, and Snow is left fighting for his life in a car’s wreckage. A green-eyed soldier stands over him and watches what he believes are Snow’s last breaths, but he doesn’t pull the trigger. Ten years on and Snow is teaching in Ukraine, keeping a low profile. But events will force Snow into a life-or-death chase. The green-eyed man, Taurus Pashinski – also known as the Bull – is employed by old military contacts to help smuggle arms and drugs over the border of Ukraine. A young, vengeful ex-solider is drawn into the Bull’s plot when he persuades him that two British investors are his older brother’s killers. The murders will spark a manhunt in Britain and a series of dramatic events in Ukraine which will drag Snow and his friends into deeper and deeper trouble. With crooked intelligence officers, ambitious businessmen and bloodthirsty ex-military, Ukraine rapidly becomes a killing zone. Has Aidan Snow still got what it takes to come out of retirement and face the Bull? What is the Bull really after, and what will he do to get it? Will the ex-SAS soldier be able to defeat his old nemesis before he destroys everything Snow holds dear?",
