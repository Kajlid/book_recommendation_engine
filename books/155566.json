  "description": "Rebecca Reis considers abandoning her career as a novelist until she begins writing about convicted serial killer Thomas Eisenbrey. Nicknamed the Hunter because of his penchant for targeting groups of hunters in the forest, Eisenbrey is the worst kind of psychopath. He is crafty, aloof, at times possessing a charm that is almost hypnotizing, and he’s wheedling his way into her mind. As her interviews with him in the Washington State Penitentiary progress, Rebecca finds herself having feelings for the last man in the world that she should, forcing her to ignore her attraction to the detective who is also vying for her affection. But when the Hunter escapes, she worries—who will he hunt next?",
