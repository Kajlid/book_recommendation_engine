When he’s given the task of finding a dangerous and reclusive shifter, though, he has his work cut out for him. When he finally catches up with his target, he finds that everything he’d been told about the man was a lie.Eric Dansen has spent decades in hiding from his former master, Christophe. Every few years the ancient shifter sends someone else to track Eric and keep tabs on him. This time he sends a human, filling his head with lies in the process.Lies quickly give way to truth, and the pair become close. That only makes things more complicated, though, as now Christophe has an interest in both of them, and he’s not an easy man to dissuade.",
