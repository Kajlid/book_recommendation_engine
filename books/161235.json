  "description": "A Trowchester Blues Novel Billy Wright has a he's only visible when he's wearing a mask. That's fine when he's performing at country fairs with the rest of his morris dancing troupe. But when he takes the paint off, his life is lonely and empty, and he struggles with crippling depression. Martin Deng stands out from the crowd. After all, there aren't that many black Vikings on the living history circuit. But as the founder of a fledgling historical re-enactment society, he's lonely and harried. His boss doesn't like his weekend activities, his warriors seem to expect him to run everything single-handedly, and it's stressful enough being one minority without telling the hard men of his group he's also gay. When Billy's and Martin's societies are double-booked at a packed county show, they know at once they are kindred spirits, united by a deep feeling of connectedness to their history and culture. But they're also both hiding in their different ways, and they need each other to be brave enough to take their masks off and still be seen.",
