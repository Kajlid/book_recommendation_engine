  "description": "An ancient evil is stalking the twin alpha rulers of the were folk and the half-were woman who is destined to be their mate if she lives long enough. First in the Tales of the Were. Fulfilling her mother’s dying wish, Allie climbs a wooded hill just before midnight on Samhain. All Hallows Eve. At the top, she finds an overgrown, magical stone circle, and her destiny. Waiting for her there are twin alpha werewolves who will be her sworn protectors, her mentors and the loves of her life. If she lives long enough. Overprotective is just one word to describe Rafe and Tim. Sexy is most definitely another. But their newfound love and all their skills both mundane and magical will be tested by an ancient evil. A hostile human mage and a misguided vampire hunt them, servants to secret plans of the ancient Venifucus, a society dedicated to destroying women like Allie. They will earn unlikely allies, including a half-fey knight imprisoned Underhill for centuries. But will it be enough to battle the evil that stalks them? Will Allie's men be strong enough to let her aid them in her own defence? Only together can were, fey and vampire defeat this latest threat and learn that love does truly conquer all. Warning, this title contains explicit sex and ménage a trois.",
