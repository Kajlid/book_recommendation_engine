  "description": "Michael's already troubled young life has taken a sudden, dramatic turn. Severely injured, he will need a miracle if he is to survive the night. Reflecting on the evening's horrific events, wondering if could have altered them in any way, his thoughts begin to drift. Soon he is contemplating his life, his family, and the possibility that he may have to answer for his life to God. In recalling some of the most amusing, bizarre, distressing and disturbing times of his life, he comes to understand \"the monster you know is easier to deal with than the monster you don't.\" Will he get the miracle he needs, and make it until morning? If he does make it, will he finally find peace? His life a seemingly endless paradox, Mike has been hardened by suffering many unsettling experiences, yet still views the world through the eyes of an innocent eleven year old. Laugh. Cry. Get angry. Cheer. Reflect.",
