  "description": "The fifth Brothers of Rock novel featuring Chasing Cross finds drummer Rick Saunderst living in a personal hell. After walking away from Chasing Cross in the middle of their tour, he tries everything he can to settle the demons in his soul, but the all night parties, booze, women, and jam sessions cannot silence the voice deep within... Sarah is a small town veterinarian, not quite sure where her life is going. She walks her opinionated dog and lives her life in a simple routine. When a moving truck disrupts her quiet street, she must learn to accept her new neighbor's noisy habits and sexy stare. For the first time ever, booze can't mask his feelings. After over a decade of the rockstar life, Rick finally feels like he has a life off stage. Jamming in a garage with old friends and getting to know Sarah, and her loyal dog, Molly, is his definition of home. The rest of Chasing Cross continue the tour, with help from Fallen Tuesday’s lead singer, Luke, as their replacement drummer. He brings life back to the band, but even still, without Rick, the band feels incomplete. In the final book featuring Chasing Cross, choices will come to a head. Chasing Cross must decide whether to move on without Rick and Rick must settle his own battles, personally and professionally. Falling in love wasn’t part of the deal, but sometimes love happens when a person least expects it.",
