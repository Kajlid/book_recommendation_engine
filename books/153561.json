For a long time Nathan Hayashi had cut himself off from the rest of the world and committed himself to avenging his family's murder. Is a chance encounter with a happy, persistent vampire enough to distract him away from his dubious goals? Nobuhiro Kurosawa has been alone among humans for a long time. All Nobu wants is to convince this silly, stubborn human to stay with him so they can live happily ever after together forever and ever.",
