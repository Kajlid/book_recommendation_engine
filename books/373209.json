Rumors of the dead man's infidelities lead Buddy to a missing female bank teller and a safe deposit box full of dirty money linked to the local mob. As he digs deeper, Buddy discovers the real motive for the murder may stem from a struggle for control of a twenty-year-old videotape of a United States Senator with an underage prostitute.TWO BITS FOUR BITS is a mystery set in the flat dry landscape of West Texas where the horizon is defined by pump jacks and oilfield equipment instead of trees and hills, and blackmail is a game best left to professionals.",
