  "description": "Life on a space station is hard for a Terran, Nenita has adapted as well as she could. A raider strike on her station sends her and her crew to the battle stations as support and she ends up between a psycho and two of her best friends. Only two out of three survive the attack, something which burns in Nenita the whole time she is being tortured and altered to suit her captor’s ideals.With her talent out of control and her refusals getting violent, she is sent into the wilderness to await a selection of raiders and prisoners who have fought for the dubious honour of three days in her bed. Up a tree, she meets her matches, but unless something drastic happens she isn’t going to come down to face the two men who defend her. Will the Oefric win her heart, or just a night in her bed?",
