  "description": "Abandoned by family. Forgotten by friends. Found by three boys and a cat.\"One minute, I’m your average student. The next, I find myself at a magical academy against my will. All because I killed a few people.Let me clear up some points: first of all, I didn’t even know I had magic when my powers went out of control. Second, I object to being here. Third, I don’t like the other students. My one roommate is okay, but the other is a total bitch. Plus I miss my parents. Badly.The only upside is the crusty alley cat that follows me everywhere. And the three cute boys vying for my attention. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had boyfriends before. But never more than one. Seems like the magical world has its own rules.Now, if I could only convince them to break out with me, I’d be a lot happier. Because there are people who want to drain my lightning power. And that would be a pity, after what I went through to get it...\"This is book one of the Second Chance Academy series, a the-more-the-merrier, medium-burn novel with a HFN.",
