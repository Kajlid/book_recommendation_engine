  "title": "Templar, Arizona: The Great Outdoors",
  "description": "\"This is a story about a town that doesn't exist, and the people who live there.This is also the story of a guy trying to find himself, and run away from himself at the same time.Templar isn't a Gotham or a Metropolis. It's not a stand-in for a real town, and I'm pretty sure the spot on the map where I tend to place it is really a national park.It's in Arizona, but not the Arizona you're probably thinking of. This is a different Arizona. This is a slightly irregular Arizona that fell off the back of a truck somewhere, and now all the power outlets are a weird shape and a couple of wars never happened.This comic's been around for a long time, in one form or another. When I was a little kid with crayons and a fistful of printer paper, the town wasn't called Templar, but the main cast was pretty much already set. Most of my time in middle school was spent struggling to draw that cast in poses that weren't three-quarter profile views from the waist-up. And in high school, the comic went through a ridiculous and utterly mandatory phase of angst-ridden pastiche that's probably best left without elaboration.The people of Templar are the heart of the strip, but their home is just as important a character. So while you're reading about Ben, Reagan, Eugene and Scipio, if anything strikes you as odd, try to remember: you're just a tourist. If you didn't feel at least a little out-of-place, you'd probably be disappointed.Thanks.\"-- spike",
