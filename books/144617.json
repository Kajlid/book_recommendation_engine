  "description": "Milo has a pretty good life: nice house, decent job, plenty of time to devote to the movies and games he loves. He also has a hot neighbor, Lewis, who frequently comes by to drag Milo out of his house. If Milo wishes they were more than neighbors, well, he's working on it.Then Lewis asks Milo for advice on how to catch the notice of a geekâ€”a man that is everything Milo is not, a man who turns his life into a living hell and makes it painfully clear that Lewis will never see him as anything but the nerd across the street.Note: This story was initially published in Less Than Three's That Famous Happy End anthology. It has been re-edited and given a new ending.",
