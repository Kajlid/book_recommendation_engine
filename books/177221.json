  "description": "One of the most time-honored cliches states that actions speak louder than words. For Henry and Amina, this phrase became a foundation for their friendship early on and now, eight years after first saying hello, they begin to discover that sometimes, actions can become mundane and words must speak louder than anything.  With their once enviable friendship now on the verge of breaking, Henry and Amina come together on a summer night in New York City: one to create a memory strong enough to let go and the other prepared to fight and rebuild. Unpracticed in the art of using their words, the conversation does not go as well as either had planned and the only thing they both know for sure is that nothing can ever be the same. Now 8,000 miles away from Henry and the life she thought she could out grow, Amina begins to understand the power of what happens when you not only say what you mean, but hear it.  Just Like That is a coming of age story for those who are being told they should have already come of age. The three characters challenge each other, as well as the reader, to distinguish between growing up versus giving in and how to define love as it actually is, rather than how we wish it were.",
