  "description": "BANG! Lights out! Just how would we cope in an event where every electronic device on our planet was rendered useless in an instant? If all electric power, industry, basic utilities, transport and the very communications that we all take for granted were zapped in a single moment, how would life carry on? What skills do we possess to cope with and help us rebuild life from its very foundations? Playing Havoc, partly based on fact, partly a black comedy, describes one small British Island's battle to maintain some normality in the chaos after a coronal mass ejection through the eyes of one man who had only recently moved there with the very intention of getting some peace. A reluctant man with enough problems of his own to deal with finds that the longer the havoc goes on, more and more of the islanders turn to him for help.",
