  "description": "An undercover operative, Reyes is posing as a buyer to bring down an illegal sex-slavery ring operating out of vampire BDSM clubs. His mission—to infiltrate the inner circle and destroy them from the inside out—becomes infinitely more difficult when he recognizes the prize attraction at a slave auction: Angelica, the woman who stole his heart years ago. Against his better judgment, he buys her in order to save her from the club's brutal customers. But now the woman who holds his heart despises him, believing he's one of the human traffickers he's out to destroy. But can he tell his beautiful captive the truth and risk everything?",
