  "description": "\"Cluck The Undercover Chicken\" is a love story.Wait, that isn't it.It's an action adventure filled with thrills, intrigue and danger.Well, it does have that.It has an action hero that kids can look up to.That definitely isn't true, despite what that \"hero\" thinks.Sigh...here's the truth.It's a story about a rooster who can't stand being called a rooster, who also spends his time arguing with the writer of the book, while trying to save his planet (made of a mutated egg shell) from a crazed hen who wants equal rights...as long as she is absolute ruler.And you think you have problems.\"Cluck\" is a book that middle aged-kids (and perhaps some adults) will enjoy. An agent with \"The Eggency\", Cluck is the best at what he does. Sadly, his ego is as massive as his skills.Besides being blinded by his arrogance, Cluck is helped along by \"ST\", the writer of his adventures and a voice only he can hear. While this causes some to question his sanity, together they make an uneasy, but successful partnership. When a hen named \"The Fan\" (named because she has a deadly hand fan with her at all times) forms a worldwide cult in order to take over the planet, it's up to Cluck to toss a feather in her plans...if his ego doesn't trip him up first.Written for the young with laughs built in for all, \"Cluck\" is a book meant to be an unique reading experience; a quick read that you will remember for a long time.",
