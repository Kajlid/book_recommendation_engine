  "title": "The Journal",
  "description": "When Mary gave a journal to her fianc√© in 1861 before he left for war, neither of them had any idea how many hands would write in it over the next four years. The little book travels back and forth across enemy lines and almost takes on a personality of its own as the new owners read what others have written and add their own reflections. The Journal covers some of the major battles of the Civil War from a personal point of view. Each soldier who writes in the journal is in a different place in his relationship with God, and each draws strength and help from what others have written.",
