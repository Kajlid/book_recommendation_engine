  "title": "Labor of Love: The Story of One Man's Extraordinary Pregnancy",
  "description": "Thomas Beatie electrified the world in April 2008 with his announcement that he was seven months pregnant and due to give birth in July. The news made headlines across the globe, but it's only one chapter in a fascinating saga. Labor of Love reveals Beatie's unique life experiences; his less-than-idyllic childhood in Hawaii, his feelings of being a young man trapped in the body of a woman, his fight to conceive a child, and the obstacles surrounding the delivery. This astonishing narrative permits an intimate look at a family that refuses to let other people's definitions of family deter them from creating one on their own terms. Labor of Love is much more than the story of a unique pregnancy and birth; it's a beautiful and controversial love story about going against the tide, a powerful statement about the evolution of family and identity in the new millennium.",
