  "description": "Meet the Wongs, Shengs and Tsuis. Each of these families has its own troubles and secrets — and something the other two want. But the three clans — whose members include a matriarch who talks to dead relatives; her nymphomaniac granddaughter; an old man who reads only decades-old newspapers; and a street punk — share a past and face a common future. Told in a sequence of interwoven stories, Troublemaker “refracts classic old-vs.-new-world tensions through the prism of second-generation Chinese-American Gen-Xers.” ( Time ) Nominated for the Stephen Crane First Fiction Award",
