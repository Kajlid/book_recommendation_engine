  "description": "This book is a lovely little reminder that a serious illness does not have to be taken entirely seriously. Yes, there will be moments when ‘laughing in the aisles’ is inappropriate - when an injection is being administered, for example, or during the funeral - but much of the time illness can be funny and we will all feel better for laughing at it. I’ve nursed both my Mum and Dad and we always tried to keep enjoying ourselves. When my Dad had really forgotten everything, my Mum and I saw the funny side of it, and laughter, which had always been central in our family life, kept its place at the table.Richard Curtis (conedy writer)The quality of empathy, defined in the Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary as ‘the ability to understand and share the feelings of another’, is key to the doctor-patient relationship. However, unless you have gone through the experience of being diagnosed and coming to terms with Parkinson’s yourself, your personal understanding will be limited. Health professionals and all those involved with the care of people with Parkinson’s will therefore benefit tremendously from this book, which is at times hilarious, quirky and moving.Dr Michelle Who (University of Oxford)",
