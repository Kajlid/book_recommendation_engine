  "description": "He’s a newly patched member of the Fugitives, a man with a tortured past who has given up everything he’s ever known to be part of the club. She’s the mayor’s daughter, a pampered girl who has lived her life in a gilded cage. She longs for a real man – one who knows how to answer the longing deep inside her. When the two of them meet, both of their worlds do everything possible to stop the sparks between them. Can two people who are so different in every way find love in each other’s arms? Or will the collision course they are on tear them apart? This 32,000 word novella is a completely stand-alone story. It contains explicit language and graphic adult content, including wild and steamy sex between a sheltered young woman and a bad boy outlaw biker.",
