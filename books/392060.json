Ardyn Halter explores the legacy of his late father Roman Halter’s experiences of the Holocaust. What is received by the “Second Generation” and how can it be expressed in language or art? A journey to Rwanda to complete a commission to commemorate the Rwandan genocide, and a journey to Poland. The Fire and the Bonfire reveals a close - though also difficult - father-son relationship and explores genocide through art, which leads to unexpected discoveries.",
