  "description": "What happens when two cousins walk the earth looking for their true love? It is never wise to piss off a goddess, especially a flame haired Irish goddess. That was something cousins Ciaran and Connor found out the hard way. For one night of folly the cousins must walk the earth, deprived of the thing that caused their downfall-women, until they find their perfect mate. Just when they think they will never find their mates, the Luck of the Irish smiles upon them. Both end up in the United States, one in Chicago and the other in San Diego. The two cousins get the shock of their lives when they met the women meant to be theirs, both are strong women with chocolate colored skin, tempting their sweet tooth. Will they be able to keep these women for their own or just have a taste of ecstasy to tease them rest of their immortal lives?",
