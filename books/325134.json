  "description": "All he wanted was to live a quiet life.Work, some cold beers, sleep. Repeat. Sure, it sounded damn boring. But the last thing Sav needed was excitement in his life.Been there, done that.Only problem was that his next-door neighbor seemed determined to bring trouble into his life, whether or not he wanted it.There was nothing quiet or peaceful about Livvy Carlson. She was a mess. Caring for her three young nephews wasn't a walk in the park. Add in her job, her studies, and a work colleague who didn't understand the word no, and yeah . . . she could really use some help.Who'd have thought that help would come from the sexy, tattooed, grumpy biker next door?The one who kept bossing her around, threatening to put her over his knee, and who frequented her dreams?The sexy kind.The last thing Livvy needed was to make her life more complicated. But every time Sav spoke to her in that commanding voice, she found herself wanting to kneel at his feet and call him Daddy.Maybe she should. Because if she let out her deepest desires, then she was bound to send him running . . .Right?",
