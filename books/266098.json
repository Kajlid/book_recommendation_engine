  "title": "The Emerald Tablet Of Hermes & The Kybalion: Two Classic Books on Hermetic Philosophy",
  "description": "The Emerald Tablet of Hermes first appeared in the Alchemical Libraries of Europe during the 12th Century. Traveling home with the Crusaders, this seminal work is alleged to be written by Hermes Trismegistus-Thoth. The work deeply influenced Western Magick, and the tenets presented influence modern magick to this day. The Kybalion was first published by The Yogi Publication Society of the Masonic Temple in Chicago in 1912. The authors of The Kybalion chose to remain anonymous, because the principles and philosophy are a summation of theTimeless Wisdom and Truth of the Hemetic Philosophy.",
