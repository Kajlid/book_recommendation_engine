Now, after eight years of neglect and loneliness, he cant think of a reason to stay. The promise of a new beginning beckons, and with bags packed, Christian embarks on what he anticipates will be an uneventful road trip to Canada and freedom from his pain. But in a twist of fate, his plans take a drastic detour in the form of a beautiful and frightened girl. Scarlett, a British teenager, suddenly appears in his life and shes in trouble. Blind since birth, Scarlett Becket has virtually been abandoned. Following her completion of school, Scarlett's world is shattered the night she's abducted from her temporary London flat. Unable to see her kidnappers, she is uncertain as to who they are or why they chose her. What she does know is that in a series of vivid dreams, much like those she has had before, she has foreseen a grisly murder and this time, shes the victim. Scarlett's narrow escape and encounter with Christian has provided her a temporary refuge, but its only a matter of time before her captors pick up her trail. Determined to protect Scarlett, whatever the price, Christian embarks on a dangerous course as he fights to keep her alive. And in entering the twisted maze of betrayal and redemption, he quickly realizes that life looks different when you may not live to see tomorrow.",
