  "description": "The Named believe that they are the only cats who can think and speak, so they are shocked and intrigued to discover a mammoth-hunting tribe of cats who also speak. The other tribe, united in a kind of group mind, is so different that understanding them appears impossible, and conflict threatens. Should Ratha increase her efforts to talk to these strange cats, or should she destroy them with the Red Tongue so the Named can take their mammoths? Ratha’s daughter Thistle-chaser, has strange gifts that could lead to a solution, but she can’t do it alone. Mother and daughter must challenge the darkness of their shared past before they can work together.",
