  "title": "The Thin Wall",
  "description": "Young, innocent college freshman Laleana O'Reilly, disenchanted with societal norms, decides that she needs a new philosophy. One dreary late night in the college library, she discovers the Marquis deSade and Julian, and through an unbridled act of passion, her innocence and naivet√© were no more. The Thin Wall is a story of codependence, love, obsession, and the unadulterated surrender of one's body, mind, and soul. It's a story of trust and friendship. Laleana's struggle is one of faith, she teaches us that to accept and submit to one's desire is to receive bountiful pleasure, but to deny the need to be loved and accepted is to endure suffering beyond measure. Will Laleana have the strength to release herself from her bonds and find the love she seeks?",
