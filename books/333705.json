  "description": "Memory loss can be a blessing or a curse... I just haven't decided which.Fifteen years ago I awoke in a hospital with no memories except for my name, Elin, and the urge to run. Since then its been a different city, a different job every year as I try to find those missing pieces. That is until I arrive in Bi Frost. A small town in Manitoba. For the first, I feel the urge to settle down.Or maybe it's my new neighbours, Arran and Hurrit, owners of a charter service for hunters and fishermen, that trigger that need. Goddess knows they trigger me in other places as well. They vow to help me. To make me whole. But with secrets of their own, I find it hard to trust them.When the storm of the century happens, we discover that the phrase \"act of God\" was never truer.If we're to have any hope of defeating this foe, we'll have to join forces, share secrets. But when the dust settles, will the relationship we forge survive?Valkyries Rising is a #WhyChoose series where the heroine doesn’t have to pick just one mate. In these pages you'll find strong heroines who don’t back down, and the shifters, gods, dragons, and other immortals who love them and fight by their sides.",
