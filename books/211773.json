  "description": "Women in SpecOps? Never… until he sleeps with the most lethal woman in the world.  Alex Wolf would never believe that women could handle Special Operations, especially someone like Kat with her soft skin, feminine curves and party-girl attitude. When he discovers her real job, he wants to protect her from the terrorists who would kill her, and make her his forever.  Katlin Callahan spends weeks, sometimes months, hunting the most dangerous men on earth as the covert Ladies of Black Swan team leader. Between missions, the only man she wants in her bed makes her heart pound and her body zing. Losing her heart, and focus, could get them both killed.  Unrelenting Love is the first book in KaLyn Cooper’s Black Swan series. Each romantic suspense features one of five, active duty women secretly trained in SpecOps. If you like the action-packed stories of Susan Stoker, Gennita Low and Sharon Hamilton, you’ll love this series.",
