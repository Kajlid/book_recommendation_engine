She thinks I’m blinded by her growing belly, but her hesitation about us only challenges me to prove her wrong. And if she takes a chance on me, I can’t let her down. That’s the last thing I can do. Because I’m beginning to feel that Kelsey and me… we may just be something more…\nThis friends (with benefits)-to-lovers, surprise-baby romance is the second standalone book in the small town Blisswood Brothers series that follows the brothers as they run their family winery and farm, Olive Owl.",
