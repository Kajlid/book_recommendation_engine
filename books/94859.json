A life of callous disregard has made her hard, but as she battles the princess’ will for the first time and finds new allies and friends, does she have what it takes to win the love and favour of the brutal warlord?

Or will her station in life yet again be her undoing?Caution: The Warlord’s Concubine is a dark fantasy novel that contains explicit scenes, and a twisted romance between a handmaiden and a God.",
