  "description": "Plucked from the slush pile, 19 year old Amelia Harkins rises instantly to fame and the top of The New York Times Best Sellers list. Dropping out of college to pursue a full-time writing career, Amelia spends the next 17 years as America’s reigning Queen of Romance, fulfilling her fans’ every desire as she pens one steamy novel after another. But when Amelia suddenly realizes she’s outgrown her muse and fictional other half, a buxom blonde named Hillary Hart, she begins to question her own identity. In Year of the Snake, Amelia embarks on a year-long journey of self-discovery and, in the process, learns what it’s like to truly fall in love. In her seventh novel, author Melissa Luznicky Garrett proves her own growing versatility as a writer. With madcap plot twists and delightful surprises,Year of the Snake wraps the reader tightly around Amelia, Mason and Desmond and keeps one guessing about who will be Amelia's ultimate choice. A light romantic read, it's impossible not to look more closely at our own lives to discover what stories are inside us that are just waiting to be written. Melissa M.
