  "description": "Slam is a bright and acerbic depiction of the slacker culture of Texas, a testament to a lost and found generation. Dave stepped out of a Bastrop Federal Prison and into the home of one Margueritte Johnson, aka the Old Lady. The Old Lady passed on and left behind her house and twenty-three cats. The cats need a caretaker or so he thinks. There are others with an eye on the Johnson estate, and soon dave is caught up in a whirlwind of anarchists, golddiggers, skateboard punks, lawyers, hackers and arsonists--a population of dropouts and misfits who will do anything to avoid doing anything.",
