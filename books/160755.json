  "description": "In Cem Anahuac, the ancient world of the Toltecs, the gods are at war, and they fight their battles through the lives of men. Tonalnan is brought into this world amidst suffering and slavery. Through a twist of fate, she grows to become an ambitious Toltec noblewoman in a patriarchal society. Meanwhile, in a distant corner of Cem Anahuac, the child prince Ce Acatl Topiltzin is favored by Quetzalcoatl, the god. Ce Acatl triumphs over the Queen of Ignorance, a monstrous four-headed serpent, and in time, becomes the priest-king of the Toltecs at Tula. Ce Acatl is vehemently opposed to human sacrifice. Enemy forces loom in the distance, as the Chichimeca, a fierce band of nomads led by a malicious sorcerer, plan to destroy the Toltecs and claim the city as their own, but Tohuenyo, a Chichimeca warrior, thwarts his tribe’s sinister plans. As time passes, the benevolent king Ce Acatl builds a mighty empire, but at prosperity’s zenith he angers the gods through hubris, and they curse his house by withholding their bounty. Devastation and calamity ensue. Seizing the opportunity, the dark lord Tezcatlipoca descends from the Heavens on a spider thread to destroy Quetzalcoatl’s people so that he, Tezcatlipoca, will become their favored god and king. Will the ancient Toltecs triumph over the dark forces that threaten their survival? Find out when you read The Last Toltec King. Learn the origins of the ancient Mexicans and their pantheon of gods, discover the difference between Quetzalcoatl the god and Quetzalcoatl the man, and understand the legend of his return.",
