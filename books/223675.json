  "description": "Being drafted into the biggest professional hockey league put me on top of the world.  Losing both of my parents in a tragic accident ripped that world apart.  And I'd fallen hard for tomboy Emmy Sullinger, the girl who'd put me back together again.  The problem is that the story doesn't end there—it's just getting started. Because Emmy, the girl I'm completely crazy about, is my best friend Sully's little sister.  Sully's not only my best friend, he's also my teammate—and there are lines you just don't cross. Going after your best friend's sister is one of them.  So I've kept my feelings—and my hands—to myself for the last three years. After all, making a play for her would result in the biggest penalty I could ever take.  With Emmy away and attending University in New York City, being tempted by her hasn't been an issue. But when she comes home to Toronto for summer vacation looking sexy as hell—and suggests we hook up?  Damn.  I just know I'm going to end up in the penalty box…",
