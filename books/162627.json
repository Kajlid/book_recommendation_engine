  "description": "No scenes in Shakespeare's plays are as intimately homoerotic to imagine as the scenes in Cymbeline in which the two brothers fall head over heals in love with the main character, who would have been a male actor playing the part of a girl disguised as a boy. It is while the brothers think the person is a boy that they fall in love with... him. Cymbeline also contains one of the best songs in all of Shakespeare. It begins like this: \"Fear no more the heat o' the sun, / Nor the furious winter's rages; / Thou thy worldly task hast done, / Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages; / Golden lads and girls all must, / As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.\"",
