  "description": "The rules of the contest were simple.Design a new logo for Morgan Financial Holdings, wow the judges with my mad skills, and bam. I get the job.Easy, right?Nope.I didn’t account for the annoyingly gorgeous Easton Roman, strolling late into orientation like he’s God’s gift to women.Puh-lease.Acting as if already crowned champion, the jerk had the nerve to flirt with me!(insert multiple expletives)He may have everyone fooled, but I see him for exactly what he is.Temptation.Easton can do whatever he wants to steer me from my eventual victory, but two can play at that game. If I have to flirt back, I will. If he wants to kiss me, bring it on.At some point in the game, it became real; our connection grew.I thought when the judges selected the winner, it would end us. But what really shattered our relationship was something neither of us saw coming.",
