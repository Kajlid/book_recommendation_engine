The cat-and-mouse game between Ellen and Leo lights up these pages, their flirtation as dangerously addictive as a high-speed car chase' PeopleIf you can't forget the one who got away, can you truly love the one you're with?Ellen and Andy's first year of marriage doesn't just seem perfect, it IS perfect. There is no question how deep their devotion is, and how naturally they bring out the best in each other. Then, one fateful afternoon, Ellen runs into Leo for the first time in eight years. Leo, the one who brought out the worst in her. Leo, the one who left her heartbroken with no explanation. Leo, the one she could never quite forget. When his reappearance ignites long-dormant emotions, Ellen begins to question whether the life she's living is the one she's meant to live. LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITH is a powerful story about one woman at the crossroads of true love and real life.",
