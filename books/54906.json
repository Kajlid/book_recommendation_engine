  "description": "On February 19, 1995, Dr. Alan Keyes' fiery speech at the Annual State Republican Dinner in New Hampshire drew repeated, thunderous ovations. Three days later, his impassioned appeal for moral courage was broadcast on 'Focus on the Family, ' igniting the hearts of listeners across America and generating a landslide of requests for re-airing. From the famed Republican Dinner speech to his various columns and essays, Dr. Keyes has been an articulate and passionate spokesman for faith, convictions of a man zealous enough to resist the tug of political convenience and courageous enough to insist that moral issues take center-stage in the political debate. Alan Keyes pierces through the ethical haze of our time and calls us to stand up for the truth, knowing that 'you cannot have the right to do wrong.",
