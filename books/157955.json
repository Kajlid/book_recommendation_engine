Enjoy their story from Nate's point of view.This is a stand-alone book, but much more fun when read along with The Juliette Trilogy.Author Motivation:All the princess books are coming of age stories. The main character progresses from college to becoming an adult. Overcoming an imbedded belief or coming to terms with adult issues is not always easy or pretty to watch. If I've done my job well as an author, there will be times when you yell at my protagonist to grow up, get their head out of their butt, or to stop worrying so much. Hopefully, by the end of each book, you will cheer the protagonist as they grow, change, and mature into an adult.Of course these are all romance novels, so the center of each story is the protagonist as they embrace their wonderful partner.",
