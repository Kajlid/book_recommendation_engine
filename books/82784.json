  "title": "Ghosts of Ophidian",
  "description": "An enormous three-mile long ship has just entered the Earth's orbit and it's doing absolutely nothing... except instilling fear and speculation upon the citizens below. After a few weeks, NASA gets a boarding party together to attempt to gain entry into the giant craft. Once inside the ship, they will discover over a million creatures on ice. They will also discover the reason that the ship hasn't been doing anything beyond maintaining an orbit above the Earth - it appears that the ship has been sabotaged by whatever used to exist in three of the empty cryogenic chambers. Their investigation leads to a lot more than a potential alien invasion. Nothing is as it seems and pretty soon, the two remaining astronauts aren't sure who they should trust anymore.The next book in the Ghosts of Ophidian universe \"Alastair\" is available now with much more to come in 2013.",
