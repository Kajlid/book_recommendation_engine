  "title": "Unveiled: Voices of Women in Afghanistan",
  "description": "A stunning journey, in striking photographic images and intimate personal stories, through the world of women in Afghanistan before, during and after the Taliban, with photographs taken by award-winning photographer Harriet Logan. This book seeks to tell the personal stories, through photographs and short anecdotes, of several women in Afghanistan who spent years depersonalised behind their veils. In 1997, Harriet Logan went to Afghanistan and met a phenomenal group of women with strong personalities and great dreams for their lives. Despite the peril to her life and theirs, she photographed them. From November to December 2001, Logan returned to Afghanistan to find these women again, and to learn how their situation had evolved since the first time she met them, under the repressive rule of the Taliban. In so doing, Harriet also met more outstanding women, and recorded the womens' existing doubts and enduring hopes for a better future.",
