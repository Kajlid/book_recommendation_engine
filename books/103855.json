  "description": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E5S41OEThe Lord has not only truly blessed you with a brilliant mind, but also has given you the ability to create success in all areas of your life by using the unique mind He gave you.To often we find ourselves constantly in bad relationships, having stress at work, and getting down on ourselves about the tough situations that come in our lives. We must realize that the reality in our lives at this very moment is a product of the thoughts that we entertain in our mind.God desires that we live a blessed and happy life on this Earth before we spend eternity with Him. Our enemy, Satan, desires that we have a miserable life while here on earth. Satan comes to steal, kill, and destroy while God wants to give us abundant life (John 10:10).The mind is the battlefield where you either allow God's Word to cause us to live happy and blessed, or we give Satan the opportunity to plant the idea of sorrow and defeat in our lives.In this book you will:* Learn how brilliant the human mind really is.* Learn how to unlock the true potential of your mind to release blessings in your life.* See exactly how Satan tries deceives us each and every day, and more importantly how to stop him from doing so.* See examples in the Bible of how great inventions and even wealth was unlocked just by using the natural brilliance we all have in our minds.* Ultimately learn how to win the ongoing spiritual war for your mind.This book is full of biblical examples and even personal experiences of mine to give you the tools you need to live victoriously through Jesus Christ.I pray this book is a blessing to you and your family.",
