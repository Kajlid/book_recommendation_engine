  "description": "With the mystery of the monsters and the Shadowscape growing deeper every day, Gryff and his friends have been split up by Headmaster Sleet and sent to the far corners of the world with one mission: find some ancient ciphers that could end this war once and for all.  Sounds easy enough, right?  Well, it would be except for the rifts that keep opening up on top of them, the mercenaries that want them dead, and, oh yeah, a murderous, monster angel that is seeking to bring about the end of the world as Gryff knows it.",
