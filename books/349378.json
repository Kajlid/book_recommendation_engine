  "description": "For passionate lawyer Rachel Stanislaski, work is her life. Assigned to watch over teenage delinquent Nicholas LeBeck, the last thing Rachel needs is Nick’s hot-headed stepbrother storming into her courtroom. Zack Muldoon is protective and stubborn, but whether he likes it or not, he needs Rachel’s help—both to keep Nick out of trouble and to reconnect with his younger brother. Rachel knows the importance of a family bond, but she hasn’t considered what excitement—or complications—a blossoming romance could add to their agreement. But Zack and Rachel’s chemistry is hard to ignore, and the two could be falling for each other faster than they realize.",
