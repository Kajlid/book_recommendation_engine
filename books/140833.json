  "description": "Stinger, a member of the Grizzly MC, leads a life that is dangerous and violent. When The Brothers of Menace, an MC in the next town over, ask the Grizzlies for help, they don’t hesitate to step-up. They are asked to help transport abused prostitutes to a safe house. It’s easy enough, except Stinger sees Molly Clark, a nurse for the battered women, and instantly knows she will be his.  As a former old lady to Malice from The Brothers of Menace MC, Molly knows what is involved with being linked to an outlaw club. When Stinger, a bear shifting biker, makes it clear that she is his, Molly should run the other way. But she doesn’t, and instead finds herself wanting much more with the hardened outlaw.  When Malice tries to say Molly is still his, Stinger shows him what it means to go up against a Grizzly.",
