  "title": "Don't Read This Book If You're Stupid",
  "description": "In his first book of short stories, Tibor Fischer examines the lives of loners and failures. With both wit and sobriety, he depicts the trials of a Web site salesman who cannot connect with others, an artist whose career is going nowhere, a failed cowboy, a has-been solicitor, and a stand-up comedienne who has fallen from grace. Laced with exuberant narrative and matchless comic invention, \"I Like Being Killed \"reveals the struggle of intelligence to make sense of our modern world.",
