  "description": "Blind golfing, anyone? Edward Bogard Bogie for short may be blind, but he can learn just about anything he sets his mind to: riding a bike, parasailing, playing guitar. Even though many things come easily to him, he stunned when he hits at a driving range and finds he has the swing of a pro. But blind golfing is a team sport, and Bogie needs a coach. Enter Birdie, the kooky and mysterious girl next door. A bit of a loner, Birdie creates elaborate worlds in miniature in her basement, and has managed to make it to age twelve without learning to ride a bike. Then someone anonymously enters Bogie in a golf tournament-with a million dollar prize. If he can team up with Birdie to conquer the greens of Hawai'i, could she be the unlikely key to victory? \"Gutman has another winner here...younger YAs and reluctant readers will enjoy this suspenseful and often funny tale.\"--KLIATT\"[A]n excellent picture of a loving father-son relationship. Highly recommended.--Children's Literature",
