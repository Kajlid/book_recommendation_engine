Gina Rosavin hooked me from the first page of the book and never let me go until the end. I was totally entertained by the by the see-saw motion of Adrian and Katerina relationship. The Taste of Magic is full of wonderful characters that are not what they seem on the surface, a wonderful plot. The story is full of action, intrigue, laughs and very hot sex scenes.The Romance 5 StarsGina Rosavin pens a well-crafted story that this reader thoroughly enjoyed. The dialogue is excellent, the passion intense, and the characters remarkably fashioned. With powerful wizards, vampires, and witches spells, this enchanting tale has about everything to please the reader. Bravo to Ms. Rosavin for an extraordinary read.”",
