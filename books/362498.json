From this first sentence onwards, Josef K. is on trial for his right to exist in a novel which, more that any other, is infinitely perceptiveabout the nature of terror. Idris Parry introduces his remarkable translation with an essay in which he points to the autobiographical elements in The Trial, in particular Kafka's broken engagement to Felice Bauer.It is the fate and perhaps the greatness of that work that it offers everything and confirms nothing - Albert CamusCover image: Sarah McGibbon",
