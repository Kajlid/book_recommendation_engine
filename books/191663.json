  "title": "Come Away: Song of Songs--A Novel",
  "description": "Nestled between two of the most formidable voices of the Old Testament, Ecclesiastes and Isaih, is one short book which has disturbed clergy and baffled religious scholars for over two thousand years. The Song of Solomon, also called the Song of Songs, is an erotic love poem. So what is it doing there? Painstakingly researched, the two story lines call out to each other like the lovers in the Song of Songs, suggesting startling truths about the genesis of the Bible, our concept of God, and of love itself.",
