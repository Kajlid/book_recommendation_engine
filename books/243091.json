  "title": "Rome's Chance",
  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today bestselling author Joanna Wylde comes a new story in her Reapers MC series…  Rome McGuire knew he was in trouble the first time he saw her.  She was sweet and pretty and just about perfect in every way. She was also too young and innocent for the Reapers Motorcycle Club. He did the right thing, and walked away.  The second time, he couldn’t resist tasting her.  Gorgeous and smart, fun and full of wonder, she jumped on his bike and would’ve followed him anywhere. Still, she deserved a shot at happiness somewhere bigger and better than a town like Hallies Falls. Walking away wasn’t so easy that time, but her family needed her and he had a job to do.  When she came around a third time, he’d had enough. Randi Whittaker had been given two chances to escape, and now it was time for Rome to take his.  This time, the only way Randi would be leaving Hallies Falls was on the back of Rome’s bike.  **Every 1001 Dark Nights novella is a standalone story. For new readers, it’s an introduction to an author’s world. And for fans, it’s a bonus book in the author’s series. We hope you'll enjoy each one as much as we do.**",
