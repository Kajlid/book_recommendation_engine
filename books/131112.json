  "title": "Coyote: North America's Dog",
  "description": "From the Arctic Circle to Costa Rica, from Maine to the tip of Baja California, the coyote thrives like no other animal in North America. It roams the Canadian wilderness and prowls the Arizona deserts and beyond. This highly intelligent animal has learned to adapt to big cities such as Los Angeles. It has even been sighted in Bronx, New York. In this fascinating Parents' Choice Award book, Steve Swinburne draws the reader into the secretive world of the coyote. His balanced and thought-provoking text, illustrated with dramatic full-color photographs, examines how the coyote behaves and survives. He considers the past and present history of the coyote and what the future may hold in store for North America's native dog.",
