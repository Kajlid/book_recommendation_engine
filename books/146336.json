Silas's troubled past—full of secrets he and his team thought they'd buried—comes back to haunt him, threatening to ruin everything. Silas tries to deal, but guilt weighs heavily on him and Sang realizes she might be the only one who can help him keep it together.  Bomb threats have increased. They are followed at every turn. The principal is resorting to drastic measures to make sure they're all going to be kicked out. Pushed to their limits, Kota, Victor, Silas, Nathan, Gabriel, Luke and North, along with other members of the Academy, have finally had enough. This time, more Academy members are brought in to help hunt down the culprit, and keep everyone safe. It'll cost the boys, but in the end, even a bittersweet victory is better than disaster. This time, they're getting what they need. All it takes is learning the line of when to let go, and when to never give up The Academy, Together",
