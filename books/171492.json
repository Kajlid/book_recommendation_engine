  "description": "Robin Hood, hidden deep in the Sherwood Forest, is fighting to restore England to its rightful king, surrounded by faithful men, green leaves and clear skies. And yet for the first time he isn’t satisfied with his lot in life. The reason, a red-headed maiden who saved him, more than a year ago, from certain death. Robin has exhausted himself looking for her with no hope of finding her alive, when he meets a slender youth who surprises him, little knowing that both their lives will be irrevocably changed.  Rosa Fitzwalter, the Sheriff’s daughter and kinswoman to the King, lives in the grand castle in Nottinghamshire, trying to obey her father’s wishes and to make him happy. What the mighty Sheriff doesn’t know, however, is her closely-kept secret: she is leading a double life, sneaking out to the forest dressed as a boy, to inform the outlaws of his plans to destroy them.  Then Robin finds the boy who came to warn him in his forest. Two worlds collide, resulting in unimaginable danger and intense romance. Maybe, just maybe, they can be each other’s salvation. But what if fate has other plans? What if their fearsome enemies finally succeed in tearing them apart forever?  Filled with adventure, intrigue and wild romance, this is a Robin Hood story unlike any you have ever read before!",
