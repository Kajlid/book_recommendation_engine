  "description": "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle AwardBlack Zodiac offers poems suffused with spiritual longingâ€”lyrical meditations on faith, religion, heritage, and morality. The poems also explore aging and mortality with restless grace. Approaching his vast subjects by way of small moments, Wright magnifies details to reveal truths much larger than the quotidian happenings that engendered them. His is an astonishing, flexible, domestic-yet-universal verse. As the critic Helen Vendler has observed, Wright is a poet who \"sounds like nobody else.\"",
