  "description": "They say that the apple doesn't fall from the tree. That the sins of our fathers and mothers always comes back to their children, completing a full circle. Karma. Was something I was skeptical about and yet here I am wondering if I will have a better fate than my mother ever did. I'm vivacious and quite the vindictive spirited woman. I also once vowed never to bow down to a man... until Dimitris Kosta came along breaking every barrier I had surrounded myself until I was stripped, bare-faced and exposed. He saw my beauty, my ugliness and the black heart I carried heavily inside me. I expected him to run yet he did the opposite. You see, this beautiful Greek man fell for me and yet I intentionally scarred him and broke his heart into smithereens. And even though I had mended and nurtured his heart, the fact remained the same... That I was still my mother's daughter.",
