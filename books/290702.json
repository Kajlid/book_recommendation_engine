  "title": "The Adventures of Danny Meadow Mouse",
  "description": "A plump little meadow mouse is always an inviting target for hungry hunters in the Green Meadows. This certainly should give Danny Meadow Mouse enough cause for concern; but lately, he's been worrying about something else â€” his short tail! In fact, he wants so much to have a different tail that he almost forgets to take care of the one he has.Danny spends much of his time avoiding the likes of Hooty the Owl, who drifts effortlessly above him in the open air; Reddy Fox and old Granny Fox, who stalk him as he races through snow tunnels; Mr. Blacksnake, who silently slithers after him through the grass; and other pesky predators.Youngsters will enjoy reading and listening to the adventures of the plucky vole and his friends as they explore Farmer Brown's orchard, the Old Briar-patch, and the enchanting world of the Green Forest. The text has been completely reset in large, easy-to-read type and Thea Kliros has adapted six black-and-white illustrations from the originals by Harrison Cady.",
