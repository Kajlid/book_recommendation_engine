  "description": "It's not easy being me...  My name is Elias Brook. Ask anyone, and they'll tell you all about me. That I am a liar, a coward, and a thief. That I betrayed and murdered my king, stole his money, and sent his heirs into hiding. That I ignited a power struggle that scarred the entire kingdom with years of endless war. That I triggered the worst famine the country had ever seen, and stated a new age of chaos, angry ghosts, and black magic. That I single-handedly created five years of living hell for every soul in the kingdom of Yivyn, and that I am the most hated man in the entire world who anyone would harm or kill if they could get their hands on me.  Seems a tad unfair, don't you think? Especially since only the first bit and that last bit are actually true. I am a liar, coward, and thief, and I am certainly the most reviled man in Yivyn if not the world. The first part I can live with, while the second makes living challenging, but it's nothing I can't handle.  Or so I thought until I was killed. And then things got really difficult.  An Exciting Debut Fantasy Novel",
