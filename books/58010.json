At a country inn she fortunately encounters Cleve Redmayne--her purse has been stolen. He pays her bills and gives her a seat in his travelling coach. Handsome and rich, he has just returned from India and is determined to marry the beautiful Corinna Mayfield, though he only saw her once years ago. Cleve learns of Elyza's problems and that she knows Corinna, so he arranges her return to London and from there to Brighton, where he plans to establish himself.At Brighton, he acquires a mansion and is taken up by the Prince Regent. Elyza joins the glittering social world of Brighton, which is dominated by the fantastic Royal Pavilion parties, and introduces Cleve to Corinna. Elyza blossoms and acquires a circle of admirers. Cleve gives a magnificent ball, but a wicked Marquis, also pursuing Corinna, plots his downfall. There is a Great Curricle Race, at which Elyza commits an indiscretion. Blackmail follows.After a duel, a kidnapping, and a hectic road race, people and proposals are happily disentangled. Particularly fascinating characters, especially charming Elyza and the unusual Cleve, all go to make a Regency romance of true distinction.",
