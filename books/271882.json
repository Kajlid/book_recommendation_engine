  "description": "He's a passionately driven attorney. She longs for a simple life of service. But their greatest temptation is each other.  Wolf shifter Hector Thayer is a top lawyer at his small firm in Tarker’s Hollow. A driven and passionate man, Hector has nearby family, good friends, and pro bono work to keep his every moment occupied. But when Hector meets his mate, it begins to feel like the rest of his carefully curated life was all just an elaborate holding pattern. Smart, funny Mei makes Hector and his inner wolf lose control. If he can convince her to accept his role in the pack he might find the happiness he’s always longed for.  Mei Cohen is lost in lust with Hector Thayer. But he’s dangerous - a wolf shifter and a heartless attorney - the opposite of the person philanthropist Mei wants to spend her life with. If only she could convince her libido he’s not the one for her. The crazy things he does to her body keep her crawling back for more, even when she most wants to let go.  When a mysterious stalker comes after Mei in the home where she is staying, Hector is desperate to stake his claim. And though Mei has never relied on a man to protect her, she allows Hector to get closer than she ever meant to...   Experience Required.   If you like wolves, magic, strong women, and alphas with experience, you’re going to love Seasoned Shifters, set in the steamy shifter world of Tarker’s Hollow.
