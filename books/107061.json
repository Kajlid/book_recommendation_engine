  "description": "Mercy Holland is sure of two things. One – that Noah Ivory is sex on legs. And two – that he doesn't remember her or the night of passion they spent together four years ago before his band, Jagged Ivory, signed their record deal. But when her father, who just happens to be the band's manager, gives her the opportunity to travel with them on tour, Mercy can't help but hope that she and the sexy lead guitarist can reignite an old, smoldering flame. Playing lead guitar for one of the hottest rock bands in the world has its perks, and Noah Ivory has no trouble taking full advantage of it. He has his pick of the many gorgeous young girls that fall at his feet night after night. But when Jagged Ivory's manager brings his beautiful and sassy daughter along on the European leg of their world tour, the guitar god is suddenly thrown for a loop as the memories of their steamy one night stand come crashing back to him. Now, all sorts of questions are running through his head. Like how can he apologize for the way he treated her back then? How can he tell her that she hasn't been far from his thoughts since that night? How can he pursue her with her father watching his every move? And most importantly, how can he keep her from falling for his brother? If you're a fan of rock star romances, you will love the boys of Jagged Ivory!",
