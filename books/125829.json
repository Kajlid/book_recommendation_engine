  "description": "Luke Bennett is on his own at the cattle auction in Denver, Colorado, and the responsibility for buying Hereford bulls to upgrade the cattle herds of the family ranch sits heavy on his shoulders. Even so, the sight of four men bullying a young woman near the stock pens changes his focus from evaluating cattle to helping Miss Theadora Pierce, who stands accused of rustling cattle she claims are hers.Trusting any man comes hard to Teddy Pierce. Too many have already let her down. The way Luke makes her heart quicken and stomach flip makes him more suspect than most. Or does it?",
