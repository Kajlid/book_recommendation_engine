  "description": "There are ancient secrets buried in the world, under dirt, rock and sand. Sometimes they are buried for a reason. GenCross, a genetics company in Toronto, wants to learn the secrets, good or bad. So do others and they’ll do anything to get them. Tim “Mouse” Jones is a university drop out who found success as a hacker. When he’s offered a job to make more money than ever, it’s hard to say no. Even if it means breaking into one of the most secure buildings in the city. The security system and the guards will be hard to get past, but the money is just too tempting to say no to. Greed is an ugly monster. Amanda McMichaels works in the Cross building and knows something about monsters. She lives with one, and work is her only escape from him. Yet the monster at home is nothing compared to what lives on the 10th floor of the Cross building. As the building shuts down, and the secret evil awakens, Amanda and Mouse are drawn together and must help each other to survive those that are hunting them. Some things should stay buried.",
