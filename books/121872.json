  "description": "Humanity has colonized the nearest planets of the solar system. One government unifies the billions of citizens scattered across three different worlds: the Hegemony, supervising a new age of peace and prosperity. Conflict between nations no longer exists.But a price has been paid. The Hegemony tolerates no opposition. It imposes its rule by force. Social progress is impossible, and personal freedoms have been eliminated.Boris Johnson is leader of the Democratic League, a covert organization attempting to overthrow the totalitarian regime. Johnson travels from planet to planet under a series of false identities, plotting to bring down the government by assassinating Vladimir Khustov, the Hegemonic Coordinator.But his plan is thwarted by an unexpected enemy: the Brotherhood of Assassins, a mysterious group of renegades whose motives seem inscrutable.Johnson finds himself fighting two battles. He faces death from the dictatorship that rules his world, yet when he tries to fight back, the mysterious Brotherhood obstructs every move.Gradually, the layers of mystery are peeled away, and Johnson faces an impossible choice: He can continue his battle for democracy, knowing that it is doomed; or he can abandon all his principles, join the Brotherhood of Assassinsâ€”and become an agent of chaos.",
