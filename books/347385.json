  "description": "While on a train heading west, Ted Jacob and Megan Crane are thrown back into the past with no idea of how or why they got there. They get off the train at Fargo, North Dakota and learn they are in April 1898. As if that isn't bad enough, the people insist that Ted and Megan marry at once! But Ted and Megan don't even know each other, and despite their protests, the preacher announces them man and wife. The only way out of this mess is to return to the future. But between figuring that out and Megan's showdown with the men, they may discover that some things are meant to be. And love may be one of them.",
