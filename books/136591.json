And a summer apart...We, the Sisterhood, hereby instate the following rules to govern the use of the Traveling Pants:1. You must never wash the Pants.2. You must never double-cuff the Pants.

You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence).5. You must not pick your nose while wearing the Pants. You may, however, scratch casually at your nostril while really kind of picking.6. Upon our reunion, you must follow the proper procedures for documenting your time in the Pants.7. You must write to your Sisters throughout the summer, no matter how much fun you are having without them.8. You must pass the Pants along to your Sister according to the specifications set down by the Sisterhood. Failures to comply will result in a severe spanking upon our reunion.9. You must not wear the Pants with a tucked-in shirt and belt. See rule #2.10. Remember: Pants = love. Love your pals. Love yourself.",
