  "title": "The Uke of Wallington: One Man and his Ukulele round Britain",
  "description": "When the only gig Mark Wallington's R&B band can get is in a nursing home they decide it's time to call it a day. But then Mark discovers an instrument he might just have enough talent for—the ukulele. Realizing his dream of a nationwide tour, the newly crowned Uke of Wallington sets off on a 42 night road trip, playing open mic sessions from Brighton to Cape Wrath. Probably the first rock and roll tour ever undertaken on public transport, he works his way through the British summer, taking his music to the Great British people, and testing to the limit the theory that you can't hear a ukulele without smiling.",
