  "title": "Scarlett Voices In The Shadows",
  "description": "Karyasa’s memoir is recounted by her alter ego Scarlett, who was born in 1964 to working-class parents in Melbourne. With razor-sharp perception and a defiant spirit, she recounts her rebellion against convention and her fascination with travel, while seeking an unknown utopia she convinces herself exists. Scarlett—Voices in the Shadows is an exploration of five decades of adventure, intrigue, devastation, survival and miracles.  Scarlett spends years raising her son in an isolated coastal community known as Death Valley. During this period, her resolve is tested as she comes close to breaking point after she is violently attacked.  After attending a women’s network meeting, Scarlett’s life takes an important turn. Scarlett is instrumental in introducing an initiative into her workplace that will change not only her own life, but also the lives of many others who have experienced violence and abuse.  When exhaustion threatens her health, Scarlett’s shadow voices guide her in a new direction, which leads to a future she could not have thought possible.",
