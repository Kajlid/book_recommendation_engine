  "description": "When the dashing Jack Carstares is unfairly accused of cheating at cards, he leaves the country in disgrace. Returning some years later disguised as a highwayman, his reappearance heralds a dramatic chain of events that includes a Duke, a damsel, a duel, and not one, but two kidnappings. Written when she was just seventeen, The Black Moth was Heyer's first novel, but it bears many of the hallmarks of her later romances, being vivid, witty, and peppered with historical insight.",
