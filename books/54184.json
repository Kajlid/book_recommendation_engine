Then her father, King Kareed, seizes the peaceful kingdom of Bellandraâ€”and its legendary sword, rumored to be able to defeat any enemy.On his return, he offers Torina two gifts: a beautiful crystal and the defeated king's son, Landen, as a slave. Both prove to be more precious than she could ever imagine, for with them Torina makes two discoveries: She is a seer, able to glimpse the future in her crystal, and Landen is not a servant but a peer, a noble spirit who matches her in wits, humor and character. But all is not well in Archeld.Beneath the seemingly orderly surface lurk greed, revenge, and plot's against the king's life. Fingers point to Landen, but Torina cannot believe he would harm her or her family. Can she use her new found powers to save her beleaguered kingdom? Or must the seer take up the sword?",
