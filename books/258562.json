  "description": "Allison and Max are spending a quiet evening alone. Or so they think. When an intruder breaks into their house, they’re not prepared for the demands he makes.  Rocky knows exactly what he wants, and he isn’t going to let anything get in his way. Including a fence and a few simple locks. For one night he’s going to do as he pleases...but will one night be enough?  Warning: This is the eighth book in the Forced Submission series, but they can all be read as stand-alone. These books contain situations involving forced submission and dubious consent. These themes can be triggers for some but sweet candy for others. If you're willing to hold off judgment until the last page, the ending is worth it, we promise! Just remember, this is all safe, sane, and consensual. Enjoy!",
