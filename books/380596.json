  "description": "Kelly Ann is fifteen and desperately in love with G - the biggest idiot in school. Her best friends Liz and Stephanie can see how awful G is - and also that Kelly Ann's quietly gorgeous friend Chris is madly in love with her. But Kelly Ann stumbles along blindly, unable to see what's right in front of her eyes. Navigating her way through teenage embarrassments, sick-filled parties, awful love poetry and green condoms, Kelly Ann is a hilariously endearing character and one every female reader, whatever age, will be able to relate to.",
