It doesn't take long before Ember finds herself smack dab in the middle of another mystery. Someone is turning the town's most eligible bachelors into frogs, starting with her cousin Florian. Aunt Hyacinth insists that the newspaper investigate alongside Sheriff Nash because 'everybody knows werewolves track meat, not suspects.'
