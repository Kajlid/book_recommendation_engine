  "description": "Smart, sassy and decidedly un-French Maggie Newberry and her hunky French-chef husband are solving mysteries en Provence and eating very well along the way. No French necessary to enjoy every page of this deliciously exciting murder mystery series! Desperate to find something to do while she is away from her job and her support system back in Atlanta, Maggie decides to write a French cookbook for American readers. The fact that she herself doesn’t cook is only a small stumbling block since she is now married to a fabulous cook, and a French one at that! Unfortunately, Laurent has other ideas of how he wants to spend his time. All of which comes to a head during that dreaded first year of marriage–which is made even more difficult with the regularity people seem to be dropping dead around them. Shelving the cookbook idea (for everyone’s sake!) Maggie and her trusty sidekick Grace begin their sleuthing in the ancient city of Arles. There is also an incredibly sexy, obviously smitten, French police detective who is investigating the murders at the same time he is seriously complicating Maggie’s life in every possible way.",
