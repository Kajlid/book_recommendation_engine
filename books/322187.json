  "description": "My name is Reggie Valentine. I’m the guy who vanished shortly after graduating high school. I know how crazy this will sound, but after a freak accident, I woke up in the 1950s. There might be a way to get back, except here’s the thing: I met a really special guy. His name is Daniel Parker. He’s adorable, sweet, hot, and everything else I’ve been searching for. So even though I’m stuck in a bygone era where people have outdated beliefs about race and sexuality, I’m not sure I can leave him. Daniel didn’t even know that two men could be together like this before I arrived, and I’ve never fallen so hard for someone. I only hope I can keep our love safe and find a way for us to always be together.Out of Time, Into You tells the unforgettable story of two young men and the intense love they feel for each other as they try to find their place in the universe.This book is intended for mature audiences. The minimum recommended reading age is eighteen years old.",
