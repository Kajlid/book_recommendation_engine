  "description": "Carrie has had enough of her crappy life so she plans to leap off the local bridge. Instead, she ends up falling across the universe to the magical world of Ario, where she learns to her horror that she harbours the soul of the Elfaeleen, the queen of the faeries. Total bummer.Accompanied by a misfit band of companions who are sworn to guide her, protect her and guard her incense, she’s tasked with bringing the faerie clans together to defeat the dread darkwalkers and their icky wyrd hounds. The trouble is the faeries all hate one another, there’s no Wi-Fi, camping is involved, and the toilets are unspeakable.A comical tale of angst-ridden teenagers, psychotic faeries, hot werefoxes, vegetarian vampires, hornless unicorns and creatures with dubious personal hygiene, Carrie me Home dishes out a big dollop of fantasy fun.",
