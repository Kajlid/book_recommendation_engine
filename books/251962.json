First published under this title in 1963.Heinlein gives us one of the earliest uses in science fiction of the \"generation ship\" idea, a huge spaceship transporting an entire community of humans to a destination so distant that generations will pass during its journey. And as Heinlein demonstrates, the origins of the community can become forgotten, misinterpreted, and otherwise distorted with the long passage.",
