  "description": "I fucked up.  This wasn't supposed to happen, not now, not ever! I think? Shit. I don't know what to think anymore.  These last two years have turned my life upside down. Right when I finally think I have everything going exactly how I want it, something always fucking happens. But this something is not so easily forgotten. Part of me wishes it could be, but the other...wants this more than anything. I have never been so scared in my entire life as I am right now.  I feel so alone.  He won't want this. He won't want me. But what if? What fucking if? He does...  Tristan, I'd give this part of me for you...  ~Sophia",
