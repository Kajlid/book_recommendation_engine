When Twelve-year-old Jake Darrow’s parents fall victim to this outbreak of spontaneous combustion, he vows to solve the mystery and stop the deadly fires, but nobody is taking him seriously and his investigation has only led to what seems like a dead end – a disused and derelict coalmine, the Danyrogof Deep. Far below the surface of the earth, in a world ravaged by war and plagued by monsters, the cunning and brutal General Mercer Hext is weaving a complex plan, a plan to commit the most insane act of destruction ever devised. Jake and Hext are heading for an incredible confrontation. Only one of them can win – an end to the life devouring fires or the whole world dying in flames. Jake is the hero who can save us all – he just doesn't know it yet.",
