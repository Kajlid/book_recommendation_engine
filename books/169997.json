  "description": "Through every age of mankind, there has been a focus in the search for God, to reconcile man's actions into an eternal perspective. This subject was first produced in Germany and England in respective periods of theological thought. But this adaptation was first produced in 1973 and now is made available in print to present the simple truth of Scriptures. Anyone who is serious in understanding the Truth can do well by thoughtfully reading and applying the conclusions of this work.",
