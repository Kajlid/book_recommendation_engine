Utian, M.D., Ph.D., founder and executive director, The North American Menopause Society.\"Bravo! This book should be a birthday gift for every 40-year-old (actually, probably earlier).\" ― Barb Malat, CPNP, PA-C, co-chair, Menopause and Hormone Therapy Committee, Association of Reproductive Health Professionals.Originally published in 2007 as Is It Hot in Here? Or Is It Me? , The Menopause Book is the all-in-one bible for women approaching or experiencing menopause. Completely revised and updated with a compelling, authoritative new look, the latest medical findings and advice, and a straightforward new title, The Menopause Book incorporates the most cutting-edge research on hormones and hormone therapy; hot flashes; heart disease and stroke; breast cancer in older women; and the subtle symptoms of ovarian cancer.  It also discusses new findings on why it's hard for menopausal women to lose weight; osteoporosis and estrogen; the interplay between migraines and hormones; panic attacks; and more. Of all the books on the market, this is the soundest―based on science, the material is vetted by top authorities in the field, the facts are up to date, the writing engaging, the tone upbeat. It's the essential guide for every woman who wants to take charge of her health.",
