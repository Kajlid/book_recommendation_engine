  "description": "A haunting tale of grief and revenge, set amid the splendor of Ancient Greece. Scott Oden is the author of The Lion of Cairo, Men of Bronze, and Memnon. Hailing from the hills of rural North Alabama, Scott Odenâ€™s fascination with far-off places began when his oldest brother introduced him to the staggering and savage vistas of Robert E. Howard and Harold Lamb.\"Oden's action scenes are rich with crackling vitality and his pacing is top-notch. One of the best adventure writers working today.\" -- Howard Andrew Jones, author of Desert of Souls\"The mark of exceptional historical fiction is its creation of an alien world so convincing (and peopled by such fascinating characters) that the reader never wants to go back to the real world. Scott Oden delivers exactly that.\" -- Steven Pressfield, author of Gates of Fire",
