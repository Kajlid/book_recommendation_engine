  "description": "Caitlyn Brady had never heard of druids, and certainly didn’t know she was one, until the summer before her sophomore year of high school. Hidden in an oak chest in her attic, a collection of photos of her parents reveal a secret she couldn’t imagine in her wildest dreams. She can manipulate earth, she is going to Keridwen - a school for druids - for training, and she is about to develop physically practically overnight from the length of her hair and nails to boobs she thought weren’t ever going to happen.Once at Keridwen, she makes friends with other druids who possess vastly different natural abilities including one who can shape shift into a grizzly bear and another who can heal any wound. With a war brewing between the druids, Caitlyn must learn mastery of her blessing in order to protect a scroll that holds the key to the druids’ existence before the rogues (enemy druids) ruin it all by destroying the ancients and all they stand for. Caitlyn didn’t want to be special, but now she’s that and more and faced with acting 200 times her age with the weight of the druid world on her shoulders.",
