  "description": "What happens when three best friends take a two-week vacation?Hunter Steele is about to find out. Hunter always thought he felt attracted to women. For a while, he’s felt as straight as hot spaghetti, not straight at all. His best friends Killian and Ari don’t see it coming, but when Hunter makes his move, they’re all in. The three friends become more inseparable than ever, sharing things they never thought they’d reveal. Two weeks of euphoria in a sun soaked paradise isn’t enough to solve their problems. Insecurities still seep into their relationship. Hunter has to come out and fears what may happen. Killian doesn’t believe he’s enough for one man, let alone two, and Ari has to hold them all together, doubts and all.",
