My beloved piano, and the music I create with it.Except a year ago, the music in my head disappeared, and I now live in a world of silence. Until my gaze lands on her. I don’t know who she is, but the moment I lay eyes on her, a symphony begins to play and the melodies ricochet through my mind. She’s my inspiration. My muse. Mine to take. Mine to keep. Forever.*This is a dark romance and contains elements that may be difficult for some readers.",
