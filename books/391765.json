  "description": "What do you get when you mix a squid-headed Ancient One, a mystical force-five hurricane, Rasputin's privates, the city of New Orleans, and an undead Captain Nemo? Christopher Csejthe, the reluctant hero stuck halfway between being undead and alive, is back, and is going to find out, whether he wants to or not.A few years ago Christopher survived a blood transfusion with a vampire only to discover that he was infected with one of the two viruses that transform the living into the undead. Since then he has survived by his wits as men, monsters, government agencies, and remnants of the Third Reich have hunted him for the secrets his mutated blood may hold.With a sexy vampire for a bodyguard, a werewolf lover, and bewildering advice from the ghost of his dead wife, Christopher's semi-undead existence was confused enough already. But now he's in for an underwater Mardi Gras of epic proportions complete with an army of drowned vampire zombies.Not to mention a Lovecraftian take on Gidget and The Creature From The Black Lagoon. Many brave hearts are asleep in the deep, and Christopher may be about to join them.",
