  "description": "It's not always butterflies and love at first sight...It's been two years since Mila Lindley moved into the apartment next to Tristan Li's house. It's been a year since he moved out, and they both thought they'd be able to breathe again—Tristan, because he was finally free of the hometown he felt suffocated him, and Mila, because she was finally free of Tristan.Or so she thought...until now. Walking into her first college course and accidentally sitting down next to him was bad enough. Finding out they'd be lab partners for the semester was a nightmare. Managing not to kill each other over the next four months was going to be impossible.Ultimately, the two realize what they're really fighting is their electric, but sometimes toxic, attraction. But what will happen if they finally give in? Will they live happily ever after, or will the damage they've already done, the words left unsaid, and the secrets they've kept from each other eventually destroy them?Told through dual point-of-view over two different timelines, Tristan and Mila's tumultuous story is an emotional rollercoaster showing us what can happen—both good and bad—when we bare our souls to another person and how love might look and feel differently when our pasts have left us just a little unstable.Content/Trigger Warnings: Sexual content, profanity, suicidal ideation, bullying, toxic behavior in a relationship.",
