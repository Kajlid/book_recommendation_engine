  "description": "Grand Tally, the world's foremost mapmaker, deliberately issues a U.S. road atlas minus the state of Montana. This move unleashes a national drama that alternates between Moosehead, Montana and New York City and ends explosively as Homeland Security attempts to eradicate a group of suspected terrorists. The slapstick action brings together the Montana militia, the FBI, journalists, New York celebrities, the Montana National Guard, and a charismatic Christian cult headed west to meet the Rapture.",
