She spent every Monday getting rid of his random hook-ups. She continued to push her feelings and jealousy aside each time the new flavor of the week called looking for more from her boss. Paxton, his business associate and best friend, Everest, are members of a local sex club. Everest likes to play and Paxton likes to watch.

Will she fall in love? Will he?",
