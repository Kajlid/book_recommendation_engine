  "description": "Andrea Westwood grew up with a loving family, living on a huge family orchard with her Mother and Grandparents. After a tragic accident she flees to New York to out run the past and doesn't look back. After ten years she is back to save the orchard and take care of her Grams. The orchard being the only place she had ever been happy in her life makes it a no brainer to go. Especially after her boss/fiance is caught red-handed with a waitress from the restaurant she is head chef of she packs up and heads home only to find that fixing up the store and tending to the land is more than she can manage. Nathan Kyle is a man out-running his own demons and when he promises Ruthie Westwood to help her Grand daughter with the work on the land he thinks nothing of it. Until he sees her. 'Drea shatters him, he is drawn to her and he can't help himself. He knows she will end him but the hell if he can help himself. And when 'Drea's ex-fiance shows up trying to right his wrong, there is drama, romance, laughter and tears.",
