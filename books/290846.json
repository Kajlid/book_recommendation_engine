  "description": "From breathtaking stop-action animation to bittersweet modern fairy tales, filmmaker Tim Burton has become known for his unique visual brilliance – witty and macabre at once. Now he gives birth to a cast of gruesomely sympathetic children – misunderstood outcasts who struggle to find love and belonging in their cruel, cruel worlds. His lovingly lurid illustrations evoke both the sweetness and the tragedy of these dark yet simple beings – hopeful, hapless heroes who appeal to the ugly outsider in all of us, and let us laugh at a world we have long left behind (mostly anyway).Stick boy and match girl in love --Robot boy --Staring girl --The boy with nails in his eyes --The girl with many eyes --Stain boy --The melancholy death of oyster boy --Voodoo girl --Stain boy's special Christmas --The girl who turned into a bed --Roy, the toxic boy --James --Stick boy's festive season --Brie boy --Mummy boy --Junk girl --The pin cushion queen --Melonhead --Sue --Jimmy, the hideous penguin boy --Char boy --Anchor baby --Oyster boy steps out",
