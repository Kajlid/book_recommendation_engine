  "description": "With one look Eöl knows he has finally found the love of his life, his Life Mate, one he has promised to bind so tightly they will never be parted. He is about to find that it isn’t as easy as he believes it will be, not with a Light Elf mate, who is also an Eagle Claw. Shocked by the sudden appearance of a Life Mate in her life, when she hadn’t expected one, Eärwen runs. It isn’t that she is against the idea, but this wasn’t supposed to happen to her and, although she fights it, their attraction to one another is too strong. As a newly bonded couple of power, they are hunted by the Demons and then captured, before being parted. The bond they share, however, is stronger than anyone believes. It connects them in ways few could have foreseen, as heart to heart, mind to mind, soul to soul, they complete their bond in the way of the most ancient of Elves.",
