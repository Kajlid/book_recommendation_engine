  "title": "The Book of Indian Birds",
  "description": "For nearly 50 years The Book of Indian Birds has been a close companion of both amateur bird-watching enthusiasts and seasoned ornithologists in India. This twelfth edition is revised, but retains Dr. Salim Ali's original text while describing and illustrating 240 additional species. Colorprints are used in place of the black-and-white photographs of earlier editions. The book now illustrates in color, and succinctly describes the habits and habitats of 538 birds of the plains and foothills, and of the wetlands and sea-coast. The sequence of orders and families has been rearrangedto facilitate reference to current ornithological literature. The book remains an indispensable field guide for everyone who wishes to enjoy the rich and varied bird life of the country.",
