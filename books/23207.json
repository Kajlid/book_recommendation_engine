  "description": "As far as Sophie Morgan is concerned, nothing sets her apart from other people her age, except maybe her quick temper. But when a car accident claims the life of her mother on Christmas night, Sophie comes face to face with her angelic father and learns her existence is anything but ordinary. As Sophie adjusts to her new life in California with her Aunt Celeste, she is thrust into a world of music, angels, and unearthly vengeance. And she is not alone; misunderstood classmate and local musician Joseph McCafferty is tortured by his own demons. Sophie and Joseph begin a strained friendship that develops into an unshakable, possibly forbidden love that marks the first step along a pre-destined journey in which Sophie must choose between her love for Joseph, her place in Heaven or Hell, and the fate of humanity.",
