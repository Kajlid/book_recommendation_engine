  "description": "What if A.I. had a soul? Could it find redemption?In a near-future where entire worlds spring from thought, minds struggle to define reality—and claim it. Human colonization of the Metaverse brings us face-to-face with a new class of artificial being, made in our image and yet utterly unknown.What is a person? Our answer will reshape the universe.The answer will also reshape a family.Two brothers stand on opposite sides of the deepest possible divide: Jon is alive, and Nat is dead but not gone. As each sets out to build his own future, their unraveling relationship becomes the battleground for the fate of the Metaverse—and of humanity itself.In the Shadow of Humanity explores what it truly means to be human, challenging our assumptions about family, love, justice, death, faith, and the nature of reality.This stimulating and intimate debut novel from N. John Williams brings together the epic scale of Asimov and the spiritual intensity of Dostoevsky, with a seriousness and style heralded as “reminiscent of the old days” of science fiction.",
