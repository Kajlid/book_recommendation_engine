  "description": "Loch Powers was the hottest guy I’d ever seen in my entire life.And I hated him with every fiber of my being.I'd practically known him since birth. Heck, we’d literally shared a crib as babies at his mom’s daycare.Then I’d crushed on him hard when we hit middle school but he wouldn’t give geeky, glasses-wearing me the time of day. When his mom made him take me to the sixth grade dance, he’d humiliated me and I vowed to never talk to him again. The next year when my family moved away, I told myself that if I never saw him again it’d be too soon.Now I’m back and attending the same college, but I’m no longer the skinny, ugly girl who was so infatuated with him. And I’m so over him it’s not even funny. But now that I’m no longer the ugly duckling, he’s set his sights on me, and I’m just not sure what to do with that.",
