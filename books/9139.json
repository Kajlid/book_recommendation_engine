  "title": "Memoirs of Darkness",
  "description": "Memoirs of Darkness - Good Man? is a raw and honest depiction of the author's struggles with mental wellness and internal conflicts. The writing is emotive and evocative, and the author does a fantastic job of using descriptive language to paint a vivid picture of their experiences as a real BDSM Dom with an average income, struggling with his demons and contemplating what his choices and actions make him.D.B. Dale tackles such a difficult and personal subject with openness and vulnerability, in this adult book which describes deeply dark erotic scenes, and in-depth self-exploration. It is not a perspective that is commonly voiced, but it leads to a deeper understanding of this “lifestyle” choice for those in the subculture, and those observing from the outside.",
