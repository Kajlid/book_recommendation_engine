  "description": "Nationally bestselling author Elizabeth Thornton returns with a wickedly tempting new tale of scandal, intrigue, and daring proposals. . . .From dueling at dawn to fighting at Waterloo, Jack Rigg, Earl of Raleigh, has seen his share of danger. But now he faces his greatest wedlock by ambush. It began in Paris, when he rescued an alluring cardsharp named Aurora from a tavern brawl. In the safety of Jack’s rooms they shared a passionate embrace. He never suspected their compromising encounter would change his life completely. . . .The idea that a poor vicar’s daughter should marry Jack Rigg might be amusing–if it weren’t so imperative. When she last saw Jack, Ellie Hill was disguised as “Aurora,” indulging her gift for gaming. Now she’s in trouble with the law–and Jack is her alibi. She must hope he’ll be more of a gentleman than he was to Aurora. But as they forge an unlikely and increasingly amorous alliance, someone with a deadly agenda wants to end their union before it begins.",
