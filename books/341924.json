  "description": "Made impotent by a shadow born of his own poor choices and godly misdeeds, whale-shifter Big Tom, The Orca King, takes on the challenge of a lifetime to make amends to the women whose personal histories he's abused after leading too many of them on needless sensual vision quests. To restore and renew his vitality and ability to shape-shift, and to save the life of his true love--a man infested with the breath of the serpent demon--he must confront his shadow head-on--not with force, but with love.",
