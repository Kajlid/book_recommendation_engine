  "description": "Delvay, once one of the strongest of nations now finds itself the weakest on the face of Sanctuary. Their only hope lies with Zoelyn, a child once considered too weak to even live by Delvay standards. The curse that has tormented her for close to a decade however may be the salvation for her entire House. If only she can manage to control her magic enough to awaken the sleeping heroes. With the Aspects themselves pushing for her to learn, Zoelyn feels the weight of her entire nation pushing against her, but that is nothing compared to her other problem. Seth, the demon she fled Merrodin to escape, the man who betrayed her in the Darklands, the only creature able to withstand her curse has decided to prove himself to her, and he refuses to be ignored. If the heroes can be awakened… If Shade can negotiate peace with the Blights…If Finn can master his place amongst the Aspects… then Sanctuary might finally know peace…If only for a while.Show more Show less",
