  "description": "Long-legged and powerful, Wes Lane's palomino leads Red Thornton's black by barely a length. As Red's horse quickens, its legs bunching close to its belly, Wes slams his quirt down with every gallop. The black runs steady, advancing until its nose is even with the palomino's...In the race as in life, cousins Red and Wes are bitter rivals--Wes the spoiled heir of the sprawling White Willow Ranch and Red the son of a humble rancher. In the heat of an argument, Wes is poised to murder an unconscious Red, but, in a panic, kills the onlooking barkeep instead. Red awakens to find himself framed for Wes's crime and is quickly sentenced and sent off to Yuma. Released from his false imprisonment, Red returns home to find Wes forced into hiding, White Willow taken over by a gang of outlaws, and his own prized mustangs stolen. Setting out to retrieve his property and clear his name no matter the challenge, Red's plans begin to unfold. But when the outlaws kidnap Wes's son, Red must forget revenge and join with his enemy to save the innocent child.",
