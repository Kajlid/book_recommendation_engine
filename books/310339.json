I’m strong, capable, able to take down almost any wolf shifter I go against, when I get the call. Dad’s in hospital and I need to come back, to care for him and determine his successor before outright war breaks out.So why do I feel like a little girl all over again?I’m right back where I started, being expected to find my true mate, but what if instead of one, there’s several? I know I need to choose, and my heart has: all of them.",
