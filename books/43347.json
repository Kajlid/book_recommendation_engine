No one harmed her. In fact, one of the thieves protected her. Now Juliette’s dreams are haunted by him.  Christian has waited to take her, resisting the urge each night. It always ends badly with human pets. They’re too fragile. The longer he can wait, the better, because the moment he takes her, the clock on her life starts ticking down.  Then she’ll be gone forever.  Publisher's Note:  This is a work of fiction, and contains erotic content meant for a mature, adult audience.",
