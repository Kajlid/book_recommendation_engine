  "description": "Is he a ghost?Outraged screams echoed through Shadow Hall, and Prudence was ready to kill...Lord Sayer. If he weren't dead already, that is. His mischievous antics made help impossible to keep. Prudence wished the seductive spirit would simply take one step beyond...and stay there!...A rake?But no insouciant ghost was going to drive Prudence from this castle. Sayer's will declared that any relative able to inhabit it for one year would inherit his estate. Prudence was only a distant relative to be sure, but she simply had nowhere else to go....Or a man to love?Except into the arms of...Lord Sayer! The very-much-alive nobleman was just pretending to have passed on so he could unmask his would-be murderer. Now he had just stolen a kiss—and requested Prudence to host a séance. Dare she trust this rogue who was far from what he seemed? Could a spirited scoundrel properly woo her? Perhaps—with a little faith, a lot of love, and maybe some help...from the other side.",
