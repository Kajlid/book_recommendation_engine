  "title": "The Wind Is My Wine",
  "description": "In, The Wind Is My Wine, I try to focus on the many aspects of human nature & on nature, as a whole. I have an affinity with the wind - gentle or destructive - it is always free. Like poetry, it is a movement with underlying currents that create responses. Many of the characters in my poetry, come to small or great understandings. I wrote this book for the voiceless that surround me.; the homeless & the hopeful, the grief stricken, and the dreamer. I believe we are all beautiful spirits at the mercy of the wind, so one way or the other, we must make it our wine.",
