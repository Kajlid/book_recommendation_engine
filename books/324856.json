  "description": "To all of our years together, Lisa Montgomery s husband said one evening, raising his glass in a toast, some of them good. They laughed and clicked wine glasses. But after his death, Lisa discovers he hadn't been teasing. When the contents of a secret post office box shatters her illusions about her marriage, she struggles to come to terms with his betrayal. Forced to examine her life as a wife, mother, and as a woman, she realizes her troubled childhood didn't allow her to be anything but composed and quiet. Then Terry O'Neal enters her life... But a jealous coworker watches, wanting to destroy what he can't have. Beyond the Quiet shares the story of one woman's struggles though bitterness, loss, and betrayal, learning to cherish each moment and follow her long-buried dreams. It's the story of how a quiet, passionless widow becomes spirited enough to climb onto her lover s shoulders for a piggyback ride... in the nude.",
