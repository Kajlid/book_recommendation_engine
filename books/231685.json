  "description": "When Alyssa Rivers accepts the coveted fitness trainer's position with England’s top cricket team, The Red Cats, she knows it's going to be nothing short of hard work. A woman in a man’s world, Lys not only has to prove she is the right person for the job, but she must earn the respect of cricket’s most elite players, including the surly team captain, Jase Willis. Known for his less than cooperative attitude on and off the pitch, he has the power to end her career before it’s even started … if she doesn’t end his first. In a game where there is no room for big egos or bearing grudges, Lys and Jase are going to have to find a way to work together ... but can the woman who sacrificed everything for love find a way to reach the man whose only love is the game?",
