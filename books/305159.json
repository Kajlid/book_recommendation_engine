  "description": "Words are wonderful. There are so many words that you might not ever learn them all. But why not learn as many as you can? Some are short and easy to say. Some are long and fill your mouth with mumbles. But you can learn any word in the world if you chop it into little pieces first. This book is full of words - names of places and kinds of boats and things to eat and dinosaurs. And each and every one of them is wonderful.",
