  "description": "Marushka loves pretty things lace and velvet, porcelain and pearls. She sews elaborate costumes for all of her dolls, and she spends hours arranging their hair just so. Her collection is growing; she's added a very pretty trinket, and his name is Michael. She can't wait to dress him up. Michael always suspected mentally ill vampires grew worse and worse as the years went by. He'd never realized how unhinged they could get. Now Michael is in way over his head. Will Wild Bill save him? Or was it only wishful thinking on Michael's part that their connection ran deeper than sex? or blood?",
