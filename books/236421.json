Heir to the throne of the Coven Sanguinis, Vittoria casts her life of vampire royalty aside and severs all ties after a betrayal from her maker, Marcella. But, a new foe is on the rise—one that is ancient and evil—seeking to destroy all that the vampires and werewolves have built since their creation.Vittoria must enlist the help of witches, werewolves, hunters, and even her maker, to protect their kind from exposure. The young queen has one advantage on her side though—the aid of the First vampire created, who has come out of hiding for this specific battle. Religion, history, and the supernatural, blur together to form an enticing tale of bloodlust, power, and chaos.",
