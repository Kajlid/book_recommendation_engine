  "title": "The Bayou Trilogy: Under the Bright Lights, Muscle for the Wing, and The Ones You Do",
  "description": "A hard-hitting, critically acclaimed trilogy of crime novels from an author about whom New York magazine has written, \"What people say about Cormac McCarthy ... goes double for [Woodrell]. Possibly more.\"In the parish of St. Bruno, sex is easy, corruption festers, and double-dealing is a way of life. Rene Shade is an uncompromising detective swimming in a sea of filth. As Shade takes on hit men, porn kings, a gang of ex-cons, and the ghosts of his own checkered past, Woodrell's three seminal novels pit long-entrenched criminals against the hard line of the law, brother against brother, and two vastly different sons against a long-absent father.THE BAYOU TRILOGY highlights the origins of a one-of-a-kind author, a writer who for over two decades has created an indelible representation of the shadows of the rural American experience and has steadily built a devoted following among crime fiction aficionados and esteemed literary critics alike.",
