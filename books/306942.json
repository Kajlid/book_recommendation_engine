  "title": "Private Battles and The Khaki Cage",
  "description": "Three people from one family; three separate lives touching or colliding, during events that took place in 1993. The father (Jack) writes his memoirs, relating his experiences as a young man during World War Two and his army escapades across Europe. He talks of meeting his future wife; like many young people at that time, they faced an uncertain future and the possibility that his wife would be an early widow. Their son (Douglas) and Douglasâ€™s wife (Naomi) face their own private trauma decades later, in a battle save the life of their unborn child. Their daughter (Jennie) faces her doubts when her world is upended by an unexpected liaison with a married man. Is he telling her the truth, or leading her on? Three ordinary lives bound or broken by the ties of family relationships.",
