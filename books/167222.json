  "description": "This second title in the Heirs of Anton series takes place in 1970, when former CIA spy Nadia \"Hope\" Moore must sneak behind the Iron Curtain, spring her estranged husband from a Russian gulag, and prove to the CIA that Mickey Moore isn't a traitor--at least, not to his country. Mickey has secrets that will save American lives, but a double agent isn't about to let the spy duo escape, even when her well-placed father attempts to help. Will Nadia be able to resurrect a love she thought had died? God is her sole ally, and only He can give her the wisdom to save her husband, her father... and her country.",
