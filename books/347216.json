  "description": "Elevating the genre of “mash-up literature” to awesome new heights, Sense and Sensibility and Sea Monsters is an expanded edition of the beloved regency romance--with all-new scenes of monster mayhem and high seas adventure. Evicted from their home after their father’s death, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are desperate to find attractive gentlemen suitors—and even more desperate to defend their new coastal cottage from giant squid, man-eating clams, great white sharks, and other monsters of the deep. Armed with nets, harpoon guns, and plenty of dry wit, they’ll need to conquer unscrupulous cads, meddling matriarchs, and a giant Kraken in their quest for true love. S&S&SM invades the prim and proper world of Jane Austen with the outrageous mythology of Jules Verne, H.P. Lovecraft, Spongebob Squarepants, Red Lobster, and Popeye the Sailor. Let the monster mash-up begin!",
