  "description": "Amber is convinced that her brother's death is her fault. It happened on the day that she'd taken something of his, something precious, the very thing that gave him his luck. Weighed down with grief, guilt and pressure to be the perfect daughter, Amber turns to the one boy who can make her feel better. But Tyler is in with the wrong crowd, and Amber finds herself in big trouble: trouble that would never usually happen to a girl like her. Only with her life having crashed around her will Amber find a way to rebuild it, and to finally find out what part she really paid in her brother's death.",
