  "description": "Seven miles beneath the Pacific Ocean, within the pitch black, hellish abyss of the unexplored Mariana Trench, a prehistoric killer thrives: Megalodon, the sixty-foot, twenty-ton ancestor of the Great White shark, the most ferocious predator of all timeâ€”and she haunts just one man. Years ago Jonas Taylor, palaeontologist and former deep-sea submarine pilot, saw Meg. But no one has ever believed his story. Now Meg is about to surface. When she does, nothing and no one is going to be safe, and Jonas must face his greatest fear once again.",
