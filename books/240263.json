  "title": "The Lady on the Rooftops",
  "description": "Angus Gregory is fourteen years old when he moves to Fairhope, Wisconsin with his family. The first thing to strike him, when he moves to the small town, are the Missing posters of the boy from the College. The second thing is the lady on the rooftops. Only Angus can see her - but she's there- dressed in a black cloak, her eyes focused straight ahead as she walks hurriedly across the rooftops of the buildings downtown. Angus thinks he might go mad, holding this secret, knowing that she's there but realizing that no one else can see her. But then one day, when he's on a camping trip with some boys from his school, as they sit around the campfire telling ghost stories, another boy reveals that he's also been seeing the lady on the rooftops. Together, the two of them team up to find out who she was, why she's there and what she's so desperately searching for as she rises up from her plot - crosses the graveyard and walks back and forth across the downtown buildings before coming back to her resting place and falling headfirst, back into the ground.",
