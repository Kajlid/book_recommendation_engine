Her marriage was crumbling and her friendships were becoming destructive. Overweight and lacking confidence, Raquel wasn't ready or interested in meeting anyone new.Fast forward five years. Raquel is eighty pounds slimmer with much more confidence in herself. She has ended her marriage and traded in the flash of a diamond ring for the flashbulbs of the red carpet. But, despite all her material and career success, she wants something more.Raquel has survived heartbreak, handled single motherhood, and thrived in the world of fashion, but will she allow herself to take a chance on love again? Although she is now use to wearing diamonds only on her ears, perhaps Javier will be able to show Raquel an accessory or two that sheâ€™s been missing.She knew what she wanted. She knew what she needed. But she had no idea what she deserved.",
