  "title": "Tightwads and Spendthrifts: Navigating the Money Minefield in Real Relationships",
  "description": "A revolutionary guide to navigating the financial aspects of real relationshipsHave you ever asked yourself “What if I’m a tightwad and my significant other is a spendthrift?” or vice versa? Scott Rick, a behavioral scientist at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, knows that many people do. He also knows that the financial aspects of an intimate relationship can become a money minefield if couples try to navigate it without first discussing all of the financial issues between them, especially if those two people have different approaches to spending.Tightwads and Spendthrifts is a science-based guide to understanding and transforming how we manage money, both on our own and in relationships. Building on his original research, and surveying a vast body of interdisciplinary work, Tightwads and Spendthrifts will help you understand your own financial psychology and how it plays out in your relationships. Can tightwads and spendthrifts live together in harmony? Rick says “yes,” but not without first asking hard questions about whose opinion should count most when making a financial decision. After all of the issues have been aired, he tells readers how to create a game plan for navigating financial decision making that both Tightwads and Spendthrifts can rely on for a happy life together.",
