  "description": "Short, sordid spiritual little tale of a boy brought up, used and tormented by a cult with plans to sacrifice him the day he turns sixteen.Setting: Could be any country, any planet for that matter, very rural setting and commune-like living arrangements, large old house and much land. The high priest chose a vessel amongst the woman to secretly home-birth him a child as the ultimate gift of blood and sacrifice to their Dark Lord. We know absolutely nothing about satanic cults, except what we read from a New Zealand news story on the animal and child abuse (that inspired this), so if we're way off the mark, sorry. It's only fiction with made-up characters who bear resemblance to anyone real by absolute freak chanceWord Count 2000",
