  "description": "Stop. Leave me to my devices and go away. Just get off my back already, all right? You don't know me, don't know my situation. You don't know the town I live in, the people I live with, the friends I own. Don't hold me to your standards. Stop expecting the best from me. I've never been given the tools to be her. So let me alone. Life's easy when nothing expects so little of you. Easy is what I crave. Easy is what I do best. Let the world weep. What good could I possibly do them anyhow? Follow my lead and close your eyes. It's effortless. Stop asking about me. I'm okay with being no one, a nobody. I'm comfortable with this stagnant life.There's nothing I stand to lose. I've taken no risks. Life can't be changed by simply doing nothing. Can it?I’m Lily Hahn and this is the story of how I went from a life of hollow nothing to a life of exhaustive agony and why I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.",
