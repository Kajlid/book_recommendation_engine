  "description": "It’s Christmas Eve at Nana Dombruso’s house, and a wild party is in full swing. Gangsters, strippers and Nana’s ‘gay homosexuals’ are certainly bringing the holiday cheer. But all I can think about is what will happen when I see Constantino Dombruso again.  Connie and I have a very long, very complicated history. The last time I saw him, he’d tracked me down because someone had hired him to carry out a hit on my brother Luca and me. He didn’t go through with it, but the tension between us is through the roof.  His life has been on a troubling trajectory over the last decade. But the fact is, Connie got under my skin a long time ago, and despite everything, the attraction between us has always been electric.  When we see each other tonight at the party, there could be fireworks or gunfire. It could go either way.  ***This holiday short story features characters from Alexa Land’s best-selling Firsts and Forever series. It’s told from Andreo’s perspective, who was introduced in the most recent book in the series, All I Believe. But it can also be enjoyed as a stand-alone for those unfamiliar with the series.  This gay erotic romance is about 21,000 words in length. It contains graphic sex and is only intended for adult readers.***",
