  "description": "For centuries, there have been legends of Vampires—the fault of one careless dragon. But humans only know part of the story. Walking amongst us are Dragons—Shape-shifters who feed on blood. Once upon a time, Lucan Aventech thought he was human. Then the day of his change arrived. As his skin ignited and he shifted to Dragon form for the first time, he was in a horrific accident—or so it appeared. He survived, but everyone, including his beloved Meda, believed him dead. Now that he’s finally come to terms with being a Dragon shifter and he’s no longer a danger to others, he’s ready to reclaim his life and reclaim Meda. Reigniting the love between them should be easy, right? But Meda’s deep-seated anger and pain as she comes to terms with who he is and the fact that he abandoned her make things far more difficult than Lucan ever imagined. Nevertheless, nothing can stop the passion still burning between them. Not even the Djinn who wants to claim her as his own. Now, Lucan has only to convince her that this time is forever.",
