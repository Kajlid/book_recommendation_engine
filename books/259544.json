  "title": "AZLANDER - Puck in Hell: Second Nature",
  "description": "Beneath the dual carriageways of Faerie and this World, are the Underworlds - where souls are often in need of help - grave help, one might say. Puck, the Elvish adept, travelled all of the realms throughout centuries, overseeing the incarnations of many. In this volume, Puck finds love. He saves Humanity. He fights Demons. He searches for the lost souls that he can recover. He also has a bespoke Heritage seed business, and a best friend called Goober. In earlier times, he is also known as 'The Hode', or 'Robin of the Forest' - and there are some choice backward glimpses into his adventures during this time as was then.",
