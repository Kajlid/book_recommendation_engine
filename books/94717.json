  "description": "Rubashov was the commissar. In the name of mankind, he had killed thousands of innocent men. He had stood by while his own mistress was delivered to the Party's executioners. Now, alone in his prison cell, accused of crimes he had never committed, he began to have the first glimmerings of doubt. Was his whole life a vicious sham? Should he resist his torturers and cry out for individual justice? Or should he remain a loyal servant of the Party even at the cost of a humiliating death?",
