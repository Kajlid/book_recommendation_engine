  "description": "A twist filled mystery with real “green” issues with politicians, businesses, and educators vying for control of the Game developed by three high school seniors. \"The Green Game\" is an uplifting story about students and educators changing the world.The game itself is close to non-fiction. It is a story of money, power, greed, evil, and even murder verses honesty, justice, and passion. Almost overnight the game becomes an international phenomenon. The Commander, appointed by the President has grown to love the three teenagers who have developed the game and are at serious, dangerous risk. Vicki, the Senator’s daughter who desperately wants a normal life. Josef, the top student, who craves friendship and is intent on clearing his father’s reputation. Jonathan, sarcastic one moment and in love the next. The destroyers are still out there. On the ground there is the giant oil company United Petro and it’s union protecting their turf including a cover-up, at all costs. The Commander is convinced that Roberts is the world’s strongest, most effective, green advocate, but does he have another agenda? Worse yet, there is a leak in the White House and the possibility that the real motive is the capture and sale of the secret spy bot by the Russian Mafia. No one sees the twist at the end as the kidnapper is revealed. On another level \"The Green Game\" is a call to action, a primer for eco-responsibility and an informative read for earth science students. The Roberts Awards for eco-responsibility are made to existing organizations and reader nominations are invited. Second printing.",
