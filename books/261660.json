  "description": "When Sadie Kramer heads to New Orleans with her sidekick Yorkie, Coco, her sole expectation is a spectacular vacation. With fabulous music, exquisite cuisine, and rich culture, how could a week in The Big Easy be anything less than fantastic? And it is - until a customer at popular Chez Lisette Patisserie drops dead face-first in a raspberry-almond tart.  A competitive bakery, a newly-formed friendship, and even Hotel Arnaud-LeBlancâ€™s luxurious accommodations offer possible suspects. As Sadie sorts through a gumbo of interconnected characters, will she discover who the killer is? Or will the killer discover her first?",
