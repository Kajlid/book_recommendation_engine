  "description": "The only thing they have in common? Really... sharp... teeth. Antonia Fielding has one goal: to escape the clutches of the Project. With the blood-virus infecting her system, though, a body bag is likely her only way out. Until her boss lets slip that he may just have a cure for her - if she brings in an escaped Lycan. Can she trust him? Now there's the million-dollar question. Then again, can she afford not to take that chance? Darce Foster was a Special Forces soldier, until the Project got hold of him. Now he's a Lycan, a lab-created werewolf, this close to escaping his creators - until another of the Project's experiments stops him in his tracks. Not because she has the power to hold him, but because he instantly recognizes the impossible. The vampiress is his mate. Allowing her to bring him in is his only choice-and possibly the last mistake of his life.Enemies or lovers, it doesn't matter. When they discover that the Project is hiding yet more secrets, they must work together to bring it down... or die in the attempt.",
