  "title": "Scoundrel!: The Secret Memoirs of General James Wilkinson",
  "description": "In the humorous, iconoclastic tradition of George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman novels, Gore Vidal's Burr, and Thomas Berger's Little Big Man, meet real-life scoundrel James Wilkinson as he lies, schemes, back-stabs, and seduces his way through our nation's early history. In Scoundrel! historian and novelist Keith Thompson mixes fact and fiction with intense characterization and a riveting story. After experiencing Wilkinson's irreverent spin, you'll never view the American Revolution or the Founding Fathers the same way again.",
