  "description": "The Mighty Six-Ninety (690) is a fictionalized account of actual events that transpired in Southern California during the Summer of 1981. A struggling AM radio station buried $50,000 in cash and gave its listeners clues as to its location, one a day, until the money was found. Set against the backdrop of a California landscape very much in flux, the story resonates evenly between desperation, hope, and suburban dissonance.A Holocaust survivor facing eviction, a schoolboy struggling with his identity, a single mother who is on the verge of being exposed for embezzlement, and a speedway daredevil whose bruised body and fragile ego are beyond repair, all find themselves scouring the Southern California landscape for $50,000 in buried cash-the grand prize of a struggling AM radio station's contest. Unknown to each other but bonded by a common desire for redemption, each is a willing participant in a treasure hunt caught between nostalgia and desperation.\"The Summer of $50,000\" unfolds against a California landscape very much in flux, both culturally and geographically. Only one contestant will call on a troubled past to help walk away with the money - and the salvation that they hope it will bring.",
