Down and out but arrogant, he assumes that his color will automatically gain him an audience. but his appeal is denied, and he becomes obsessed with the desire to confront the King at any cost. And so begins Clarence's odyssey. Fleeing from gambling debts, corrupt justice, and the contempt of his fellow whites, he begins a grueling trek to the savage South, accompanied by a roguish beggar and two boys. The overwhelming jungle and its many false trails finally give way to the South, \"provocative and cruel, lascivious and unmentionable,\" where Clarence comes to the end of a bizarre hallucinatory quest for \"soul\" and redemption in The Radiance of the King.",
