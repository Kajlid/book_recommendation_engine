  "description": "Combine an optimistic realtor selling a home with a sexual playground, a kindergartener convinced he's actually French and something called, \"Chicken Soup for the Kidnapper's Soul,\" and you get Patrick Wensink's hilarious collection of short stories. Sex Dungeon for Sale! Takes these bold characters and a few other outrageous situations to create an unforgettable and quick literary ride.  While keeping an eye focused on the surreal, but both feet firmly planted in reality, these stories dissect a modern world so strange you have to laugh. Wensink's punchy style is perfect for the brevity-obsessed Twitter generation, but saves room in his utility belt of brief tales for humor, humanity and an extra helping of WTF?.  About the New Bizarro Author Series:  With the current state of the publishing industry, it is hard for new voices to be heard. We wanted to do something about this. The New Bizarro Author Series is designed to showcase first books by unknown writers of the weird at a low price. By publishing these books on a smaller budget, we're able to take more risks and publish more writers who might not otherwise be given a chance. Created by authors Kevin L. Donihe and Carlton Mellick III, and published by Eraserhead Press. Try out one of these new talents to take a glimpse at the bizarro writers of the future.",
