  "description": "\"You're Not As Good As You Think You Are\" is an important addition to the field of self-help literature. You think you're swell, don't you? That you're God's gift to the Universe, the cream in everyone else's coffee. Well, you're wrong, and it's getting on everyone's nerves. The problem is you're too good, too pumped, too motivated. You need to come down to earth, to realize that when all is said and done, you're little more than a speed bump on the highway of life. You need a crash course in the principles of demotivational psychology. Based on the exemplary work of \"Sugar\" Roy Carboyle, a self-taught therapist, \"You're Not as Good as You Think You Are\" offers a user-friendly guide to building a less significant you. Each chapter provides theory, life examples, and valuable \"Mental Exercises\" designed to help you hone your self-effacing skills as you strive to be the least you can be. By following the steps laid out in this groundbreaking book, you too can feel really bad about yourself.",
