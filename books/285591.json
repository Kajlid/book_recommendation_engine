  "description": "Jonas Schwartz isn’t just good at playing football.He’s also good at playing hearts, and four years ago, he played mine like it was the easiest game of his life.Brokenhearted, I ran off to art school, swearing to forget about my one-off secret weekend with the star quarterback.I’d heard whispers about his injury, but I never expected Jonas to return to our hometown to rehab his knee, and I certainly never thought he’d show up on the other side of my door with a pizza in hand.He looks good. Better than before.Whatever—I’m over him. I’ve completely moved on.I just wish my heart would get the memo…This novella was previously included in the Team Player 2 Anthology.",
