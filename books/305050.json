  "description": "The moment that I found my mate, was the very moment, that my entire world changed. I thought destroying The Facility, a government funded medical center, was my destiny, but now, I see that my journey is only just beginning. I may not know exactly what the future holds for me, but I do know, that I’ll do anything to keep my mate safe. However, in doing so, I begin to show everyone around me just how powerful and dangerous I can be. Even if I’m doing the right thing, how can I be sure that this is the right path for me to take? How do I know that I’m supposed to be their savior, when all I can do, is doubt everything around me? In the end, my choices will either save the ones I care for, or it’ll cost me everything that I hold dear to my heart.",
