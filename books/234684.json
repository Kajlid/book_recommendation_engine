  "description": "It's been nearly three years since Kaylyn was given Nightfire to raise. Now she and Nightfire have a new challenge; to help raise not only a baby dragon, but train a new Dragonrider. The Silons are preparing for war, and it's only a matter of time before the fighting starts. Meanwhile, Kaylyn's already embroiled in a political battle, fighting for peace between humans and dragons, and fighting for those in power to accept the Dragonriders as people worth more than their fighting skills. But time is running out, and things are changing. Once, Kaylyn swore to never fall in love again, but she's finding out there's someone worth loving, someone waiting for her to love him back, and the battle with the Silons is about to begin and threaten everything she has.",
