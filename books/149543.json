  "description": "I don't turn every date into a medical emergency, but when I do, I nearly castrate my man... Shannon and Declan's first real date ends with an ambulance trip and yet another test of their madcap relationship. Ex-boyfriend Steve insists on dinner with Shannon while Declan is overseas on business, but a surprise return leads to plenty of romance as Declan whisks her away for a ride over Boston (in more ways than one...). Just as life and love look good, a misunderstanding takes on a sinister tone as a conspiracy brews to keep them apart. Julia Kent's hilarious Shopping series continues. Part 3 of a 4-part series.",
