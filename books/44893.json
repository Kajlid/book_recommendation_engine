  "description": "′This story is a true account of the birth of outlaw motorcycle clubs in Australia. There was no template for us, it just evolved. It shows our simple creed: loyalty to the club and respect for your brothers.′David Spiteri was a founding member and long-time President of one of Australia′s first outlaw motorcycle clubs from its inception in the early 1960s through to the early 2000s. He has been uniquely placed to witness the clubs develop from loose affiliations of riders to the well structured and well connected groups we see today, with links to police, politicians and lawyers. In this never-before-told inside story, Spiteri puts himself at risk to reveal everything from the drug trafficking which funds the clubs′ operations to the extreme violence that continues to make them infamous. For the first time, the true extent of the clubs′ corruption will be exposed, and the treachery and subsequent retribution enforced by their own brand of law known as ′the code′ is brought to light. A truly shocking and compelling look at a fascinating subculture.",
