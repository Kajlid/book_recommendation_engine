  "description": "Praise for Elias Khoury's New York Times Notable Book Gate of the \"An imposingly rich and realistic novel, a genuine masterwork.\"Los Angeles Times Book Review Milia's eyelashes drew apart, her eyes still curtained in drowsiness. She made up her mind to close them again and return to her dream. She saw a small white candle whose wan light trembled and flickered in the fog. . . Milia's response to her new husband Mansour and to the Middle East of 1947 is to close her eyes and drift into parallel worlds where identities shift, where she can converse with the dead and foresee the future. As the novel progresses, Milia's dreams become more navigable than the strange and obstinate \"reality\" in which she finds herself, and the two worlds grow ever more entangled. Elias Khoury, born in Beirut in 1948, is a novelist, essayist, playwright, and critic. He was awarded the Palestine Prize for Gate of the Sun, which was named a Best Book of the Year by Le Monde Diplomatique, The Christian Science Monitor, and the San Francisco Chronicle, and a Notable Book by The New York Times and The Kansas City Star. Archipelago Books also published Khoury's Yalo in 2008 and his White Masks in 2010.",
