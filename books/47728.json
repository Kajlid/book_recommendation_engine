  "description": "The Flower Power books follow the funny fifth-grade adventures of four girls with little in common but their flower names who, nevertheless, blossom into the greatest of friends. Katie-Rose, Milla, Yasaman, and Violet have confronted their share of challenges in fifth grade: a dead hamster, turtle theft, trapeze lessons, and pesky boys, just to name a few. Nothing can stop these four fabulous friends. Well, nothing except for their archnemesis, the evil Modessa (a.k.a. �Medusa”). Somehow, Modessa has recruited one of the sweetest girls in the class to be her new sidekick. The flower friends are determined to save Elena, even if it means braving Modessa’s wrath. But it will also mean getting Katie-Rose to focus—she’s a bit too busy NOT flirting with cute-but-annoying Preston. And then there’s Yasaman’s little sister’s birthday �bubblegum” party, which the four friends promised to organize . . . if it’s possible to call anything involving 30 kindergartners organized. Luckily, Violet is back to herself and ready to lead the Flowers to their most glorious triumph. With mean girls, romance, and tons of fifth-grade drama, this critically acclaimed friendship series shows that author Lauren Myracle �has her finger firmly on the pulse of tween girldom.” (Booklist)\nPraise for Awesome \n\n\nBlossom\n\n \"The girls' giggle-worthy antics and enough dangling plot threads will keep readers wanting more.\" --Kirkus Reviews \"Shining example of themes and language (parts of the story are told in IMs, e-mails, and chat messages) that will cut straight to the heart of tween girls.\" --Booklist",
