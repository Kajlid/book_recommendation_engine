With Oxford University on the horizon, his future looks bright, and he believes life has returned to normal after Christy’s rescue. He couldn’t be more wrong.Christy has been free from a life of slavery for more than a year and has made remarkable progress due in no small part to the love he found with Michael.

Learning of Christy’s survival is the only thing that brings him out of hiding. People, open spaces, even the most common of sounds frighten him beyond reason. A mere ghost of a boy, Thimi arrives in the US with no knowledge of the outside world—the only constant in his life a purple marble.Lost, shattered, and afraid, only hope gives them the strength and courage they need to begin anew.",
