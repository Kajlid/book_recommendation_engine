  "title": "The Twelve Caesars",
  "description": "As private secretary to the Emperor Hadrian, Suetonius gained access to the imperial archives and used them (along with carefully gathered eye-witness accounts) to produce one of the most colourful biographical works in history. \"The Twelve Caesars\" chronicles the public careers and private lives of the men who wielded absolute power over Rome, from the foundation of the empire under Julius Caesar and Augustus, to the decline into depravity and civil war under Nero, and the recovery and stability that came with his successors. A masterpiece of anecdote, wry observation and detailed physical description, \"The Twelve Caesars\" presents us with a gallery of vividly drawn - and all too human - individuals. This translation, by the noted classicist Robert Graves, serves the ancient chronicler very well indeed.",
