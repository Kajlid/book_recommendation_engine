  "description": "Should you dare to read it, “The Adventure of the Wollaston Ritual” will serve as a fine (and perhaps a little frightening) introduction to Evelina Cooper, the niece of none other than the great detective Sherlock Holmes. Her world is one of sorcery, automatons and mystery. The main course in this succulent fiction feast – A Study in Silk – will be served September 24. In the meantime, consider “The Adventure of the Wollaston Ritual” to be a scrumptious hors d’oeuvre.",
