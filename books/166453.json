  "description": "They didn't want to be on the boat in the first place. They didn't want to be stuck at sea with a bunch of strangers. But when a storm hits, what they want doesn't matter. It's all about survival. Luke, J.J., Will, Lyssa, Charla, and Ian soon find they have nothing to rely on but a desert island--and each other. No food. No shelter. No rules. They're on their own. Or are they?",
