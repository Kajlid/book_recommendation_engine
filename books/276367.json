  "description": "WINNER OF A 2019 RIPPED BODICE AWARD FOR EXCELLENCE IN ROMANCE“Herrera serves up high heat, serious social commentary, and laughs in perfect measure.” —Book RiotNo one should have to choose between love and justiceHaitian-born professor and activist Patrice Denis is not here for anything that will veer him off the path he’s worked so hard for. One particularly dangerous distraction: Easton Archer. The Assistant District Attorney who last summer gave Patrice some of the most intense nights of his life, and still makes him all but forget they’re from two completely different worlds.All-around golden boy Easton forged his own path to success, choosing public service over the comforts of his family’s wealth. With local law enforcement unfairly targeting young men of color, and his career—and conscience—on the line, now is hardly the time to be thirsting after Patrice again. Even if those nights have turned into so much more.For the first time, Patrice is tempted to open up and embrace the happiness he’s always denied himself. But as tensions between the community and the sheriff’s office grow by the day, Easton’s personal and professional lives collide. And when the issue at hand hits closer to home than either could imagine, they’ll have to work to forge a path forward...together.DreamersBook 1: American DreamerBook 2: American FairytaleBook 3: American Love StoryBook 4: American SweetheartsBook 5: \nAmerican Christmas\nDating in DallasBook 1:\n Here to Stay\nBook 2:\n On the Hustle\nSambrano StudiosBook 1: \nOne Week to Claim It All\nBook 2: \nJust for the Holidays\nLas LeonasBook 1: A Caribbean Heiress in Paris",
