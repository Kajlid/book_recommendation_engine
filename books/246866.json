  "description": "Achieve Success. Create Balance. Experience Fulfillment. It’s the elusive trifecta every working woman desperately seeks. Do you find yourself trying to be everything to everyone? Do you run yourself ragged but still feel something is missing? The struggle is real and all too common. Paula Brown Stafford and Lisa T. Grimes are two award-winning, c-suite executives who together have accumulated 60 plus years of work experience at the highest levels, 60 years of marriage, and raised four successful children. Collectively, they have managed more than 25,000 employees globally. Paula recently retired as President, Clinical Development at QuintilesIMS and Lisa has served as President & CEO of PurThread Technologies. Although Paula and Lisa were fierce competitors 20 years ago, they eventually formed a friendship and now, as a team, speak to corporations and women’s groups on a number of topics, including Complementing Not Competing, Packing Your Potential, and The Juggling Act. In a transparent and relatable way, Paula and Lisa share personal experiences, insights and encouragement―what they wish they’d known 30 years ago―to women looking for career advancement and quality of life and men who want to improve their working relationships with women. Each chapter includes a personal letter from a successful female executive to her younger self that offers wise counsel for aspiring professional women. For working women who are still trying to ‘have it all’ but are left feeling not ‘good enough,’ Paula and Lisa explain how achieving success, creating balance and experiencing fulfillment begins and ends with Remember (ing) Who You Are .",
