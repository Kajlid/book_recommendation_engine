  "description": "The first half of this book is a humorous retelling of Levenson's childhood as the youngest of a large immigrant family in New York in the first quarter of the 20th century. The second half talks about issues of race, children, and education today. This nonfiction book is very humorous, smart, well-written, and has the potential to be influential if enough people are willing to read it. It's FULL of fantastic quotations, too. Sam Levinson was a genius!",
