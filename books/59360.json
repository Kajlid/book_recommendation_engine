  "description": "Coating opera's roles in opulence, Maria Callas (1923-1977) is a lyrical enigma.Seductress, villainess, and victor, queen and crouching slave, she is a gallery of guises instrumentalists would kill to engineer… made by a single voice.But while her craftsmanship has stood the test of time, Callas’ image has contested defamation at the hands of saboteurs of beauty.Twelve years in the making, this voluminous labour of love explores the singer with the reverence she dealt her heroines. The Callas Imprint: A Centennial Biography reaps never-before-seen correspondence and archival documents worldwide to illustrate the complex of their multi-faceted creator - closing in on her self-contradictions, self-descriptions, attitudes and habits with empathic scrutiny. It swivels readers through the singer's on- and offstage scenes and flux of fears and dreams... the double life of all performers.In its unveiling of the everyday it rolls a vivid film reel starring friends and foes and vignettes that make up life.It's verity. It's meritable storytelling.Not unlike the Callas art.",
