  "description": "London, a thousand years from now. The capital sprawls across the whole of England and every last bit of land is taken up by human habitation. Both London and Paris are protected from terrorist and criminal infiltration by an invisible shield and the people live under constant surveillance. Everyone, though, is happy - or seems to be. Law breakers are cast out of the shield into the wilderness and are left there to fend for themselves. Somewhere in the French wilderness, two sixteen-year-old Londoners are about to embark on the task that every boy their age must pass. They couldn t be more different: Kayleb is clever but puny; Rowan is strong and obstinate. They ve never been friends - far from it - but they quickly realise that, if they are going to survive the bloody dangers ahead of them, they are going to have to learn to trust each other - and fast! A thrilling, powerfully imagined sci-fi adventure that will keep readers guessing until the very last page.",
