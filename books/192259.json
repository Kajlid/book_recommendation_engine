But the tomboyish, outgoing Sun Jing cannot bring herself to utter a single word in Qiu Tong's presence. Once she musters up the courage, however, Sun Jing successfully introduces herself and secures a friendship with the cute girl. Although they are only friends for now, Sun Jing will do anything to see Qiu Tong smile; and with her genuine kindness, she might just win Qiu Tong's heart.",
