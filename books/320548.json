  "description": "Disagreeing from the first time they meet, Noah and Niko know exactly how to push each other's buttons while they fight the intense pull between them. But when they’re forced to work together, they might realise that their connection runs deeper than frustration and lust.\n\nNiko is driven and ambitious, even when it's misconceived as cold and measured. Her latest project is her great-grandmother's nature organisation. Niko is determined to see it thrive again and hopefully understand herself and her broken family better in the process. Getting a handle on her inconvenient feelings is a must too.Noah has made a promise to set things right and honour his eccentric grandfather's hard work. Even when that means taking on an active role in a small nature organisation, while hiding his true identity. He is busy enough as it is with university, work, and late nights of writing. Still, he can't help but care about the organisation. Or the fierce woman who always seems to make his life harder.Only Sometimes is a new adult frenemies to lovers romance set in Copenhagen, Denmark (with a getaway to a gorgeous Swedish forest). It's book three in the Without Filter Series, but it can be read as a complete standalone. Only Sometimes is a steamy slow-burn romance, and it contains spicier content than the previous two books in the series.",
