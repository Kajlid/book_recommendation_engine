  "title": "Akenfield: Portrait of an English Village",
  "description": "In this rich, rare book, which John Updike called \"exquisite\", forty-nine men and women, from a blacksmith and a bell ringer to the local vet and a gravedigger, speak to us directly, in honest and evocative monologues, of their works and days in the rural country of Suffolk. Composed in the late 1960's, Blythe's volume paints a vivid picture of a community in which the vast changes of the twentieth century are matched by deep continuities of history, tradition, and nature.",
