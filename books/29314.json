  "description": "Environmental devastation and economic chaos have turned America into a land of horrifying depravity. Assault, theft, sexual abuse, slavery, and murder are commonplace. Taking advantage of the situation, a zealous, bigoted tyrant wins his way into the White House.Directly opposed is Lauren Olamina, founder of Earthseed - a new faith that teaches \"God Is Change\". Persecuted for \"heathen\" beliefs as much as for having a black female leader, Earthseed's followers face a life-and-death struggle to preserve their vision.Best-selling author Octavia Butler's fluid writing and keen observations about race, gender, politics, and religion make for a moving parable that will be pondered for generations. A powerful reading from three standout narrators captures the multi-generational sweep of this poignant tale.Butler's acclaimed novels have won numerous awards, and she is a recipient of a \"genius\" grant from the MacArthur Foundation. Parable of the Talents was selected as one of the best books of the year by Publishers Weekly.",
