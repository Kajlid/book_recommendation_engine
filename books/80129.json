  "description": "Just like you, Prudence has a body, and this body has many nice and useful parts: A head for thinkingEyes for seeingEars for hearingA mouth to talk and eat withHands for playingA pee-pee for making Wee-WeeLegs for walking and runningA bottom for sitting and in it a little hole for making Poo-PooPotty talk has long been considered taboo in conversation -- even between parent and child. Thankfully, Alona Frankel presents toilet training in a frank, open way for parents and children. Available in both Girl and Boy formats, Once Upon a Potty books are best used as companion volumes to a child's new potty. Dear Fellow-Parents, Once Upon a Potty is best used as a companion volume to a child's new potty. I wrote this book when my own child was toilet training to help him better understand the process. My son was encouraged and excited by this story. It motivated him to make the developmental leap from diaper to potty.Learning to use the potty is often a lengthy process, taxing the patience of both parent and child. When success finally comes -- and it should come in its own good time, without undue pressure or haste -- it enhances the child's confidence and pride. She has taken another step toward independence. She sat on the potty as a little child and got up feeling ten-feet tall.It's one small step for mankind, but a giant one for your family.Love, Alona",
