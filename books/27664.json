  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Genesis's father ventures out on a lake in Northern Maine for one last catch of the season-and never returns. As the lake freezes over, so, too, do the lives and hopes of her family. Because with no body, and no hope of finding one until the lake thaws, the family is denied access to insurance money. As the long winter drags on, Genesis begins to unravel the truth behind the rumors-of an affair, and possibly worse-and for the first time, questions how well she, or anyone, really knew her dad. Her odyssey will take her into the thick woods along the Canadian border where her father worked at a logging camp . . . and into a romance she isn't sure she wants.Taut, dark, and compelling, Season of Ice perfectly captures the complex, interior life of a young woman bracing for truth, inadvertently finding love, and waiting for answers that only the thaw can bring.",
