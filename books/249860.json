Only their love can save the world…  Curvy Autumn Carter is a sheltered travel agent who has never traveled. But after planning her trip of a lifetime to Iceland down to the last hotel and landmark, she's forced to throw all her plans out the window when a hot-as-blazes dragon shifter and a bunch of homicidal fire dragons crash her vacation!  Damon Drago is the powerful Dragon of the Earth, member of the Council of Elements. On the trail of dangerous fire dragons in Iceland, he instead finds what he least expected - his mate. Her luscious curves kindle a passion hot enough to melt the ice and make him want to forget all about his duty - but the fire dragons have other plans. Now his mate is in deadly danger and only Damon can protect her, by whisking her away to a secret shifter town hidden in the mountains.
