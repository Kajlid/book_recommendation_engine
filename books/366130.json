But when he is married to the cunning and beautiful child-bride, Frances Howard, a very dangerous liaison changes everything.

Her attempts to rid herself of an unwanted husband, and later to ensnare a lukewarm lover, lead her deep into the world of spell-makers and treachery. This is a woman to underestimate at great peril.
