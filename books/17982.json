  "description": "Annabelle has always taken her bipolar brother under her wing, but after years of acting as his personal disaster janitor, she finds herself fighting against her lifelong compulsion to take responsibility for his actions and fix all his mistakes. It's easier said than done, especially when his actions affect her own future. The struggle between letting her brother deal with his own consequences and fixing just one more thing for him - so she can keep the life she's always known - pushes and pulls at her as each mistake he makes lands her further and further from the future she had planned. In the end, the decision she makes about whether or not to play clean up crew for his most recent disaster, does not in fact produce the results she expected ... but ... it just so happens, it might not be such a horrible thing after all.",
