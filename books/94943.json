  "description": "Hitching a ride on a rogue iceberg, a polar bear washes up on the north coast of Scotland and immediately acquires a taste for human flesh. Intent on a huge media scoop, TV journalist Rebecca Riposte is swiftly on its trail. But so, too, is Lord Tobias von Hindmarch - a man hell-bent on settling an old hunting score and bagging the sole trophy that has evaded his beastly collection. Meanwhile, \"independent\" scientist Dan Travis flies in, his covert mission to play down the implications of the iceberg and bolster the government's melting green reputation. With the weather fast closing in, Rebecca is forced to rely upon the help offered by a police officer with a murky past. But Dan faces his own dilemma: after he falls for Rebecca and resolves to help her, he finds he has place his life in the hands of a sinister mountain guide. As the action converges and the body count rises, each must face challenges more deadly than their darkest fears. Punchy but lyrical, this edgy eco-thriller offers plenty of dark comedy and packs enough twists in the plot to keep you guessing to the last pages.Polar Nights was dubbed \"a sumptuous read\" and awarded Thriller of the Month by the review site E-thriller.com in May 2013. It is the debut novel from British journalist and travel writer Simon Hacker.",
