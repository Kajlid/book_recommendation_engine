  "title": "Cold Water Crossing: An Account of the Murders at the Isles of Shoals",
  "description": "This series of events happened on a cold winter evening when three women were unexpectedly left alone on Smuttynose Island, ten miles off the coast of Maine where it borders with New Hampshire. They were the only inhabitants of the small island.That night, the men of the family were unexpectedly detained in Portsmouth awaiting a shipment of bait. At the dock, their casual conversation was overheard, a killer saw an opportunity, and did the unthinkable. He rowed ten miles out to sea on a freezing night and committed murders that have become legend in New England crime annals. One woman survived the brutal assault and narrowly escaped his clutches as she hid among rocks. This is the frightening story of what happened the night of March 5, 1873 on a lonely coastal island and what followed in the days and months after.",
