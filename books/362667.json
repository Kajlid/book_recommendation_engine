  "description": "Many believe Robert Christgau invented rock criticism. Cooper Square Press offers an expanded edition of his early writings, unavailable since 1978. It was one of the first books on rock music, an invaluable compendium showcasing a new sub-genre of writing not yet contained by the established boundaries of journalism or criticism.Christgau deftly applies his intellectual approach to popular music, showing that it is as worthy of serious study as any other art form. Yet his writing is never pretentious, as he presents early record reviews, discusses music as it relates to popular culture, and profiles artists as diverse as Frank Zappa, Carole King, Captain Beefheart, Tom Jones, and Chuck Berry.",
