  "description": "Broken, haunted Johan doesn’t want a bondservant. He certainly doesn’t want a bondservant like Emil, who is mouthy and disobedient and completely disrespectful. But if Johan can overcome his own nature and subjugate Emil, maybe he can finally win the respect of his family—and escape the painful shadows of his past.Emil never expected to get caught for his crimes, and he didn’t expect to end up as a bondservant to one of the richest families on Cadmus Station. He’s willing to play nice, but he refuses to be submissive—there’s nothing submissive about him.His new master is cruel, but he’s inept and inexperienced. Emil can see all the cracks in Johan, and he’s going to take every advantage he can get to gain the upper hand.Leashing His Heart is set in the Under His Heel universe but can be read as a standalone.Leashing His Heart contains dark themes and potentially triggering content. Read at your own discretion. You can find full content notes on the author's website.",
