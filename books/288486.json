  "description": "I’m the broken Gilroy.Or at least I was until Grace Faraday waltzed into my life with her mile-long legs, smart mouth, and quiet determination and decided I wasn’t as far gone as everyone thought.She’s trying to make something of her life. For herself. For her daughter, Molly.The last thing she needs is a washed-up soldier with a bum leg and a broken brain dragging her down, but the more I try to stay away from her, the deeper I sink. The more determined I become to save her from my bullsh*t, the faster I feel my resolve to do the right thing slip away.Maybe I am broken. Maybe I am beyond repair but Grace sees something in me.She makes me feel. Not like the man I used to be. She makes me feel like the man I should’ve been— could’ve been —if my life had been different.Grace is determined. She’s stubborn. She won’t give up on me. On us. All I know is I want her. I like the way she looks at me. The way she makes me feel, and I’m willing to do whatever I have to—be whoever she needs—in order to keep her.",
