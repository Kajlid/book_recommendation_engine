  "description": "Living semi bankrupt in France wasn't the dream I'd fantasied about. Homesick and disillusioned, I knew something had to change, but what? It seemed like a good idea at the time. I had seen all those TV programmes. The dream of living in France was only a ferry ride away. But months later, my life was a nightmare. I didn't fit in with either the expats or the French, my husband had taken refuge in Star Trek and I had adopted a crazy dog that ate anything he could find, including my slippers. Faced with loneliness and very homesick for my family in the UK, I began to write a journal of my life. This is a warts and all tale for anyone who has ever thought of 'living the dream.' Humour and tears a plenty, join me on my journey of self discovery and see if I was really only Faking it in France.",
