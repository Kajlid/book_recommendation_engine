Once the rush wears off and the cash is gone, he needs more. It’s his drug and he’ll stop at nothing to get it. South Carolina Senior Special FBI Agent Martin Rickard and Agent Knabb pull out all the stops to identify and capture Cameron. Through extensive profiling, facial recognition software and gut instinct, they are closing in on his identity and home base. Along comes Chloe Wilson, an innocent teller and the victim of one of Cameron’s heists. Cameron is instantly smitten with Chloe and pursues her. A relationship develops but Chloe’s inner voice knows there is much more to Cameron than just a stock broker.",
