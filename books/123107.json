  "description": "- The Torah (Law of Moses)--is it in full force today? Yeshua (Jesus) said, \"Don't think that I have come to abolish the Torah... I have come not to abolish, but to complete.\" What did he mean? - Sha'ul (Paul) wrote, \"All Israel will be saved.\" Was he speaking of all Jews? Messianic Jews (Jews who believe Yeshua is the Messiah)? The Church? Who is Israel? - Why did Yeshua juxtapose the saying, \"Do not store up for yourselves wealth here on earth\" and \"The eye is the light of the body\"? Dr. David Stern, a Messianic Jew living in Jerusalem, speaks to these and other issues in the Jewish New Testament Commentary. In this companion volume to his widely read and highly acclaimed \"Jewish New Testament,\" he offers an exciting and original way of understanding the New Testament from a Jewish point of view.",
