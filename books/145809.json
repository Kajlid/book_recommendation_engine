  "title": "One Man: No Plan",
  "description": "Confused ex-outlaw, pardoned for all misdemeanours, seeks answers... The Pan of Hamgee has a chance to go straight, but it's been so long that he's almost forgotten how. Bewilderingly, despite a death warrant over his head he is released, given a state-sponsored business, and a year's amnesty from all offences while he adjusts. He doesn't have a year, though. In only five days Lord Vernon will gain total power and destroy Kâ€™Barth. Much to his frustration, the only person who can stop him is The Pan: a man without a plan.",
