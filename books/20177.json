  "description": "Jenna Rainey can turn the reality of the bitter northeastern winter wind into a daydream of her childhood summers in Texas just by sinking to the bottom of the pool. It’s only a brief respite from the climate that she detests, but it’s the only one she’ll get after relocating from her southern home to Baltimore to live with her cousins, Rowdy and Laura. A tragic drunk driving accident has robbed Jenna of her mother and damaged her eyes, transforming a successful college graduate into a lonely, disabled dependant. After finding employment as a spin instructor and volunteer at the local school for blind children, she begins to gain confidence and independence in her new surroundings. When Jenna meets Rick Bentley, a swimming coach and accomplished athlete, her feelings of uncertainty and vulnerability mask her kindness leaving him rightly offended and their first two encounters threaten to be their last. It will take forgiveness, loving families, and a debilitating migraine to take their two broken hearts and make them into one great everlasting love.",
