  "description": "Caroline Myss, author of Sacred Contracts, calls Dr. Emoto, “magnificent…genius…His research in spiritual consciousness is positively masterful.”  This book will transform your world view.  Dr. Masaru Emoto ’s first book,  The Hidden Message in Water , told about his discovery that crystals formed in frozen water revealed changes when specific, concentrated thoughts were directed toward them. He also found that water from clear springs and water that has been exposed to loving words showed brilliant, complex and colourful snowflake patters. In contrast, polluted water, or water exposed to negative though formed incomplete, asymmetrical patterns with dull colors. The implications of this research creates a new awareness of how we can positively impact the Earth and our own personal world. This book takes you further and deeper into how you can affect your own personal healing by reading it.",
