  "description": "She shouldn't have trusted a donkey with her food and water, when she trekked up the Semien Mountains in Ethiopia. Especially because the mule knew the way and ran off with all her luggage. In Nepal, however, Anna Halabi did have faith in a young woman and help fund her college education. She learned the difference between K-Pop and Kebab on her trip to South Korea and discovered how resilient she was after she had spent a week in a small pirogue down the Niger River with seven strangers and a swarm of cockroaches and mosquitos.Diary of a Syrian Globetrotter is a patchwork of the adventures of a young Syrian woman traveling around the world. She tells the stories about her journeys, the kindness of strangers she had encountered and unravels the contradictions and contrasts to her own culture.",
