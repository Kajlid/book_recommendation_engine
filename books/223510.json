  "description": "Family came first—that’s what the Brothers by Blood MC believed in. They fell in love, they battled the odds, and they fought through the danger that threatened to tear them apart, but it wasn’t over yet. Their stories were just the beginning, and now they were determined to continue to build their families and the next generation of the MC. They’ll face struggles that will test them—both internal and external—but they’ll face them together. For some of them, the fight ahead would be long. For others, maybe even dangerous. And just when it seemed like it was over for one… …a new story may have only just begun.",
