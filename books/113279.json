  "description": "At the age of seventeen, Reiss Chambers knew he was in trouble the moment he realized that Ava was never going to marry someone like him—the poor gardener’s son. Even though everyone was against them, Reece stood his ground, knowing that the only thing that mattered was Ava. As long as she stayed true to their love, he could endure whatever life threw at him. Her family opposed the relationship from the beginning. The more Ava’s parents meddled, the difficult it got. When Ava’s ex came back into her life, the worse things became. Witnessing Ava betray him, he walked away vowing to never look back. Ten years later, they crossed paths again. This time, Reiss was no longer poor nor was he easily recognizable. Young love. Betrayal. Agony. After all that, could a man truly forget his first heartbreak and move on without some form of closure?",
