When caught and imprisoned, he must choose between conquering his addictions and succumbing to suicide.Rachelle is a God-fearing woman who struggles to cope with a history of abuse. In an attempt to unchain herself from the past, she ministers to others who’ve suffered. Yet when her own past haunts her marriage, she must face her repressed trauma before her relationship collapses.Based on a true story, Love the Unloved is a Christian short story of a man’s fight against temptation and a woman’s struggle to heal.
