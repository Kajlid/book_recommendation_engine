The main character is a burned-out businessman who takes an unplanned retreat to his cabin in the mountains of Idaho.On the first evening of his getaway, a mysterious stranger appears beside his campfire and delivers a summons: \"Drop everything and attend a rendezvous of destiny...the fate of the world may depend upon it.\"He is confronted with a terrifying choice: believe this stranger and take a journey into the unknown, or ignore the whole thing and perhaps miss his call of destiny?Join the main character on an adventure of the spirit. With him, you will meet a cast of divine helpers, shaman monks and ragged teachers who will captivate your imagination. Rich with insights, quotations and teachings of sources ranging from ancient to modern, this book is a breath of fresh air for the soul.Like the hero in this tale of awakening, you may never see life the same way again.Author's note: This book tells a story using symbolic language and fictional situations.

Find out why in Chapter 15.",
