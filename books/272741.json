  "description": "Azar Nazemi is a firefighter with an ancient secret; she is Ifrit. A race of Djinn, or Genies as they are known to Westerners, the Ifrit have the ability to read a fire and mold it to their will. That makes her job a whole lot easier. When her crew attends a series of deadly arsons that appear to have been lit by one of her own kind, Azar knows it is up to her to track down the rogue Ifrit and stop him before he kills more people. There's only one problem; sheâ€™s spent a lifetime avoiding other Djinn and ensuring that the Djinn Ruling Council have no knowledge of her existence. A cold and brutal regime, the Djinn Council want to conscript her into slavery for one hundred years. As she pursues the Rogue, Azar will break the rules of secrecy that surround her world and enlist the help of human Arson Detective, Keenan Reilly. A chauvinist to the core, Detective Reilly has always rubbed Azar up the wrong way, mostly because she'd like him to rub her up the right way, despite her better judgement. But if she is to save her friends and the millions of people who call New York City home, then she is going to have to make a few sacrifices and bend a few rules.",
