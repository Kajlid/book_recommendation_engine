  "description": "Star light, star bright,First star I see tonight,I wish I may, I wish I might,Have the wish I wish tonight . . .Everyone is familiar with this beloved wishing rhyme, but what happens when two wishes collide? Frustrated British publishing heiress Ana Weland wants to change her life. One busy day in London, she bumps into troubled young writer, Steve Gage, who has the beginnings of a fantasy story that may help her do just that, but before she can make her dream a reality, they both wish on an unusual star. Ana plunges into Steve’s story . . . literally . . . and her wise uncle George’s saying, “Every life has a story, and there’s life in every story,” takes on a profound meaning. Unexpectedly, Ana becomes a heroic character in Aurania, the quasi-medieval world Steve created, giving the people hope and rousing them to save their world, despite placing herself in mortal danger. Enter the magical world of STARLIGHT and experience a universe of life-changing adventures and romantic intrigue.“Visually eloquent.” “Highly imaginative.” “A must-read.”",
