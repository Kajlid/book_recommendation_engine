  "description": "Max blew out a sigh and said, \"Come on, Charlie-girl, play nice. It's too hot to argue.\" Forgetting about my determination not to look at him, I twisted my neck round to stare at him in disbelief. He didn't want to argue? When for the past 17 years that had been the sole basis of our relationship? The story goes that the first time I had kicked in the womb it had been when Max, a baby himself, had placed his hand against my mother's stomach. It had been the first, but certainly not the last, time I'd kicked him, and now suddenly he wasn't interested in a fight? Weird. Charlie has known Max her whole life, and wanted him ever since her hormones kicked in. If only he wasn’t such a disappearing, secret-keeping, disappointment, there’d have been no need for Emmanuel to get involved… Please note this story contains some mature language and content.",
