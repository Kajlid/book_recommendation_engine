  "description": "Two contrasting stories - The Necklace is a story of vanity, of two lives blighted by the loss of a diamond necklace, whilst The Pearls is the story of love and fear; both authors use the symbolism of jewels to illustrate the human condition. Guy de Maupassant was born near Dieppe in 1850. A friend of Flaubert, Zola, Daudet and Turgenev, he died in 1893. Isak Dinesen was the nom de plume of Karen Blixen who was born in Rungsted, Denmark, in 1885. She is the author of Seven Gothic Tales (1934) and Out of Africa (1937).",
