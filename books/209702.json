  "description": "The World is caught off guard by the sudden advances in technology, some are not happy about that at all.Bethany Anne's group needs to move into production, who is she going to hire for that position?Old enemies take a stronger stance at revenge than before.Helping others is a tall order, but TQB Rises to the Occasion!This is the second book in the second arc (books 08-14) for The Kurtherian Gambit. Now, the World is on Notice!**Please note, as mentioned in another review, there is flagrantly foul language in this novel. The main character does not have a problem with cussing, just uninspired cussing.If you haven't read the previous books, you will need to go back to #1 (the book does not explain the characters and previous relationships / deeds).",
