And in that place of death, Briar Rose is plunged into a deep sleep…Ever since she was a child, Rebecca has been enchanted by her grandmother Gemma’s stories of Briar Rose.

Her vow sends Becca on a remarkable journey to uncover the truth of Gemma’s astonishing claim: I am Briar Rose.Jane Yolen’s graceful retelling of the German folktale of “Briar Rose”—also known as “Sleeping Beauty”—sets the story amid forests patrolled by the German army during World War II.
