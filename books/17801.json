  "title": "Awetizm: A Hidden Key to Our Spiritual Magnificence",
  "description": "Lyrica is born, seemingly unreachable. With a recommendation to institutionalize her and a diagnosis of autism, her mother, Gayle, won't give up. With love and patience she stops at nothing to penetrate her daughter's wall. The barrier is breached and Gayle is welcomed into Lyrica's world. While Gayle attempts to teach her daughter, she discovers that Lyrica is an enlightened spiritual being, sharing wisdom beyond this world. As Gayle opens up to Lyrica's gifts, miraculous events begin to shape her life. Lyrica and friends, Leslie, Kellen, and Sara, write how they love their lives in autism and are here with a grand purpose. They share their mystical abilities, including telepathy, soul traveling, healing, oneness, gridding Earth energy, and communing with angels. Lyrica reveals that autistic souls are wired at a higher frequency that enables them to experience multidimensional worlds. Written by mother and daughter, this book will challenge every conventional belief of autism, religion, and our world.",
