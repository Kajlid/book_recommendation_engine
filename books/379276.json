  "title": "Starkweather: Inside the Mind of a Teenage Killer",
  "description": "In January of 1958, seventeen-year-old Charlie Starkweather killed eleven people in a grisly spree of cold-blooded murder in his hometown and neighboring towns in Nebraska. The story shocked America and cast Starkweather and his fifteen-year-old girlfriend, Caril Fugate, in the crime scene spotlight, a vivid embodiment of the dark side of the heartland. First published in 1976, this revised edition contains previously classified notes from Starkweather's prison journal and transcripts of the interviews between Starkweather and the prison psychologist, conducted as the teen awaited execution. Allen also provides further evidence that Fugate, often regarded as a kidnap victim, was indeed an accomplice in the murders.",
