  "description": "“I’d say it’s nice to meet you, but I’ve never been a good liar.”That’s his initial offense against me.Don’t worry—there’s plenty more where that came from.Landon Winters is colder than his last name suggests.Cruel and callous too.I’m certain he finds pleasure in making others miserable.He’s a billionaire by his own making—not satisfied with simply inheriting a white collar and silver spoon.Landon's arrogance is so thick I could choke on the stench alone.He’s also responsible for gouging a jaded chip to my shoulder.The only saving grace is never having to see him again.Wishful thinking is a fickle beast.My boss just announced that Landon is my latest client.I’ll need to impress him or kiss my promotion goodbye.Either way, this is my chance to get even.Revenge is all I see.The price for redemption is steep.Landon will pay a small fortune in humiliation.And I’ll walk away filthy rich in vindication.",
