Jude's house is kept dark, and no one talks muchâ€•it's been that way since his little sister drowned in a swimming pool seven years ago when Jude was supposed to be watching her. Now, Jude is finally, finally starting to live. Really live. And then, life spins out of control. Again. Acclaimed author James Preller explores life, death, love, faith, and resilience in his first young adult novel that will grip readers from the book's dramatic first few pages to its emotional end.",
