  "title": "Border Run",
  "description": "On the Burmese border, two naïve backpackers, Will and Jake, follow a tour guide into the jungle, tantalized by the possibility of dalliances with the tribal women who live there. At an idyllic waterfall, they discover that nothing is as it seems and their guide has his own agenda. It is not long before the two young men slip into a nightmarish spiral of murder and moral decay, their chance of survival determined by a game of hide-and-seek played out with deadly crossbows. As the stakes get increasingly higher, the bonds of friendship are tested and lives are put on the line. Simon Lewis has written a gripping, amphetamine-paced novel about the hidden perils that can lurk in paradise, and the fine line that we draw for ourselves between what is “civilized” and what is not.",
