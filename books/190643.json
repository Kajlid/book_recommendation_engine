  "description": "William G. Davies Jr. explodes with this lengthy book of short poems, concise and deliberate, with compression that reads effortlessly. With a voice as familiar as a remembered friend, Davies writes about the world, inviting us to see it as he does, through the lens of a masterful poet at the top of his game. Finally approachable poetry we can all call our own.\"William G. Davies Jr. gives us small, concise, clear minded poems that shine and sing with clarity. \"Evening settles like a soft comb through mahogany hair...\" We enter each poem as an intimate guest, welcomed like, \"the clatter of supper dishes stacked one on top of the other, still warm.\" The reader will come away with this sense of being there and being loved through all the different life experiences. Well worth the read.\"Irene KoronasPoetry Editor: Wilderness House Literary Review \"A collection of short, sharp jabs at the world, each poem a sliver of wisdom distilled, arresting as a face suddenly appearing in a dusty window.\"Justin LoweBluepepper",
