  "description": "Do you ever have questions about life, such as why doesn t it seem to make sense? Or have you ever wondered why things happen as they do? Do you ever ask what is life really about? Perhaps life is like a game, but we don t know the rules and we don t know how to win. What if we are all playing the same game of life, but on different levels? Is the game we play competing with others, or only with ourselves? Is life to be considered as play, rather than the heavy drama it seems sometimes? What are the rules and how do we discover them? Universal Principles and Spiritual Truths answer these questions. They always were, are, and forever will be. They are unchangeable and a solid foundation on which to build your life.Why The Three Little Pigs? You'll have to read the book to discover the secrets they unlock that have been lost for over 100 years!",
