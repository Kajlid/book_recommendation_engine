  "description": "Chased by thugs, San Francisco poet Miranda Stead plunges through a door to what she thinks is safety. Instead, she finds herself surrounded by a bunch of paranoid, robe-wearing people who can read her thoughts. And then he steps up: tall, dark, amber-eyed, gorgeous Sariel Valasay - lured by her mind probably, and its deliciously wrong ideas.Sariel knows no ordinary human should have been able to break through to their world, but here she is, all lush curves, red hair, and snappy comebacks. As a member of the ancient Les Croyant des Trois, Sariel is sworn to protect her kind from the dark forces always at work. He never thought he'd have to protect her from his own desires. A simple touch would erase all memories of the evening from Miranda's mind. Tomorrow, he'll make her forget. Tonight, he only wants to make her believe.",
