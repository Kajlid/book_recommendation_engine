  "description": "Brides of Caralon - Rituals of Passion By Lacey Alexander Book One in the Brides of Caralon series. When Maven, the eldest daughter of Caralon's mighty ruler, is given in marriage to the fearsome Dane of Rawley, she's horrified. Bad enough that she should be any man's possession, but she's heard the dreadful tales about Dane, tales of force and brutality. She goes into the marriage refusing to submit to him in any wayâ€”the only problem is, the sensuously forceful Dane demands her submission, especially in his bed, and he's determined to get it. As Maven begins to clash with the Beast of Rawley, she needs all her wits about her to win their erotic battle for control.",
