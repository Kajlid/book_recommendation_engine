  "description": "The beginning doesn’t always determine the endSummer Anderson is a 23 year old reality TV star, the Hollywood darling, the daughter of a famous film producer and his equally famous actress wife. The Anderson’s are as close to Hollywood royalty as you can get. Her network show “Days of Summer” is an internet hit, making her a star in her own right overnight, and along with it, a tail of paparazzi and media following her every move. Although she relished the attention in the beginning, a year later, she feels dazed and disillusioned with her fake real life. But one night, on her way to an award ceremony after party, Summer is kidnapped and is driven away from the only type of life she has ever known. That night, she finds herself handcuffed to her kidnapper in a dingy motel bed, unsure what her future now holds. Casey Stewart is a desperate man forced to do the unimaginable to save his family. But now his conscience is eating away at him, the moment he saw Summer and the terror in her eyes when she realised what was happening, he knew that he had changed the direction of his life forever. Can two people from two separate worlds, who come together in the worst possible way, find their way back to happiness, in a world they don’t know.",
