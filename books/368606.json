Carver learned life's tough lessons on the streets, so when an unexpected inheritance sends him to the Star Lake Lodge to claim his half, he's expecting trouble. Being greeted with open arms by the whole Lawrence gang--feisty Aunt Sophy and calm Uncle Ben, clearly off-limits Dru and her young son, Tate--just convinces him they're working an angle, and he's determined to uncover it.

Hard-eyed J.D.'s ability to push all her buttons--some of which haven't been pushed in way too long--just proves how wrong he is for her. So why does her son hero-worship the guy? And why does her heart clench when he gets that \"nose pressed against the candy shop window\" look on his faceIn Love...and All Shook UpThey thought they knew everything their lives had to offer...until they met. Can a failed good girl and a guy who never caught a break learn to believe in one another long enough to trust their love?",
