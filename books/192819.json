Captain Carl Ramsey is an ex-Earth Navy pilot whose crew won’t let him fly his own ship. The pilot is his ex-wife, the mechanic is a drunk, and the chief of security is from a predatory species. Instead of a star-drive to travel through the astral space between worlds, the ship’s wizard does it by hand.Mission 1: Salvage TroubleA salvage mission turns into a rescue, and no good deed goes unpunished. With two refugees onboard, the Mobius crew is hounded by bounty hunters, border partols, and corporate enforcers.Mission 2: A Smuggler’s Conscience“Don’t open the package.” It’s the smuggler’s credo for good reason. When the Mobius crew takes a peek at their illicit cargo, the entire job takes an about-face.Mission 3: Poets and PiracyThe Mobius crew gets caught in a turf war between a pirate fleet and a galactic criminal syndicate. The trick is getting everyone out alive (and maybe getting paid in the process).Mission 4: To Err is AzrinSometimes you can’t go home again.

Can the rest of the crew bail her out of an old feud gone horribly wrong?Bonus Short Story: Guardian of the Plundered Tomes (Black Ocean #4.5)Mordecai The Brown has been on the run from the Convocation for decades.
