  "title": "Social Taboo: A Male Victim of Domestic Violence Speaks",
  "description": "This hard hitting book describes domestic violence from the male victim's point of view. Male victims of domestic violence are not only victimized by abusive women but also by a justice system that refuses to protect men from violent women. This book details how local law enforcement agencies do not take action to deter female to male domestic violence. Even when allegations of abuse are reported and clearly documented in police reports. For decades, law enforcement agencies have not been properly trained to identify female batterers or false reporters, largely because of political considerations. Therefore, responding officers rarely question women's statements during a report because they lack training and fall back on faulty gender stereotypes. In most cases, female batterers count on gender stereotypes when making a false allegation. Using the harmful myth of \"men are abusers\" and “women are victims” in domestic violence situations gives female batterers even more power and control over their male victims. However, when men report abuse they will often receive no sympathy or protection from their batterer. Abused men, more often than not, are arrested when woman provide a flimsy statement to hide the abuse she inflicted on her victim. This book highlights a case in shocking detail were an abusive woman used the justice system as one of many tools of domestic violence. The abusive woman described in this case is a public school teacher in Arizona and may be in a classroom teaching your child today! As this book highlights, there is a real and inherent danger to the general public when female batters are not arrested when men report domestic violence. Clearly, when male domestic violence victims lose, we all do.",
