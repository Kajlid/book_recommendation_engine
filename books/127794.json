  "description": "After WW II, Lucilla Eliot's soldier son George and his beautiful wife Nadine lived with their five children. They acquired an ancient pilgrim's inn on the river, that touches not only its new owners but also those strangers who stop there for a rest on their pilgrimages.Sally Adair had never seen this face before, but as she studied the unfinished portrait of David Eliot, her untried heart knew the meaning of love.

This is an unforgettable story, one that will hold you spellbound as you enter the portals of Pilgrim's Inn...",
