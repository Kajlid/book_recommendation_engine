  "description": "Some people call me an assassin, personally, I prefer the term bounty hunter.In a world where magic is hidden from the general population, I'm hired to keep our secrets safe and take care of rogues by whatever means necessary.When I accidentally targeted the wrong person, the Supernatural Bureau of Investigation offered me a deal -- go to jail or work for them. Their first official request was to locate a vampire I thought I killed years ago. Â My ex-boyfriend. Now I'm ordered to deliver him to them without harming a hair on his gorgeous head.That was going to be a problem. By the time I found him, he was going to wish he had stayed dead.\nSupernatural Slayer is an action-packed urban fantasy romp through Barcelona with an assorted cast of witches, vampires, and shifters. It may also feature a snarky troll or two.\n\"No human beings were harmed in the writing of this book -- only supernaturals.\"",
