  "description": "Heartbreakingly beautiful and devastatingly annoying, Timaeus Lambros, a deaf, former military translator, has just been assigned as my co-teacher for the rest of the school year. His stupid-hot face gets on my nerves. So does his well-fitting jeans. Charming and gorgeous men like him should not be teachers. They should be locked away in a storage closet... with me.But that’s just a teachers’ lounge fantasy with a big dreamy sigh attached. Tim and I can never be a thing. He’s broody and closed off, while I’m the new owner of a one-way ticket back to Costa Rica, thanks to budget cuts. But my Abuelita always said life wasn’t a fairytale. So even if Tim does have a magical tongue and a dreamy body, we still might not get a happily ever after.",
