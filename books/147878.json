  "description": "If you have any interest in poker or gambling, you will enjoy reading about the Tiltboys. Even casual poker fans will recognize Phil Gordon, the ringleader of the bunch, as the expert commentator on Bravo's \"Celebrity Poker Showdown.\" Imagine the guys from \"Animal House\" with high SAT scores. They are a bunch of buddies who went to Stanford together and began a weekly poker game that led to weekend trips to Las Vegas and, for a few of them, to a life of playing poker professionally. Phil Gordon made dot.com millions and is now living the good life in the poker world and on television. Perry Friedman won a World Series of Poker event a couple years ago. While Dave \"Diceboy\" Lambert is, according to the other Tiltboys, the luckiest human being on the planet. It's \"Swingers\"-meets-\"Rounders.\" Read these true tales of gambling, friendship, and Wednesday night poker. These anecdotes are a testament to just how amusing a life devoted to excess and debauchery can be.",
