  "title": "Daws: The Story of Dawson Trotman, Founder of the Navigators",
  "description": "In the mid-twenties, the future founder of The Navigators gave little evidence of his 'vocation': he liked to stunt-drive his jalopy, he became a pool shark, and following graduation from high school, he realized that 'he could not gain mastery over lying and stealing.' The transformation of this potential delinquent into the youth-evangelist who established Navigator Homes is a fascinating story as told by a colleague who worked with him for many years... Ms. Skinner's book captures her subject's zest for life, his phenomenal energy, and also his faults.--Family Life",
