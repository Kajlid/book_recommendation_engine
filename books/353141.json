  "description": "THE SON WILL RISE Prince Zuko is banished from the Fire Nation by his own father, Fire Lord Ozai. Horribly scarred and stripped of everything he holds dear, Zuko wanders the earth for almost three years in search of his only chance at the Avatar, a mystical being who once kept the four nations in balance. All around him, people whisper that this is an impossible task—the Avatar, after all, disappeared a century ago—but Zuko defiantly continues the search. His quest is all he has left.",
