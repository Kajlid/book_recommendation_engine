  "description": "Five years have passed since Caitlin Tierney was kidnapped from New Haven, a secret facility for gifted children. Deemed a threat to society by the government’s Anomaly Control Team for her empathetic and telekinetic powers, Caity was implanted with a chip meant to neutralize her abilities and keep her on the ACT’s radar.Now Caity is trying to live the life of a normal 21-year-old but her nightmares are getting worse. She’s haunted by the past she can’t remember, the painful experiments she endured in New Haven and Chase Taylor, the love she lost.When a mysterious letter arrives one day and promises Caity answers to her forgotten life, she suddenly finds herself thrown back into the world of New Haven…and into the arms of her old flame. For once it seems like everything will be alright, but how much has New Haven really changed? And how much has Chase changed?While conflicted by the dark secrets she uncovers about New Haven and her beloved Chase, Caity stumbles upon a group of Anomalies who call themselves The Punks. They’re charming and unexpectedly, Caity finds herself drawn into their small family…and to their leader, the quiet, enigmatic Kismet.Ultimately, Caity must decide where her loyalty lies: is it with her first true love Chase and the cloaked objectives of New Haven? Or is it with the peaceful, nomadic Punks?And how far over the line will she be willing to go for either one?",
