  "description": "This book is part of a dark kinky fiction trilogy and may disturb some readers. The full warning is at the bottom. This is not a standalone read.Zorie is lost, again.Friends can become enemies and enemies can become friends.What is a man who declares himself your knight in cracked and bloody armor, when he seems to be leading you to your doom?Mavros, once known as Mister Black, has vanished.Zorie and Grimm are in the hands of unscrupulous men. She will emerge either dead, enslaved, or with revenge in her heart, and a lethal hairpin in her hand to kill those who have hurt the innocent.Hairpin or bullet, dead is dead.WARNINGThis Dark Hearts trilogy explores horror and thriller territory. You’ll find some very graphic scenes oozing from the pages. In the first book you won’t find anything more than hints of romance, as the romance is on drip-feed speed. The main man, the antihero, may not even end up being who most readers expect him to be.",
