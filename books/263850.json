  "description": "Dove Wheeler doesn’t have many friends. The only one she ever got close to left her to go live with a vampire. Even thinking the word gives her chills, but in the best way possible. She spends hours in the library researching who they are and where they come from until she can’t stand it any longer and goes looking for them on her own. What she doesn’t expect is to find two of them, a set of twins, that turns her world upside down.  Once Ezra and Erik Marcellus were changed to vampires, they tried to put everything in their past behind them and start fresh. They love their new family and everything about their new lives, but there’s always the worry that one day they will have to separate. Vampires don’t share their mates, so why does it feel like that’s exactly what they want? When they find a young woman snooping around, suddenly all of their fears come true. They’re both ready to lay their claim, but they’re not prepared for which one she’ll choose.  Warning: It’s the first time we’ve written vampires, so go easy on us. Enjoy this brand new series that features a coven of five and read about how all of them find love.
