  "title": "Thom Blood",
  "description": "Thom Blood is the second installment in the Blood Underground series by author Terence Jackson. Blood Underground chronicles the lives of the vampires and their minions who inhabit the unused and deserted train tunnels that crisscross underneath the city of London. Book I introduced Liam Thackeray, the oldest – and sometimes wisest – of the undead tunnel dwellers who call themselves Thavs – Tunnel Housed and Vampire. The vampires spend their days in the tunnels and abandoned railcars within them, going out at night to feed and walk among the unsuspecting living. And not all vampires are evil as they try to hang on to their humanness, with varying degrees of success. Book II continues Liam’s story, his depression and loss, and his need for a distraction from it. Little does he know but he’s about to get more than he bargained for. We meet some new characters and see the return of a favorite from Book I. There are twists and turns, and the end is just the beginning.",
