  "description": "From the co-author of Black Mass comes a gripping YA novel inspired by the true story of a young man's false imprisonment for murder -- and those who fought to free him.On a hot summer night in the late 1980s, in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury, a twelve-year-old African-American girl was sitting on a mailbox talking with her friends when she became the innocent victim of gang-related gunfire. Amid public outcry, an immediate manhunt was on to catch the murderer, and a young African-American man was quickly apprehended, charged, and -- wrongly -- convicted of the crime. Dick Lehr, a former reporter for the Boston Globe's famous Spotlight Team who investigated this case for the newspaper, now turns the story into Trell,  a page-turning novel about the daughter of an imprisoned man who persuades a reporter and a lawyer to help her prove her father's innocence. What pieces of evidence might have been overlooked? Can they manage to get to the truth before a dangerous character from the neighborhood gets to them?",
