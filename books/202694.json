  "description": "Christy is going to Europe! It’s a three-week outreach trip with Doug, Katie, and Tracy. First stop is London for some sightseeing, and then on to a castle in the English countryside for group training. Christy is so excited to be headed for Belfast with her friends. Their roommate, Sierra Jensen, adds lots of energy to their late night conversations along with Katie. Why is it that Tracy seems to be avoiding the merriment? Or is it Christy that she's avoiding? The tension grows and Christy must evaluate her closest relationships. In her heart she knows she's been untrue to herself and also to one of the greatest guys she's ever known. Difficult conversations follow and it seems everything has been made right. That is, until all the plans go topsy-turvy at the last minute and Christy must face her fears. Will she be able to take on the challenge even when she can’t foresee the end result? If she can go the distance and trust God more than ever before, Christy will discover that a promise really can last forever.",
