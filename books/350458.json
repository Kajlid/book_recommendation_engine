  "description": "When B-list syndicated TV star Lucas runs into Gaming-goth-geek Trent in the hotel bar the night before the convention starts, he isn't expecting to become attached. And since Trent is obviously out of touch with television, Lucas figures he's safe using his 'con name', Bill Speare. When Trent-- Mainstream Video clerk and goth with big dreams--meets a stellar hottie who seems to be into him, he goes with it, happy to be free of his recent dry spell.But one night turns into so much more, and when he finds out that his very temporary lover has been lying to him about something as unimportant yet vital as his name, he gets... miffed. Thanks to a new acquaintance, Cindy Lou, Trent works through his anger in a drunken evening, and when he finally goes to see Bill --Lucas-- he's figured it all out.So has Lucas, and the two men do what comes naturally to them, but can they come to an explosive and enjoyable conclusion?",
