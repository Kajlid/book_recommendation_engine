  "title": "AMUNDSEN OF THE ARCTICS",
  "description": "Cast yourself back to the age of Arctic exploration, when men like Peary, Cook, Scott, and Shackleton were striving to reach the Poles. Perhaps the greatest explorer of them all, the \"Napoleon of the Polar regions,\" was the Norwegian, Roald Amundsen.Amundsen was a different type of leader. He brought an unmatched professionalism to the science of exploration in addition to being a natural motivator. He was fearless and open to learning from other cultures. He was also a practical man. It was hard for him to lie, but he did so on at least two occasions when he felt deception was justified. He loved animals, yet he made the difficult decision on one expedition to kill most of his huskies to provide fresh meat to the remaining dogs.The British criticized Amundsen and misrepresented his achievements. Americans loved Amundsen and provided much of his money by paying for lecture tours or making donations. President Theodore Roosevelt wrote to Amundsen after each of two expeditions.Who was the real Amundsen? Was he as underhanded as the British made out? Or was he a hero as most Americans believed?",
