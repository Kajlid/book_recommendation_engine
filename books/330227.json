  "title": "A Peep Behind the Scenes",
  "description": "Behind many smiling faces there hides a hurting heart, and for what may appear to be glamorous, there is usually a high price to pay. Mrs. Walton gives us a glimpse into the life of a disillusioned young actress. In her fabricated world of glamour and glitz, Rosalie finds solace in the words of a gentle old man who gives her a picture of a Shepherd who loves and cares for her. Her travels take on new meaning as she shares with the “down-and-outters” about this wonderful Shepherd who loves them too. This profound century-old story is still relevant in today’s entertainment-enmeshed culture. Often, hidden behind smiling faces are hurting hearts, and that which is attractive and alluring may be a facade, concealing the hard reality of life behind the scenes. This dramatic book is both powerful and sensitive, and sold over two and a half million copies in the 19th Century! It continues to be a favorite among our collectors.",
