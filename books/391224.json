  "description": "Broadway darling Nicky Avery gives commanding performances on stage, but when he comes home at night, it's Devon Turner who commands him. Devon — that's \"Sir\" to Nicky, of course—owns Nicky heart and soul, and neither of them could possibly be happier with that. This collection of vignettes explores the gifts of submission and domination—Nicky and Devon's ultimate expression of love and trust. The ten short stories range from sweet and sensual to hot and hardcore, from cross-dressing to knife play, and so much more. Dom or sub, curious beginner or 24/7 lifestyler, the stories in Sublime will tease and tantalize, arouse and thrill. And don't mind Devon and Nicky . . . they like to be watched anyway. (Stories include \"All-Nighter,\" \"Down in the Woodshop,\" \"Stainless Steel,\" \"Pretty,\" \"Milk Run,\" \"Too Much,\" \"A Hairy Situation,\" \"Wrapped Up,\" \"One for the Road,\" and \"Pony Up.\")",
