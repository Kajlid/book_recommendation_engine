  "description": "In the Lands of the North, a perennial wonderland of forests and snow, stands a castle that is home to Nicholas Claus and his Elves. There, lonely Clara wiles away her time alone, waiting until the day she is old enough to begin making the toys that Nicholas delivers each year during the holiday season. One day, a mischievous Faerie named Bristlefiend manipulates Clara into taking a mysterious journey to the Lands of the South, from where she must return before time runs out or else remain trapped for many years. Accompanied only by her magical flying blanket, and her penchant for curiosity, Clara enters the world of humans, a place filled with many fascinating sights and sounds. While exploring the wonders of city life, Clara learns the meaning of selflessness and sacrifice, and discovers the values of home and family with the help of some unlikely characters she meets along the way.",
