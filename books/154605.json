Brilliant, provocative, and absolutely spellbinding.”  — Lauren Myracle, New York Times bestselling author of The Infinite Moment of Us  “Maggie Lehrman nimbly reveals secrets wrapped around our most basic need. The Cost of All Things is a walk of the soul.”  — Rita Williams-Garcia, Coretta Scott King Author Award Winner",
