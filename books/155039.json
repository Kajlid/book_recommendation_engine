  "title": "Pride of the Plains",
  "description": "With three strong interweaving plot lines, the last book in the series tackles the themes of survival and conservation. Huru and Kimya have formed a small pride with mates Battlescars and Blackmane. Six cubs have been added to the pride's number. The eldest of these, Moja, has gone missing. He must learn to survive on his own. Meanwhile as leaders of the pride, Battlescars and Blackmane face new challenges to their authority, and the Game Park itself is in peril, when a tremendous fire sweeps across it, killing many of the animals. With its gripping narrative and strong characterisation, this is a compelling conclusion to the story of the twin lionesses we first encountered at Lingmere Zoo.",
