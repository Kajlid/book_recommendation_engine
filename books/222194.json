Her ex-boyfriend-turned-sheriff, Parker Montgomery, never forgave her for dumping his Camaro into the pond before she left town. Determined to make her pay, Parker arrests her the moment she enters town, but she manages to smooth talk her way out of trouble. However, it soon becomes difficult to suppress her lingering feelings for Parker when she starts spending more and more time with him.Parker suffers in silence with anxiety and nightmares due to his dark past. After serving in the army for nearly eight years, he came back to Prospect to start anew.

She’s only in town for a week and then she’s going to do the very thing she did ten years ago, unless Parker can find some way to convince her to stay.",
