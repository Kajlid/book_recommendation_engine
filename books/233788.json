  "description": "Librarian Note: See Alternate Cover Edition HERE.What if one day, having led a fairly fulfilling life, you receive a mysterious letter that could lead you to finding your birth parents? Would you embark on an unknown journey to a remote fishermen’s village somewhere on the Italian coast having never travelled before or even knowing where you’re going? This is exactly what the brave Carina, an orphan who was raised in an Italian convent did. “Turning her key she rushes through the door and runs up the narrow steep stairs to her apartment. Her body now surging with curiosity, fear and unrest, her heart pounding in her chest, she opens her apartment door and slams it behind her. She’s never gotten a letter before!” What, or more importantly, who does she encounter when she finally arrives? Can she unlock the truth and mysteries to her past or does she discover much more than she had bargained for? “Carina’s stomach is in knots. Partly because she can’t get the handsome stranger out of her mind, but more-so due to not quite knowing what she’s gotten herself into. It’s too late to turn around now, she thinks. She’ll just have to muster up the courage, push on and see where it leads.” Pack your bags, travel with her, and help her unravel the mysteries of her past!",
