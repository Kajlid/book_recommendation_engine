  "description": "A lady reporter? Preposterous.In a time when other young women are learning the art of pouring the perfect cup of tea, Lady Hazel Winchester dreams of a front page byline. Just because the war with the Americas is over doesn’t mean there isn’t a story hiding in the aether tinged streets of London and she means to uncover it.But perhaps the biggest story of all is the secret she’s keeping about herself.Combining steampunk and Victorian aesthetics, Lady of Vision is a clean romance for anyone who loves a good, slightly fantastical, historical mystery.",
