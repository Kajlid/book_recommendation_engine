  "description": "As Amanda Jamison, Ariel Kirkwood suffered stoically through the daily traumas of a popular soap opera. She was adored by her loyal fans, as well as the real people in her life. Booth De Witt had written his greatest script: from the pain of a bitter marriage came a bitingly brilliant story. Ariel knew she wanted to play the scheming wife -- a complete change from her sweet daytime heroine. But Ariel the actress awakened the ghosts of Booth's past with her eerily perfect portrayal of his ex-wife . . . and Ariel the woman broke through his hardened cynicism, tempting him to love again.",
