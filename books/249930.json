In prose that is tender and compelling, Judy MacLeon brings her contemporary take on Shakespeare's classic play to vivid life. Rosemary and Juliet is a fast-paced novel that finds two girls on the edge of womanhood - and on the brink of disaster. But more than that, Rosemary and Juliet is about the turbulent intensity of first love and the conflict between the expectations of parents and the undeniable sexual realities lived by their children.",
