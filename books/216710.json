  "description": "The MacKintosh clan somehow made love look so bloody appealing…James MacKintosh has watched his brothers find the perfect woman one after the other, but for him, he had yet to stumble across one who didn’t make him want to put an ocean between them. So he did, thinking a life in New York would put his discontent out of sight and out of mind.Love was the last thing she wanted…New York suffragette Primrose Eames had more than enough men trying to control her already. There was no chance she’d relent and marry again, despite her brothers’ dogged “encouragement” on the matter. More than anything, she wanted independence and the freedom to live life on her own terms. A husband would only serve to snatch that dream away from her forever.What Prim needed was a decoy and James MacKintosh was just the man for the job. Having failed in his search for the perfect woman to wed, James is happy to help Prim, but only because avoiding matchmakers serves his purpose as well. However, James soon discovers that even a fictitious courtship with a woman set on never remarrying has its challenges.For Prim, the courtship begins to feel all too real. James is too charming, too engaging, and so supportive of her cause. It doesn’t take long before she realizes there is a certain freedom to be found in marriage to the right sort of man. If the right sort of man were interested in marriage, that is.It’s only when betrayal and despair leave them both longing for more in their lives that they realize the importance of a love worth having, and a question worth asking.It’s only when betrayal and despair leave them both longing for more in their lives that they realize the importance of a love worth having, and a question worth asking.",
