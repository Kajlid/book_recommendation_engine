  "description": "When Hillary and her girlfriends rent a country house for their summer vacation it is a pleasant surprise to find that its secretive and kinky owner, Darius Harwood, seems to be the most desirable man in the locale. That is, before Hillary meets Haldane, the blond and beautifully proportioned Norwegian sailor who works nearby. Intrigued by the sexual allure of two very different men, Hillary can't resist exploring the possibilities. But these opportunities for misbehavior quickly lead her into a tricky situation, and she is forced to make the most difficult decision of her life.",
