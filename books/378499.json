  "title": "Leather Boys",
  "description": "Start your engines, mount up, and get ready for the ride of a life-time... Sexy gay fiction author Devlin Young donned his helmet, black leather jacket, and jeans. Then he mounted his Kawasaki and set off for what he anticipated would be a wild ride to Sturgis. There were thousands of motorcycles, thousands of men, but only one Sam Rhodes. When web-designer Sam Rhodes joined a local group called The Leather Boys, he wasn't quite sure what to expect, but he knew what it was he wanted. Amidst the decadence and insanity of the monster event, all Sam could think about was what it would be like to share an erotic experience with the deliciously naughty Dev Young. Never one to apologize for who he is, or who he desires, Devlin doesn't understand Sam's reluctance to openly explore their relationship or his wish to keep their liaisons confined to the darkness of their tents while at the rally. Then he crosses swords with a tough-as-nails biker who both taunts and tempts him, unleashing a potentially dangerous craving and pushing Dev to make a choice.",
