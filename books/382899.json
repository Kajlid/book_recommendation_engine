  "title": "The Spirit of Food: 34 Writers on Feasting and Fasting toward God",
  "description": "You are invited to a feast for the senses and the spirit! Thirty-four adventurous writers open their kitchens, their recipe files, and their hearts to illustrate the many unexpected ways that food draws us closer to god, to community, and to creation. All bring a keen eye and palate to the larger questions of the role of food-both its presence and its absence-in the life of our bodies and spirits. Their essays take us to a canadian wheat farm, a backyard tomato garden in cincinnati, an organic farm in maine; into a kosher kitchen, a line of hurricane katrina survivors as they wait to be fed, a church basement for a thirty-hour fast; inside the translucent layers of an onion that transport us to a meditation on heaven, to a church potluck, and to many other places and ways we can experience sacramental eating. In a time of great interest and equal confusion over the place of food in our lives, this rich collection, which includes personal recipes, will delight the senses, feed the spirit, enlarge our understanding, and deepen our ability to & eat and drink to the glory of god. &featuring the writings ofrobert farrar capon, wendell berry, lauren winner, luci shaw, andre dubus, jeanne murray walker, brian volck, and many others,including original recipies!",
