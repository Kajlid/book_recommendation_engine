  "description": "NO APOCALYPSE HANDBOOK Sandra and Molly were two typical office workers enjoying their lives, which consisted primarily of going to work, shopping and looking for cute guys. Then their world came to a disastrous end brought about by a fast-acting, airborne virus that decimated the the world's population. Now the girls live in the abandoned office building in which they once worked surrounded by a new and dangerous landscape; one where mutated animals roam the streets and giant birds soar through the empty skies; where frightening humanoid bat creatures have appeared to challenge humans for supremacy of the earth. What are two attractive, intelligent, single girls suppose to do now...other than merely hunt for food and try to stay alive? Well, there are still malls, albeit much less crowded, and though rare, a few cute guys still out there. So even if the apocalypse sucks, Sandra and Molly are not about to let it cramp their style. Writer Peggy Chambers offers up a truly unique, twisty adventure with two of the most likeable heroines you'll ever meet. \"The Apocalypse Sucks,\" is a pulp mash-up readers are sure to enjoy from cover to cover.",
