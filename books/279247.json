  "description": "MusicalMusic and Lyrics by William Finn. Book by William Finn and James Lapine. A seamless pairing of March of the Falsettos and Falsettoland, acclaimed off Broadway musicals written nearly a decade apart, Falsettos won 1992 Tony Awards for best book and musical score. It is the jaunty tale of Marvin who leaves his wife and young son to live with another man. His ex wife marries his psychiatrist, and Marvin ends up alone. Two years later, Marvin is reunited with his lover on the eve of his son's bar mitzvah, just as AIDS is beginning its insidious spread. \"Exhilarating and heartbreaking.... Falsettoland gains exponentially in power by being seen only 15 minutes, instead of 9 years, after the first allment.\"---The New York Times \"A masterly feat of comic storytelling and ... visionary musical theater.\"---Variety \"What a treasure this brave and hilarious, charming, disarming, loaded with honest sentiment and cynicism.\"-- The New York Newsday",
