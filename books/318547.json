  "description": "They were legends based on myths—myths of fantasy, power, and black magic. The tales of their tours were the most outrageous in the already excess-laden annals of modern music. The era of Led Zeppelin personified sex, drugs, and rock & roll. Based on interviews with the band's musicians, friends, employees, and lovers, Hammer of the Gods tells the shocking story of Led Zeppelin's successes and excesses in the 70s—when Zeppelin reigned as the industry's biggest act. Exclusive sources. Documents. Interviews. Photos. Revelations about a band—and an industry—at its shameless peak. Read it all, and see why Hammer of the Gods is a classic of rock journalism in its own right.",
