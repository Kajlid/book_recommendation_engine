  "description": "Hello I'm Vishnu, not Vishnu Sharma or Vishnu Ahmed or Vishnu whatever. I'm Lord Vishnu, one of the members of Trinity or you can simply say I'm one of the Tridevs, and this is my story. You must have heard many stories about me, but I can bet that here you will find me in a new or you may call it a contemporary avatar. Actually this is about…wait, why am I telling you everything now... You better read this and give me your feedback. Oops you can't give me your feedback unless you…you know what I mean… Jokes apart if you find it interesting or even not, just shut your eyes once and think about me, I will get your signal.",
