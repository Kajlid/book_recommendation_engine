Is she the savior prophesied in the ancient writings of Moses? Or is she an innocent child being manipulated by religious zealots? Determined to uncover the truth, Brandt and his fianc?e, archaeologist Rebecca Monroe, embark upon a perilous journey that will carry them across three continents and through the annals of history, as they race to distinguish fact from myth before they are overtaken by men who will do anything ? even kill ? to protect an ancient lie. Every step they take brings the world closer to the brink of religious war, until Rebecca and Brandt are forced to decide once and for all what price they?re willing to pay for peace.",
