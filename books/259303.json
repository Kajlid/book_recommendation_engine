  "description": "BOTTLENECK traces the messy, alcoholic life of writer Paul Fuhr from his days as an insecure James Bond-loving teenager all the way to his bleary-eyed parenthood, when nearly every one of his kids’ diaper changes came against the headwind of a hangover. From stealing his very first drink (two terrible bottles of Zima) to breaking out of a detox center many decades later, BOTTLENECK charts the aimless trajectory of an alcoholic who refuses to acknowledge that he’s an alcoholic. Fuhr’s memoir is much more than a chronicle of the quiet corrosion of BOTTLENECK is a darkly funny, occasionally artful account of deserts, death, disillusionment, DUIs, narrow escapes, unpaid bar tabs, unhappy reunions, unexpected friendships, epic lies, awkwardly admitted truths, rehab routines, horrible AA-meeting coffee, and staring down life without happy hour. It’s a book that reveals as much about relationships as it does addiction, showing what happens to families, friends, strangers and casual acquaintances when the sagging weight of alcoholism finally breaks loose, sweeping everyone and everything away.\"One of the best recovery memoirs of all time.\" - Anna David, New York Times bestselling author of PARTY GIRL\"Deserves to be a classic.\" - Raymond Benson, New York Times bestselling author of 007, THE BLACK STILETTO books and IN THE HUSH OF THE NIGHT\"Eye-opening and courageous.\" - Nancy Carr, author of LAST CALL\"Hilarious, heart-wrenching and unflinchingly honest.\" - Chuck Salmons, author of PATCH JOB and STARGAZER SUITE\"Reading this book was like experiencing a car crash in slow motion.\" - Chris Aguirre, \"Since Right Now\" podcast",
