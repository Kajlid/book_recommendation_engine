  "description": "Demons tore her life apart. Can a sexy Scottish Druid put it back together again?My name is Arabella, and I'm one hell of a mess. My entire life, I've been driven to protect and defend the innocent. But my history of epilepsy has kept me from getting into the military or law enforcement or any other career that would let me follow my dreams.I've never felt like I've belonged because of my condition, but at least I thought I knew who I was. But then I crashed my car on the interstate, and went flying straight into the clutches of a demon in human skin. I didn't think life could get crazier than that, until a hunky guy who seems to be the lovechild of Outlander and the Iron Druid dropped in and rescued me.But I'm not safe. Far from it. Because Brodie won't take me home. He insist that my life is a lie, and that I'm still in danger. He says the demons think I have something they want, and they won't stop coming for me until they get it.I should run far, far away from this man. But I'm drawn to him in a way I can't explain. Those startling green eyes see past my barriers and into the real me, in a way that I didn't think anyone ever could. And that wicked smile makes me wonder what else he can do with that tempting mouth. Plus, ever since the demons showed up, my seizures have been getting worse. I have a feeling its all connected, and if I can figure out how, I might just be able to cure myself.If I want to find out the truth, my only choice is to put my life in the hands of this charming, but dangerous Scotsman. And hope he doesn't break me in the process.Scroll up and get your copy today!",
