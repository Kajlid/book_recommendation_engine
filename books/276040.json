  "title": "Between The Battles",
  "description": "When a young Australian girl travels to the Vietnam war to work as a secretary, she has no idea how to begin to become accustomed to living in a warzone with others like herself. Few in number, and fitting into no category - neither military nor medical, neither local nationals nor US citizens - rules and regulations do not seem to apply to these women working in a warzone. Living by their wits as outcasts in a war-torn foreign land, they are subjected to bombardment and enemy firepower. As she later takes on the duties of a reporter and then civilian personnel officer, she begins to face the horror, brutality and corruption that is at the heart of war. Spanning the spectrum of emotional experiences, she comes to focus on the events between the battles, on the friends and lovers who are drawn closer through their extraordinary circumstances.",
