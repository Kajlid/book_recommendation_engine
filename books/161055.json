With the right combination of elements at just the right time, a couple can fall head over heels in love. That being said, blending two lives can get messier than any kitchen and also a hell of a lot harder to clean up.\"Molly's food truck took Austin by storm, and she's got more prospects than she knows what to do with. Her crazy ex is out of the picture, and she's moved in with her gorgeous boyfriend, Joe. She and Joe rarely see one another, and when they do, their time is squandered arguing. Molly's anxious to break this cycle because the tension between them is literally making her sick.After years alone and shattered, Molly has reawakened a part of Joe that he was sure couldn't be revived. He's terrified of losing her, but their combined baggage makes every step forward seem littered with landmines.

He's determined that he and Molly won't be the exception.Fate kicks in the door and rocks them to their very foundation. Boundaries are tested, tears shed, and Molly and Joe will question everything they think they know about themselves and each other.",
