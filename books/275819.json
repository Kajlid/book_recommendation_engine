  "description": "\"Unquestionably one of the best time travel novels I've ever read. Pearson has penned a proper page-turner laced with hilarity, poignancy and nostalgia.\"Toby Grant spends his days working for a digital marketing agency and his nights stressing about how unfair life is for his generation. With a thirtieth birthday only months away and his finances stretched to breaking point, it’s fair to say Toby is not a happy millennial. His parents’ generation had it so much easier … or did they?After a series of rather unfortunate events, Toby is offered an opportunity to discover exactly what life was like for his parents’ generation, courtesy of a journey back in time to 1969.However, life in pre-decimal Britain isn’t quite as simple as Toby envisaged. And neither, as it transpires, is time travel.\"If you love a good time travel adventure then Tuned Out should be top of your reading list. I laughed out loud, shed a few tears and genuinely couldn't put it down.\"",
