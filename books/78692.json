  "title": "1966 and All That",
  "description": "An utterly brilliant follow-up to the humour classic, by Britain's funniest writer. 75 years on from the first publication of 1066 and All That, Craig Brown takes over where Sellars and Yeatman left off. With all the zest and exuberance of the original, 1966 and All That takes us on a half-remembered journey of imperial decline, loss of moustaches, The Sewers Crisis, angry young men, slightly cheesed-off young ladies, the onset of rock 'n' roll, the doomed romance of Princess Margaret and Pete Townshend, the decade of the Ironing Lady - and an unstoppable increase in the quantity of Royals. 1966 AND ALL THAT - all the modern history you can't remember, narrated in a way you can't begin to understand. There'll be an exam too, so please pay attention.",
