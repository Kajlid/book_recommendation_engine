  "description": "Having recently lost both parents to a brutal murder, Franklin Benjamin Cartwright has decided that it’s time to retire from life in the big city and try a quiet life in the country. While still young, he has inherited his family’s wealth and wants to leave the “rat race” behind. He decides to first try a small town called Witmore that claims to have a population under 1,000. The place turns out to have some odd characters, but plenty of quiet charm that he is looking for. It also has a romantic interest in the form of local reporter Janice Fredricks. And most important, Franklin also comes across a wayward dog that has more to him than meets the eye initially. What it also has is what Franklin wanted to avoid: murder! When the newly installed hotel manager turns up murdered, Franklin’s curious nature kicks in and he feels he can’t walk away without trying to solving it. What happens along the way surprises him and the whole town.",
