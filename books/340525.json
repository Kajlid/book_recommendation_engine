  "description": "Roberta's vendetta continues as Rock and Revy enlist some old acquaintances to try and catch up with the Killer Maid before it's too late. They're going to have to get in line since Roberta's got everyone from a U.S. military black ops unit to her ex-F.A.R.C. comrades gunning for her, not to mention the CIA and the NSA. When the turmoil becomes more than the city's criminal underworld can bear, Balalaika and Hotel Moscow enter the game. With so many players at the table, it's winner take all, and the stakes couldn't be higher!",
