  "description": "Years ago, I managed to flee my abusive husband, fell in love with a beautiful man called Bear and was blissfully happy. My ex-husband Tom was livid and promised to get back at me. He did. He murdered my baby. My gut told me it was him behind the murder, but I just couldn’t prove it, so he got away with it. Then, he quietly found a way to send me to prison. When I got out of prison, together with Bear, I fought back and found a way to turn the tables on Tom. I sent him to prison for more than thirty years. I am now happier than I have been in my whole life. But Tom, even though he’s behind bars, is determined to have the last word. He has found a way to wedge himself in my life once again and is threatening my marriage and my children. Something has to be done. Something final, this time. Warning: Contains violence, sex scenes and strong language. Before you read this book, please read the first part of this story in, You Will Pay For Leaving me.",
