Quiet Pine Trees is jet fuel for your imagination and a wrecking ball against writer's block. This collection features more than 500 compelling miniature stories that turn the humble microfiction into a self-contained work of literary art. Within the limits of the form, each story combines powerful imagery with haunting themes using just a few words, making snapshots of bigger, stranger worlds to inspire the creativity of the reader. The multitude of stories in this volume span genres and galaxies alike: from science fiction about advanced time travel techniques, to otherworldly fantasy about desperate trees and artillery pianos, to eerie horror about the real reason dolls close their eyes.",
