  "description": "Fitz Baker was the world’s biggest sex symbol. Until he disappeared.  Fed up with the trappings of fame, he traded his world of Hollywood for a quiet life on Newman Lake. He was perfectly happy living as an island. Until he met her.  Returning home with nothing but a failed music career, all Maggie Sharp wants is to rebuild her life. A life that doesn’t involve the surly, arrogant mountain man now living across the lake.  Still, there’s something about Will…something familiar. Something Maggie can’t quite put her finger on…  She only wanted the spotlight. He gave up his life to escape it. The real question is if they can remain discreet.",
