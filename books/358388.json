  "description": "\"How in the hell do you do that? Are you a witch?\" I knew exactly how ridiculous that sounded and how rational at the same time. Darrin couldn't have said it better to Samantha. Alice's smile deepened and she demurely dropped her gaze. \"I guess I'd have to know what you mean by that. There're so many misconceptions.\" *** Alice & Henry is a magical tour through the landscape of a small Midwestern town where the past and present collide and the Afterlife is the one place where all can be understood. Henry Spears has died and finds himself unable to stop haunting the love of his life, Alice, whom he has not seen in over forty years. Forcefully separated by Sarah, who blackmails and coerces him into marriage, he has been unable to break her hold over him. Guided by an angel, Henry learns through revisiting scenes of his life both with and without Alice, that his problems stem from a much earlier existence in the 15th century.",
