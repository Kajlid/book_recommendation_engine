Yet, there was something missing from her life, and the longing grew stronger each day. She dreams of a faceless man, fearless, sensual and breathtakingly beautiful. He is every woman's fantasy who would sooth her fears and bring her peace. After a brief meeting with a handsome foreigner, she becomes involved with his sexy brother who just happens to be from the 12th century . . . and a dragon. He explains he's a prince from an ancient race of dragon shifters who once called Atlantis home. He and his brother are now being hunted by his enemies, who want him dead. Convinced he's mentally impaired, she tries not to get involved, but finds it's too late. She's fallen madly inlove with him and now must decide whether or not to help. Diedre discovers he's telling her the truth, they are being hunted . . . literally, by dragons who've traveled through time to find them. Together, they must return to the 12th century, to find and kill the man who wants his crown. Will they survive the perilous trip through time? And will Diedre finally fill the longing she's been fighting so long, or will she too fall prey to a murder plot? This is the first book of The Dragon Chronicles, a new series about these unique men from long ago.",
