  "description": "A favor for her aunt. A favor for his uncle. One date—then it’s over . . . or is it? Violet Monroe thought she was done providing material for her Aunt Pearl’s wildly popular advice column. But with retirement on the horizon, her aunt ropes her into one last favor—a blind date in New York City with a mystery man. Sawyer Quinn, heir to the prestigious Royce media empire, has spent his life under scrutiny. When his uncle proposes a weekend date as a way to shake up his structured world, he surprises himself by saying yes. After an unexpected—and slightly clumsy—first meeting, Violet and Sawyer are swept into a whirlwind adventure through the heart of the city. From iconic landmarks to unexpected confessions, their chemistry is undeniable. But with Sunday looming—and Sawyer’s meddling mother waiting in the wings—will their weekend romance fade with the city lights, or is this just the beginning of forever?A Hallmark-worthy romance filled with heart, charm, and swoon-worthy moments! If you love clean contemporary romance with a dreamy happily ever after, New York In Love is for you!",
