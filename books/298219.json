  "description": "Suspense, excess, danger and exuberant fun come together in Chuck Barris's unlikely autobiography - the tale of a wildly flamboyant 1970s television producer of innovative game shows such as The Gong Show and The Dating Game. What most people don't know is that Barris spent close to two decades as a decorated covert assassin for the CIA, claiming to have killed over thirty people. He joined the CIA as an agent in the early 1960's. He infiltrated the Civil Rights movement, met with militant Muslims in Harlem, and was sent abroad to kill enemies of the American state, even as his game shows began to soar to ratings success. Confessions of A Dangerous Mind is a wild and improbable tale spiced with intrigue, sex , bad behaviour, and plenty of one-liners.",
