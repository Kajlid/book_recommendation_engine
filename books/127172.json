  "description": "“The effigy seared with burning force. As smoke rose to the sounds of her bubbling flesh, the image was lost in the intensity of her screams. When finally the boy released her, the only thing remaining were the sounds of her sobs and the bright glowing replica of a perfect set of wings.” Her father is gone. The town of Cohoes is gripped in an unearthly quiet as tumbleweeds barrel the streets. Heartworth Castle is bare – of antiquities, of chattels, of warmth, of laughter as the forces of hatred bare down. The Demonic Empire’s fold grows each passing day and purgatory is buckling under the storm. Can Melodie and Joseph protect mortality from being caught up in a power struggle that has its origins in the afterlife and beyond? Cloaked in shadow and the deepest corners of the underworld, The Darkest Angel – Book three in The Castle Series.",
