In tribal policeman Charlie Moon's world, good and evil manifest themselves in more explainable, human ways.

And now the parched earth has yielded up the remains of a gargantuan prehistoric beast on the site of a failed dude ranch--a find of enormous scientific importance that is attracting the attention of a wide variety of inividuals, some eminent and seemingly scrupulous...other obviously neither. Moon is also curious about the strange old bones. For things this ancient and rare have been known to inspire malevolent deeds in the past, including avarice, lies...and murder. And all it takes is one mysterious disappearance and one very suspicious death to convince Charlie Moon that his greatest fears have just been realized.",
