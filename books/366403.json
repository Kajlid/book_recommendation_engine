  "description": "\"For a second we gasped in admiration...\"September 1930. A scientific expedition embarks for the frozen wasteland of Antarctica. But the secrets they unearth there reveal a past almost beyond human comprehension - and a future too terrible to imagine. By taking scientific fact so seriously, At the Mountains of Madness(1936), H.P Lovecraft's classic take on the \"heroic age\" of polar exploration, helped to define a new era in 20th-century science fiction. \"...and then vague horror began to creep into our souls.\"",
