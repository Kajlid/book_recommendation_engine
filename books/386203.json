  "title": "Hungry Like the Wolf",
  "description": "Under pressure from her family to recapture the interest of her wealthy ex-husband, it was almost inevitable that it would occur to Nicole that making him jealous just might do the trick, and who better to do that than the fabulously sexy Jakman brothers? It still took a lot of pep talk to gather her nerve to ask for their help, to pretend an interest in her.Neither Hugh nor Byron had any interest in or need to pretend. They wanted her and they were already having trouble controlling the wolf within. All it took was an invitation.They had their own agenda, though—and letting her go back to her ex sure as hell wasn’t it. Carnal/Erotic. Multiple heroes, several menage a trois-m/f/m, foreplay, anal penetration, oral sex, voyeurism. Paranormal Romance.Bitten by Books Hockeyvamp 4 Tombstones!!!!I really love this series. Although Hungry Like the Wolf is definitely a stand alone when it comes to the other Wolf books by Mandy Monroe, its allusion to the pack life the men were forced to abandon ties it in nicely with the previous books. The suspense level in this book is high despite the knowledge from early on the distinct roles played by the characters involved. I am quite often disappointed when a book follows such a clear path, but this one gave enough dimension to the characters that their intimate interactions along with their witty dialogue that the dramatic confrontations with their enemy stood out and made this book a great read. Mandy Monroes shifters oooooze sex appeal, and the ménage play was both sinfully decadent and full of tantalizing romance.",
