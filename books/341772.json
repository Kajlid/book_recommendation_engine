  "title": "It's Useful to Have a Duck",
  "description": "A little boy finds a rubber duck and uses him as a hat, a straw, a nose. But how does the duck use the little boy? By turning the book over, readers find the same story told from the duckâ€™s point of view. Witty line drawings and text by the gifted Argentine author/illustrator Isol remind even the youngest child that there are always two points of view, and more than one way to be. This charming, innovative book in the form of an accordion is beautifully packaged in a slipcase.",
