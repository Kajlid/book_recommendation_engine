  "description": "This story has never been told before. It's about the insides of the worst places the inner workings of psychiatric institutions in the former USSR. It's about the young people who, in their pursuit of spiritual freedom, undermined the main principle of Soviet fear. How their resilience and sacrifice delivered a strong blow to the ideological strength of Soviet tyranny, which fell apart only three years later, surprisingly easily.But above all, this story is about every one of us, about our choice between good and evil. It is about the ultimate fight we must not lose and about the meaning of our precious lives.",
