  "description": "Jessica may not have the warmest relationship with her mother, aspiring presidential candidate Margaret Hunsucker, but it still comes as a shock when she discovers that her mother has sold her to the devil. Will she have to spend eternity in hell with one of Satan's minions, a demon named Brad? Brad takes pains to explain that they live in one of hell's better neighborhoods, and he seems like a nice enough guy, but still! And things only get worse when Jessica learns the full extent of her mother's evil plans. Can she and Brad come up with a plan to save the world? These and other pressing questions are all answered in Marilyn Kaye's delightfully satirical Demon Chick.",
