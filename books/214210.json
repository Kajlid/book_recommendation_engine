  "description": "Kingston Rush  Becoming a goaltender in the NHL is the only thing I ever wanted for myself.  Goal accomplished.  Two years ago, I was the best goalie in the league, for the third time. With our Stanley Cup win, the Austin Arrows were on top of the world. Nothing could possibly bring us down.  Wrong.  Turns out, even when you’re at the top, you can find yourself back at rock bottom.  But it gets worse.  Not only did the team fall from grace, then I did too. I was accused of something I didn’t do. And now I’m being forced to repair my tarnished reputation.  Only I don’t know how to do that.  When the suggestion is made for me to pull off this ruse for the media, I know what I’m getting into. I also know there’s only one right answer.  But it’s complicated, and I’m not the only one who could get hurt.  There’s only one major problem.  I can’t say no.",
