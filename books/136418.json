  "description": "All I ever wanted was to be a normal girl. I had dreams of joining the ranks of the Military Police and making my family proud. But the nuclear war that laid waste to our country destroyed any hope I had of being normal ever again. They took everything away from me, including my humanity. I am now half-human, half-machine, part of the never-ending freak show that is the Restoration Project.They hate what they created and they fear us for being powerful.And so they hunt us, destroying our lives so that they can bury what they built. What they don’t know is there is a Resistance out there and The Bionics aren’t going down without a fight.**Due to coarse language and mild sexual innuendo, this story is not recommended for teens under the age of sixteen.**",
