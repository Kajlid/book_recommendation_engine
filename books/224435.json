  "description": "Dear __________,I dreaded coming to camp Pine Haven and my first week here was the worst. While my best friend was sunbathing on the beach in Hawaii, I was stuck with outdoor showers, a rickety cabin, and only one friend—quiet, boring Melissa. Then the \"Evil Twins\" showed up. It turned out they're totally cool and they wanted to be my friend! They're not really evil—well, not to me, at least. They AREN'T too nice to Melissa. We started playing a few pranks and it's kind of gotten out of control... I know I should put a stop to things, but I don't want to lose my only friends here. I just hope that I don't do anything I regret.Love,Kelly",
