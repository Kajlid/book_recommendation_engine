  "description": "FIVE CLASSIC TALES ALL STARRING ONE PUT-UPON WOLF!Wolf, a rather fine dresser and intelligent creature, just can’t catch a break. All he wants to do is eat some pig, lamb, a gosling or two, a loud sheperd…or that little girl wearing a red hood, but for some reason none of them will cooperate. Five classic tales morph into one ongoing yarn as Wolf bumbles his way through each of them. Told in graphic novel style in an oversized picture book package, this is the gift for kids of all ages for happily-ever-after holidays.",
