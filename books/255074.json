  "description": "The last thing I expected was my ex-boyfriend showing up unannounced, demanding to see our son. The son whose existence he’d previously never bothered to acknowledge, leaving me a single mother at sixteen years old.  As if I’m not freaked out enough, I also have to deal with a loud, annoying new neighbour on top of it all.  Imagine my surprise when I discover my neighbour is none other than Jeremy, my best friend’s dangerously hot brother, who was recently released from prison.  I’m sure he’s a complication I definitely don’t need. But then he inserts himself effortlessly into my life, becoming my hero, my saviour, and someone my son can look up to, and I realize how much I actually need him.  But my ex isn’t backing off, making me wonder what he’s capable of — and how far Jeremy will go to keep us safe.",
