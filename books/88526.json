  "description": "The charred steel girders of the World Trade towers, a nuclear explosion, storms and tsunamis, a beautiful woman, an ancient prophecy, and a government that wants to discredit him... Paolo DeLaurentis has the prophetic gift of Nostradamus and is haunted by visions foretelling catastrophic events. Does he possess a gift or a curse? 1963, a third grade boy, Paolo gets sick. His parents, doctor, and a priest watch in awe as the child lies in a cold bath at death's door. He is enveloped in a globe of white light and recovers. Two years later, Paolo awakens from a dream of a woman-the love of his life. He won't meet her for another thirty years, and the dream is forgotten when another vision-the tragic deaths of two of his friends-comes true. After college, a desire deep within Paolo beckons him to travel to his grandfather's village of Ottati, Italy. This begins Paolo's quest to find life's balance of love, tragedy, forgiveness, and identity. Despite lingering threats from his nemesis, NSC director Doctor Colin Payne-a high-ranking government official-Paolo combines what he learned in Italy with his gift of prescience to become a wealthy businessman, charismatic leader, husband, and father. He finds the woman from his dreams and their love is so powerful it just might change the world. Paolo is generous with his financial and spiritual wealth as he lives his life searching for beauty and truth. But when his visions of tragedy escalate, will he be able to warn the world in time? Messenger from God illustrates the battle between good and evil within the world and ourselves and asks: What is our purpose in life?",
