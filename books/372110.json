  "title": "Sync: The Emerging Science of Spontaneous Order",
  "description": "\"Sync\" is a story of a dazzling kind of order in the universe, the harmony that comes from cycles in sync. The tendency to synchronize is one of the most far-reaching drives in all of nature. It extends from people to planets, from animals to atoms. In \"Sync\" professor Steven Strogatz considers a range of applications - human sleep and circadian rhythms, menstrual synchrony, insect outbreaks, superconductors, Lasers, secret codes, heart arrhythmias and fads - connecting all through an exploration of the same mathematical self-organization, or the spontaneous emergence of order out of chaos. Focused enough to present a coherent world unto themselves, Strogatz's chosen topics touch on several of the hottest directions in contemporary science.",
