  "description": "What if you could not only travel to any location in our own world, but to any possible world?We can all imagine such \"other worlds\"—be they worlds just slightly different than our own or worlds full of magic and wonder—but it is only in fiction that we can travel to them. From The Wizard of Oz to The Dark Tower, from Philip Pullman to C.S. Lewis, there is a rich tradition of this kind of fiction in the fantasy genre, but never before have the best parallel world stories and portal fantasies in the science fiction genre (of those published prior to 2012) been collected in a single volume—until now.
