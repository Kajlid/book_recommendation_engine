  "description": "Richard Howard's exuberant and definitive rendition of Stendhal's stirring tale has brought about the rediscovery of this classic by modern readers. Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history. As Balzac wrote, \"Never before have the hearts of princes, ministers, courtiers, and women been depicted like this...one sees perfection in every detail.\"With beautiful illustrations by Robert Andrew Parker.",
