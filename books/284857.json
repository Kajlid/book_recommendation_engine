  "description": "A year ago, she begged me to stay.A year later, it’s my turn to beg her not to go.My obsession. My downfall.I tried to resist, to keep her at a distance.I tried to save myself.But no one will be saved here, not even a selfish bastard like me. My life has always been about sport and family, including my stupid brothers. Until that night, the night I made the worst decision of my life. And I’m still paying the price for it.We both are.But the time has come to take back control of the situation, to risk it all, to convince her to let me in, because she can’t be anything other than mine. I am Ian O’Connor, and I’m about to accept this challenge: to try and hold on to the only woman I’ll ever be able to love.And even if I already know how this badly written romance is going to end, I won’t back away. This time, I’m going all the way. Because I only want her.And I have no intention of losing her.I’m an O’Connor, and the O’Connors never lose.",
