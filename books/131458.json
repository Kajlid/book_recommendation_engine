Unlike the baffled authorities, Maliha believes the General is innocent, and so the mystery begins.With landfall just hours away, Maliha must find the true murderer before the culprit escapes, even if it means putting herself in grave danger.Murder out of the Blue is the first installment in the Maliha Anderson steampunk murder mystery series which includes unforeseen twists, vivid descriptions, intriguing characters, and crisp, elegant prose. The book serves as a great introduction to the steampunk genre and as an homage to Agatha Christie in an alternative Edwardian setting.",
