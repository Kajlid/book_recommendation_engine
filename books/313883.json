  "description": "It’s hard to start over, and find love, when no one forgets your past.  Pregnant and suddenly jobless, Lily is desperate to figure out what she wants from life before the baby comes. Leaving her busy, high-rise life on hiatus, she sets out to the small-town on the Pacific coast determined to fix up the family’s summer home and sell it for some much needed cash flow. As she begins the renovations, she becomes reacquainted with her sexy neighbour, a charter pilot, who now lives on the strip all year long. Despite his charm and laid-back attitude, Eric’s a distraction she doesn’t need right now. Besides, there’s no way he could possibly be attracted to the single mom-to-be, right? Despite her repeated attempts to show she’s changed, Cheshire Bay refuses to welcome her home. Will she cave to the mounting pressure to return to the high-rise lifestyle, or will she put the rumours to rest and make Cheshire Bay – and Eric – her new home?  Fans of Rachel Gibson and Jill Shavis will love this sweet and charming story of a straightened out bad girl coming home to her small town on Vancouver Island.BRONZE MEDAL winner in the 2021 READERS CHOICE AWARDS (romance) as put together by Connections e-Magazine.",
