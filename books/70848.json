Mysteriously lacking in emotions, Gage tells Emma an incredible story that pulls her into his world of impossibilities. At first, she refuses to believe. But when she puts his words to the test, she discovers that his world is also hers. ​Soon she will be forced to use her ability in an attempt to destroy an ancient evil that has defied death and ruled the centuries in a reign of terror.They are called… The Cadence.​​In the end, she has only one weapon and one chance to defeat the Cadence, break their circle of power, and restore hope.",
