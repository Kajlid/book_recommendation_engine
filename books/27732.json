  "description": "Jimmy Peterson is sick. Very sick. Living within the children’s ward at St. Joseph’s Hospital at the height of World War II, Jimmy suspects that his illness is far worse than anyone will admit, especially to him. But Jimmy knows endless medications, constant pains and wracking coughs are the unfortunate realities of his days. One wakeful night in the ward, he receives an unexpected visit from none other than Santa Claus. Saint Nick invites Jimmy on an adventure, one which will grant him a brief respite from the illness that plagues him. Of course Jimmy accepts and within moments finds himself sitting wide-eyed in Santa’s sleigh, soaring through snowy skies behind eight flying reindeer.When they arrive at the North Pole, Jimmy meets an assortment of extraordinary characters, all of whom are eager to introduce him to the many marvels of their home. Each encounter is more astonishing than the last, from cooking classes with elves to mice that talk to the endless wonders of Santa’s workshops. He enjoys every magical moment, relishing the contrast to life in a children’s ward, with its frightened patients, unsavory medicines and desperate parents. Despite his delight, Jimmy constantly struggles to conquer the fear that wells up inside him when he faces the reality of returning to the ward. More than his own pain, Jimmy dreads the impact his illness will have on his family if his health continues to decline.",
