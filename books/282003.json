  "title": "The Sham",
  "description": "Our marriage is a sham. I'm the first to admit it. Only privately, of course.  Notorious playboy Luka Zoric needs a wife, and the good PR it brings.  I just need the career boost being his top model will give me. It's a win-win--on paper. But since when has real life been simple?  His jealousy makes me crazy.  The control he maintains over my body is unacceptable.  I really shouldn't be so turned on by it.  But there's more to both me and my husband than meets the eye.  And it isn't long before I'm wondering--which of us has made the bigger mistake?  Book one of three.",
