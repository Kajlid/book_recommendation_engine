  "description": "It all comes down to breath. If we don’t breathe deeply enough, we cannot fill ourselves with the joy and beauty of the world around us. If we don’t release that breath, we cannot let go of all the hectic ugliness that goes hand in hand with living in a modern and complicated world.When you start on this photographic journey—this path of quiet insight and reflection—you will start to breathe again. You will immerse yourself in these diverse and beautiful images and thoughtful words, and find rejuvenation for your heart and mind. Peace, serenity, balance... it is all attainable—if you just Breathe.",
