  "description": "Colin: My life is pretty quiet, and I prefer it that way. I do my schoolwork, I have what some would call a nerdy hobby and I have my, um…toys. Tutoring pays the bills, and when I’m asked to help the star football player fix his grades, it’s just another job, right? Then I find out he’s a dragon shifter who likes to party rather than study. God, I wonder if the stories about dragon shifter anatomy are true? Not that I’m likely to find out since he’s clearly straight!  Leon: Being on the football team and belonging to the best frat on campus is great. I get to have fun, and women throw themselves at me. Life was looking good until my team captain found out I was failing a class and hired a nerdy little human tutor to keep me focused and get me back on track. But…It turns out the guy is actually kind of cute...and quite a distraction!  All Colin wants is a quiet life studying and building his models. All Leon wants is to have fun and play football. When the nerd and the jock are thrown together, logic dictates they can’t both have what they desire…or can they?",
