  "description": "A fantastical tale of a boy who finds something amazing in the forest—and then finds the courage to stop hiding . . .   At school, Brennon Trapper does whatever he must do to be liked, but at home inside his trailer, he crawls back inside himself, wishing he could disappear. His father likely wouldn’t even notice if he did.   Then, something too incredible to believe happens on his family’s wooded property, and Brennon and his younger brother vow to keep it from their parents rather than risk ridicule again. Seriously, who would believe that a beaver gave them a tesserapod that could develop into a lodge of sorts in two hundred days if grounded correctly?   But when an epic blizzard destroys the roof of their trailer, Brennon finally comes clean about the woods and what he thinks may be a place of shelter.",
