  "description": "Nadia and Anabella head down to Houston, Texas, for what they thought would be a relaxing vacation. Nadia could work on her travel news articles for her boss in Cedar Rapids while Anabella caught a few rays of sunshine. Or that was the plan. Little did they know what trouble lurked inside the luxurious hotel nestled in the center of downtown Houston.  When Carlisle Ali introduces Anabella to his friend and brother-in-arms, Carter Jackson, all hell breaks loose for the Mavericks. Trouble never has a problem finding Nadia when she is out and about looking for a story. Be it Cedar Rapids or Houston, it doesnâ€™t matter. Nadia finds a way to cause chaos and disaster.  What happens when Mr. A and Mr. J go out on a hunt for the man who is terrorizing people along I-45, the interstate running through the heart of Houston? More importantly, what happens to Nadia and Mr. A when they are forced to face the feelings that have been boiling between them for over a year now?",
