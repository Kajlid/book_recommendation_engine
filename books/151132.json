Secrets exposed, tender hellos, and tumultuous goodbyes. This multi-faceted two-book collection of short stories, captures those defining moments that challenge and change us, those that serve as the catalyst to our greatest experiences, our dearest memories, our deepest joy, and perhaps our sincerest sorrows.Ideal for readers ranging from the seasoned literary fan to today’s savvy young adults.",
