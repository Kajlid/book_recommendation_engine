When he spontaneously invites her to his home for a night of games and music with friends and family he is blissfully unaware that resplendent Elle has been covertly preparing to use her beauty, intelligence and other-worldly seductive charms on Jacob. Her parents, Ray and Grace, have traveled from their dying planet with one objective: secure an exemplary and compatible lover for their daughter who will selflessly sacrifice everything to be with her. Ray created Socialite, the worldâ€™s powerful social network and total communication solution, to facilitate their search, one that led them to select unsuspecting Jacob. The success of their mission depends on Elle slowly gaining the trust of Jacob and the people in his life, before they discover her secret heritage, and ultimate ambitions.",
