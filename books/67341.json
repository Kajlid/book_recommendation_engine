  "description": "NO LONGER IN PRINTA magical accident threw them together. But when Fate holds all the cards, it can be impossible to tell the difference between pure chance and Destiny... The Madrassa, a magical school for mage practitioners, is the stuff of legend. With selective entrance exams and quotas for only the most advanced of mage children, it's almost impossible to attend. When Allorna, a guardian trainee for the royal family, ends up on the doorstep of the citadel on the eve of the final day of a recruitment ceremony, she decides it must be fate.She was sure she knew the path her life would take before she enrolled. But sometimes life has a way of throwing in magical curveballs and strange friends, just to see if youâ€™ll trip up. Oh, and one of those friends is a mage accused of murder, another is a slightly psychotic dragon, the third a healer facing an existential crisis, and the last is a female storm-caller with more hidden secrets than a thief lord.Do they all belong at the new school they call home?A young adult epic fantasy book with a bountiful cast of characters.",
