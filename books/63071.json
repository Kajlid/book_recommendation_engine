  "description": "Are you looking for a design book for your 10-year-old child? Look no further! This book introduces the fascinating world of design to children. From smartphones to chatbots, everything around us is designed by someone for a specific purpose. This book is an eye-opener for young minds interested in design and helps them understand what design is and what it isn't.Written by a team of practicing designers and teachers, this book shares stories of designs and designers that have contributed to making the world a better place. It helps children think creatively and critically about designing anything, making it the perfect first book for children interested in design.What makes this book unique is that it's written by both adults and children during the pandemic, and every page has a design story based on things that surround us. It took three years to curate, select, and craft the stories that children can appreciate.Design is too important to be left only to adults, and this book is an excellent way to introduce children to design in a holistic and responsible way. We often associate the word 'design' loosely with colors, prints, or cool stuff, but none of these are design. Design is about creating things that are useful to people and do not harm our planet. With a complete understanding of what design is and what it is not, children can have a critical and constructive view of designing anything.",
