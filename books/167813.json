  "title": "Ocean Beach",
  "description": "In the tradition of the European novel of ideas, Ocean Beach is a searing psychological portrait of infatuation and longing. At twenty-five years old, Peter Niletti’s life is confined to a bedroom in his parents’ suburban Long Island home. From his isolation, he ruminates on the life and death of his younger sister, Severine. The siblings are raised in a cloistered intellectual environment where, estranged from other children, they develop an unusually close bond. Peter and Severine exist for one another, until college shatters their unity when Severine meets the handsome and worldly Spencer. Peter’s desperation compels him to do anything to keep his sister for himself, only to find that in trying to save what he desires most, he risks destroying the only chance he has at living. Ocean Beach is a brilliant and beautifully twisted tale of obsession and ardor, pain and pathos, a heartrending portrayal of a young man’s descent into seclusion and madness.",
