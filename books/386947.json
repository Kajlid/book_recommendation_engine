But her daring escape in a wool wagon quickly becomes a misadventure, and she winds up in the arms of Dienwalk de Fortenberry, a rogue as smooth and bold as Aquitaine wine. Soon Philippa finds herself a prisoner at Dienwald's castle, where there are mysteries to be solved, villians to be bested, and a stubborn man's heart to be won. You'll also meet old friends, Graelam and Kassia de Moreton from Fire Song, as well as the king of England, who is closesr to Philippa than she could ever imagine. Journey back to the thirteenth-century Cornwall, and let me entertain you",
