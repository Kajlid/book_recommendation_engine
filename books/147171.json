  "description": "The fiery Captive Series conclusion that has fans diving for cover:  Burning out of control, Rena Hellberg has rightfully earned her reputation as a maniacal loose cannon. Her checkered past is riddled with holes, and as she faces life in a maximum-security psychiatric ward, fate grants her a second chance. Now she's free, an escaped convict who is searching for the answers that could either prove her innocence or her guilt. When her murderous journey lands her in bed with the man she's labeled a traitor, Rena faces her biggest fear of all: losing her heart to the enemy.  As a fireman, Ty Ferguson lives to help those in need. Captivated by Rena's natural elegance, contradictory attitude, and hidden vulnerability, he can't deny his building attraction for her. But when he puts it all on the line, the beautiful fugitive proves to be even more sensuous, more unpredictable and more dangerous than originally thought. Is her illness catching up with them both? Can he save her from herself? Or is there more to a story that is bound to end with them both going down in flames?",
