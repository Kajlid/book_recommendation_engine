  "description": "Little ones love to play peek-a-boo! With its bright, quirky animals and oversized flaps to lift, Peek-a-Moo! is sure to be a read-aloud favorite. Readers play peek-a-boo with a different animal on each page, guessing what it is, then lifting the flap to find out. Each animal has a different sound that becomes part of the peek-a-boo game: Guess who? \"Peek-a-moo!\" says the cow. \"Peek-a-squeak!\" says the mouse. The bold, funny illustrations will keep kids laughing, while the large trim size and sturdy binding will ensure many hours of lift-the-flap fun.",
