  "title": "TERRY: The Time Travelling Tortoise",
  "description": "Terry was not at all interested in becoming a time traveller, but one day, that's exactly what happened... VOO-SHWIPOP! Like it or not, Terry the tortoise was no longer in his quiet English garden, drinking tea and eating buttered crumpets. Now he was tumbling through time and space, and meeting a very odd assortment of characters along the way; such as the pirates Bee Beard and Broccoli Beard, strange creatures called cogs and dats, a depressed William Shakespeare and a humpless camel. And when Queen Victoria mistakes Terry for a teapot, it begins to look like he might never get back home again! Join Terry on this fantastical voyage of silly adventures, and confront conundrums of the space-time continuum face on! By the year 2376, this book has won numerous (as yet un-invented) prizes, such as The Wurlitzer Sausage Award for Twenty First Century Classics. Suitable for readers of all ages 7+",
