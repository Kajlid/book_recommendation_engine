  "title": "America in the World: A History of U.S. Diplomacy and Foreign Policy",
  "description": "An essential history of the schools and traditions of American foreign policy.In addition to presenting the compelling and influential stories of statesmen and diplomats from Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson, to Henry Kissinger and James Baker, America in the World also lays out Zoellick's critical framework, the \"five traditions\" of American diplomacy. These traditions include a focus on the home continent, the role of trade relations, changing attitudes towards alliances, the bonds between countries across the Americas, and the belief in the exceptionalism of the United States.In the author's words, \"The American diplomacy revealed in this book will look beyond meetings and maneuvers of envoys in gilded drawing rooms, exchanges of papers and treaties, and even the careful labors of negotiators. Diplomacy should reflect aims and means of policy, not just processes. Statecraft requires strategy. And strategy needs to reflect national visions, purposes, interests, assessments of realties, capabilities-and public support.\"Both a sweeping work of history and a clear-eyed guide to diplomacy past and present, America in the World will serve as a critical companion and a cautionary tale to anyone seeking to understand the implications of foreign policy under an unpredictable new administration.",
