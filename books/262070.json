  "description": "I never should have let her go.Or left him.I thought it was the right thing - what was right for all of us.I thought it was best. I thought we could move on.I was wrong.I thought I could stop loving her. Or forget about him.I didn't.I could never stop.Like an avalanche barreling down the mountainside at full speed with nothing in its way to halt its progress, so was my love for London and Sage.Strong. Unrelenting. Powerful.But with catastrophic endings.London and Sage broke my heart first, in very different ways, but I shattered theirs. I abandoned them both when I should've stayed and protected them. Decimated any chance to later salvage even a fragment of our friendship.Yet the universe is giving me a second chance.To prove to them how unbreakable our bond really is. And to make up for lost time before my time runs out. ***NOTE: This is Book 2 in the Reckless serial - a MFM/MMF menage. To enjoy the entire story, please read Reckless Youth (Book 1) first. And stay tuned for the conclusion of Reckless with Reckless Hearts (Book 3) coming soon.",
