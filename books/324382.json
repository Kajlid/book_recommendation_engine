The paparazzi and media are circling Kingston like vultures. People have questions, and they want answers. Tanner took pity on Cali, bringing Braxton, Bree, Knoxx, Finn, and Hoyt along for the ride; a decision they may regret.Fallout from the fire isn’t Cali’s only problem. Already victim to a prank war in her own dorm, Cali finds herself in the middle of the first year crew’s saga. Can Cali remain Switzerland as the pranks continue to escalate, or will she be caught in the cross-hairs once again?Gruesome scalpel work. New societies. Minor kidnappings. Death by glare. Just a typical day at Wiltshire.Feeling guilty, homeless, and possessing only the clothes on her back, Cali tries to juggle the demanding Wiltshire academics, investigators who don’t think Cali is as innocent as she seems, a game with increasing stakes that Cali doesn’t know the rules to, and trying to hold on to the friends she’s made. Cali wanted to be seen, but this is not what she had in mind.*Note: The book begins with a recap of book 1.",
