  "description": "King Kobe replaced his wayward brother on the Kindred Throne and was commanded to destroy all offspring of the initial Werewolf. Those Wolves were only puppies at the time and King Kobe scoured Europe to fulfill his command. Finding great success, he was able to refocus on growth and business, while the New World loomed large in his vision. The U.S. Preternation was ripe for his colonization and its conquer would be easy. All he had to do was claim the Vampiress who maintained the most elite status. “With great power comes great responsibility.” Never a truer statement has been made, and to the detriment of all known powers, Kenny Trammell has reached maturity. Some have sought to stint Kenny’s greatest strength, which was still yet to come. Through their efforts, many have fallen, and those remaining race to the Great Alpha for protection from a purveyor of savage annihilation. Kenny is forced to choose between protecting those running in fear and throning the prolific puppy-killer in his midst. Added to the goings-on, Kenny is also coming out. He is set to tell the world about… Alpha and The King.",
