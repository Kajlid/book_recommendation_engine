  "title": "The Punishment of Nicollet",
  "description": "A tale of innocence lost and passion gained. Jack Kemp, owner of the Lazy Z Ranch, is a man of strong passions. Dark passions, that he keeps firmly under wraps. He longs for a woman to understand his needs. A woman who won't mind being completely dominated, possessed, punished. From the moment she first set eyes on Jack, Nicollet knew she wanted to be his. Not his precious darlin', no matter that he's always been there for her. Not his friend, no matter that their love of horses and the Ranch gives them plenty in common. But his woman. Nicky's been saving herself for Jack, and now, home from college, she's going to get him. But first she'll have to convince him she's not too young for him. Even if it means taking her punishment like a woman. PUBLISHER'S NOTE: This e-book contains substantial explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations some readers may find objectionable. While Jack and Nicollet have no blood ties and their relationship is fully consensual, some readers, particularly those with a history of sexual abuse or incest, may find this story disturbing.",
