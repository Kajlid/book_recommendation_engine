  "title": "The Fall of the Black Queen",
  "description": "The Kingdom is torn by civil war. Two women, Lady Isabella of Aardmore and her half-sister Joan d'Montefort, each claim to be rightful heir to the throne. The clashes between their supporters, known colloquially as the Blacks and the Whites, have grown ever more bitter and brutal. Then, unexpectedly, on the eve of a major battle Queen Isabella is taken. A gifted leader possessed of tremendous strength and intelligence, Queen Isabella suddenly finds herself a helpless prisoner. Her captivity becomes a relentless nightmare as the beautiful noblewoman becomes a focal point for the most vicious and depraved impulses of the White partisans who control her fate. From the simmering class resentments of the common soldiers to the repressed desires of the Church to the casual malice of the Kingdom's knights and nobles, nearly every rung of her feudal society is given the chance to shame and subjugate the royal hostage. Will Isabella escape her cruel confinement and be reunited with her gallant young lover, Sir William Cantor? Or will this be the end of the dynamic and headstrong commander known as the Black Queen?",
