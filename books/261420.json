  "description": "A WINTER’S TALE   After racking up serious injuries, world-famous snowboarder Nate Forrest returns to the West Virginia coal town that has been his family’s home for generations. The transition’s a challenge, but there’s nothing more beautiful than snow. Except maybe Dr. Lacey Berryville. How can Nate resist this tender-hearted vet who adores every living creature and isn’t the least bit fazed by his celebrity?      Just what Lacey doesn’t need is for this larger-than-life, adventurous Olympic medalist to melt her caution away during the season’s last snowfall. She’s spent her girlhood moving from place to place, and soon she’ll be leaving again. So, what’s she supposed to do about the avalanche of feelings Nate is unleashing in her? Can she leave West Virginia’s tree-covered mountains behind—with Nate giving her the best reason of all to stay?   Praise for THE FOURTH SUMMER “What a joy it is to have a new romance by Kathleen Gilles Seidel! With wit, wisdom, and originality, Seidel tells the story of Caitlin and Seth as they go from friends to lovers. The Fourth Summer is a delight!” —New York Times bestselling author, Mary Jo Putney",
