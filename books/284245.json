  "description": "HE DOESN’T MIX BUSINESS WITH PLEASURE. UNTIL HER.  Billionaire Aiden Blair is a workaholic. His employees call him The Ogre at the Tower for setting hard-to-reach standards and asking his employees to work impossible hours with him. It doesn't matter that his company pays really well. He is a monster to work with.  It’s no wonder when Aiden is in need of a temporary executive assistant, everyone is scared to take the job. But Alyanna Curtis jumps at the opportunity to be noticed by the boss for a possible promotion, but more importantly, to be closer to Aiden. She's been secretly in love with him since the first time she saw him, but of course, she's careful not to let her feelings show or she might get fired from the job she loves.  In the confines of his luxurious office suite on top of his skyscraper, the last thing Aiden needs is a distraction in the form of a beautiful young woman, especially when he’s in the middle of closing an important deal. But the way Alyanna looks at him does something inexplicable to his system. And soon, he's finding it very hard to keep his hands to himself.  She’s a code waiting to be broken.  ___________________________________________________________________________ Emotional, romcomish, contemporary office romance. Check.
