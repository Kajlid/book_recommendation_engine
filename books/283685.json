  "description": "An epic standalone forbidden age-gap sports romance from the New York Times Bestselling author of The Play and My Life in Shambles  Starting over was her only option.  Forty-years old and still reeling from a public and painful divorce, Thalia Blackwood is looking for a fresh start, somewhere far away from her upside down life. When she’s offered a new job as the sports therapist for a football (soccer) team, she jumps at the chance. This is just what she needs to leave the heartbreak and shame of Manchester behind, trading it in for the warmth and hopeful vibrancy of Madrid.  He was her only desire.  Twenty-three year old Alejo Albarado is rising up the ranks in his career. As the charming forward for the Real Madrid team, Alejo’s life revolves around women, parties, and being a tabloid darling, that is until the new sports therapist joins the team.  Their passion could not be ignored.  What starts out as a strictly professional relationship between Thalia and the young Spanish player, slowly evolves into something more. Much more.  Their relationship was forbidden.  But their combustible chemistry and simmering sexual tension can only go so far—should Thalia give into Alejo’s advances, she’s at risk of not only losing her job, but succumbing to a much younger man will drag her through the spotlight again.  Alejo might be worth that risk.  Unless he breaks her heart in the process.   The Younger Man is a full-length standalone romance. Characters from Love, in English make a cameo in this book, however The Forbidden Man is intended to be read as a STANDALONE. This book will be approximately 400-500 pages or more.",
