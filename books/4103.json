  "description": "Clinton held office, the Republicans staged a revolution, welfare was reformed - and after four years, Molly Ivins couldn't hold back any longer. Unapologetically liberal in her concern for the Everyman, Ivins exposes the fatuous and hypocritical in American political life. She takes on the militias, multiculturalism, do-nothing Democrats, virtuously posturing Republicans, out-of-control lobbyists, Rush Limbaugh's \"dittoheads\" and down-home Texas politics. Whatever your political persuasion, you're sure to agree that Ivins is one of America's sharpest wits.",
