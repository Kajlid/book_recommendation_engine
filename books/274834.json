  "description": "There are three rules to fighting vampires.   \n  Rule one: Throw blood in their faces. Rule two: Kick them where it counts. Rule three: Bite back. Hard.\nIn a world where vampires rule and Donor Life Corp forces all adult humans to donate blood, the only true way to survive is to comply. But I’m not about surviving. I’m fighting back.  If only I hadn’t been caught rescuing humans from a quarantined city.  Because now, I’m an unwilling applicant to the Blood Match Program. I’m supposed to spend the rest of my life as a personal blood source to an elite vampire.  Unfortunately, a change in the rules of the program means I might be satiating an entire coven’s blood hunger. Screw that.  These four dangerously hot vampires have no idea what’s coming...and neither do I.  This is a new adult reverse harem romance that contains mature language, sexy steaminess, and sizzling attraction.",
