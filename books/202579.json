  "description": "Emmalin  Gone.  Everything I ever had is gone. Ripped away, taken before I was ready. So I just hid. Hid in the shadows, hoping to disappear, blending in, fade away. I didn't want to be found, and I sure as hell didnâ€™t want, to be discovered.  But one man did. He saw me. Saw right through me. He's overbearing, egotistical, and did I mention a total asshole? When I'm with him, I want to scream. Punch him. And then have him rip my clothes off.  I gave him one night. He wants more. And so do I. I'm his. Grayson Mandrake owns me.   Grayson  I take, because I can. I claim, because I can. She was mine the moment I saw her, and I will destroy her soul to keep her. Have her. Own her. I'm ruthless, and relentless. A total asshole. And I will do anything for her. Emmalin Ross is mine.  This is PART ONE of the Incapable series.  Warning: This series has a foul-mouthed male, dirty talk, and strong sexual content. Intended for mature audiences 18+ only.",
