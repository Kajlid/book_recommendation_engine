Then on the night of her engagement party, a cancer diagnosis threatens to once again steal her chance to shine.Now, Jillian's on the road to recovery after finally finishing chemo and radiation, but residual effects of the treatment keep her from reclaiming her life as she'd hoped. And just when her dreams might be falling into place, a life-altering revelation from her husband sends her reeling again.Will Jillian ever achieve her own dreams, or will she always be \"just Jillian,\" the less-than Thatcher sister? Can she count on her sisters as she tries to step into a stronger place, or are they stuck in their childhood roles forever?",
