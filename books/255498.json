  "description": "Being a tomboyish seventeen-year-old girl isn't always easy. It's even more difficult when you're a tomboyish seventeen-year-old girl who loves horses, but whose friends have gone on to other interests. When she becomes the target of bullies and it's obvious her once-friends not only won't help but are part of the problem, it seems she will have to change to fit in. Even if it means becoming someone she isn't. Can she do that and remain true to herself?  With a quirky sense of humour, Lisa finds her way through trials and tribulations to wind up in a \"happy place\" she couldn't have foreseen.",
