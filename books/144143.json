  "description": "When Benjamin, a seasoned reaper, is assigned to Danica's case, he thinks nothing of it. But, despite his years of experience, he just can't get her soul to enter the afterlife. Even The Manager (aka Death) is unsure why. Stuck bunking with Danica until he can figure it out, their unlikely friendship starts developing into something more. Despite knowing how it will all end, Benjamin feels the necessary walls of isolation come down, and he begins to wonder if it was chance that brought them together…or fate. As their feelings grow, so does The Manager’s desperation to find a solution. But is there something else at play here, something unknown and sinister? IT HAPPENED ONE LIGHT is a T4T love story outside of time and space that asks: Is there love after death? And how far would you go to hold onto it?",
