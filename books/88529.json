  "title": "Birth, Breath, and Death: Meditations on Motherhood, Chaplaincy, and Life as a Doula",
  "description": "At the age of fourteen, Amy Wright Glenn began to question the Mormon faith of her family. She embarked on a life long personal and scholarly quest for truth. While teaching comparative religion and philosophy, Amy was drawn to the work of supporting women through labor and holding compassionate space for the dying. Amy shares moving tales of birth and death while drawing on her work as a birth doula, hospital chaplain, and her own experience of motherhood. We are born, we die, and in between these irrevocable facts of human existence the breath weaves all moments together. \"Birth, Breath, and Death\" entwines story, philosophy, and poetic reflection into transforming narratives that are full of grace.",
