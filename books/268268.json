  "description": "The Resistance called him a monster. And Vladimir never denied who he was: a beast, who had turned the world into his ghastly kingdom of ashes and blood. But in their blind vengeance, the Resistance forgot that he was the least of many evils, and darker forces lurked in the shadows. And now, in a bitter twist of fate, the wicked vampire is the only one who can save humankind.But it might be too late—he has unleashed an unstoppable horror, and before he can face her, he must confront the sorrows of his own blood-soaked history. Layers of forgotten tales peel off one by one, revealing a rotten core—none of the vampires’ deeds is worse than what humans had done to each other, time and again.When multiple vampire factions across Europe, Asia, and Africa rise up and clash over conflicting ambitions, bonds of friendship shatter, loved ones turn to traitors, and mortal enemies unite under a common cause. Strange forces surface from the distant past, vampires of the ancient world emerging out of myth and legend, turning the tides of war in unpredictable directions. Vladimir and his reluctant allies plunge into a mad rush across the globe to stop the world from falling into an eternal night darker and bloodier than the Nightfall has ever been.",
