It sounds like it's going to be a lot of fun -- each guest is bringing a gag to the party, and the best prank will win a special prize.  When two of the guests' fancy new electronics go missing, Nancy knows something's up. Is this someone's idea of a joke? The Clue Crew certainly isn't laughing, and they're on the case to find the missing gadgets.",
