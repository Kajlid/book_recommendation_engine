  "description": "Book 4 in the Acclamation series, Proclamation takes readers throughout the fallout following the revelation of Michael and Dominic's relationship to Renee Butler. Separated by school and job, by family demands, perception of deceit and not in the least, the continents between them, Michael and Dominic must find new footing for their love story. Medical school keeps Dominic busy, while living in Japan brings a new side of Michael to life. Letters, emails, texts, video calls fuel their relationship and they are determined to find a way to prove to their families that their love endures. Guilt weighs heavily though and a future together seems impossible without Renee's forgiveness, hardly forthcoming to either Michael or Dominic. In the end though, with their love tested and found standing, finding home is the only answer.",
