  "description": "Venice seen as never before. Seductive and mysterious, this city of islands is a place of dreams. While most know her winding canals, palazzi, churches, and busy streets by day, her true allure emerges in the mystical light of night. Never has Venice appeared as exquisite and captivating as in these pages.Celebrated photographer Ferenc Máté―whose books reviewers have praised as “brilliant photography . . . achingly beautiful”―has created the perfect Collector’s Item with mesmerizing images of Venice after dark. What to the naked eye are somber waterways, shadowed bridges and piazzas, are transformed here into luminous scenes of color and radiance sure to ignite the imagination. Stirring, haunting, and romantic, you’ll lose yourself in a private Venice under the cover of night.In addition to a nighttime walking guide, a hundred-page selection from John Ruskin’s The Stones of Venice enriches the experience. 110 Color Illustrations",
