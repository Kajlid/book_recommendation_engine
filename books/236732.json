  "title": "Knights Odyssey: The Return of Henry Fountain",
  "description": "Knight’s Odyssey is a journey where Pancho Villa befriends Henry Fountain, a crazed American bandit betrays him, Apache Kid challenges him, and a wealthy hacendado, a man-eating jaguar, and Apache Elias try to kill him. During his odyssey among the Apaches, Henry comes to know the love of a good woman for the first time only to lose her and swear vengeance against the man who killed her. Riveting historical fiction that reveals the hidden world of the Sierra Madre Apaches, Knight’s Odyssey is a thundering revenant story of survival, courage, love, and debts paid and forgiven. It is a story where fact and fiction are hard to separate on the last western frontier that survived well into the third decade of the twentieth century.",
