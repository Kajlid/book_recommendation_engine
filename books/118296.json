  "description": "Dead people are supposed to stay dead, right? For Antonio, that just wasn't going to happen. With what Antonio knows, heaven will have to wait. Macy had always been sensitive to the spirits of those who needed help to find peace, but this guy! He was driving her insane! It didn't help that he was gorgeous to a distraction. So what if he claimed that Angel Knight was his family? One does NOT just stroll up to the famous rock star's house and say \"Hey guess what?\" But Antonio is very persistent and Macy knows what she must do if she is going to get any peace at all. Jacque spent all of his free time looking for a way to contact his lost brother. But it seems all hope is lost until not one, but two women walk into his life. One is a pretty necromancer who claims Antonio speaks to her, the other is one he had been searching for himself for a long time. He had known Frankie was destined to be his mate, but she disappeared from his life before he could make her understand that. Now that she's back, he doesn't plan to ever let her go. With a dire situation at hand and working against the clock, Jacque must make Frankie his own while fighting a danger they all thought had been extinguished months before...",
