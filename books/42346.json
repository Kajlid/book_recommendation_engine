  "description": "Unedited, completely fresh and perfectly f**ked story by the artistic provocateur Nigel Tomm begins without a cheesy \"I was tired, tired and lonely as a f**king cocksucker or some kind of a drunken f**kface. It was morning and I was laying in my f**king bed with a f**king pain in my f**king head. F**k that. F**k the pain. F**k the world of f**ks! Just f**k it and f**k away.\" A true masterwork of contemporary literature, the book has transcended language and culture to become one of the most astonishing books ever written. It is a quintessential passage to the today's literature. You don't have to read the entire book - experience it, feel it, and taste it like wine, breathing it in and letting it sit and roll around your eyes. The book is written in the style of Nigel Tomm's novel \"The Blah Story\" and, actually, it's a sexy bit goodie.",
