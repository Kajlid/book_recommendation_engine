  "title": "The Patchwork Years",
  "description": "The first of a trilogy, a factual novel, covering the passing of the twin curse, the 'mixing of the blood' and the 'odd child out', moving down the generations. Beginning with the birth of Christopher Thomas Flowerdew in 1854 following the brief coupling of a Scottish Earl and a chambermaid during the shooting season at Royal Sandringham, Norfolk. The story is continued by his eldest daughter Georgianna, who instinctively feels herself 'the wrong side of the green baize door that separates servants from gentry' and strives to better herself. The depression of the 1920's following the first world war further upends her life and years later when Sarah, her youngest child, has the chance to go to university Georgianna, embittered by now, refuses to allow her 'to be educated above her station in life'.Times are changing fast and it is Sarah's life we now follow, through another war and her marriage to a regular soldier as she struggles with that inherited inner longing for something more.",
