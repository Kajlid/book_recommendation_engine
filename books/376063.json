  "description": "Follow the famed Neterus and the Neteru Guardian Team from the epic 12-novel Vampire Huntress Legend series as they take the fight against evil beyond the Armageddon. In the Dawn and Darkness graphic novel (collecting the four-issue series), the team is still searching for the wounded Anti-Christ while trying to avoid the wrath of Lucifer. Complicating matters, several members of the team are pregnant with the next generation of Warriors of Light, and the darkness wants them and their unborn wiped off the face of the planet. To make matters worse, a new predator is hunting humans -- something not wholly vampire or werewolf or like any demon they've ever encountered... and this time the predator is out for more than just blood!",
