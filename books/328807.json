  "description": "Seren Grayson is a tempest. Heartless and destructive to anyone who crosses his path. But because of his good looks and talent on the football field, the students at Windham Prep adore him. They respect his boldness. They fear his wrath. And, they believe they know the real Seren.  But they don’t.  When I’m forced to move into Seren’s home, I unexpectedly unleash his wrath and become his latest target. He may think I'm easy prey because I’m the housekeeper’s daughter, but he’s wrong. I’m not someone who will cower or back down when I'm pushed.  I’ll push back. Harder. The longer I spend in Windham, the more I unravel the mysteries of Seren and Grayson Manor. Who knew it would take an outsider to soften his tough exterior and discover the truth behind the lies.",
