  "description": "Find out what's lurking inside ....Hannigan's Hand! Many years ago, a young Dan Hannigan witnessed a horrific headless spectre and poltergeist activity which shook him to the core. A priest had to intervene, to exorcise the demon which invaded his campsite and him, following his haplessly using a remote beach trail for some summer work. While exorcising the demon from his spirit-possessed hand, the priest told Dan he was being punished by the ghosts of a tragic shipwreck which had happened there a year before. He also told him he was never to repeat what happened at the camp that terrible night, OR THE CURSE WOULD BE UPON HIM, AND ANYONE ELSE WHO HEARD THE STORY. 60 years passed. Old Dan Hannigan mellowed, and began to believe the priest's warnings were all hogwash. Until a visit from an old friend and four innocent teenagers prompted the telling of the story again.
