  "description": "My name is Angel, and I live on Nugene Station. My days are filled with doctor's tests, but I spend my nights dancing in zero G, or in the arms of my secret lover, Carver Liddell.Nugene is the sole outpost orbiting Jupiter where specially engineered human clones are bred for sale to The Gran, a fierce alien race of Cats. The treaty between humanity and the Cats guarantees a constant supply of worker drones.I am not a worker drone. I am something else. I am the untapped potential of the human genome. I am the next step in human evolution.The Cats finally noticed me, they know I am special. Now they want me. They want to breed me. Silly Cats, don't they know clones are sterile?Nugene is only the beginning of my story. The Series:Born of illegal experimentation on the human genome, I've been taken for a ride across the galaxy, enslaved to the warlike race of Cats called The Gran. They think I'm some kind of upgrade, a new slave stock to be bred. Though many would resent me for the decisions I have made, they never experienced my struggle to find love and meaning in a world where I do not belong. A freak of nature, the humans don't want me. Far more valuable than they could ever know, the Cats don't appreciate me. Lost in the conflict between two galactic empires, the pirates can't save me.Standing at the center of an interstellar war, the Earth Defense Council never saw me coming. I am Angel 6.0 and this is the dark, wicked, violent tale of my life.",
