Cott’s acclaimed study includes a new preface in which Cott assesses her own and other historian’s development of the concept of domesticity from the 1970s to the 1990s.“Nancy Cott’s Bonds of Womanhood is not just a pioneer work in women’s history. It is a classic. Despite all the work published since, it is still an essential starting place for understanding New England in the early republic.”―Laurel Thatcher Ulrich“Cott, still the best historian of women’s bonds and bondage, foresaw twenty years ago the tendency of domesticity’s bonds to lead both to feminism and the far right. An essential book for understanding today’s women.”―Carolyn HeilbrunReviews of the earlier “A lovely, gentle, scholarly, and valuable book.”―Doris Grumbach, New York Times Book Review“Women’s history at its best.”―Phyllis Kriegel, New Directions for Women",
