  "description": "From New York Times Bestselling Author Jasinda Wilder comes a sexy, laugh out loud romantic comedy series that is the perfect escape. If you’re a fan of Sex in the City and you binge watched Selling Sunset, you don’t want to miss this. It was just supposed to be just a 40th birthday prank for our boss after a wild night of girlfriends, laughter, and a LOT of margaritas. When we placed the ad in the newspaper, we never thought anyone would actually answer it. We also didn’t think that Laurel would be so brainless as to put Lizzy’s actual phone number in the ad… “Beautiful, successful single woman, 40, seeks attractive male billionaire to impregnate her the old-fashioned way. No strings. NOT seeking sugar daddy. Validation required. Serious inquiries only, please.” What could possibly go wrong? Everything.",
