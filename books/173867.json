Now at thirty-eight, her fairy godfather arrives to tell her sheâ€™s a witch, and suddenly she's having to come to terms with the uncertainties of an alarmingly magic-fuelled world.

Accidents start to happen, people die, Old Magic is on the hunt, but in the age-old game of cat and mouse, just who is the feline and who is the rodent?",
