  "title": "Abraham Lincoln",
  "description": "This self-made man from a log cabin-the great orator, the Emancipator, the savior of the Union, the martyr-was arguably our greatest president; but it takes a master storyteller like Thomas Keneally, author of the award-winning novel that inspired the film Schindler's List , to bring alive the history behind the myth. Acclaimed for his recent Civil War biography, American Scoundrel , Keneally delves with relish-and a keen, fresh eye-into Lincoln's complicated persona.Abraham Lincoln depicts all the amazing man's triumphs, insecurities, and crushing defeats with uncanny his early poverty and the ambition that propelled him out of it; the shaping of the man and his political philosophy by youthful exposure to Christianity, slavery, and business; his tempestuous marriage and his fatherly love. We see him, elected to the presidency by a twist of fate, unswerving in the grim day-to-day conduct of the war as his vision and acumen led the country forward. Abraham Lincoln is an incisive study of a turning point in our history and a revealing portrait of its pivotal figure, his greatness etched even more clearly in this very touching human story.",
