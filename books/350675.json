  "description": "Mallon has assembled a guide to the great diaries of literature -- from Samuel Pepys to Anais Nin. Mallon has written a new introduction for this edition which comments on the political consequences of keeping a journal, as in the former controversy involving Sen. Bob Packwood. A diarist himself, Mallon places journal writers in history, fleshing them out with both background and witty anecdote.",
