  "description": "Should you ever mix business with pleasure? Billionaire Grayson Finlay knows what it’s like to have and nothing will ever get in the way of his success again. Now at the helm of a thriving tech enterprise, the fearless entrepreneur is about to launch a new app to help people dress for success. But when he’s splashed with mud on his way to an investors meeting, a chance encounter with tiny fashion boutique owner Mila Tomlinson changes everything. She has just the right clothes he needs to look the part—and she’s just the right woman to catch his eye. As pressure mounts for Grayson’s idea to become a viral sensation, so does his interest in Mila. A business bet feels like a sure-fire way to propel both Mila’s boutique and Grayson’s app and give them an excuse to work together. Charged and determined, Mila and Grayson work hard but play harder… Until one night of hot passion results in some serious consequences when Mila discovers she’s pregnant. With a baby on the way, Mila struggles with Grayson’s playboy lifestyle, ambition and grand plans—just opening her boutique was a risky endeavor, one that pushed her far from her comfort zone. Will she ever be able to trust a man who puts business before pleasure? Grayson has similar doubts. Can he trust himself as a parent? Would a relationship with Mila be a total disaster? And will his wavering heart distract him from pursuing the success he’s always dreamed of?  50% longer than normal Leslie North books—but at the same price!",
