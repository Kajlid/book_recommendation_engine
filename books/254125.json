  "description": "“Strait-laced. Ruthless. Arrogant.”Alexander Westhide, the Duke of Rakecombe has no quarrel with such faint praise as he has forever shunned marriage, women and anything remotely resembling love. Indeed, the damning words merely serve to enhance his haughty façade. But beneath the controlled demeanour lies a duke beset by tragedy, a man turbulent and restless.“Forthright. Impudent… Capricious saucebox.”Miss Aideen Quinlan can’t quite express why she feels the need to taunt, tease and generally annoy the Duke of Rakecombe. Maybe it was for the heart-racing spar of words that always ensued, or maybe it was to see the duke’s broad fist clench on his ebony cane, green eyes glittering.Or maybe it was because she was unable to erase the memory of his vehement kiss…An unlikely couple.Torn between his world of espionage and this unquenchable passion, the duke still refuses to lower his fierce defences.If Aideen is to capture her resistant duke’s troubled heart, it is she who must follow the Rules of the Rogue.Resistance is futile…A sensual Regency Romance with warmth and wit, this story also includes unpalatable chefs, a darling of the Season with a secondary love story, deadly walking canes and sheep…",
