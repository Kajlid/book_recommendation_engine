  "description": "Conundrums of a Half-Jew – a humorous romp through religious ambivalence. I was a religious mutt— a matzo brie pizza; a blintz marinara; a bagel and lox trapped inside a spaghetti and meatballs body. Some Amazon Reviews.. (4.8 stars/15 Reviews..) \"Funny, silly, absurd and most of all heartwarming.\" Toni Roche \"More tongue in cheek than any kosher deli.\" Robert S. Rosenthal \"This is a pisser.\" Larry SchneidermanThe offspring of a Jewish mother, begotten by a pair of good old-fashioned European Jew begetters, and an Italian Catholic father, I straddled religions for most of my youth. I was a Jew Catholic, or Cath Jew, or half and half, or half-Cath, or half-Jew, or Jewolic, depending upon whom I was trying to impress or what I was attempting to avoid.My Gram tried to convince me that I was a Jew by virtue of the ‘mother of the Jew rule’. I remained solidly unconvinced and ambivalent. “But why isn’t the rule: if your father was Catholic, you are too?” I always challenged the ‘mother of the Jew rule’ when I had an urgent need to irk. “Because you are a Jew,” she said, a cigarette dangled from her lips and smoke meandered up through her glasses.“How can you be so sure?”“Because, you are a schmuck and only Jews can be schmucks.” She had embroidered the very same saying onto a pillow, which she threatened to give to me for my birthday. She opened the clasp on her purse and snapped it shut, signaling the official end of the conversation. That was my conundrum. This is my story. More Amazon Reviews.... \"Oy. Such a good boy. Such a good book...had me laughing out loud.\" Michael Bernhaut \"Mox Nix. End of story. Buy this book.\" Grady Harp, Amazon Top 50 reviewer \"An ethnic jewel!\" Joel Bresler.",
