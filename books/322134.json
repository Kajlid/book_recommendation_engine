  "description": "I’m a scoundrelPlayboy. Man whore. Basically, I get around, and I’m not afraid to admit it.So when my best friend opens up Salacious Players’ Club and asks me to head the construction, how could I say no? Now we’re on a cross-country road trip touring other kink clubs, and I couldn’t be happier. Life is good.Then Hunter suddenly asks me to sleep with his wife…while he watches.I’ll do anything for my best friend, but this is the one request I should say no to. Isabel is the woman of my dreams, but she’s his. And the exact reason I should say no is the one reason I say yes.Because it’s not only Isabel I want. These are the two most important people in my life, and if we go down this path, how will I ever be able to walk away? I’m not sure my best friend understands just how much I’m willing to do for him—and why.",
