  "description": "Jade's saga is coming to a close. Love triangles can't go on forever, well at least her's can't. Neither John nor Julian is the sort of man to put up with such a messy situation for too long. It's time for Jade to make a choice. It's more than just a relationship on the line for her. Her entire life is about to change. Meeting her mother for the first time puts things into perspective for this indecisive heroine, and other family secrets are revealed. At the end she'll know exactly which man she belongs to. Enjoy this whirlwind romance!*This is Jade's story picking up after she leaves Brazil. It was originally part of Only Her Heart prior to 2014. I have since edited that book due to the length.*",
