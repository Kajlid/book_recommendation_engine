  "description": "A collection of answers to the philosophical questions on people's minds—from the big to the personal to the ones you didn't know you needed answered.Based on real-life questions from his Ask a Philosopher series, Ian Olasov offers his answers to questions such - Are people innately good or bad?- Is it okay to have a pet fish?- Is it okay to have kids?- Is color subjective?- If humans colonize Mars, who will own the land?- Is ketchup a smoothie?- Is there life after death?- Should I give money to homeless people?Ask a Philosopher shows that there's a way of making philosophy work for each of us, and that philosophy can be both perfectly continuous with everyday life, and also utterly transporting. From questions that we all wrestle with in private to questions that you never thought to ask, Ask a Philosopher will get you thinking.",
