  "description": "In 1803, a New England trading ship put in at the Nootkan village of the Eagle House on the Canadian Pacific coast. Its purposes were to replenish provisions, barter for valuable sea otter pelts and, incidentally, to obtain sexual services of the young village women.A group of rebellious Indian youths, infuriated by the arrogance and disdain of the white men, carried out a violent plan to massacre the crew and plunder the ship. Surviving the slaughter were Jewitt, the appealing and skilful ironsmith, and Thompson, the dour sailmaker. Eagle Song is the turbulent tale of their two-year captivity, seen through the eyes of Siam, a Nootkan nobleman.",
