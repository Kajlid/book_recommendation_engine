  "description": "In Henry and Mudge's eighteenth adventure, Henry's cousin Annie is moving -- right next door to Henry! Annie likes Henry and Mudge, but she's nervous about leaving her friends, and about changing schools, and about what might happen to her things on the moving truck. She's so nervous she's broken out in blotches. But Henry knows just the thing for a bad case of nerves -- a snuggle under a blanket with a big dog like Mudge!",
