  "title": "Finding Me",
  "description": "The lines are blurred between what is real and what isn't, the darkness that was once a place I feared was now a place of safety. If I stayed in the darkness, the hellish reality of what was truly happening no longer seemed real. But I was about to be pulled from beneath the consuming blanket of dark shadows, and plunged into the murky depths of my past. I was about to be shown my demons and all their evil sides, all of their pain and grief. I could only hope I survive it. What happens when the world you once knew crumbles and falls at your feet? Who will find me? Who will save me from my demons? My dark prince or my white knight... And will I find myself in the process?",
