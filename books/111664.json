'Death In A Northern Town had absolutely everything for me , it made me laugh , it made me cringe, it made me wince in imagined pain and ultimately it just made me very very happy. It is a modern zombie classic with real heart and I implore all lovers of horror fiction to pick up a copy of it NOW!! 10/10' - UK Horror Scene 'A must buy' - A Dead Little Podcast",
