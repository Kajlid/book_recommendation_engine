  "title": "Fall Into the Sun",
  "description": "They should have spent the past 22 years together, but life took some unexpected turns for Bobby Gallegos and Alejo Sandoval. Heartbreak and rejection can harden the hearts of two passionate, stubborn men. One, deeply devout, wanted to attend college. One, who perfected a tough act to deceive his brothers, might have followed his dad to prison. Now, at 40 years old, they maintain a long-distance relationship as sex buddies, who don't quite trust each other. Their lives have sharply diverged. One is now divorced with two teenagers, who bring him joy and despair. One has just had a near-death experience on the job. When Bobby returns to Albuquerque, he will use sex, persuasion, and memories of their shared past to try to convince Alejo to take a chance on him and reach for the future that they were meant to share together. Note: REACH FOR THE MOON is listed as a prequel to FALL INTO THE SUN, but only in the sense of having the same characters at a younger age. Think of FALL INTO THE SUN as what might have occurred on an alternate timeline. Meanwhile, REACH FOR THE MOON is what really happened on the main timeline. The events of REACH FOR THE MOON do not fit into the backstory of FALL INTO THE SUN.",
