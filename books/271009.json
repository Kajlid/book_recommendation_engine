  "description": "Death this way comes,To souls who break Fae law.So it is written,So carved in blood.Mighty are the Fae who watch us all. \nI’m screwed. Royally screwed. Of all the ways to mess up, I picked a real gem this time—of the dastardly shifter sort. Especially because I’m the crowned elven princess.A forbidden soul mating with the cruel King Athon was not why I attended the royal summit of magical races. Our kinds do not mix, as is written in death-blood. And I’ll be damned before I let some arrogant alpha tell me what to do, and for once I’m not talking about my father.But now, I’m on the quest of a lifetime.My crew of accomplices—sworn enemies.Including King Athon and my father.Our mission—retrieve ancient artifacts lost forever.Good luck there. And if we fail? No worries. The giants will crush the realm.Between all the secrets and lies, my name is Trixie Towers; and that’s the only truth that won’t get me dead.",
