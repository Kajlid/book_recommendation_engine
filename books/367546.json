  "description": "Poetry. \"BLACK-EYED HEIFER is a mighty anthem to down home local culture--the deeply rooted--the feisty, sustaining rhythm that saturates the land. These lyrical prose poems sing a 'rampant fire' tune 'to yesterday's hands-up hinterland' and the fact that 'there were horses, there always are.' There is abundant vitality and wide-eyed beauty in Shelly Taylor's contemporary Georgian eclogues, 'all the while mindful of the color turn' and 'silent footwork & news'\"--Brenda Iijima.",
