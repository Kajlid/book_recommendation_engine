She’s heard of the super secretive event known as the Seduction Party, and she won’t be content until she finds a way in. The last thing she expects to find is that Drex is the host. She’ll never get an invitation from her nemesis—unless she finds a way to get one herself. And breaking into his house is nothing if it means getting the scoop. But what she gets instead is an eye-full of the man himself, half-naked and more than she’d ever dreamed he could be in all her teenage fantasies.Drex has been fantasizing about Chris forever, and now that she’s a grown woman, he still has a hard time treating her like one.

He never dreamed sex could be like this, with Chris in his room, tied to a bed, asking him for stuff that blows his mind…But when things turn ugly, it becomes clear that someone wants the nosey reporter dead. And Drex will have his hands full trying to keep his prize safe…",
