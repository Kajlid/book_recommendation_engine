  "description": "After two years in Saint Mary's Asylum Coltrane Dawson is ready for the world, but is he ready for love?  Cole Dawson's life is filled with solitude and one-night stands. Get on, get off, and get out—that’s his motto. Anything more would expose the darkness that still lurks within him, a darkness he's not willing to share with any woman. That is, until a chance encounter puts him face-to-face with the one he's wanted since forever.  Self-doubt and a crippling case of writer's block have all but destroyed Nina Gray's career. Everything changes after Cole shows up as “The Entertainment” at her birthday party. And when they cross paths again, entering into an unconventional business arrangement that some deem scandalous, the two embark on an emotional journey of discovery, forgiveness…and perhaps even more.Author's Note: Temptation's Edge is a standalone, so if you haven't read Within Temptation, you'll have no problem reading this one. New hero. New heroine. New story. Also, Book #1 was a romantic mystery. This book is a straight contemporary romance.",
