  "description": "You've heard of Neverland and its inhabitants... fairies, pirates, mermaids, and a boy who didn't want to grow up. But you can't always believe the stories. In the vein of Aiden Thomas’ Peter Pan retelling, Lost in the Never Woods , Hook & Crown is perfect for readers who crave fresh, modern twists on classic tales.“Where do I even begin with this book?! As a lifelong fan of Peter Pan I am a sucker for retellings and this one blew my mind. This book took me on a rollercoaster of emotions that I can only hope to share with the world. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a dark and gritty retelling with some plot twists that will leave you breathless!”- Verified ReviewerElena Hart arrives in London, bound for a new boarding school operated by her estranged uncle.

Although she tries to resist his charm, something about him allays her doubts, and Elena is whisked away from the world she knows to one she always thought was make-believe.But Neverland is nothing like the stories Elena grew up hearing, and she quickly learns that the boundary between the righteous and the wicked is hardly clear-cut. She must decide for herself who the heroes and villains are, or if there are truly any at all.",
