  "description": "Amelia owns a successful wedding cake business, has a loving husband, a daughter and sisters who share a bond like no other. Family is her world. What happens to the mind when your world comes crashing down? Will heartache rip her apart? Will she find new love, a new husband, while resisting the voice that beckons for her to return home—that place in the clouds that waits? Along the path of healing, Amy receives loving support from her newly-acquired family as she observes humanity, and prods Taryn (her sister) to hook up with that “Freakin gorgeous grey-eyed hunk of man,” who waits for Taryn to see through the veil and discover her true nature. This story is one of laughter, heartache and erotic romance, with threads of magical fantasy, as a war to protect the Rose is coming.... “… a constant, magical and spicy ride, laden with snort-inducing humor on par with Evanovich.”",
