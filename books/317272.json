  "description": "Welcome to Stargazer Island, where the weird, wonderful, and magical meet.When your mother is a dryad and your father is a Native American Shaman, you’re pretty much guaranteed to be an environmentalist. And Sage takes saving the world seriously. She does her best to keep her carbon footprint as small as possible, up to and including her beloved bookstore, Alternate Universe. But what she doesn’t know is just how big a print she’s left on the heart and soul of one giant Viking.The day Eric set foot on Stargazer Island was the day his world was rocked to the core. Not only did he learn that magic really exists – and that he possessed just such a legacy in the form of a Viking Berserker – but he set eyes on Sage Winters, the woman – quite literally – of his dreams. The real woman though is so much more… smarter, more beautiful, and far, far more infuriating.Eric would do anything to keep Sage safe, even if it means staying away. Too bad the stubborn woman didn’t get that memo. And when Eric discovers she’s in danger from more than just his past? All bets are off, because this Berserker won’t stop fighting until the monsters that threaten Sage are slain. Even if it costs him his life.This is Book 3 in the Stargazer Island Series, but can be read as a standalone.",
