  "title": "Stone Cold Christmas",
  "description": "With Christmas only days away, Pelican Falls, a tiny hamlet not far from Lake Wogegon, is festooned with decorations and teeming with excitement. When Pastor Kathy Johnson rescues a runaway teenage girl, she could not have imagined waking the following morning to discover a body sprawled like a snow angel near the rear door at Grace Lutheran Church. As the blizzard passes and word of the fallen soul rages through the gossip mills at the Pelican Inn and the Curl Up & Dye, some townsfolk come to suspect Pastor Kathy may have bonked the poor fellow over the head. The local police investigation sputters to get started amid old grudges so Pastor Kathy sets about to solve the case. The runaway girl may hold the key but she has vanished. The mystery deepens when the trail leads Pastor Kathy and her friends to be held captive in a pig barn. Will Pastor Kathy be rescued or in jail by Christmas?",
