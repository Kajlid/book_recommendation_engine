  "title": "Hope from Lockdown: A Collection of Pictures and Stories During the COVID-19 Pandemic in New Zealand",
  "description": "Hope from Lockdown is a historical documentation of March - early June 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in New Zealand.  It includes a diverse collection of pictures and stories told by people from Coromandel to Queenstown that were part of the Front Door Project, Nature Revives, and Return to Local projects that were run by Incremental Change Agency in New Zealand during this time. The first edition of Hope from Lockdown was released as a physical book in New Zealand in September 2020 and was sold out soon after. It now lives on in New Zealand’s COVID-19 archives, libraries and museums as a historical account from this time. This digital version is a second edition which we’ve adapted to provide wider distribution for those interested in New Zealand’s story during this period.",
