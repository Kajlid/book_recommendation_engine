  "description": "Nobody on the varsity knew me, but I know what they thought: I was the guy who had good hands and could run like lightning, but who also had a yellow streak down his back.The wide receiver best able to hang on to his quarterback’s passes, Brock Ripley would be a star for the varsity team—if he could just bring himself to put his body on the line. But he can’t. Just like he can’t bring himself to stand up for his friend Richie Fang, who has been targeted by the quarterback, known for his brutality in the school’s Suicide Alley and beyond. As events spiral out of control, Brock is faced with a true test of character. Can he find the courage to step up and do what is right?",
