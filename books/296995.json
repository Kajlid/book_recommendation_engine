  "title": "The Feminine Mistake: Are We Giving Up Too Much?",
  "description": "Author Leslie Bennett insists that in the so-called Mommy Wars, the first casualty is truth. The veteran Vanity Fair journalist argues that much of the apparently relentless campaign against working mothers ignores one of the issue's central components: economics. Her Feminine Mistake stakes out the dollars and cents case for married women participating in the workplace, arguing persuasively that millions of families need two incomes for financial security, medical expenses, and retirement funds, not to mention personal independence. Food for thought; fodder for debate.",
