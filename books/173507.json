Folly Fennington's ability to throw an excellent party had convinced few parents to entrust their children to his theories on education...until the Queen herself had endorsed the school by allowing her daughter to attend.Among the crowds of ambitious students anxious to scrape acquaintance with the royal heir, all Eluned Tenning wants is to keep her head down, work quietly on her portfolio, and support her sister's romance. Not such an easy goal when Eluned's sister is in love with Princess Celestine, her brother is determined to uncover every secret of the estate's chequered past, and the newspapers are full of stories about the Tennings' slightly-vampiric aunt.When the success of the school is threatened by a spate of petty vandalism, Eluned finds herself at the centre of a complicated web of friendship and rivalry. Wanting to fit in will not keep her safe from jealousy. Kissing. Mystery.Or a midnight barking.",
