  "description": "Ethan Bryant's world has been turned upside down by the loss of his submissives. Alone and desperate, his life spins dangerously out of control. Will a return to Chicago give him the closure he so desperately seeks? What happens when a childhood friend comes back into Ethan's life, vying for his love. Will Ethan find what he is looking for, or will Jayden's jealousy tear them all apart and make everything come crashing down? \"I crushed him to me and was hit with a feeling so incredibly strong that, for a moment, I couldn't breathe. There were aspects of it that I recognized easily - attraction, lust, but there were subtler aspects as well and they weren't as readily identifiable - companionship, longing and comfort. The only way I could describe that undercurrent of emotion, strangely, was ... home.\" - Master Ethan Bryant*This title is out of print.",
