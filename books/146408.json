  "description": "F*ck and chuck. Pump and dump. Hit it and quit it. One night stand. Didn’t matter how I branded it—that’s all she'd wanted it to be. That much was clear when she left me with my pants down and my dick still out.  What she hadn’t counted on was fate intervening and our worlds colliding—again.  The day I showed back up in the life of Chloe Griffins, I knew I had to have her again. My body was hungry for another taste. Like an addict, I’d been craving another hit for months, and there she was—flesh and bone, tits and ass.  The fact that she worked for the competition should’ve been reason enough for me to leave her alone. I had a job to do that summer and f*cking Chloe wasn’t part of it. But I was like a man possessed.  I’d do whatever it took to have her again.  *** This is the first instalment in the Indiscretion serial. Volumes 1-3 are approximately 23K-25K in length, with the final fourth instalment being longer. The release schedule is as Volume 2: Aug 18th, Volume 3: Sept 1st, Volume 4: Sept 15th.",
