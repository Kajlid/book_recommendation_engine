  "description": "Dr. Fell is anxious: things are going too well. He's let a boy into his life, and the world didn't end. He has a job, a home, hell, he even has a dog. So why does he have such a bad feeling about what will happen next? Ben, twink, and his boy all claim he's just being his usual grumpy self. They all say he's happiest refusing to enjoy what he has. But, when unwelcome news from the past proves his feeling was right and shakes them all up, Dr. Fell does something that may jeopardize his whole future.",
