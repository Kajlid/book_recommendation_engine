  "title": "Overcoming Depression One Step at a Time: The New Behavioral Activation Approach to Getting Your Life Back",
  "description": "What if depression weren’t a disorder occurring on its own but was rather a kind of signpost pointing at tangible things you needed to change in your life? This would radically alter not only the way you think about depression but also the strategies you’d use to overcome it.Behavioral activation therapy is built on this powerful, insightful assumption. Its techniques offer fast, effective relief from depression by guiding you to make positive and rewarding changes in your life. This simple, profound process reconnects you to the naturally occurring rewards of a well-lived life, which are powerful antidotes to feelings of depression.The workbook’s engaging exercises create a structured framework in which you are encouraged to focus on those activities that will inspire you with feelings of pleasure, mastery, and engagement. Learn to develop a list of enjoyable activities or activities you need to engage in as a part of a normal and satisfying life. Begin with the easiest (or sometimes, the most indispensable) activities on your list, and learn how to tackle them one by one.This book has been awarded The Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies Self-Help Seal of Merit — an award bestowed on outstanding self-help books that are consistent with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and that incorporate scientifically tested strategies for overcoming mental health difficulties. Used alone or in conjunction with therapy, our books offer powerful tools readers can use to jump-start changes in their lives.",
