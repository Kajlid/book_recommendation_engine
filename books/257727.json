  "description": "No one said life was going to be easy, but mine just keeps getting harder.   My best friend has been abducted by a madman who seems to have returned from the dead with the sole goal of seeking revenge against me. She’s my friend, but she’s also essential in finding a cure for a virus that has the potential to destroy the supernatural world.  Did I mention there’s a war brewing between supernaturals and humans? My people, the Legacy, were responsible for the first supernatural war, and now I’m tasked with preventing the second.",
