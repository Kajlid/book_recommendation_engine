  "description": "Liam Hoffen and Nick James are back in the next, exciting installment of Jamie McFarlane's Privateer Tales. After fighting space pirates and rescuing a damsel in distress, nothing sounds better than shore leave at Puskar Stellar on Mars where Liam can reconnect with his girlfriend. But neither their newest crew member, Marny, nor the Mars Protectorate Navy is ready for them to spend much time relaxing. Their old nemesis, Harry Flark, found a new mining station to pillage and the crew of Sterra's Gift has been hired to transport a covert operative into Flark's lair. This is the perfect opportunity for them to set things right if it helps to bring him down. The big problem comes when Liam and Nick discover Flark is expecting them and has no intention of letting them get away with their lives. Like white knights on silver steeds, Liam, Nick, Marny and a passel of new friends fight their way across the solar system, making a name for themselves and their mission.",
