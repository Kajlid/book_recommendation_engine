  "description": "In this wonderful parody from 1940, W.C. Fields announces his candidacy for America's highest office. He offers sound advice on a number of topics in classic Fields-style humor in his attempt to win votes. \"Campaign resolutions are no better than New Year's resolutions,\" he writes. \"They are thrown together hastily at the last minute, with never a thought as to how they may be gracefully broken. Now, I am a candidate with years of experience breaking New Year's resolutions, and what I can accomplish with those, I can certainly accomplish with campaign resolutions.\"",
