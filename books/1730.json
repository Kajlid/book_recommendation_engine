  "description": "The uncompromising achievement of Elias Canetti has been matched by few writers this century. His novel, Auto-da-Fe, and his work of social theory, Crowds and Power, are modern classics, displaying a voracious intellect and an exquisite sensibility that reflect their author's polyglot background. A Ladino Jew born in Bulgaria, Canetti was raised in Vienna, Manchester, and Zurich, finally settling in England. Canetti worked brilliantly in many forms, but the three volumes that compose his autobiography are where his genius is perhaps most evident. The first volume, The Tongue Set Free, presents the events, personalities, and intellectual forces that fed Canetti's early creative development. The Torch in My Ear explores his admiration for the first great mentor of his adulthood, Karl Kraus, and also describes his first marriage. The final volume, The Play of the Eyes, is set in Vienna between 1931 and 1937, with the European catastrophe imminent; here he vividly portrays his relationships with Hermann Broch and Robert Musil, among others. The three volumes, read together, make it clear that this spiritual and intellectual autobiography is much more than a compelling account of the development of a great artist - it is a portrait of the tragic character of an entire era.",
