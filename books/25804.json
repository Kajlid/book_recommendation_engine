Before long, Captain Ryabtsev and Alik Olisevych are teaming up to discover the source of the \"anomalies\".Meanwhile, Taras - who makes a living driving kidney-stone patients over cobblestones in his ancient Opel Vectra - is courting Darka, who works nights at a bureau de change despite being allergic to money.They young lovers don't know it, but their fate depends on two lonely old men, relics of another era, who will stop at nothing to save their city.Shot through with Kurkov's unique brand of black humour and vodka-fuelled magic realism, Jimi Hendrix Live in Lviv is an affectionate portrait one the world's most intriguing cities.",
