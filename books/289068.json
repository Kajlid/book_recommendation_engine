What I did may have put me behind bars, but I don’t regret it. At least not until I met her. She’s the one. And my past is the one thing that may destroy our future.  Cat The MC found me. They gave me a job and I’m under their protection. But right when I start to feel safe again is when I find out there’s nothing that can protect my heart.
