  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B01GDRM3XU Let me tell you now: I kill her. I love Gwenna White more than my life â€“ and still, I'm her demise. It should have been simple. Easy come, easy go, and in between: atonement. She was not who I'd have chosen. Gwen was delicate and lovely: a former model with a ruined life, living in the quiet of the Smoky Mountains, healing injured bears. When she laid her hands on me, she healed me, too. That's how it began. That's where it first went wrong. I knew she could never be mine. But I sinned. I sinned.Murder is a standalone romantic mystery novel. It's the second in the Sinful Secrets Series, in which each book is inspired by a sin and centered on a huge secret.",
