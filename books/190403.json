SALES Follows The Pendragon Chronicles and The Camelot Chronicles, both runaway successes; Brand-new stories from the best writers in the genre and classic tales from the golden age of myth and legend; Mike Ashley is one of the leading figures in this field.

He has written over 500 articles and stories and produced more than 30 books, including The Pendragon Chronicles, The Camelot Chronicles and The Mammoth Book of Historical Whodunnits.
