Malin Strom has been searching for Kase, her childhood sweetheart, since he was lost at the annual masquerade years ago, and with her gift of stealing memories she crosses more than one dangerous line to do it.Until she uncovers a dark secret of the masquerade and a bounty is placed on her head. When she flees, her brother is snatched in her place. Malin's only chance to save him is to enlist the services of a brutal crook—the Nightrender.And he bears a striking resemblance to a face from the past.No longer the boy she knew, Kase now rules as the amoral leader of brutal thieves. Pulled into his world of tricks and schemes, tantalizing attraction returns, but so do secrets: the truth behind Kase’s disappearance, why he stayed away, and why Malin’s magic grows stronger the closer she comes to the masque.But when betrayal tosses Kase and Malin into a deadly game of illusion and magic, Malin faces a cruel choice: save her brother’s life? Or give up the thief who holds her heart…forever.\nFilled with luscious world building, banter-filled romance, and epic battles, this first book in the Eastern Kingdom is part Viking, part Cinderella.
