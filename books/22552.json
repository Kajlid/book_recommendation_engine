  "description": "Plug it in and Cook with French Flair“I’d bet that if French cooks could get their hands on Michele Scicolone’s French Slow Cooker , which is filled with smart, practical, and convenient recipes, they’d never let it go.” — Dorie Greenspan, author of Around My French TableWith a slow cooker, even novices can turn out dishes that taste as though they came straight out of the kitchen of a French grandmère . Provençal vegetable soup. Red-wine braised beef with mushrooms. Chicken with forty cloves of garlic. Even bouillabaisse. With The French Slow Cooker , all of these are as simple as setting the timer and walking away. Michele Scicolone goes far beyond the usual slow-cooker standbys of soups and stews, with Slow-Cooked Salmon with Lemon and Green Olives, Crispy Duck Confit, and Spinach Soufflé. And for dessert, how about Ginger Crème Brûlée? With The French Slow Cooker , the results are always magnifique .",
