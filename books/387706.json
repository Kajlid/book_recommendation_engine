  "description": "Jessie Keaton and Claudia Sherwood were as different as night and day. But when their nation needed experienced female pilots, their reactions were heed the call. In early 1943, the two women joined the Women Airforce Service Pilots—the WASPs—and reported to Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Texas, where they promptly fell head-over-heels in love.The life of a WASP was often perilous by definition. Being two women in love added another layer of complication entirely, leading to ostracism and worse. Like many others, Jessie and Claudia hid their relationship, going on dates with men to avert suspicion. The ruse worked well until one seemingly innocent afternoon ruined everything.Two lives tragically altered. Two hearts ripped apart. And a second chance more than fifty years in the making.From the airfields of World War II, to the East Room of the Obama White House, follow the lives of two extraordinary women whose love transcends time and place.",
