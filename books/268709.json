  "description": "Part two of the epic three-part conclusion to the Ruthless People and Children of Vice series…Do you understand why I asked you last time, how well do you think you knew the Callahans?Because I knew you don’t know them. Not in the way I knew them.But don’t worry. I’ll reintroduce you to them.The real them.I will show you what they are all really, truly, capable of, because I am no longer in the shadows.I am here.In my kingdom, at last.And I do not give a damn about your opinions of me, or the one who came before me.We are doing things my way now.So bow…or be broken.Sincerely,Mrs. Callahan",
