  "description": "Monica Trant and her colleagues don’t even consider their employer, William Waters, a man. He’s just “Still Waters,” the abominably accurate “machine” who barks out orders and gives them dictation. So when he calls Monica into his office with a bizarre “job” offer, to pretend to be his fiancée for the next year, it’s little wonder that she is taken completely by surprise. But when circumstances force Monica to accept this position as Mr. Water’s nominal fiancée she finally finds her backbone. She may be a poor clerk who’s come down in the world, but her new position has perquisites Mr. Waters never could have foreseen: the opportunity for Monica to have the upper hand and needle him every chance she gets, all under her guise as… His Official Fiancée. Praise for Berta Ruck: \"One can always depend on finding an interesting plot, strongly tinged with originality, in any novel by this author.\" – The New York Times, April 23, 1922",
