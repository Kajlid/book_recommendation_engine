  "title": "Creating a Ponygirl Champion",
  "description": "Julie and Rose are best friends. Julie is the strong outgoing dominant member of the pair. Rose, quiet and shy, usually follows Julie’s lead and does as Julie determines. Over Rose’s objection the two travel to Esham, a small (very small) country in the Near East where women have no rights. Julie thinks she is there to collect an inheritance. As you can guess, things do not go as she planned. Esham is enlightened in one way. It is very ecologically conscious. The preferred mode of transportation, at least for short distances, is ponygirls. Ponygirls of European extraction are prize property. Expectedly, most recruits do not want to become a ponygirl. They resist as best they can, but hundreds of years of experience puts them in a very difficult place. Restrained, tightly controlled, and whipped to be obedient, even the strongest willed girl soon finds herself succumbing to the training. The house of Mahamet is a top training facility for racing ponygirls. What will happen when the headstrong English girl is converted to a ponygirl? Can she resist? Can she find a way out? Will her best friend, help her escape from her new life, or be a party to her training? This novel of 127,000 words contains scenes of nudity, strict bondage, corporal punishment, sexual interaction, and humiliation. It is intended for adults only. If you are offended by any of the above topics, please do not purchase this book.",
