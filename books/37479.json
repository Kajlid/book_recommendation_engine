  "description": "Fate seems to have mistaken Anne Serafini, a forensic photographer, for superwoman and she’s not amused. After being stabbed, witnessing a friend’s murder and shooting a man in self-defense, Anne realizes she’s been Fate’s puppet all along. Now she’s chosen Anna Maria Island to try and take back control of her life. Unfortunately—when a murdered girl washes up on the beach—she understands, once again, Fate has chosen this place for her. Anne’s two eccentric aunts decide it’s time to let her in on a family secret about her inherited gift, but the gift is also a curse. Each green-eyed woman has died before her twenty-eighth birthday. Anne will turn twenty-eight in three weeks. Can she embrace her gift and help stop this budding serial killer? Or is he the tool Fate will use to fulfill the family curse?",
