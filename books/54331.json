  "description": "Centuries ago when England was wild and the mighty castles were built of wood, a petty dispute between neighboring keeps became a perilous feud. It was a feud that passed from generation to generation, destroying the prosperity that might have been. In time Heloise of Border Haven secretly marries Gunner of Reynalds, with the hope that their love would bring the fighting to an end. But their happiness is short lived. On a fateful night, a dreadful curse is cast over Heloise and the Lord of Reynalds, causing the rift between the two families to grow even wider. In order to free herself and Reynalds from their curse, Heloise must gain the aid of Rupert, the last of the Reynalds family. But will Rupert be able to let go of the demons of his past and free them all from torment, before time runs out?",
