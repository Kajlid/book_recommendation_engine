  "description": "Emily Chambray wants a divorce. Unfortunately, her husband believes in “’til death do us part” with an emphasis on “death.” She won’t get another chance, so her get-away plan must be foolproof. When a ruggedly handsome stranger comes to her aid, she definitely doesn’t expect to fall for him in her hour of deepest need.Xavier Caine has ulterior motives when he offers Emily refuge in his rustic cabin. Against his better judgment, he is drawn to her innocent allure and natural beauty. Together, they explore a sensual relationship that rocks their world. But once Caine sets the stage for his own agenda, Emily could end up directly in the eye of the very storm she’s been trying to escape.****GRAPHIC LANGUAGE, SEX, AND ADULT SITUATIONS****",
