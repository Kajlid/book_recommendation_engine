  "description": "Don’t bargain with the fae they say. If only I had remembered the fae are real. Waking up in the hospital in Arizona with no memory of my life— sucked. Living with my grandmother and working at said hospital— totally boring. That’s me, plain Jane, boring girl with no past, Allora James. Or at least I thought. Then I met Callen: a beautiful man who claims to know me but I can’t remember. Yet he’s not even the most surprising thing about my past. Someone wants me dead. The evil leprechaun assassin after me is proof of that. The more I learn, the more I realize everything I’ve been told is a lie. I need the truth if I want to survive.At this point, I don’t know what’s scarier: finding I’m not entirely human or that those after me aren’t either. The world I’ve stumbled upon is one of myths and fairytales, and a bargain with an alluring fae prince might be the only way to get my memory back. I just need to keep one thing in mind— don’t fall for the enemy. Born of Sky is a YA sweet, urban fantasy romance full of mystery, magic, and humor, with a sarcastic female lead who doesn't back down, and powerful fae males you can't help but swoon for. If you love Evermore Academy by Audrey Grey and the world of Mortal Instruments, then you'll want to read this right meow!",
