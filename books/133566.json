  "title": "Georgian Poetry: Poems by D.H. Lawrence, Siegfried Sassoon, Rupert Brooke, Robert Graves, Edmund Blunden, Walter de la Mare & others",
  "description": "* A compilation of the Georgian Poetry anthologies published by Edward Marsh from 1911-22. * Edited and with a new introduction by Keith Hale *The Georgians in their day were acclaimed as bold, fresh, and realistic in their use of language. D.H. Lawrence, a contributor to the anthologies, said the first collection was \"like a big breath taken when we are waking up after a night of oppressive dreams.\" Lawrence reviewed the first anthology in John Middleton Murry's Rhythm, proclaiming: \"I worship Christ, I worship Jehovah, I worship Pan, I worship Aphrodite. [...] I want them all, all the gods. They are all God. But I must serve in real love. If I take my whole, passionate, spiritual and physical love to the woman who in return loves me, that is how I serve God. And my hymn and my game of joy is my work. All of which I read in the Anthology of Georgian Poetry.\"",
