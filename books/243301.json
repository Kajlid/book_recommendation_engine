But mostly, poor decision-making.Porthos and Athos aren't going to sleep together, no matter what Aramis says. Aramis isn't going to marry her girlfriend, Minister Chevreuse, which probably means they're breaking up. Athos is not prepared to be visited by the ghost of his dead husband. Oh, and the Duchess of Buckingham is totally not going to hook up with the Prince Consort thereby causing an interplanetary diplomatic disaster... right?When a group of \"festive terrorists\" start inflicting traditions from a very different midwinter festival on the space station via nano-virus, the Musketeers and the Red Guard are expected to work together to protect Paris Satellite. This isn't going to end well.Joyeux is the prequel novella to Musketeer Space, an epic gender-swapped space opera retelling of The Three Musketeers.",
