  "description": "Follow the Bradbeer family and their adventures once again in PHELIX, the second offering of The Time Store.  RULE NUMBER TWO OF TIME TRAVEL, LEAVE NOTHING BEHIND.  London. A borough steeped in history. Home of the Royal Observatory, Cutty Sark, Old Royal Naval College and the PRIME MERIDIAN. Also home to the Bradbeers, a family of Time Travellers.  The year is 1913. After an unsuccessful start to his adventures in time, Oliver Bradbeer realises that he has no option but to flee. His subsequent exploits across London leave behind two things. Complete mayhem. And his own left arm. The year is 2014. The Bradbeer family of today are rocked by the actions of their elusive ancestor. Following her recent injuries, Sarah eases herself back into The Time Store by investigating a deserted cottage, whilst Jason goes to the 1974 Motor Show accompanied by a client with a secret to hide. But the need to protect their own timeline becomes more pressing as Oliver’s rampage continues… and thus begins a chase which spans over two and a half centuries. What does Oliver want? Confidence? Power? Bravery? His missing arm? And what has this got to do, with PHELIX?",
