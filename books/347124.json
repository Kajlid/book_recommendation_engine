  "title": "Going Down With Janis",
  "description": "'IF IT FEELS GOOD, DO IT' was Janis Joplin's philosophy And from the four buck coffee-house gigs to fifty grand one-nighters and million dollar albums she did just that. She shot a lot of smack, grass and speed; made a lot of love - to men or women - and drank a lot of Southern Comfort and tequila. She had a real funky time ...and of course, she sang. She roared, whined and growled and ripped her way to the top. GOING DOWN WITH JANIS is a different kind of book about a different kind of person. It tells a story as raw and honest as her voice, as gut-shaking as her songs, and as vivid as her memory.",
