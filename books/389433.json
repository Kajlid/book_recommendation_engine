  "description": "There's a moth trying to beat itself to death against the lightbulb on the ceiling.And here I am, alone in the bathroom, holding a razor blade at the ready. Guess we all make do in lieu of a moon.Beneath the mirror, a black feather--a gift, a worthless thing--waits and watches.And I remember the screams, and the tears. And because I remember, I won't ever forgive myself for what I let her do to destroy me. I turn my back on my reflection, turn the razor over on my skin.At least, tonight--after--I'll get to see him.For now, I'm dreaming of wings.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\"In a dream we can do anything we want to. Anything at all.\"Set in Melbourne in the late 90s, Trapdoor is a story of love, obsession & beautiful self-destruction.Raven and Pegasus each have their own reasons for denying their feelings for one another, but once they are all they have left in the entire world, how long can this charade really hold out?Sometimes, if you wish hard enough, dreams can come true, even if you should wake to find them gone like shadows in the morning.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------120,000 words (400 pages).Contains adult themes, coarse language, homoerotica, violence, self-harm, suicide and drug references.",
