  "description": "Before Hercules found his might and Odysseus went on his Odyssey, there was Icarus, the hero that time forgot. All roads lead to the Labyrinth. That's what twelve-year-old Icarus realizes when he learns that King Minos plans to sacrifice his father, Daedalus, and all the mythical creatures in Ancient Greece to the Minotaur. It's up to Icarus and some unlikely heroes to save the world. Children of the Lost Gods unites legendary heroes and villains from Ancient Greek lore. It's a retelling of classic sagas that were about adventure, friendship, and family.",
