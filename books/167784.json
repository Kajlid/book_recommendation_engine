  "description": "Sometimes, a chance meeting is just the push you need in order to break free from the darkness within…My name is Emma, I’m 23, and I’ve never been kissed. I’m no virgin…But kissing is too intimate, too intense, and I don’t want that – not ever. I like sex, though, and most of my hook-ups don’t seem to mind the no-kissing part. But then I meet Daniel, who’s such a geek, and definitely not the kind of guy I’d normally take an interest to. He’s the shy, quiet type, but with such a charming smile, and he makes my heart race – something I’ve never experienced before. Daniel has his own issues to work through, and I know my hardened heart shouldn’t melt when he looks at me. I really shouldn’t be falling for him, either, but somehow, he manages to tear down my walls, and I’m scared…because once he learns my secrets, he’ll want nothing to do with me.All I know is that Daniel makes me feel things that I have never felt before – but do I dare let down my walls and confide in him? Will I let him be my first kiss?This is my story, and I’ll reveal everything in my own sweet time…Just don’t expect all the hearts-and-flowers stuff.Life is messy, and mine is no different…INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS\n***Due to possible ‘triggers’ and adult situations (yes, there is lots of sex in this book) it is not recommended to persons under the age of 18.",
