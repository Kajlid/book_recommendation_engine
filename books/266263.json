  "description": "The creative-drawing companion to the acclaimed and bestselling \nWhat It Is\nLynda Barry single-handedly created a literary genre all her own, the graphic memoir/how-to, otherwise known as the bestselling, the acclaimed, but most important, the adored and the inspirational What It Is. The R. R. Donnelley and Eisner Awardâ€“winning book posed, explored, and answered the question: \"Do you wish you could write?\" Now with Picture This, Barry asks: \"Do you wish you could draw?\" It features the return of Barry's most beloved character, Marlys, and introduces a new one, the Near-Sighted Monkey. LikeWhat It Is, Picture This is an inspirational, take-home extension of Barry's traveling, continually sold-out, and sought-after workshop, \"Writing the Unthinkable.\"",
