  "description": "Charlotte gets more than she bargained for when her fairy godmother, Muffin, sends her into a fairy tale for a second chance at life. But instead of being the heroine...Charlotte's accidentally become the evil queen! To make matters worse, there’s a man captive in her basement. A very sexy, very angry man who also thinks Charlotte’s the bad guy. Now she has to figure out how to save the day and get the guy. But will Kai be able to see the real Charlotte underneath it all? Can she thaw his anger and win his love before the ‘real’ heroine ices her? Will the Snow Queen get a happy ever after for once? This novel features a captive alpha hero, a reluctant evil queen, a storyline nothing like that movie you’re all thinking of, and some creative use of ice in the bedroom.",
