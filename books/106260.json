  "description": "Alternate cover for this ASIN can be found hereDia’s life was pretty boring for a girl found on the steps of a convent as an infant. Sure she didn’t know anything about her birth parents but there were millions just like her in the world. Well at least that’s what she thought. Twenty years later and her normal life as a researcher and obedient catholic daughter were thrown out the window. Dia goes from being single to having three mates in a matter of weeks. Try explaining that one to your mum. Her world is turned inside out when she finds out what it means to be the daughter of a god. When all the bad guys want you for a prophesy that is so vague it’s ridiculous; things really start to heat up. It’s up to her and her mates to keep her alive long enough to get control of her powers. It’s not that easy when you’re basically married to a Wolf, an Ancient Fae and well… even Puck has no clue what Daniel is. Read on to find out how Dia survives her Rising.
