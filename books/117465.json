  "description": "The harder she resists him, the faster her clothes will vanish. Outspoken Sarah Santorelli hides her sensitive side behind a gruff personality. Fear of abandonment causes her to manipulate romantic relationships to avoid involving her heart. But when her prying aunt casts a spell on her, Sarah ends up on a voyage of discovery on the open seas. The problem? Every time Sarah lets her guard down, instead of casting off her emotional barriers —the spell makes an item of clothing disappear. Anthony Mancini has clawed his way to the top. Along the way he’s become a workaholic, putting the demands of his company above those he loves. That’s how he lost Sarah, and he wants a second chance to prove he’s changed. Thanks to Aunt Lilly’s spell, and a week-long European cruise, stripping Sarah of her defenses just got easier. Now You See It . . . was originally published in 2006 with Ellora's Cave. Scenes have been added and the novel has been professionally edited.",
