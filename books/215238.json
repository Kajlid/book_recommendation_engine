  "description": "Verified Purchase, Le Quest\"A new Author who writes science fiction with a twist. What a great story! Even at full paper-back price this would have been a bargain read but at a few pence this is a must for anybody out there who likes a touch of classic science fiction with a cross between HG Wells and Steven King. Written in a light very readable style, I thank you Adam for your imagination and gift to us in your authorship.\"My life was a treadmill. Long hours, soul-destroying work, barely keeping up with the mortgage on the home we bought to start a family. By the time we could afford kids, we’d be too old to have them. Modern life eh? Chasing carrots with strings attached.But my life turned around, turned upside down, when Pete, retired chief engineer, moved in next door. Forty years on ships, tinkering, experimenting. Time to create a device that would change the if he could get it to work. Almost there, showing an apparently magical effect. So close to something so amazing. As close as he would ever get.He became my mentor and friend. I was a software engineer with fading dreams, a man in need of a cause. Applying my digital skills to Pete’s genius mechanical wizardry, we smashed through the barriers of metallurgical limits. We brought about the breakthrough that Pete proclaimed would realize a new golden age for mankind. It didn’t. Quite the opposite.",
