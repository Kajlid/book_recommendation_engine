  "description": "Journey's End By Patricia Crossley Dr. Kari Lunne is ready to leave London in order to fulfill her dream of practicing medicine in the third world. On a last walk on Hampstead Heath, Kari and her dog bump into Mr. Tall, Dark and Mysterious and are catapulted four hundred years into the past - to Tudor England. Somewhere in the twenty-fourth century, maverick historian Aidan Torrance plans to make good his mistake by picking up the annoying woman—and her dog—and depositing them back into their own time, like a wrongly directed parcel. He has the technology. It should be simple. Aidan does not reckon on Kari's strong will. Kari does not expect to have to make choices that threaten her whole future. Neither of them expects to find love and happiness with someone far removed from their own space and time. Lovers meeting after a wild ride through time.",
