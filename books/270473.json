  "title": "The Vessel: Nothing",
  "description": "In the year 2030, overpopulation is at critical levels. To combat the problem, a new law is passed which creates a class system, including a Forfeit class in which the least deserving are stripped of all rights and labeled as non-human. Twenty years later, the Elite class rules the world on the backs of the Worker class, while the Forfeits are nothing more than a consumable product, to be used and abused with no restriction whatsoever.The Vessel was a college-aged boy with a name and a future before his parents went bankrupt and damned the entire family to become Forfeits. Heâ€™s purchased at auction by a doctor with his own agenda, and becomes one of many who will find their way into an in-home clinic where the Hippocratic oath no longer applies. Warnings: noncon, dubcon, torture, forced medical procedures",
