My career has skyrocketed while playing Silver Shield, everyone's favorite superhero, but a a part of me longs for something more.Then Lexi Robinson walks into my life. An older woman isn’t who I pictured as my leading lady, but the moment I lay eyes on her, I can’t get her off my mind.The fates have given me a few days to fulfill her fantasies, and I was born for this role.Being a single mother isn't for the faint of heart.So a writing retreat in the heart of the Smoky Mountains is a dream come true. My sister challenged me to find a fun summer fling, but sitting by the fireplace with my pen and paper is the only thing on my agenda. Until Chandler Thomas invades my space. He's ten years younger, but age is just a number when our eyes meet. He has one rule- he covers every expense. I don't trust easily, so I have two requirements of my own- complete transparency, and no contact when the trip is over.A short affair.Three rules.It should be simple.What if that’s not enough?What if I want my happily ever after?",
