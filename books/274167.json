  "description": "With only two witches left, one of them takes her own life rather than fall prey to her enemies. With her dying breath, she summons Dawn, the Goddess of the earth, of birth and rebirth, and protector of the witches. Lucifer, prince of lies, and Ahura-Mazda, master of Heaven, may try to bar her path with treachery and swords, but neither Heaven nor Hell is safe from Dawn's quest for answers - and for bloody vengeance.",
