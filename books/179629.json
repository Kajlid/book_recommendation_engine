  "description": "Lasandria: an ancient civilisation, consigned to oblivion by the greed and power-lust of its own people. The coming apocalypse heralds the arrival of a new evil that will ravage the world of Alanar for an entire age. Yet on the eve of Lasandria's destruction, the ethereal overseers of the mortal realm grant a dispensation -- a promise of hope for the future.That hope lies with an orphaned teenager named David, born some ten thousand years later; a boy whose isolated and uncertain existence leads him on a journey upon which hinges the fate of not just his world, but countless others.On the run from a brutal military force, David's quest is one born of shattered dreams and tainted by the thirst for revenge. As an inter-dimensional war that has been waged since the beginning of time threatens to consume his world, the dark force that destroyed Lasandria lurks in the shadows, ready to take possession of the one thing that will either save or destroy Alanar -- David.",
