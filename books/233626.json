  "title": "Ways of our Grandfathers: Our Traditions and Culture",
  "description": "Ways of Our Grandfathers compliments David D Plain's previous book, The Plains of Aamjiwnaang. While his first book focused on the history of the Ahnishenahbek (Chippewa) of Aamjiwnaang territory Ways of Our Grandfathers describes Ahnishenahbek culture and traditions from the pre and early contact period with Europeans. It covers such anthropological topics as social life, economic life, and religious life. Clear descriptions of characteristics, language, political structure, band designations and their totemic system are illustrated. Gatherings, games and stories are depicted with vivid illustrations. Construction of their dwellings and canoes are described as well as methods of hunting, fishing and sugar making. Trade routes and places of trade are given as well as types of trade goods. Religious life is detailed and includes a description of the political structure of the Midewiwin Medicine Society, healing practices and death customs. The book includes an appendix listing many traditional medicines. Another appendix provides a detailed description of a Midewiwin initiation ceremony performed on the banks of the St. Clair River recorded verbatim by a local missionary.",
