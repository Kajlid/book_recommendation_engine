But when some strange things start to happen, she questions whether or not she has a purpose in this life. Then she meets a brother and sister that mean more to her than she even realizes. They are her protectors, and her kindred spirits. Just like her, they are bruised and broken, though for different reasons. When she finally discovers the truth of her existence, her mind is jumbled with everything she has to take in; not to mention the battle she has to fight, inside and out.",
