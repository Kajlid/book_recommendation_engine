  "description": "Sexual abuse is an undeniable and unfortunate reality of life. There are both predators and preys to this unnecessary and preventable crime upon our society. Too often, the occurrence is treated like a taboo secret or a skeleton that is tucked away in a closet somewhere while the victims feel like no one hears their cries, no one understands their pain, and no one can help or care. Without Permission puts roadblocks in front of that misconception by letting victims know that they are not alone; their voices need to be heard; and there are avenues for help in the midst of their pain. Sharon R. Wells through dramatic recollection of her own personal experience; exploration of the voices of others; and motivational and inspirational supplication,sheds illuminating light on a topic that is too often swept under a proverbial rug of denial and despair. Without Permission is a gift of hope. It's a source of deliverance for those in need of encouragement that they can move beyond being a victim to becoming victorious. This journey is a testimony illustrating that tears don't have to last always and strength and healing comes from breaking the silence of abuse. Sharon R. Wells takes the taboo issue of Sexual Abuse from a position of guilt and shame, transforming it to a position of empowerment stemming from the perception and acknowledgment of self acceptance and community awareness.",
