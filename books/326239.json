  "description": "Cyn and Megan have had two very different summer holidays. While Megan was away at music camp, Cyn was exploring the magical worlds of Atlantis and Xanadu with the powerful genie, King Sinbad. But when Cyn tries to tell her best friend about her adventures, Megan is more interested in showing off her new hairstyle and clothes. That is, until she steals the genie's enchanted ring and summons King Sinbad for herself ...The genie grants Megan a wish, but not the kind she was hoping for. He banishes her to Circe's island, where she is mistaken for a slave and forced to serve the wicked sorceress. Cyn can't leave her best friend in danger. Together, she and the flying carpet set out on a perilous journey of rescue to the Magic Isles and beyond, along the silken road to the ancient city of Samarkand.",
