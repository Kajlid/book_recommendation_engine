  "description": "After years of scraping a living from the proceeds of petty crime Bruce and Archie unexpectedly hit the jackpot when they are mistakenly identified as heroes. They become honoured guests in the Royal Sargorean household where, with an endless supply of booze and more servant girls than you can shake a stick at, their every whim is catered for. However, their good fortune is short lived as within days the Sargorean Kingdom is invaded by the Mamolians. With the help of a blundering old wizard called Nobby, Bruce and Archie manage to escape. Although free, if they want the good life back then an act of heroism is needed. A rather silly medieval fantasy time travel adventure.",
