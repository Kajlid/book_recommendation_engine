  "description": "“Marry the devil…or die.”  That’s the ultimatum Belle Harrison, vampire slayer, just received from a demon. Belle has only one response: To hell with him.  Turns out it’s not that easy, though—apparently the devil doesn’t know the meaning of the word no.  Lucky for Belle, three panty-melting vampires come to her aid. Three hot vampires she can’t resist. Hey, we all have our vices. Hers just happen to have fangs.  And she’s going to need these three to help her thwart the devil’s marriage proposal and defeat the terrifying dark force that wants her dead.",
