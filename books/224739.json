  "title": "Alfie Slider vs the Shape Shifter",
  "description": "Some people say that Alfie Slider is a bit weird, but he thinks that weird just means different. Weird is good!  Living with his 'different' family is never predictable for Alfie, but nothing could prepare him for what happens when he finds a strange key on his way home from school. This is no ordinary key – it seems to break the laws of physics! Once he's figured out how to use it, Alfie is caught up in adventures that are literally out of this world.  This story has evil grannies, flame-throwing frogs, bossy computers, shape-shifting aliens, huge explosions, best friends and parallel universes. In other words, it's a bit weird…but weird just means different!",
