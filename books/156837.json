  "description": "The first two years of the War for Restoration of the Hegemony have been a brilliant success for Promono-Dei the World-Queen, helped by The Oracular Topaz hanging around her neck. It answers her every question about the present or past, but not the future. Her bitter foe is Kordo-Strî, an influential member of the Council of Forty-Two of the Kingdom of Nobalos. Kordo-Strî has the power of planting thoughts in people's heads, though without full mind-control. Kordo-Strî's husband Lord Bashânîr knows the secret of the Oracular Topaz, and plans to make a duplicate of it, nullifying Promono-Dei's advantage. He has also invented Malga's first steam-powered warship, which threatens to wreak havoc on Promono-Dei's fleet. Another force to be reckoned with is Plâkî Queen of Roude-Kî, who alone in all the world can sit on the back of the great predatory bird the soin, and make it fly. All these elements clash in the on land and sea alike as the battle for Mastery of Malga reaches its climax in Mistress of Land and Sea.",
