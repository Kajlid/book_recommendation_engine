  "description": "A season past the Maji-Maji Fever swept through Prefecture 7 of Solai. Of the forty families in Yego’s prefecture, ten were wiped out. Of the remaining, the survivors of the fever are permanently marked with water-lung, the slow deteriorating after effect of the illness that often results in death. For Yego apTolgos, watching her mother drown in her own body is beyond what she can handle. When trips to the khemist, and all other medicines refuse to work, she is left with only one choice. Disobey the Ban set by the KIP of Solai and go into the forest in search of the Stone-Temples and their keepers. Remnants of the old world rumored to still hold ancient knowledge and quite possibly a cure for her mother’s illness. But nothing is given without a price, and the cost, Yego finds, may be her life. In the heart of Urun Forest Yego discovers a world that thrives on ancient laws and customs, haunted by dangerous beasts and old magic. There, she finds that the old traditions that once belonged to the Solani are still alive in all their magnificent, horrifying and ravenous beauty.",
