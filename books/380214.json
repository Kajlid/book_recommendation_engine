  "description": "Pat Gilbert’s definitive biography of the Clash – universally acclaimed as a great book – has already sold over 20,000 copies in paperback. Now, for the 30th anniversary of the band’s classic London Calling album, it is reissued with a stunning new cover. For the book Pat Gilbert – a former Mojo editor with the highest credentials – talked to everyone, in over 70 interviews with the key participants – roadies, producers, friends and fans - and above all the band members themselves, including Joe Strummer before his death, to be able to give the first real insight into what went on behind the scenes during the Clash’s ten-year career. With the surge in interest generated by the Shea Stadium live CD and the official Clash book, Passion Is A Fashion will attract a new sale as the only truly indispensable Clash book.",
