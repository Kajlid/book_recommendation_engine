Little do they know they're sharing their house with a sinister squatter that lingers in the fireplace and likes to come out and play when the sun goes down.Financially broke, Molly decides to go public about the ominous presence in the farmhouse, hoping to cash in on the phenomena, never considering the repercussions of her actions.Billy's Experiment:A dark tale of mistaken identity...On the night of a lunar eclipse, park ranger Bill Steward rescues a baby from a strange band of misfits on the misty moors of Old Castle's national park.Seven autumns later, Bill and his wife, Dorothy, discover a ghastly experiment in a treehouse and a mysterious medical prescription written in a childish scribble.Bill realises what he'd observed on the moors seven autumns ago wasn't what it seemed. Who was saving who, exactly?Just as Bill's eclipse is beginning, so, too, is Billy's.Crazy Daisy:It is always night in the cave. Take my cold hand.",
