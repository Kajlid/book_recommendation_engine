  "description": "Courage of a king, Strength of a knight, Heart of a womanA literary phenomenon.--New York Times\nHer father is a robber baron...\n\nHer husband has grand ambitions and a quick temper...\n\nShe will become...the Great Maria.\nA lush portrait of the eleventh century that leaves out none of its harshest nature, Great Maria is Cecelia Holland at her most evocative. A mere fourteen years old, strong-willed Maria is betrothed to Richard. Theirs is a marriage of conflict, yet one that grows over the years into respect and partnership. As they struggle--at times against each other, at times side-by-side--Maria and Richard emerge as full-blooded characters you'll never forget.What Readers Are SayingHolland's characters are so complex and vividly drawn that the reader actively participates in their adventures.An intriguing plot, unforgettable characters, and a wonderful sense of place makes this one of the finest books I have read.If Hemingway had written historical fiction, he would have had a hard time beating Ms. Holland. Her terse, tense writing style is incomparable, and her character development is superb.A stunning book.Characters so believable, they walk off the page and into the room. Few authors can bring the past to life as powerfully as Cecelia Holland. I'd recommend her to any fans of historical fiction.--Elizabeth Chadwick, author of The Greatest Knight and To Defy a KingThis novel's success is assured by its own excellence.--Library Journal One of the very best historical novelists of our day.--Larry McMurtry",
