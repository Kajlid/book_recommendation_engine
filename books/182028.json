  "description": "When one down-on-his-luck lumberjack meets one incorruptible Mountie, the sparks are sure to fly!  Chuck MacKenzie has been doing it tough lately – and when he finds himself on the wrong side of the law, he’s hotly pursued by hunky Mountie Constable Justin Douthat.  But with a snowstorm closing in, the two of them have to take shelter in an abandoned cabin. Alone, they soon find themselves sharing confidences – along with a whole lot more.  This is a gay romantic comedy short read – no cliffhangers! It is intended for mature audiences only and contains graphic scenes of sexuality.",
