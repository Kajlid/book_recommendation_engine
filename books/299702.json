  "description": "The magical world is thrown into chaos by the arrival of death dragons from the north. Coven after coven fall to this mysterious and seemingly invincible foe. The good witches of the world are rendered powerless and stricken by fear at the hands of the cruellest of enemies. Maya and Evaline are forced to flee for their lives, but there's more to Evaline's chequered past than first meets the eye. As the truth is finally revealed, have they walked willingly into a trap or can they find a way against seemingly impossible odds? This is the sixth book in the award-winning Young Adult series Maya's Magical Adventures, but don't worry each book stands alone. Hall of fame Amazon reviewer NN Light says of the series: \"Looking for what to read after Harry Potter? Pick this up today! A must read for all fantasy readers, 5 stars.\"",
