  "description": "If you only had a few weeks to live, what would you place on your bucket list? Morbid I know, yet isn't it better to question this right now, rather than you depressingly admit you still have a million things to place on that list towards the end yourself? Lucy Webster wasn't lucky enough to live a long life, then at just twenty-five she too had to put together a list. Together with her heartbroken boyfriend, this is their story; her final few weeks, as they comically work their way through her true dreams and desires. A list like no other bucket has ever seen before, where if her life was to flash before her eyes, she would only need to vision this time to feel she achieved it all.",
