  "description": "Linda's had a bad day. First her boyfriend killed her. Then she woke up, still on this boring plane of existence, and with an odd obsession about her missing body. Mike won't tell her what he did with her body, and she can't find the stupid thing herself. There's only one thing she can do - torment the bastard until he coughs up the information.This is a very short work - novelette length - around 11000 words or 44 (print) pages.Warning: Frequent foul language, mild sex scenes, and Australian spelling. Not suitable for children.",
