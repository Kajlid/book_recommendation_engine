To protect the troubled estate, Derek submits to his father's wishes, not realizing he's about to entangle himself in a hell of a lot more than marriage.Miss Clementine Henrietta Grey may be worth millions, but not a single coin has ever bought her a smidge of happiness. When she marries the charasmatic and dashing Viscount Banfield, whose only strife in life appears to be the uneven seams in his coat, she finds that siring the heir he wants requires far more than her heart is prepared to give.Unable to seduce his overly-serious and reluctant wife, Derek realizes his dreams of creating a loving family has turned into a nightmare. But with the unexpected assistance of a retired courtesan and her outrageous school, Derek and Clementine discover that passion is a language spoken not just from the body, but from the mind, heart and soul.WARNING: This book is Rated Double S (Sweaty & Sinful) and contains strong language and sexual content which may cause respectable people to swoon.This quirky, sexy and scandalous Regency/Victorian Historical Romance is part of a series.THE SCHOOL OF GALLANTRY SERIES:Book 1, Mistress of PleasureBook 2, Lord of PleasureBook 3, Lady of PleasureBook 3.5, Romancing Lady StoneBook 4, Night of PleasureBook 5, Master of Pleasure",
