  "title": "They Move Below",
  "description": "Horror lives in the shadows.It exists under the earth’s surface in ancient caves. Below the vast sea’s undulating waves. Under dense forest cover. Within a storm’s thick, rolling clouds. And downstairs in our homes, when we hear the knife drawer rattle in the night. Even our minds and bodies harbour the alien under the skin, the childhood nightmares in our subconscious.Darkness hides things, no matter how much we strain our eyes. And sometimes those things are looking back at us.In this collection of fifteen scary stories to tell in the dark, Karl Drinkwater sews flesh onto the bones of our worst fears, full of creeping menace that seeps from urban legends and folk horror.",
