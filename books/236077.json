  "title": "Gather the Bones",
  "description": "It’s the early 90’s. Smart phones, e-mail and Google don’t exist, and being a teenager is just as difficult as ever… but when you add date rape, an accidental pregnancy, unexpected psychic abilities, and a murder mystery, you’ve got some serious trouble. This coming-of-age story is both a cross-country adventure and a cautionary tale.  Follow Natalie as she faces the pressures and pitfalls of late adolescence and grows into a young woman with remarkable abilities. Take a trip from the East Coast to the West, from naive to empowered. Gather the Bones is an inspirational tale of how one young woman turns trauma into triumph.  (This is a re-release of the book formerly titled Orion's Daughter.)",
