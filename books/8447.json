  "title": "From Hell to Eternity",
  "description": "In 2009, The Whitechapel Society 1888, an organization devoted to studying not only the murders of Jack the Ripper, but of Victorian and Edwardian society, held its first ever short story contest. Such was the quality of the entries that Moongypsy Press decided to produce this anthology, comprising the top ten entries in the contest. Each author has produced a mini masterpiece of short horror, based on a compulsory opening line. The talent displayed in From Hell to Eternity is evident in the varied tapestry of tales contained within its pages, some set in the era of the Ripper murders themselves, others placed into a modern and up to date setting. Each has earned its place in this anthology, and each is guaranteed to appeal to those who enjoy a real ’thrill and chill.’",
