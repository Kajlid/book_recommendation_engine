  "description": "TiraEveryone has always told me I'm the best baker. My family, my friends, my town. Going on a televised baking competition should have been a dream come true, but it turned into my worst nightmare. Now, I need to start over in a new town, and with an old friend. Dario Wells was once honest with me, and I punished him for it. I'm getting a second-chance at making things right--and falling back in love with him. But I need to believe in myself before I can believe in a future for us.  DarioI worked hard to become a successful businessman, but there's always been something missing. Or someone. When Tira Coulson needs me, how can I say no? She hasn't talked to me in six years, but I've never stopped loving her. It's time for me to prove to both of us that I can be the man who treasures her above all else--and maybe get her to bake for me again.",
