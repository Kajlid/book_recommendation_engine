  "title": "Never Wipe Your Ass with a Squirrel: A trail running, ultramarathon, and wilderness survival guide for weird folks",
  "description": "The Squirrel Wipe project is an unorthodox primer to the adventurous world of trail running and ultramarathons by ultrarunner and author of 'The Barefoot Running Book' Jason Robillard. The tips provided throughout the book range from practical to weird as Robillard sets out to teach others how to run ridiculously long distances through the wilderness based on his endless self-experimentation. This book goes where no other ultrarunning book dares by covering topics like testicle shaving and methods to get rid of annoying training partners. This book replicates a drunken conversation at a local pub versus the stuffy academic \"how-to\" tone of other similar titles.",
