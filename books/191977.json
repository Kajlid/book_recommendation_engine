  "title": "Is Notre Dame Still A Catholic University? A Catholic Reflection on Faith and Freedom: Before and Beyond the Vagina Monologues and Queer Films",
  "description": "Notre Dame is an independent Catholic university, like Georgetown, no longer chartered by the Vatican or the local diocese. Therefore, Notre Dame's financial, academic, and other resources are not controlled by the Vatican or the bishops but by Notre Dame itself. \"The University of Notre Dame is a Catholic academic community of higher learning, animated from its origins by the Congregation of the Holy Cross. The University is dedicated to the pursuit and sharing of truth for its own sake.\" As such, Notre Dame is expected to be Catholic and secular at once. Otherwise it will be a contradiction in terms. A Catholic university should thrive on both reason and faith, each complementing but without trying to suppress the other. If Notre Dame fails to make the best of both worlds, it will cease to be a Catholic University.",
