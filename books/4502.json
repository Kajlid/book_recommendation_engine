  "title": "The Lady of Shalott",
  "description": "Willows whiten, aspens quiver,Little breezes dusk and shiverThro' the wave that runs for everBy the island in the riverFlowing down to Camelot.Four gray walls, and four gray towers,Overlook a space of flowers,And the silent isle imbowersThe Lady of Shallot.The familiar words of this romantic poem have been enriched by the mysterious and evocative charcoal drawings of the late Charles Keeping. His illustrations will serve to stir the poetic imagination of readers familiar with Tennyson's haunting poem and will add an intriguing element of suspenseand drama to newcomers. A memorable book -- for children and adults alike.",
