  "description": "Shadowland and Ninth Key  are the first two books in the thrilling, romantic Mediator series, from the New York Times bestselling author of the Princess Diaries, Meg Cabot.   Suze is a mediator—a liaison between the living and the dead. In other words, she sees dead people. And they won't leave her alone until she helps them resolve their unfinished business on earth. But after a cross-country move to sunny California, Suze is looking forward to a fresh start and a life free of spectral interventions. Too bad Suze can't escape the undead that easily. She might not mind Jesse, the sexy ghost who haunts her bedroom, but there are plenty of other poltergeists out there with less friendly intentions. Some of them are out for revenge...of the murderous kind. And Suze might be the only one who can stop them. Binge-read the first two books in the New York Times bestselling Mediator series in this bind-up, from the author of The Princess Diaries .",
