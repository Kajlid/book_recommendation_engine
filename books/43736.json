  "description": "Artemis is a spunky and self-reliant 14-year-old who has never been one to let life get her down. But when her father bails — this time for good — the fragile façade of normalcy she created for herself and her younger brother crumbles away.With nowhere to go and no hope of making things right, Artemis grabs her fake ID, her best friend Jason, and heads west in a last ditch attempt to find herself and recover her lost innocence.Alternating between day and night, reality and dreams, Artemis Dreamt is a poetic and eloquent exploration of a girl’s struggle to thrive despite the odds stacked against her.",
