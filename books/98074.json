  "title": "The Prospect of My Arrival",
  "description": "(The new edition came out June 2013. It includes discussion questions and reviews, and the book has been reproofed. Available now on Amazon in kindle and paper. There is also a bonus: a sneak peek at chapters from my new novel THE HOPE STORE. It's about the first store to sell hope over the counter.)Thanks to a scientific breakthrough, a human embryo is allowed to preview the world before deciding whether or not to be born. The embryo, named Prospect, is given a starter kit of human knowledge and its consciousness is inserted into a synthetic twenty-year-old body. What will he make of the modern world with its over-the-counter solutions, rising tide of mean-spiritedness, and senseless violence? He meets a range of people to help him decide, from a greeting card writer with a knack for sympathy cards \"because there's so much in the world to be sorry about\" to his parents whose first child disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Battling over the soul of Prospect is a scientist who sees an opportunity to help the human race evolve -- and a businessman who is more interested in creating something marketable than something remarkable. Sprinkled with humor, The Prospect of My Arrival is a cautionary tale exploring the triumph of imagination, the limits of modern science, and the perils of losing one's sense of wonder.This version includes book review quotes, discussion questions for book clubs, and the text has been reproofed. Also the edition includes a preview of the new novel THE HOPE STORE.",
