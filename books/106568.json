  "description": "The trails around Tucker Springs, Colorado, are perfect for horseback riding, and Nathan finally has the horse he’s been saving to buy for years. So it just figures that the first day he takes Tsarina out for a ride, some guy on a motorcycle spooks her and she throws him, leaving him with two broken limbs and no chance of enjoying the trails for the rest of the summer.Mechanic and nomadic motorcycle enthusiast Ryan feels awful that his wrong turn resulted in injury and inconvenience. To atone, he offers to exercise Tsarina for Nathan, with one caveat: Nathan will have to teach him how to ride. Lessons turn to friendship and then to mutual attraction, but Nathan is determined that attraction is where it ends. He’s been hurt before, and he knows Ryan will never settle down. He might just be too skittish to give them a chance—unless Ryan can convince him to get back in the saddle.",
