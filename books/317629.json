He realizes that Nandini has experienced something extremely bitter in her life.On one such occasion, he notices that while going for therapy, she orders the cab to halt in front of a bungalow. She keeps gazing at the house for a long time. She is overwhelmed with easeless emotions of joy and sorrow. Another house, but in ruins, a little distance away from this one, also arrests her attention. This sequence of events follows a similar pattern during the visits for therapy.Gradually, Paramjit concludes that Nandini's present condition is the result of some unpleasant event in her past life. He could see her burdened with the bruised heart. He couldn't bear to let her suffer anymore. He resolves to dig out the facts in a bid to improve Nandini's condition - mental, emotional and if possible, physical.",
