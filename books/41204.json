  "description": "It began with an unfortunate meeting, a forced abduction and six seeds from a pomegranate. What followed was a forced marriage, the growth of an innocent maiden into a powerful goddess and a passion which would eclipse even death itself. This is the story of Hades and Persephone, whom the Fates and the gods played games with, but who ultimately won the greatest prize either could have hoped for; freedom and love.",
