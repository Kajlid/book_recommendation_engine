  "title": "The Baby Proposition",
  "description": "Clara Barnes wants a baby, and I’m going to give her one. I wanted Clara the first time I saw her, but as soon as I figured out she was the local vet and would be working on my ranch, I knew I had to let her go. I put myself in the friend-zone until the night she told me she wanted to get knocked up.There wasn’t a chance I’d let another guy get her pregnant, even if he was an anonymous donor. Not when she had me, Maverick Wilde—grade A certified Montana cowboy—right in front of her.The arrangement was perfect. I make my donation, she gets her baby, we go back to being friends. No strings. No messy heartbreak.Except everything changes when we decide it’ll be a lot more fun to make a direct deposit and do things the old fashioned way. That spark between us? Now it’s a blazing fire I have no desire to extinguish.Our baby proposition just got a lot more complicated.",
