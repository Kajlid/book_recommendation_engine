  "title": "Louisa May Alcott: The Woman Behind Little Women",
  "description": "In Louisa May Alcott , the extraordinary woman behind the beloved American classic Little Women is revealed as never before.A fresh, modern take on the remarkable Louisa May Alcott, Harriet Reisen's vivid biography explores the author's life in the context of her works, many of which are to some extent autobiographical. Although Alcott secretly wrote pulp fiction, harbored radical abolitionist views, and served as a Civil War nurse, her novels went on to sell more copies than those of Herman Melville and Henry James.Stories and details culled from Alcott's journals, together with revealing letters to family, friends, and publishers, plus recollections of her famous contemporaries provide the basis for this lively account of the author's classic rags-to-riches tale--a perfect gift for fans of Little Women .",
