  "description": "Ticket to Ride is the timeless tale of two writers coming-of-age. While it is set in the late 70s, it's themes are as universal as those in Homer's Odyssey.Enriched with allusions to literary and early rock 'n roll classics, readers of Ticket to Ride will see Morgan and Livy moving from being innocent 17-year-olds to becoming fully realized adults and, like America, anxiously redefining the ideas of \"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\" Ticket to Ride is comprised of two parts, subtitled Just Another Day and Got to Get You into My Life. Got to get You into My Life is the story of Morgan Blake who struggles with the fear of becoming like his angry, alcoholic father. Yearning to find a greater sense of peace and freedom, authentic love and his own voice as a writer, Morgan sets off on an odyssey, both internal and external. The second part, Just Another Day is the story of young Olivia Tinsley, a poor girl from East Finchley/London and her determination to raise herself from poverty and become a successful, self-reliant, and outspoken writer for the New Yorker. Her journey includes meetings with hippies in Spain, U2 in Ireland and feminists in the extreme.",
