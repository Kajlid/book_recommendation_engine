  "title": "Indian Myth and Mankind the Eternal Cycle",
  "description": "From the formless mass of primal chaos appeared the gods who were to create, preserve and ultimately destroy the universe: Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, the  Timurti , or Great Trinity, of Hinduism. They came to rule over a bewildering array of divinities, all of whom were aspects of a single divine reality. But these angels were not invulnerable, and when their world was threatened by demons, running riot through the perfect universe, the gods turned not to their own power for deliverance, but to that of the mother goddess, in the fierce and vengeful form of Kali, the merciless destroyer.  So begins one of the stories taken from the many Hindu, Buddhist and Jain myths collected in  The Eternal Cycle: Indian Myth , just one volume in the series of books called Myth and Mankind, a culture-by-culture examination of world myth and its historical roots. Whether exploring the myths of India, early America, Tibet or Greece, each book brings an ancient culture to life as never before.",
