  "title": "The Books of Zambarau Maji Omnibus",
  "description": "A timid girl who otherwise resigned to blend into the background opens the door to the Phupha (Faerie), becoming more prominent in their world than she could have anticipated; influencing an alliance between dreamers and Fae that would determine the fate of their realms. This Omnibus contains the three volumes originally published as separate volumes in 2006 when 'Black Faerie' first emerged. The epic poem Metaheart and related shorts are also included as extras in this Alpha Edition. More shorts and activities maybe added to future editions. The pre-Meta Edition is now the edition currently available. More Modern Myth will be available in Purple Magazine's annual Modern Myth issues via literature, visual art, song, and multimedia. E-versions are available through UltravioletUnderground.com",
