  "description": "A pretty awesome piece of work - Abel FerreraWhen the local doctor in the sleepy town of Mill Valley in northern California hears a patient's strange complaint that her uncle isn't really her uncle anymore, it's just the start of a descent into a horrific nightmare. As the number of similar stories begins to multiply, Dr Miles Bennell discovers that aliens are silently taking over the bodies and minds of his neighbours, his friends and the world as he knows it.First published in 1955, Jack Finney's classic sci-fi parable has since become a part of our common culture. Filmed by Don Siegel in 1956, Invasion of the Body Snatchers played on Cold War paranoia to create a chilling masterpeice of sci-fi cinema. It was successfully filmed once again in 1978 by Philip Kaufman starring Donald Sutherland.",
