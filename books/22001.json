Romantic sparks fly, but there's a bomb on the plane, aliens outside their window, and a CIA hitman in seat 13-C.Though they manage to survive the doomed flight, little does Matts know he's at ground zero of a germ-warfare conspiracy approved by the President of the US.From the back streets of New Orleans and the corridors of NASA to the super yacht of a gigolo Saudi prince and a showdown in a raging ice storm, the laughs, chases, and shoot-outs come fast and furious in this balls-to-the-wall espionage action thriller.",
