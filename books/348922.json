Anna never knew werewolves existed until the night she survived a violent attackâ€¦and became one herself. After three years at the bottom of the pack, she'd learned to keep her head down and never, ever trust dominant males. But Anna is that rarest kind of an Omega. And one of the most powerful werewolves in the country will recognize her value as a pack member, and as his mate.",
