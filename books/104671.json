  "description": "Experience firsthand the drugs, the sex, the sadness, the hope, the dream, the despair, the speed, the stage, the downfall, the glory, the destruction, the lust, the angst, the love, the vision, the fame, the loss, the hunger, the death, the poetry, the void, the passion, the end, the falling apart, the everything so real you don’t know where Hayley ends and you start.Lost somewhere in a disintegrating South Texas home, 15-year-old Hayley, her brother Jack, and the band they form – PLUSH – stumble into a dream of a life as they wind up in the LA rock scene, swirling into a strange sacrifice of art, love, and depravity.This poetry tornado’d prose will emotionally rollercoaster you through everything singer Hayley sees and feels.YOU WILL BECOMEA ROCKSTAR and lose it all. Your mind-heart will be broken. What is love and what is art and what does it all mean if anything?Dive into the chaos of the soul, of the ideas of what a star is, of reality and fantasy blurring too thick, of the myths of beauty and the lies we tell ourselves, and feel the stage lights blind your good intentions as the crowds scream and you disappear into someone you are not sure you meant to be –Come... This is Plush.This is not a Rock N Roll Fantasy…This is an erotic, chaotic, beautiful, broken, anddamned melody singing through the pages.",
