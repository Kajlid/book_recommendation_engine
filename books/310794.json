  "description": "Brad, Stephen, Joe and Rae are university students that also spend their nights slaying vampires and demons that walk the earth. Billy, a vampire with a soul, often comes to their rescue, but they never thank him. It doesn't matter that they are fighting on the same side; to them, he is still a filthy vampire.When the students start concerning themselves with a prophecy that demons are trying to destroy so they can fulfil their evil plans, Billy finds himself wrapped up in his own concerns, a woman. He had stayed away from humankind as much as he could, but this woman called Tara, there was something special about her that lured him to her. He had to get to know her.But what will happen if Tara finds out he's a vampire? Would a lovely Christian woman like her truly be able to love a beast like him? And where does this prophesy fit in? Rae has become obsessed with it, even looking through the bible for answers. But will she find it there?",
