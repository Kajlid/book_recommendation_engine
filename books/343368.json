  "description": "It seems that everything gets Earl's tail wagging--a bowl of food, a field of flowers, long walks, and belly rubs. But Mooch, Earl's best friend, knows what all of these things have in love is what makes Earl's tail wag. Patrick McDonnell, creator of the nationally syndicated comic strip, Mutts , pays an incredibly sweet tribute to his dog in a tale of wiggling and waggling, fwipping and fwapping...and every dog's secret to the joy of life.",
