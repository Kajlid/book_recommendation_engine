  "description": "Mother can’t kill me. Not that she hasn’t tried.I’m the heir to a modern-day magical dynasty, daughter of the most powerful mage in existence. From day one, Mother made it apparent that she never wanted me—never wanted an heir at all.That’s why she’s forced me into the shadows, where I remain invisible. Nobody even knows what I truly look like. Locked away, I dream of ordinary things. You know. Friends. A boyfriend. A purpose for my existence… But I’ve got secrets too. Things she can’t find out. For years, I’ve watched her scheme to expand her grip on the mage world. Like a snake, she waits for the right moment to strike. If she succeeds, there will be deadly consequences.As my powers grow, I think Mother and I have both come to the same conclusion. I might be the only thing that stands in her way.",
