Sasha figures out why the hooker ran away but not where to. Besides,how fast can anyone run in stiletto heels? When the next body turns up, Sasha has her moral compass tested as she tries to understand the sex trade and how those enmeshed in it will do anything to surviveâ€“ even if it means murder.",
