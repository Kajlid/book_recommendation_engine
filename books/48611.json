She’s stuck working at the local store to make the rent while her no-good ex-husband lives it up with a floozy.When she inherits a Victorian house, Raelynn jumps at the chance to turn her life around. How can she afford the upkeep on such a huge place? Simple. She’ll run it as a hotel. Problem is, she has no experience and the décor dates back to the Dark Ages. She’ll have to use her secret talent for turning junk into treasure or she’ll never snag an overnight guest. But before the new Honeysuckle Hotel even opens for business, Raelynn discovers the body of a young woman in the garden. As a newcomer in town, Raelynn is blamed for the murder. She’s fired from her job, which could mean she’ll lose the house. The only way to save Honeysuckle Hotel is to find the real killer - with or without the sexy Sheriff Kent Klein. One way or another, Honeysuckle will be buzzing.",
