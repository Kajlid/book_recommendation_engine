  "description": "Zookeeper Skyler Ashcraft prefers scorpions to skirts, but flirting with the feral gains new meaning when she unwittingly drugs a feline shapeshifter. The same rules should have applied: Approach with caution and the near-impossible keep your hands to yourself.Bastian is uniquely dangerous among the Ailuro, a people capable of much more than shapeshifting. The way his anger psychically endangers others earned him exile, as self-imposed as mandated. It’s the reason he should leave Sky alone. If only it was that simple.When the predator becomes prey, the hunt is on. If it’s truly survival of the fittest, they can’t hope to win.The zoo’s primary rule of expect the unexpected hardly prepared Sky for this, and in the end, they find there are worse things to lose than your life, and nothing they won’t risk for love.NOTE: New Adult is a diverse genre. 9th Life contains no sex, but the rest of the series does. Mild language throughout. Age appropriate around 16 & up",
