  "description": "Someone's left a man's body in Donald Strachey's car - the grandson of Albany's most connected political fixer. A letter from the deceased asks Strachey to dismantle his grandfather's party machine. Like a chess master, Strachey moves ten suitcases, an army of colorful pawns (all of whom think they're king) and $2.5 million across the continent and around Albany. One of the funniest in the series.",
