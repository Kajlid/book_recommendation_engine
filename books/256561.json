  "description": "The Navy SEAL's Secret Baby When curvy Sophie Chambers walks in on her boyfriend cheating on her, she drowns her sorrows in tequila. Lots and lots of tequila. After waking up in bed with a man whose name she canâ€™t remember, she does the only thing possible...she runs. Navy SEAL David Marshall is celebrating his retirement when he stumbles across the woman he's been dreaming about for two years. The attraction is still hotter than ever. When she drops a bomb on him, he's determined she won't get away this time. Not when she's the mother of his child. A Second Chance at Love Callie Foster never expected to feel such a strong connection to the sexy former SEAL her friend introduced her to. She only thought about having a little fun now that she'd regained her confidence after surviving an abusive relationship. Except he pushed her away. Kyle Harper barely survived the war, returning home with one less limb. He begins a brief affair with a gorgeous nurse, but breaks it off knowing it won't go anywhere. She'll only leave him like everyone else in his life. When he runs into her a few weeks later, he realizes what a fool he was.",
