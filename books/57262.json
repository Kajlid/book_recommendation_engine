  "description": "Even if the world did end, five men is far too many to handle. Isn’t it? Since the Final War, I’ve been doing just fine. I have a lovely cave, a darling vegetable patch, forest views . . . and if loneliness sometimes squeezes my aching heart, well, my books have always kept me company. That is, until a pack of hunters chase me from my home and right into the arms of several rather large, rather brutish ex-Army Rangers. And those brutes have the nerve to make me the rudest offer I’ve ever heard. Their protection—for my body. The whole thing is absurd. Scandalous. Perverted, even. I mean, just the thought of doing that with five men, well, it’s . . . it’s . . . I take the deal. Okay, so it’s possible I find them indecently tempting. But these men also have secrets, and pasts so fraught with emotion, I’m not sure I can untangle them all. Or whether they’ll let me. No, my brutes have made it excruciatingly clear where they think I belong—beneath them, between them, bent over backwards for them . . . but certainly not beside them. And I don’t think that’s going to work for me.*** The Brutes of Bristlebrook is a dark(ish) post-apocalyptic, steamy reverse harem romance series, meaning Eden will end up with three or more love interests after I’ve appropriately obliterated my readers’ nerves. Expect complex characters, 1st person present tense, multiple POVs, MM in the harem, angst, lots of laughs, and to encounter material that some readers may find sensitive—a full description of which can be found on my author website.",
