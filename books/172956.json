The people who killed her ancestors demand the last viable member of the Day clan, and she has no idea why.  She finds out that her bloodline is the key to bringing back a portion of the population that have died out. The women. Her alien people survive by abducting their brides from a variety of species, but if she can claim her birthright, she can bring the trigger back and fertility will return.  Arbor-Dren–assassin, warrior and snappy dresser—is the consort that she chooses, and he is more than capable of dealing with her learning curve, and all of her other curves as well.",
