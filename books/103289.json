  "title": "Mommies Who Drink: Sex, Drugs, and Other Distant Memories of an Ordinary Mom",
  "description": "With a poignant voice and a fresh style that makes this memoir read like the best women's fiction, Paesel navigates new motherhood in all its forms--the ecstatic, the terrifying, the tedious, the hilarious, the transcendental, and the sticky.For young single women, every night is Ladies' Night. For Brett Paesel and her friends, Friday happy hour is all they get--if they can wrangle a babysitter. Like most mommies, they support each other through pregnancies, sleep deprivation, and the need to talk about it all. Instead of meeting at the playground, they convene at the local watering hole while sipping Black and Tans and flirting with the cute bartender. Paesel's laugh-out-loud perspective will appeal to all women who are braving the new world of mommyhood, where the secret question on their minds at playgroup is \"When is it too early in the day to start drinking?\"",
