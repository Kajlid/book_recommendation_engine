  "description": "I want vengeance so badly that I can almost taste it. It's all I've ever wanted. So, I did what any privileged, adopted boarding school girl would do. I slapped on a secret identity and became an internationally renowned thief, known as The Fox. Nobody knows me. Nobody can catch me.  Or so I thought...  It turns out; I have what they want. Special abilities. And trust me, these abilities are coveted--and dangerous. Now, I don't know who to trust or where to go. Peril lurks on every corner as I try to uncover my past and origin. Teaming up with unlikely allies may be my only chance at survival or my biggest mistake. Only time will tell.  I'm Kit Davenport and this is only the beginning.  ** Warning: This book contains a kick-ass heroine with several sexy men (#whychoose), violence, bad-language and content which some readers may find triggering. **",
