It's a sprawling, ugly beast.It's also the perfect hiding place.Armstrong Manor is off the beaten path, desolate, and far from any suspicion. It's the best playground for my deviant desires.Where Adrienne Hamina is concerned, all of my desires are deviant.I spent fifteen years in lust with a woman who was as intangible and as wild as a warm breeze. Now she's no longer a fantasy. I've tasted her blood, her sweat, and her come. I've witnessed her in the rapture of orgasm and at dizzying heights of pain. I'm more enamored with her than ever.She'll never run from me again.Ever.Every mansion has its secrets... Adrienne is mine.Warning: This Gothic dark erotic tale contains violence, explicit sexuality, and adult situations.
