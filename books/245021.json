  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07874BLBDMax has finally found everything she never dared dream of; family, friends, and love with a man who does terrifying things to her independence. She has more to lose than ever before. With lines being drawn in the sand and sides being chosen, the future from her nightmares seems set in motion. Max is terrified – feeling the weight of her Order’s lives on her shoulders. But she’s also resolute, because she’s calling do-over on their entire society!  Ryker had been a miserable bastard for years before Max stumbled into his life and turned his whole world upside down. Months ago, she arrived and offered him everything he swore he would never want or need. Now there was no question; he was blissfully whipped. But who would have thought that winning Max’s heart wasn’t the real fight?  With the rot at the centre of their society uncovered and the hidden threat identified, Max and Ryker must unite all – wardens, paladins, rangers, and chades – if they are to defeat their common enemy.  But hey, with a Goddess on their side, how hard can it be?",
