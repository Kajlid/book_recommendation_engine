  "description": "There it goes again! You can’t see it, but you can feel it. Everyone feels it. It’s a feeling you get from the time you are an infant to the time you take your last breath. Stop for a moment! Don’t tell yourself you don’t feel it. It’s on the move, it’s in your brain—your thoughts, your actions, the unseen movements. You don’t understand it, do you? You are trying to understand the movement, the players. It’s in the very spirit of who you are. You know it’s big—whatever it is. You know that much. All around the world, you see it in the actions of other people—your actions. You are filling your life with stuff, stuff that really doesn’t matter. Are you running away from something? Perhaps, yourself?",
