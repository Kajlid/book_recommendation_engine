Years of abuse at the hand of her former Master have taken their toll. Now, two years later, Sara believes she's ready to embrace her submissive side once again and enjoy the carnal pleasures of a younger Dom.A man testing his limits...Derek Thomas has lost belief in his abilities as a Master. Accepting an invitation for Dom training could be exactly what he needs to regain his self-confidence. Challenged with an experienced older woman, he soon realizes wielding a flogger isn't always enough to break down the emotional walls and heal a damaged submissive.Two people with something to prove...Sara and Derek sizzle with sexual heat the moment they step into the dungeon. The mind-blowing sex and physical pain may satisfy their bodies, but wounded souls and broken spirits just may require something even more intimate--their hearts.",
