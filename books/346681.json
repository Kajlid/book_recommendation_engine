  "description": "Themes of reckoning, redemption, and the inevitability of love, and loss recur in this 2008 collection of Chris’s work between the years 2002 and 2007. This volume showcases Wright’s idiosyncratic drawing style, and multi layered narrative voice. In its brutality, and it’s compassion, the world of Inkweed displays the author’s determination to create an aesthetic capable of disseminating an entire world view.",
