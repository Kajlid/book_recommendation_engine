Behind its ramparts and battlements heretical acts are said to take place and there is the rumour of a secret - a secret so dangerous that its keepers will kill to keep it hidden. At the end of a bitter winter, a delegation headed by the ambitious Inquisitor Rainiero Sacconi arrives to investigate the monks of St Lazarus. Andre, a Knight of the Templar Order, and his young scribe, Christian de St Armand, have been sent by the King of France to oversee the investigation. When monks begin to die, one by one, under strange circumstances, Andre and Christian try to unravel the mystery while being hampered at every turn by the inquisitor. By the time they stumble upon the secret of St Lazarus hypocrisy and violence will be exposed. And for Andre and Christian it will turn into a fight, not only for their lives, but also for their souls.",
