  "description": "Compiled and edited by Charles Kelly Barrow, J.H. Segars, and R.B. Rosenburg. Controversial but true Thousands of slaves and freemen thought of themselves as Confederates first and blacks second. They served the Confederacy as wagon drivers, cooks, and servants. They also served as soldiers, sailors, and spies These first-hand accounts and photographs undermine some traditional stereotypes; for many African-Americans fought to defend the only home they had every known, the South. This unique volume will provide new insight into a little known and controversial area of America's Civil War",
