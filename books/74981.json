  "title": "Die Rich Here: The Lost Adams Diggings",
  "description": "After searching for sixty years for a long-lost gold mine known as the Adams Diggings, Ralph Reynolds tells all he's learned. This is a rousing tale of Apache cunning and Yankee gullibility. And it's a story of lost lives, emptied souls, and misguided senses in a land of magnificent mountains, mesas, and canyons. His book delivers evidence that three or more prospecting parties were massacred after they located the diggings and the startling implications of these events. And most rewardingly, it tells how, and most likely from where, the gold nuggets were clandestinely removed late in the nineteenth century and why and where the mother lode may soon be found.",
