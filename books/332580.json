When his ex-husband, convicted child murderer, Josh Gatlin, has his life sentence overturned, Ronan’s carefully constructed world begins falling down around him.

The only problem is that the cameras were switched off the night of the murder.Making the crime that much harder to solve are the suspects, the warden and three corrections officers, who all have the opportunity and motive to have silenced Josh permanently. Complicating matters further is the involvement of convicted mob boss Vito Dragonni, who may be playing both sides against the middle.When the wrong man is arrested for the crime, Ronan will do anything to find Josh’s true killer, including using himself as bait to lure the monster out of hiding.
