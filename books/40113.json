  "description": "No mad skillz, no sacred destiny, just a pink tracksuit that will take her places she never wanted to go...Includes The Z Word, The X Factor, iRobotronic, Kumbaya Much, Bite Me, and Apocalypse For RealzIt's been said that a sure sign of the coming apocalypse is an 80s roller skate disco movie coming to DVD (with special features). In my science-fiction novel series entitled Apocalypse Babes, a stylish group of twenty-something friends are torn from the Babylonian arms of 2006 West Hollywood and flung nearly thirty years into the past. It might be because one of them purchased the taboo film in a nostalgic moment, setting off a chain of events more disturbing than a roller skating conga line. They wake up in an apocalyptic—but strangely familiar—landscape, complete with a hidden mountain compound and retro survivalists, hinting at hidden and retro issues they must face if they want to survive.",
