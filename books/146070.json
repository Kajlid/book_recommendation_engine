  "description": "The remarkable story of New Zealand's wildlife sanctuaries and how they are stemming the tide of extinction.It is too soon to say that extinction is over in New Zealand. Where there is no pest management in the forests and parks we are losing native species at an ever alarming rate. But a revived national consciousness of critical species decline has given new hope. Scientists have responded with pioneering techniques to help clear offshore islands of introduced pests, providing havens for dwindling populations. In the wake of their success, the same strategies and techniques of predator control have now been applied on the mainland. Sanctuaries have appeared all over New Zealand, with thousands of volunteers answering the call to help support and run them.Paradise Saved tells the gripping story of how we are turning back the tide of extinction. It is a celebration of pioneering science and a national survey of the sanctuaries, little and big, that are protecting native species and reintroducing them to areas where they had once been extinct.It covers over 130 sanctuaries, with up to date information on where to find them, how to visit and how to do your part.",
