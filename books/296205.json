  "description": "AIMEEAs a nurse, I swore an oath to help, not harm, which I take very seriously. However, I’d make an exception for Holt. My cousin’s cheating ex is a vile human being, an utter waste of oxygen. His brother is... another matter. One look at Devin and I’m fighting the urge to lose my inhibitions and my panties. I know it’s insane. Yet I can’t help but wonder if a little no-strings-attached fun might be just what the doctor ordered... DEVINI know I’m not Aimee’s type, and not just because of her deep loathing for my brother. She’s willing to go toe-to-toe with me, and I am irresistibly drawn to her fiery demeanor. Then, to my utter astonishment, we are matched on a kinky hookup app. Could it be the uptight nurse has a freak flag she’s looking to fly? I’m down for any dirty fun she’s up for... as long as she doesn’t expect a ring in the end.",
