  "description": "It's a mind thing… In 2096, empath Petra Neiman loves the real thing. Be it pencils, phones, or people, whatever technology has improved, she prefers originals in both her professional and personal life. Or she would if she had a personal life. Experiencing someone else's memories with even the briefest touch puts a whole new spin on intimacy. Then a serial killer shares a gruesome murder during Petra's dreams, without contact, and frames her brother for the crime, and her entire world shifts. …he couldn't understand. Why the Central Region Investigative Authority employs an empath is beyond dark-ops leader Gideon Callahan's comprehension. Just as baffling is his assignment for observation duty on the same supposed empath. Following orders, he watches, engages, and reports to his superiors–until he discovers her mental abilities are all too real and he might just be working for the wrong side.",
