  "description": "As the vampires begin to realize bagged blood isn’t giving them what they need, Kendra goes in search of a human companion. She’s been a Domme for the past thousand years, and has never had trouble finding human men who want to submit to her.  Eric is a human adrenaline junkie who spends his time hang gliding and jumping out of perfectly good airplanes when he isn’t creating video games. And he smells of sunshine and blue skies — addictive to a vampire who’s seen neither for nearly three thousand years.  Unfortunately, he’s a Dom. But he’s so full of life, and he gives her adventures when she’d forgotten how to live with joy.  As the two navigate their compatibility in bed, Eric must figure out whether he can handle living in Kendra’s world, and the vampires have to figure out whether they can deal with their third in command submitting to a human they feel is so far beneath them on the evolutionary ladder.  While Kendra and Eric work through their personal challenges, they must also fight a group of powerful supernaturals planning to enslave Eric in an effort to exploit his skills and further their own agenda.  Can Kendra and Eric battle all of this to find happiness?",
