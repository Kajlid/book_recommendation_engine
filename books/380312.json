  "title": "Perseus",
  "description": "This adventurous, dramatic, and at times funny retelling of the Perseus myth retains the spirit and structure of the original while offering a coming-of-age story sure to appeal to modern readers.Readers will follow Perseus on his quest to kill the hideous, snake-haired Medusa in an effort to save his mother from marriage to a less than noble king. A power struggle among the gods both hinders and helps him along the way, and Perseus even manages to find true love when he rescues the breathtakingly beautiful Princess Andromeda from the horrors of a bloodthirsty sea monster.PERSEUS is the second of the four books in the HEROES series, which debuted in the Fall of 2004 with the release of ODYSSEUS.",
