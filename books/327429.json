  "description": "Tsalagi should never have to live on human blood, but sometimes things just happen to sixteen-year-old girls.Following one extended Cherokee family across the centuries, from the tribeâ€™s homelands in Georgia in the 1830s to World War I, the Vietnam War, our own present, and well into the future, each story delivers a slice of a particular time period.Alongside each story, Cherokee artist and language technologist Jeff Edwards delivers illustrations that incorporate Cherokee syllabary.",
