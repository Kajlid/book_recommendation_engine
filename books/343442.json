  "description": "Marian Ware's future seems settled. For two years she's been engaged to a naval lieutenant, now due home within weeks. But before she weds, Marian accepts her cousins' invitation to join them in town for the social season. Lady Formsby has generously arranged for Marian to study with the masters at the Royal Academy. As a dedicated painter, Marian can be relied upon to provide steady, sensible company to her impulsive younger cousin Katie, who has been relishing her debut. All of London is thrilled with Napoleon's abdication and the celebratory visits of foreign princes. Yet Lord Sidley's return from the war has created an equal sensation. The earl's looks, charm, and dashing reputation intrigue both cousins. Katie vows to marry Sidley, and indeed, as the last of his family, he must choose a bride. But there is another reason for the widespread fascination with Lord Sidley's Season. And Marian soon discovers how easily plans, and hearts, can be overturned.",
