  "description": "A steamy new full-length standalone novel by Amazon bestselling authors C.M. Seabrook and Frankie Love!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had it all planned out. I'd find a girl, marry her, get the white picket fence and make a family. But then a baby is dropped off at my doorstep. My baby. Turns out I'm more than an NFL quarterback -- I'm a father. And my daughter's mother is missing. Or she ran away. No one knows, not even her sister Aria Ryan. Aria carries a gentle grace that doesn't match her story. She has every reason to run -- her sister has made her life a living hell. But Aria is different. And I want her to stay. A baby changes everything and this game I'm playing isn't won on the field. It's dirty, it's dangerous, and I'm in it to win it. Game Change Baby features Tatum Madden, from the Princeton Charming books! This time he isn't letting the girl of his dreams get away. He's fighting for more than touch down -- he's fighting for his daughter's life.",
