  "description": "In this, the second volume comprised of Maugham's best works, the four plays in this selection provide significant evidence of the playwright's powers as a dramatist.  \"For Services Rendered\" sheds a harrowing light on provincial middle-class England after the First World War.  \"The Letter,\" a tense drama of sexual passion set in the Malay States, shows Maugham as the colonial storyteller. In contrast, \"Home and Beauty\" treats the marital complications of a returning war hero with Mozartian \"joie de vivre.\"  W. Somerset Maugham established his reputation as a master of the social comedy in the tradition of Oscar Wilde with \"Lady Frederick\" in 1907.",
