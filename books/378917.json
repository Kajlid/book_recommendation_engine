  "description": "A SWEET ROMANCE...The end of Julia Belden-s marriage came as no surprise. Although it began for a pregnancy, she and Carl stayed married for ten years. Their only emotional connection was a baby who did not survive past one day. After two years of grieving for his wife, Nick Sitello kept busy while teaching high school math and raising Sammy. Romance never entered his mind, until his encounter with Julia while on a weekend getaway. It was a timely moment when she tumbled into the water, just as he and his son coasted by in their rowboat. As he helped her from the lake, the attraction was immediate. Nick questioned Julia-s love when Carl reentered her life. He was protective of his feelings, but mostly of his son-s. Julia was torn between her new relationship and an obligation to Carl, as childhood ghosts returned to haunt him, vindicating his distant nature while married. Note: This book contains some adult language.",
