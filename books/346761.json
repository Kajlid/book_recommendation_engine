  "description": "Sometimes, demons can steal your heart.Adam Ross doesn’t believe in demons. After a house-fire killed his family at the tender age of twelve, he’s not even sure he believes in God. He spends his days living a meager, but comfortable existence in a small cabin on the shores of Moss Beach, California, in 1930, working on fishing boats and spending time at a local speakeasy. But that is about to change.Necalli wakes up in Adam’s cabin with no memories of how he got there or who, or what, he really is, and he’s not sure he wants to know. His extraordinary senses betray Adam’s attraction to him, an attraction he returns. When he finds out Adam rescued him on the night of a full moon among dead bootleggers who were slashed and drained of blood on the beach, he blocks the rush of painful memories and becomes even more determined to keep them buried. Adam is insistent on solving the mystery of Nacalli’s broken memories, but it’s a mystery that might very well tear them apart.",
