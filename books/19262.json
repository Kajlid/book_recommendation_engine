  "title": "The Companion of Lady Holmeshire",
  "description": "A baby girl, Emma, is found in a basket on Squire Carrington's doorstep. She is raised and sent to work as a servant girl for The Countess of Holmeshire. The widowed and unconventional Countess chooses Emma Carrington as a companion and sends her off for finishing with the goal of dragging her along into aristocratic, \"polite\", Victorian society. As a former servant girl and now just a companion, she is sure to have a rude reception. She has eyes for the young Earl of Holmeshire, but it is hopeless he is above her station in life and engaged by arrangement to a lovely London lady. Tribulations and banned romances of the servants downstairs play into the story humorously as we follow Emma from a stone fortress to a Victorian village and grand London mansions. Great surprises unfold at a Midsummer Night's Dream Ball that help to solve mysteries which have gradually developed. But there is yet another great twist in the story at the end. Can you predict what it is?",
