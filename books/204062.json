And if they find out what I stole, they’ll auction me off to the highest bidder.But Rafe slipped past my defenses. And not only did I get involved with a shifter, I hooked up with a Royal shifter. With the blood of the heavens in his veins and three wild beasts sharing his body and soul, he’s practically a king. And he keeps calling me his queen.The longer we’re together, the more I want to be claimed as his mate. There’s just the little problem of my past coming back to haunt me.I have a psycho stalking me, my friends are dying, my family is in danger, and all the secrets I’ve worked so hard to keep hidden might end up sealing my fate.
