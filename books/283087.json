  "description": "A Brother's Best Friend Standalone Romance Emilia Ronan has loved Reeve Sawyer since the moment she first saw him. The only problem? He views her as a little sister and nothing more. Tall, dark and handsome, Reeve is the complete opposite to the vibrant and outspoken Em. Not to mention that he’s her older brother's best friend. After years of pining over him and one humiliating rejection, she finally decides it's time to move on, but when Reeve shows up, begging for a shot, can she really say no?  Reeve knows two things to be true in life: you work hard to get what you want and you stay away from Emilia Ronan. It's clear he's crossing a line, but what happens when he can no longer stay away? Hiding this relationship from his best friend is breaking every code he can imagine, yet he can't seem to stop. But when a ghost from his past shows up, shaking his core, Reeve will have to decide what matters most: keeping secrets from Emilia or simply keeping her.",
