  "description": "Trapped with a billionaire in his mysterious mansion... Can she beat him at his own game? Lily Frazer would do anything to save the Frazer Center for the Arts--even take on the infamous billionaire Calder Cunningham. When Lily breaks onto the Cunningham estate, she only wants to find and reason with Calder. (All right, all right, she wants to punch him, too, but that's Plan B.) As it turns out, the arrogant billionaire is willing to give her the money he promised, but there's a catch: she must win it from him. Lily won't give up the money without a fight, but she quickly discovers that there's more to the attractive, brooding Calder than she initially perceived. To make matters even more complicated, their games of cat and mouse are becoming increasingly intense, and she suddenly finds herself confused by her own emotions. Can she deny her attraction long enough to win the money she needs? What happens if her feelings for Calder begin to overcome her hatred for the things he's done?",
