  "description": "Never one to let a few wayward balls spoil a good walk, join us in a short stroll along the front nine at Fairweather Fields. Regardless of stiff shafts or loose grips, whether you drive deep or pull your stroke, prefer to play your wood in the rough or your iron in the bunker, with holes, poles and sweet spots abounding, there’s something for everyone who has ever thought that ‘playing a round’ is a euphemism for exactly that, ‘playing around!’A Hole in One (The Front Nine) is a cheeky collection of nine short, sexy stories loosely based around the game of golf, and only suitable for adults due to its fabulously decadent content. Part of Jackie's Naughtier Side Collection.",
