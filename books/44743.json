  "description": "This limited edition book, Forgiveness and Love Conquers All, from the Inspiration Mini-series by top self-help author Stephen Richards is easy to read and to the point.What is the price of holding back on forgiveness? The problem is there is a price that we and other innocent people will pay when we say “no” to forgiving someone. Forgive and live; refuse and lose. What happens when we hold back on forgiveness is that it actually implodes inwards …. Right into our souls! The anger and hatred in us can grow until it becomes a giant! Anger is the root of bitterness! Not surprisingly, we then take out our anger on other poor, innocent people around us. We may end up unjustly punishing our loved one for something that one of our parents did a lengthy time ago, and they, our loved one, finally gets sick of it and leave us.Are you the first to give a friendly sign, to nod first, smile first, speak first and - if such a thing is necessary - forgive first? Can you put your hand on your heart and say “yes” to all of these things? Multi-million selling author Stephen Richards reveals and coaches you how to let go of the past, thereby ensuring you can move on to better things.We keep tight a hold of the emotional pain that we usually just end up trying to treat with various forms of destructive addictions. Hence so many of us end up as “nut” jobs! These addictions just go around in circles and in turn create more emotional pain! However, the emotional pain is like a pebble in a pond. The ripples reach those far around us. So not forgiving creates a chain of pain that just goes on and on.Take a walk down memory lane, going as far back as your mind will let you; right from your infant years up to where you are right now. Take a walk through the garden of forgiveness and pick a flower of forgiveness for everything you have ever done. When you get to that time that is now, make a full and total forgiveness of your entire life and smile at the bouquet in your hands because it truly is beautiful. You are simply naturally inclined to make mistakes just as everyone else is, whether male or female, black or white, young or old. These mistakes are your school of learning therefore forgiveness is your greatest teacher in this school of learning. Forgiveness and Love Conquers All is a book that can serve you well.",
