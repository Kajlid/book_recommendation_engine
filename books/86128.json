  "description": "Thrilling adventures of Canadian superheroes... and villains! 75 years ago Canadian cartoonist Joe Shuster co-created the world's premier superhero: Superman. Over the decades the genre has gone from camp to counter-culture, from pop art to postmodern, from noir to new wave. Today's superheroes feature in bestselling novels, hit TV shows, Hollywood blockbusters ... and Masked Mosaic: Canadian Super Stories. Mexican luchadores wrestle primordial evil in Vancouver ... The Intrepids battle Nazis in Nova Scotia ... A mysterious masked man rescues an adventuring heiress in a steampunk Gold Rush-era Yukon ... Zombies and ancient Viking magic are unleashed in downtown Toronto ... A godlike oracle wanders Calgary with her cyborg handler ... The fearsome Iron Shadow stalks the streets of Kingstonia ... The Coachwhip and Cat-Girl fight crime in lurid wartime Montreal ... In these 24 tales Canada's most daring writers reimagine the super genre from its outer limits to its pulp origins, exploring the diverse landscape of Canadian identity and geography.
