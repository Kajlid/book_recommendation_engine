  "description": "Is it morally defensible for a wife and mother to leave her family because she's fallen in love with someone else? What if that wife and mother is terminally ill? And what if that someone else is another woman? For Alex Fournier, it is the pull of obligation and duty to her husband and children. For Lily Peterson, it is the challenge of loving a woman who belongs somewhere else. They are apart for seven years, until a terminal illness strikes. When they finally meet again, they begin an unforseen and unimaginable journey through a maze of confusing and tender connections with each other and the innocent people who love them.",
