Their plans seem promising, and the passion between them burns hotter than ever as they keep each other warm despite the icy temperatures. Then a surprise Stockton family get-together threatens to reveal what Jason would rather keep hidden, and an impromptu trip to Blazeâ€™s home in Hawaii makes the cultural, financial, and social differences between them more obvious than ever. Thanks to two chaotic family holidays and a lot of painful secrets, Christmas could end up being more than their budding relationship can endure.",
