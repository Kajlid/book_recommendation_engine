  "title": "Vincent Can't Sleep: Van Gogh Paints the Night Sky",
  "description": "Vincent can't sleep . . .out, out, out he runs! flying through the garden--marigold, geranium, blackberry, raspberry--past the church with its tall steeple, down rolling hills and sandy paths meant for sheep,  He dives at last into the velvety, violet heath, snuggles under a blanket of sapphire sky,  and looks up, up, up . . . to visit with the stars.  Vincent van Gogh often found himself unable to sleep and wandered under starlit skies. Those nighttime experiences provided the inspiration for many of his paintings, including his most famous, The Starry Night. Van Gogh sold only one painting in his lifetime--but he continued to pursue his unique vision, and ultimately became one of the most beloved artists of all time.",
