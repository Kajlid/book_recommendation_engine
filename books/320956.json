  "description": "Separated from her children, Raine guards her sleeping dragon lover at the top of the world. Although Hel continues to threaten Raine in her dreams, training with the strange phantasm, Sentinel, seems to keep the Goddess at bay. Her plans thwarted, Hel finally releases a dangerous prisoner to the mortal realm, sending the enemy of the gods themselves to wreak the havoc she cannot. Terror sweeps the land as a new evil appears in Arianthem: a succubus Witch who empowers herself through sexual activity. The dragon’s daughter, Idonea, stands in the land of the Ha’kan as “The Green” approaches. Powerful allies have fallen, friends have mysteriously disappeared, and now indecision takes hold. Should she face this threat alone? Does “The Green” want her dead? Or does the witch have some worse fate in store for her?",
