  "description": "Excerpt from Moral Uses of Dark Things Of the three volumes by Dr. Bushnell now produced under the general title of \"Literary Varieties\" two have long been out of print and one is new. The latter consists of various articles and addresses which have been printed in some fugitive form, and which Dr. Bushnell himself designated under the heading of Reliquiae as the material for a book to be published after his death. Collecting them now as a nearly complete edition of his miscellaneous writings, we would emphasize the distinction between these and his theological works, these \"the spontaneous overplus and literary byplay of a laborious profession,\" the latter the embodiment of that profession itself. They so richly represent and, as it were, personify the varied interests of his life as to form in themselves, if rightly interpreted, a biography necessary to the completeness of any which has been or could be written. As an aid to such interpretation, a few facts and thoughts may here be fitly presented.",
