  "description": "Jess Damon, Houston’s hottest wedding planner (and reformed succubus), is working for the bride from hell—literally. Her mother is the queen of evil, the princess of darkness, Satan herself, and she’s getting married. What could possibly go wrong?Well, for starters, Mommie Dearest thinks Jess is only in the wedding business to hook up with hot groomsmen, not to find true love. If she knew her man-eating daughter had gone soft, there would be hell to pay. Making matters worse, hunky demon hunter Cutter Owens just rolled into town, determined to vanquish the devil once and for all—and he wants Jess to help him do it.Now, on top of wrangling florists and sweet-talking caterers, Jess must outfox the world’s sexiest demon hunter and save her mom from oblivion. But can she do it without revealing her true identity? Or—devil forbid—falling in love?",
