But nothing could prepare him for the moment he returns home and sees Zhina—the girl he once sheltered under his strict protection—now a stunning, irresistible woman. She’s no longer the innocent child he once knew, but a fiery temptation that threatens to unravel every vow he’s ever made.Zhina has spent years hiding from the world, devoting herself to medicine and helping those in need, but the return of Taha ignites a hunger inside her she can no longer ignore.

She knows she shouldn’t want him, but every touch, every heated moment between them, pulls her into a whirlwind of desire she’s powerless to resist.Bound by tradition, duty, and loyalty to their faith, they both face the most dangerous temptation of their life. As desire consumes them both, they’re torn between their love and the weight of family, society, and their own self-control.With danger lurking, secrets unfolding, and their love tested by family and society, Taha and Zhina must navigate the fine line between passion and duty. Will they surrender to their desires, or will their love be a forbidden dream?",
