My name is Eden and I only want one thing in life—and it isn’t to have sex with some guy I’ve never met in front of three creepy businessmen. But when dirty-copper Coop, who holds the deed to my family’s farm, says jump—I ask how high. And ex-street kid L is nothing like I expect him to be. He’s so much worse. Now I want three things. My dad’s farm back.To know why a guy as hot as L has never slept with a girl before.Coop to die a painful death. And there’s a fourth. Here’s a hint…It starts with the letter L.Just like this story does. Is happy-ever-after possible when your meet-cute happens in front of three voyeurs in business suits?** This is a full length standalone. HEA. Strong language, sex scenes, and a character with abuse in his past. For mature audiences.The intro novella, A Boy Called L, is the story of L's last night on the streets when a girl's wild curves and sad eyes shocked his dead heart to life.
