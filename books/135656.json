  "description": "Murder, Murder, Everywhere! Sheriff's Deputy Clinton Greengrass meets Texas Ranger Ed Givens over a dead body. It's a decidedly inauspicious beginning. When one body turns into three, the investigation-and the attraction between them-heats up, but Clint misses his chance when they close the case before he makes a move. Three years and a promotion later, Sheriff Greengrass is out of the closet and working on the case of another string of murders, murders that bring Ed and all the sexual tension back to town. Despite the circumstances, Clint is happy to get a second chance, but a lawman's job is never done. Can Macone County handle the two of them as partners on and off the job?",
