  "description": "In a celebration of friendship and love, acclaimed bestselling author Fern Michaels brings her trademark wit and warmth to a thrilling story of a group of women who bond Survivor-style . . . and find romance along the way. When Samantha Rainford—newly wed to Douglas Rainford III—returns from her honeymoon to find divorce papers, she’s shocked and heartbroken. Discovering that she’s actually the fourth Mrs. Rainford, she puts into practice the old truism: Don’t get mad, get even. Sam enlists the three other Mrs. Rainfords to do whatever it takes to bring down their ex-husband. At a top-secret special-ops training program, these determined women meet ex-CIA operative Kollar Havapopulas. Handsome as a Greek god, “Pappy” is the best at transforming civilians into highly skilled fighting teams. He’s less adept at telling a woman how he feels, and before long he’s developed very warm feelings for Samantha Rainford—an attraction seemingly fated to be a disaster. Two personalities as strong as Sam and Pappy are sure to strike sparks, but will the fire burning between them consume everything in its way?",
