A second violent death finds Annalisse and Bill at odds with the official investigations.The local police want to close both cases as quickly as possible—without unearthing the town’s dirty secrets.As she and Bill pursue their own leads at serious cost, the dual mysteries force Annalisse to question everything she thought she knew about family ties, politics, and the art of small-town betrayal.",
