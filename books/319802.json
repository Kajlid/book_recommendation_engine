I find myself without a job, without a home, and without the pro football quarterback I’ve fallen for. The only thing left to do is head back to my parents’ place in Kansas as I give up every dream I’ve dared to have since I left it.I’m just not sure I’m ready for the turnover.\nTURNOVER is the fourth book in the VEGAS ACES: THE QUARTERBACK series. This series must be read in order.",
