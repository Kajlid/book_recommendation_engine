  "description": "Sophia believes her godfather Dominic wants her as much as she wants him but is afraid to express his feelings. Scarred and burned in a car accident, Dominic remains private and reclusive and only lets his guard down with Sophia. She wants him to let it down completely and act on the desire she knows he feels. Sophia plans to tell him exactly how she feels and what she wants, when his twin brother shows up. She didnâ€™t even know he had a twin, and the arrival of the handsome and unscarred man causes Dominic to become hostile and retreat away from her, spoiling her plans of revealing her heart to him. As the reasons for their animosity unfold, Sophia vows that she will prove to Dominic once and for all that his looks mean nothing because his heart is what she truly desires.",
