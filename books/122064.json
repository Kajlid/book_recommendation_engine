  "description": "All seventeen-year-old Charlotte wants to do is get through the last of high school unscathed. This wouldn’t be so difficult if it weren’t for the ghosts that keep seeking her help with their unfinished business, but since she’s the only one who can communicate with them, she tries to help in whatever way she can. She does this with the help of Cole, a ghost who is sweet and charming yet mysterious and the subject of her tight-lipped affections. Eternally eighteen, Cole seems content being by Charlotte’s side year after year, protecting her from any unruly dead and helping her live as normally as possible.But when popular class peer and bully Vanessa is found dead at school, Charlotte must put her grievances aside to help her find out what really happened the night she died. To make matters worse, Charlotte also discovers that someone else can see ghosts too, someone who is keen to use whatever means necessary to make sure the dead move on to where they belong—and stay there.Charlotte must now learn more about her ability to figure out what—or who—killed Vanessa in the hopes that she’ll move on. But the more Charlotte uncovers, the more she realizes that even the dead keep secrets, including Cole with secrets of his own she may rather not want to know . . .",
