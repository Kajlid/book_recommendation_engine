  "description": "They’re going to make it through this fake engagement,Or kill each other trying…\nAldenI’ve saved for years. I pinched every penny, skipped nights at the bar, and cashed out my vacations, all so I could buy the town bakery. For twenty years, I’ve managed this place. Now the owner wants to sell to someone else, all because I don’t have a family to pass the bakery on to. In a moment of panic, I tell her I’m engaged to Cece Barnes, the literal last woman in Sycamore Mountain that would actually date me. Getting Cece to play along is going to cost me an arm and a leg, plus most of my sanity. But the longer I spend with the feisty beekeeper, the more I wish this wasn’t fake. CeceI was done with men. Really, I was. Which is why I laughed so hard I hurt myself when Alden, the town flirt, showed up on my property, asking me to pretend to be his fiancé. And I kept laughing right until he promised to fund repairs on my crumbling farmhouse. I’m fiercely independent, but I’m also pragmatic and broke as hell. But when our dates start to feel real, and the kisses lose their platonic safety, I know I’m in too deep. My heart shouldn’t race when he looks at me. My ribs shouldn’t squeeze the breath out of my lungs when he touches me. I shouldn’t be falling in love with my fake fiancé… but I don’t think I can stop.The MAN OF THE MONTH CLUB is a steamy small-town collection featuring a new hottie (or two!) every month. In 2022, escape to Sycamore Mountain, North Carolina and celebrate ALL the holidays with your favorite group of romance authors and their delicious mountain men. Can’t wait to see you there!",
