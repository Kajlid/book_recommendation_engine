  "description": "I, Kerah Moss, was on the fast-track to becoming the first veterinarian in my family. Academics - check. Accolades - double-check. But then, a drop of forbidden passion entered my life, and like with all things forbidden, trouble followed and trapped me in the relationship that led to the near-fatal car accident that ended my veterinary career.Five years later, my life is mostly back on track. I’ve got a career I love and veterinary school is once again a possibility. Everything is perfect...except for the hot-tempered former Army pilot who comes barging into the animal rescue I run at least once a week.Elias the Wicked.It’s how he’s known to all the staff. A name I created for him.He’s rude, coarse, and bullish...but whatever he throws at me, I give it back just as good. He’s also sinfully gorgeous.And I want him. He's more trouble than what I've already put myself through, but I want him.However, everything is fine as long as I don’t find out he wants me too. As long as this coarse, bullish man doesn’t reignite the lust and desire, which I assumed I'd suppressed long ago, in the most erotic ways.",
