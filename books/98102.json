  "title": "The Case of Jack the Nipper",
  "description": "It all began on a Wednesday, and everyone knows life changing experiences hardly ever happen on a Wednesday.Mister Marmee was a Victorian gentlecat first and foremost, not a detective, or so he thought; that is until he took up residency at Hanover Place with London's premier doctor of veterinary medicine, Stephen Hanover, and met his vivacious dachshund detective, Sir Happy Heart. With a nose for finding and following clues, Sir Happy soon began teaching his feline friend the tricks of the investigative trade. It was not long before Mister Marmee was earning his tabby stripes as an amateur detective along side his canine friend.The Case of Jack the Nipper is the chronicle of Mister Marmee and Sir Happy's first case together and incidentally the moment when they first met. Within short order of making himself at home in Hanover Place, Mister Marmee finds himself whisker-deep in one of the most perplexing and brutal crime sprees London has ever seen. Drawn into the fray by the charming but bewildered Hyrum Farley of Scotland Yard, Mister Marmee and Sir Happy endeavor to track down a killer canine before it strikes again. It is a chase that takes them from the slums of Cheapside and the dogfighting rings of the warehouse district to the sleepy manors of the countryside onto the very doorstep of Hanover Place itself. It is a race against the clock.....and time is running out.",
