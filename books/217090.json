  "description": "The UCE: In the 21st and 22nd Centuries, the United States changed and grew. Now the United Colonies of Earth dominate the globe. But a mysterious voice is broadcasting treason, inciting revolution and referring to the \"ideals of 1776\"—and to an enigmatic figure named Banzai Maguire.To find Banzai, the UCE assigns Cai Randolph. She’s the \"anchor,\" the techie half of a Quandem: a pair of elite operatives used by Army Special Forces for just such covert action. Neural implants allow her to sit back in a control chair and feed information to her partner, the dark-souled Jacob Tucker. He’s as rigid as he is deadly…or handsome. But this time, it can’t be business as usual. This time, Cai needs Jake to trust her completely. Whether he likes it or not, she can’t sit back while he fights the bad guys. Wherever this mission takes her, Cai is gonna be the one kicking a little tail.",
