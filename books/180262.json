  "description": "Nothing is simple anymore in the new undead world. Crossing a road, making tea, meeting new people, all can turn deadly in a twitch of an eye. For the Renegades who are unarmed and hounded over half the state by ruthless bounty hunters, there’s only one thing that they can say is dying. Surrounded by enemies and without help from the imprisoned Captain Grey, they flee from one trap into another with little but the wits of Jillybean and Neil’s steadfast leadership to keep them alive. But is it enough? Not by a long shot. They have to dig deep and take wild chances to stay out of the clutches of the River King…and they find out the hard way that there are consequences to rolling the dice against the devil.",
