  "description": "Copper  I needed a break, so I took off to my friend’s cabin for a few days for some peace and quiet. Instead, I found an injured woman in the woods claiming to be a lost hiker. I immediately knew there was more to her story, and I was right, but the bombshell she dropped was the last thing I expected.  Layla  I wasn’t sure how much more I could take. After losing my mother, my life drastically changed, and I found myself escaping from one bad situation only to land right in the middle of another. I was alone and lost, and it seemed like every person I met tried to take advantage of me. When a sexy, beast of a man appeared out of nowhere and came to my rescue with guns blazing, I didn’t know whether to trust him or run screaming. Ultimately, I ran, but he followed and refused to let me go.  This is the first book in the Devil Springs Blackwings MC Series. It is heavily tied to the Blackwings MC Series. You can start with Copper, but there are references to characters and events from the previous series that may take away from your reading experience. I recommend starting with Dash (Blackwings MC Book One).  Adult Content Warning: This book is intended for readers 18 years and older. It contains adult language, explicit sex, and violence.",
