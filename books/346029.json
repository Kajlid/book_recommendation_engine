  "description": "WE ALL DREAM OF THE FORBIDDEN BUT SOME OF US MAKE THOSE DREAMS COME TRUE.In her best-selling \"Vampire\" books, Anne Rice daringly exposes the erotic link between fear and desire while Lestat and-Rice's other charismatic \"blood drinkers\" draw us, irresistibly, to the dark side of ourselves.With the same mystery, menace, and intensity, Exit to Eden continues to explore the forbidden by taking us to The Club, a vacation paradise where no aspect of sexual pleasure is taboo. And just as The Story of O shocked the sixties by speaking aloud what had only been whispered, Exit to Eden gives voice to the sexual secrets of this decade ... looking boldly at those who enslave themselves for love and those who love only to be enslaved.",
