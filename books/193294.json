  "description": "When art historian Nora Barnes returns to France for a Van Gogh conference in the charming medieval village of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, she’s expecting a vigorous debate about whether the famed artist’s suicide was actually a homicide. But on the night before the conference, an elderly French woman who’d promised to reveal important evidence is found head down in the village fountain, and her Chanel briefcase is nowhere to be seen.             During a week of academic squabbling, dining, romance, and suspense, the quirky conference members, one by one, fall under police suspicion and the amused gaze of Nora’s husband, Toby. But someone wants to halt Nora and Toby’s amateur sleuthing, and what happens next is no joke.",
