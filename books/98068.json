  "description": "Selected by Kirkus Reviews as one of the \"Top 100 Indie Books of 2013\" and awarded the Kirkus Star for Books of Exceptional Merit.Award-winning author Bruce Hartman is back with THE RULES OF DREAMING – A tale of madness, music — and murder. A beautiful graduate student suspects that her psychiatrist is ruled by the fantasies of a poet who’s been dead for two hundred years...A mental patient with no musical training sits down at the piano and plays a fiendishly difficult piece of classical music...A young doctor’s life spins out of control as he falls under the spell of three irresistible women... Art and illusion. Deception and delusion. Sex, evil and death. “A mind-bending marriage of ambitious literary theory and classic murder mystery…. In this intricately plotted novel, Hartman spins the familiar trappings of gothic mystery together with a fresh postmodern sensibility, producing a story that’s as rich and satisfying as it is difficult to categorize…. As Hartman skillfully blurs the lines between fiction and reality, the book becomes a profound meditation on art, identity and their messy spheres of influence.... An exciting, original take on the literary mystery genre.” — Kirkus Reviews.“A great read and highly recommended.\" - Jack Magnus, Readers' Favorite Book Reviews.",
