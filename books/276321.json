  "description": "Aside from dealing with the occasional wayward donkey or lawn-mowing dispute, being a policeman in Higbee, Maine had never been very exciting. Still, Simon was content with his simple life, close to his family and the good people he wanted to protect. His sister could tease him about his humdrum ways, but Simon felt his life was pretty much where it should be.  That is, until the skies chose his small town as the scene for the most extraordinary show of northern lights in the country for decades. It brought hundreds of tourists and parking infractions to Higbee. But most of all, it brought Elijah.  Blazing beams of light, the deafening rumble of a gigantic machine… Elijah was sure—twenty years ago, he had witnessed the abduction of his parents by a UFO, and it had happened here, in this town lost in the middle of the pines. Others may call him crazy, that great bully of a policeman with the impossibly sexy eyes may intimidate him all he wanted, but Elijah wouldn’t let anything get in his way of solving the mystery of a lifetime.  Subzero temperatures and sizzling, reluctant attraction brings these two together as Simon, the ever clear-headed and responsible officer, gets sucked into outlandish fantasies. Full of aliens and intergalactic adventures, Elijah’s world is more thrilling than anything he has ever known, but as he weasels his way into his heart, Simon fears he may lose him in his starry-eyed dreams of outer space forever.",
