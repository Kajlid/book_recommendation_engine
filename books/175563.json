  "description": "If you liked Bared to You or Fifty Shades of Gray, you will enjoy this story!   Film school student Madison is a contestant on the set of a reality matchmaking show in Hollywood. Everything about it is fake - the make-up, the lighting, the interactions - everything except the money. As long as she plays it up for the cameras, she could get back to studying for her upcoming exam.  There's just one problem: the eligible bachelor turns out to be the famous and devastatingly handsome celebrity, Johnny Logan, star of the highly successful Mike Shadow movies and Madison's girlhood fantasies.  How would she approach a man she dreamed about for years? Is this reality show fake or is it the real deal?  No matter what, one thing is for sure: Once Johnny is in Madison's life, things will never be the same.   **This multi-POV 19.5k+ word new adult erotic romance contains strong language and explicit scenes. Adult readers only!***  keywords: m/f, multi-POV",
