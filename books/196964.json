  "description": "Churches made of meat, spaceships powered by song, simulated authors and a soul-warping artwork that may or may not existâ€”in these ten stories you will be confronted with a garish neon blueprint of post-humanity, a form-fixated vision of the Altermodern less New Wave than No Wave. Torrents of alien language and remixed fragments of science fiction hauntology merge in the valley of the shadow of unguessable metaphysics, while atomized characters scramble for self and meaning only to find themselves overwritten or revised out of reality.",
