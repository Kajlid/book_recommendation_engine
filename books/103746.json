  "title": "About Hana",
  "description": "Hana Johal is an English immigrant, who settled in New Zealand with her husband and two children. Cruelly widowed in her thirties, Hana has raised her teenagers alone. Now older and wiser, she has become bored with her predictable life working in an all boys' school in the Waikato region of the North Island. She begins the new school year with a desire for excitement, wishing quickly that she hadn't been so rash. While the attempted mugging seemed random at first, it becomes clear that Hana is being particularly targeted but she has no idea why or by whom. Falling in love with a new colleague had not been part of her plan either and brings complications of its own, especially when she discovers that they met once before back in London, on one of the worst days of Hana's life.",
