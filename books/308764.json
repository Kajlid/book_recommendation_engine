  "description": "In a world where men and women are encouraged to reject traditional sex roles, Elisabeth Elliot candidly reminds men why the sexes are not interchangeable. Written as personal advice to her nephew, The Mark of a Man reveals the glory and purpose of true masculinity. With Christ as the example of the ultimate man, this classic take on understanding a man's role in life and relationships, romantic or otherwise, helps men define their own masculinity in a positive way. This timely repackage encourages men to stand strong in their unique role established by God for all time.",
