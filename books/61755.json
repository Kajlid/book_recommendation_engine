  "title": "Bren Woodard: Hatred, With A Passion",
  "description": "From birth, life had never been good for Bren Woodard. Fate dealt her a shitty opening hand with an abusive, alcoholic father, and a mother who chose to turn a drunken eye, right down to a society that didn’t even care if she existed.  By the time she had become a young woman, Bren had taken as her own, one of the many names from the multitude of taunted nick-names from those who teased her. The young woman, now known as Bren (Woody) Woodard, escaped from her past hell and took a path into the world of the unknown. She made her remaining parent pay; knowing that the very same society that wouldn’t look past the ‘wrong side of the tracks’ where her parent’s death was concerned, made it easy.  Now she was prepared for any who came her way looking for trouble. She would make them pay by way of the weapons she loved, ones she’d created with her own hands. To her, death would be a release and the end of her worries. So the death of another would merely be secondary!",
