Someone from her past shows up out of nowhere, and now the Akuma demons are on Evie's trail.  As if that weren't enough for a pregnant supernatural hybrid to handle, a mysterious fog seeps through a crack in the gate to the underworld and wreaks havoc on the town.  Evie has had enough. She's going to close that gate once and for all. She won't rest until every single demon is back where they belong. Luckily, she has her trusted crew to help her every step of the way.",
