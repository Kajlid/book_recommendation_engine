  "description": "A Retelling of Snow WhiteShe never needed a mirror to tell her who she was. She thought she knew…Until an assassin made her question everything.Brenna Seagrave would rather spy on her kingdom’s enemies than attend a ball. She prefers danger and disguise to the smiling insincerities of the Andari court, but no one is quite sure what to do with a countess who engages in espionage.To escape her frustrating new life, Brenna accepts an invitation to visit the mother she’s never had a chance to know, but nothing turns out quite as she expects. Her mother is obsessively critical, the neighbor is a ridiculous flirt, and the handsome butler is undoubtedly up to something. Also, someone seems to be plotting her demise.In order to find out who wants to kill her, Brenna must work together with a bumbling nobleman and an old acquaintance who isn’t exactly a team player. Yet no one is who they pretend to be—not even Brenna—and it’s only a matter of time before her past catches up with her and threatens to destroy everything she’s come to love.A romantic fantasy inspired by Snow White, Daughter of Lies is the fifth book of the Andari Chronicles, a series of interconnected but stand-alone fairy tale retellings that feature strong heroines, romance, mystery, and deeply satisfying happily ever afters.",
