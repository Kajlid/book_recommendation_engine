  "description": "Dragon love burns bright, can she survive the flames?Graeme made his way to Serenity for one very specific, hopefully-deadly reason, but a few friendly wolf shifters on the Serenity Police Department almost made him reconsider his centuries-old death wish. His body, however, remembers it well, acting upon it when he is unable.Heather Herrin has just received news that threatens to change everything for her, but when she sees a half-naked beast of a man in a hospital bed, he takes center stage in her thoughts, giving her some relief. Until he runs hot then cold so often she almost gives up on him, having no way of knowing he's someone that will make her entire life make sense.Are Graeme's reasons for turning down what he thought he'd never be blessed to have enough to keep them apart? Or will Heather manage to break through his walls in time to save them both?",
