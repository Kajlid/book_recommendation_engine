  "description": "The Aligned Stars are broken. The first Vixen war is at an end, and the Uprising the imminent victors.The old ways are rapidly dying out, already labelled 'Resistance' throughout the new \"Kingdom Mother Vixen.\" The Divinus have one last chance that lies in the last drop of sacred blood. Have you ever seen your face change in a puddle? Have you ever seen blue eyes become grey, or grey blue? I have. And when I did I took my treasure and fled. That's when it all began. A common cause unites two conflicting outcasts. An epic modern fantasy which captures the essence of modern life, and blends it with classic medieval adventure. Full of satire and suspense, Mother Vixen is an emotional journey through a life of escape.",
