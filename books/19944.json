  "description": "Her father's dead, her mother's crazy, and her grandmother's never been wrong. Jeri, at 17, resembles her grandmother most of all: she's hard-headed, passionate, and idealistic. At the beginning of the volatile 1960s, she plunges in head first. From the first, she gets herself in trouble and eventually drags someone she loves right along with her into danger--all in pursuit of what she hopes will turn out to be justice. But she has a few surprises coming.",
