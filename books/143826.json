  "description": "\"The Life of Charles de Langlade, fully detailed, would rank among the veritable romances of history. Had the French King succeeded in retaining his American possessions, the name and fame of that forest settler of Green Bay would have been better known in history, and would probably have taken a high rank in Canadian annals. No officer on either side of that prolonged contest ['the French & Indian War'] marched further, endured more, or participated in more hard-fought battles than he, and none more enjoyed and deserved the respect of those with whom he served.\" - The National Magazine, Vol. XII (1890).",
