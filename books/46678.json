His desperate, lonely existence is maintained by a meager disability check and gallons of alcohol. As he's finally learning to control his burden, and making progress with the girl next door, Ash is thrust back into a life he thought he'd left behind. When unidentified intelligence agents abduct him from his apartment, he is plunged into a world of espionage and assassinations.A unique terrorist is operating on U.S. soil, and the government needs Ash, and the malady that has plagued him for half a decade, to find him.Echoes is an edge-of-your-seat, page-turning thriller with the pacing of The Terminator and the quirky characters of Carl Hiaasen.",
