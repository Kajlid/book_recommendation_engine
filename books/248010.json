  "description": "> Christianity Today 2019 Book of the Year Award of Merit, Apologetics/Evangelism What arguments best support the existence of God? For centuries the moral argument―that objective morality points to the existence of God―has been a powerful apologetic tool. In this volume, David and Marybeth Baggett offer a dramatic, robust, and even playful version of the moral argument. Tracing both its historical importance and its contemporary relevance, they argue that it not only still points to God's existence but that it also contributes to our ongoing spiritual transformation.",
