  "description": "Freud's discovery of the preeminent role of sex in creating neuroses resulted in theories that changed the thinking of the world. He was a champion of greater sexual understanding in a society that only whispered the words he used out loud. This pioneering study of the nature of sexuality and love remains a monumental achievement. The importance of sexuality and infantilism in shaping individual destiny sets the general theme for these groundbreaking studies. Elaborating his now-famous frustration theory, Freud dramatically illustrates how a person's sexuality can be stifled to the point of neurosis by a sex-scared society. With utter frankness, he explains various aspects of homosexuality, incest, frigidity, impotence, masochism, sadism, and fetishism. Here is Freud at his most brilliant, raising the curtain on a new era of sexual and social awareness -- Publisher description.",
