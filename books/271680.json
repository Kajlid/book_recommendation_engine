  "description": "Ronnie's a Reaper.Officially she's a retrieval analyst for hell. But the demons and angels who would sell their souls for her job know what she really does for a living. She fetches lost cherubs, and gets to enjoy all the perks of life on earth in the process.She might appreciate the position a little more if: a) she could remember anything about her life before she started working at Ubiquity, b) the damned voice in her head would just shut up already, and c) her boss weren’t a complete control freak.On top of that, her favorite incubus-with-benefits is acting super possessive. Her mentor, Lucifer, is being more cryptic than normal. And the two most powerful angels in history are there whenever she turns around—Gabriel seducing her, and Michael pushing her away. Ronnie’s struggling to keep her sanity and job, while stopping the voice in her head from stealing her life. The last thing she needs is the complication of falling for an angel... or an entire harem of heavenly and demonic hosts.Publisher's Note: Soul Reaper is a #WhyChoose novel where relationships are built across the series. It was previously released as Uriel's Descent. It has been edited and revised for this re-release.",
