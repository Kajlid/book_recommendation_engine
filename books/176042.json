  "description": "This book is made up of events that occurred in my own life mixed with fiction from the made-up life of James. James is essentially a better version of myself. His home, his school & his life all resemble my own at his age. The people James analyzes and is surrounded by are not so unlike those Iâ€™ve known as well. I have experienced much of the loss James has however his happier moments are more often than not also mine. I want to share my story without it being purely non-fiction. I simply felt this approach would make for a far better book. At points I cried while writing this, at others I laughed.Stones To Abbigale is not just a book I wrote; it is a piece of who I am.",
