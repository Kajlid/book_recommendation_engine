  "description": "When the heart sets its course, even home is no escape...  Alpha male shifter, Lieutenant Commander Bradi Janelle isn't looking for a mate. Hell, he goes out of his way to avoid the prospect altogether-until the sexy little number in the infirmary makes a mockery of his ladies' man facade. Now, trapped with her in an escape pod, she's way too close for comfort. Too close to deny himself the pleasure of her body.",
