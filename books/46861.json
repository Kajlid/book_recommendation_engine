  "description": "Jack Abbott is a Washington spin doctor who longs to make the big time: the White House. Once there, he'll do almost anything to hold onto his job. Will the country re-elect his boss, President Dexter, a beloved widower with a secret, because of Jack’s skillful deception? Will Jack’s conscience finally surface and spur him to make amends? Or is it too late?Spin Doctor has a Washington theme, a realistic story and a soul. And unlike many Washington novels, Spin Doctor is not a memoir or polemic, not a message book or a thriller. Politically neutral, it goes to deeper truths: the conflict we all have between ambition and conscience. Spin Doctor is Washington from the inside, with humor and authenticity.",
