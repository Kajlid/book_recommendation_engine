  "title": "To Sail a Darkling Sea",
  "description": "A World Cloaked in DarknessWith human civilization annihilated by a biological zombie plague, a rag‑tag fleet of yachts and freighters known as Wolf Squadron scours the Atlantic, searching for survivors. Within every abandoned liner and carrier lurks a potential horde, safety can never be taken for granted, and death and turning into one of the enemy is only a moment away.The Candle FlickersYet every ship and town holds the flickering hope of survivors. One and two from lifeboats, a dozen from a fishing village, a few hundred wrenched by fury and fire from a ship that once housed thousands...Light a FlameNow Wolf Squadron must take on another massive challenge: clear the assault carrier USS Iwo Jima of infected before the trapped Marines and sailors succumb to starvation. If Wolf Squadron can accomplish that task, an even tougher trial awaits: an apocalyptic battle to win a new dawn for humanity. The war for civilization begins as the boats of the Wolf Squadron become a beacon of hope on a Darkling Sea.At the publisher's request, this title is sold without DRM (Digital Rights Management).About John Ringo:“[Ringo’s work is] peopled with three dimensional characters and spiced with personal drama as well as tactical finesse.\"—Library Journal“. . .
