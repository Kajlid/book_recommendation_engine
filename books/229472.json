Nothing seems to go to plan and Clara and Andrew are on a mission to make sure everything works out. They seem to have finally overcome their past. They've finally accepted their history can't be erased. It can't just be deleted. It's what makes them them. Without all the history between them they wouldn't really know each other and they definitely wouldn't love each other the way they do now. It all started with tears but will it end the way it started or will it end with a happy ever after?",
