  "description": "Michelle has always dreamed of being an artist, but after her best work is destroyed in an accident and she finds herself too blocked to paint anything else, her aspirations of art school come crashing to the ground. Left after high school graduation with no other options, she moves to New York City with her best friend Katie, hoping that the change will be just what she needs to get out of her rut and start painting again. New York is full of opportunities she never could have imagined, especially when she meets the easy going and swoon-worthy Theo. Michelle quickly discovers a surprising twist to Theo and his friends- while most people are asleep in bed at night, they run around the city creating illegal art, painting on buildings and installing creative pieces on sidewalks. Michelle can’t help but get drawn into their world, but the physical danger of street art soon proves mild compared to the real danger it poses- the threat to Michelle’s identity, to her relationship with her best friend, and to possibly her whole life as she knows it.",
