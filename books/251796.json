  "description": "IT SHOULDN'T HAPPEN TO A DOG....Canine-loving detective Holly Winter is a columnist for Dog's Life magazine. She thinks a week at Waggin' Tail, a camp for canines in the scenic Maine woods, will be a vacation in pet heaven. So does Rowdy, her champion malamute--especially when there are pooches galore: mixed breeds, Pekes, cairn terriers, Labradors, shelties, and a gorgeous mastiff pup. But upon Holly's arrival at the camp, things swiftly go to the dogs. Instead of the advertised gourmet food, there's olive loaf and soggy pudding. The human campers are given to nasty back-stabbing. And Holly receives a black-edged card consoling her for the loss of her dog. Is this someone's sick idea of a joke?Suddenly Waggin' Tail seems like the summer camp from hell. Then a dog owner turns up dead in a freak accident. The probable cause? The victim's own dog! Holly suspects a four-footed frame-up and with Rowdy sets out to find the real culprit. She's on the scent and closing fast--which makes her the perfect target for a killer whose bite is definitely worse than his bark.",
