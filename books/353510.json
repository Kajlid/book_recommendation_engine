  "title": "Believe: Journey from Jacksonville",
  "description": "Imagine yourself transfixed into a totally strange, unfamiliar and non-controlling environment-an environment whose only sound is the constant din of a machine attached to your body. An environment so foreign with malodorous, strange smells and barren, plain blanched walls. Your once Adonis-like physique now captive to an audience not of adoring, envious fans but a steady parade of white-clad staff with whom your only communication is with a hand signal or nod. Such is the journey of Ken Norton's transformation from the cocky, self-assured and formidable world champion from Jacksonville, Illinois to a patient in great need of attention. The story of Norton's journey-his physical and mental readjustment and his will to persevere and overcome and win again will inspire anyone who has had to cope with sudden and catastrophic challenges. It is a story not only of hope and overcoming life's ultimate challenges but also a spiritual journey of a man who found himself and in turn touched the lives of others.",
