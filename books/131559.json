The vote is unanimous, five to zero in favor.Meanwhile, not far away, Virgil Flowers is helping a friend by looking into a dognapping. It seems to be turning into something much bigger and uglier—a team of dognappers supplying medical labs—when he gets a call from Lucas Davenport. A murdered body has been found—and the victim is a local reporter!Librarian's note: as of 2021, there are 13 volumes in the author's Virgil Flowers series. The last was published in April 2021.
