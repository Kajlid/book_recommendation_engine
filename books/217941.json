  "description": "The Sydney Storm MC are back and war is coming.  Nitro’s Torment takes the Storm MC to a new level. Dark, gritty and fast-paced, this book is an adrenaline ride right to the very last page.\n  Tatum Lee is a pain in my ass. She’s stubborn, full of attitude, and she doesn’t like to do what she’s told. And yet, at a time when I should be focusing on the war my club is at, she consumes my mind because she’s also fearless and fierce, and I’ve never met a woman like her.  The thing about war, though, is the minute you let your focus drop, your enemy rises up and attacks. And sometimes they bring you to your knees in ways you never imagined.  The other thing about war? You learn just what you’re capable of doing to protect those you love.",
