  "description": "Are you familiar with USDA Class B animal dealers? Alison Cavera wasn't. When her dogs were stolen, Alison was thrown into an underground world of dog theft and suspicious activities linked to the county animal shelter. Her determination to rescue Blue and Cody gave her the courage to take risks, do things she never knew she was capable of and helped her honor the memory of her son. Along the way, Alison meets Cooper Malecki, a handyman, vegan and animal advocate. As Alison opens herself up to new ways of helping animals, she also finds herself opening her heart.",
