While struggling to get back to what he considers the right path of an ascended being, Shamsiel meets Blake, a male pole dancer and a daimon that feeds on everything the angel runs away lust, desire, physical love. Blake will challenge him to face his deepest fears and reevaluate his ideas on love, purity, and divine grace.Warning! 18+ This is an m/m story, which means two males fall in love and enjoy each other in every way imaginable.
