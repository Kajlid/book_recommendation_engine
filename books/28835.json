  "description": "Even the simplest of touches between Will Frost and Lauren McLean are forbidden.To share love will surely mean death.Since her granddad’s passing, Lauren has existed a few steps out of sync with the world. Desperate to feel the love only he offered her as a child, Lauren returns to the haven they once shared — a snow-covered cabin at the foothills of the Rockies.It’s not the memory of her granddad that warms her ice-cold, frost-bitten body after being caught in a blizzard, though. It’s the man in whose bed she wakes.Along with bringing life to her soul, Will stirs deep-rooted memories in Lauren and brings out the love she seeks.What Will knows about himself — the secrets of his kind — he keeps hidden, forcing Lauren to search for answers, to question and ultimately put her life, and his own existence, in danger.In love though, there is always a way.Can Will get around the rules? Or will Lauren give up her life simply to have one last touch from Will Frost?",
