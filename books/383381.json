In 1997 Philadelphia, an 800 year old vampire comes face to face with his reason to be when he discovers a young mortal woman whose understanding of immortality is about to change all he's known as truth. Obsessed with the mystery of her knowledge, he embarks on a journey that doesn't only lead him to his childhood home in the Provencal Alps, but into his greatest hopes and dreams, fears and disappointments, and into the strange and frightening past that shaped him. A novel about faltering faith and never-ending hope, On the Soul of a Vampire will not only alter everything you think you know about vampires, it will change the way you see your very soul.",
