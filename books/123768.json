  "description": "Waking up married is bad enough. Having feelings for my husband? Pure disaster.\nTeddyI wasn’t looking for attachments. I certainly wasn’t looking to get drunkenly hitched to my coworker’s best friend, the very man I’ve been denying an attraction to for over a year.The thing is Kipp is gorgeous and kind and a self-proclaimed mess, and now that we’re married—and living together—all I want is to take care of him.But Kipp is only just learning about his submissive side. It doesn’t matter how good he is for me. It doesn’t even matter that he turns to putty every time I call him doll.He’s not mine to keep. Our husbands-with-benefits relationship is temporary, and once we get divorced, everything will go back to the way it was. Kipp and I may have shared our I dos, but let’s face it…Falling for the man who wears my ring would only end in heartbreak.Teddy is a wake-up-married romance between a teddy bear adult entertainer and the hot mess he shacks up with. There’s caretaker-Dom elements and a gentle exploration of kink, spanking (but not as punishment), only one bed, plenty of lighthearted mayhem, and one very HEA. It’s book five in the Elite 8 Studios series but can be read as a standalone.",
