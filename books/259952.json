  "description": "Succulent starlets ready to make it, rich moguls hungry for hotter pleasures—on the casting couch, at lavish parties, in plush hotel suites. A Hollywood tale about the burning ambitions, vicious power-plays, and sexual double-dealings of the entertainment world, where wives wait for husbands who never come home, and luscious models pay more than their dues…where talent and drive take you just so far, but sex can take you all the way.",
