  "title": "Still Evangelical?: Insiders Reconsider Political, Social, and Theological Meaning",
  "description": "Evangelicalism in America has cracked, split on the shoals of the 2016 presidential election and its aftermath, leaving many wondering if they want to be in or out of the evangelical tribe. The contentiousness brought to the fore surrounds what it means to affirm and demonstrate evangelical Christian faith amidst the messy and polarized realities gripping our country and world. Who or what is defining the evangelical social and political vision? Is it the gospel or is it culture? For a movement that has been about the primacy of Christian faith, this is a crisis. This collection of essays was gathered by Mark Labberton, president of Fuller Theological Seminary, who provides an introduction to the volume. What follows is a diverse and provocative set of perspectives and reflections from evangelical insiders who wrestle with their responses to the question of what it means to be evangelical in light of their convictions. Contributors include:Shane Claiborne, Red Letter ChristiansJim Daly, Focus on the FamilyMark Galli, Christianity TodayLisa Sharon Harper, FreedomRoad.usTom Lin, InterVarsity Christian FellowshipKaren Swallow Prior, Liberty UniversitySoong-Chan Rah, North Park UniversityRobert Chao Romero, UCLASandra Maria Van Opstal, Grace and Peace CommunityAllen Yeh, Biola UniversityMark Young, Denver SeminaryReferring to oneself as evangelical cannot be merely a congratulatory self-description. It must instead be a commitment and aspiration guided by the grace and mercy of Jesus Christ. What now are Christ's followers called to do in response to this identity crisis?",
