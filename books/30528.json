  "title": "Live...Suburbia!",
  "description": "Live...Suburbia!\n is a collection of stories and images of the post-1960s subcultures that define America. It’s kids taking their urethane wheels to empty pools, picking British Punk in broad downstrokes and creating Hardcore, it’s skinheads wearing sneakers and moshing in Connecticut warehouses.\n Live...Suburbia!\n is dedicated to denim devils twirling butterfly knives and hasty tags thrown down with Rust-Oleum touch-up paint stolen from your parent’s garage.  Most importantly \nLive...Suburbia! \nis a new approach in compiling a book. We have Tumblr, Facebook, Flickr and thousands of blogs documenting subcultures, but we’re interested in the other side: real people’s archives and memories, the ones that haven’t been passed around so many times that we have no idea where they came from.   The book begins with Kiss. From there \nLive...Suburbia! \nrushes through years packed with ninjas, long metal hair, BMX dirt jumps, karate, seven-ply skateboards, bathroom mohawks, skinheads, jockey hardcore kids, basement DJs, graffiti murals behind supermarkets, and finally we arrive in the 1990s where it all collides.",
