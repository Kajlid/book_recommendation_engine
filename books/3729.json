  "description": "Unabridged audiobook / 7 CDs / approximately 7:15 hours\n\n\"'Magic? Me, do magic?' Magic was a thing of schools and books. No proper Acalon did magic. 'Oh, no--please, you're mistaken, my lady. I'm no mage.'\n Sandry met his eyes squarely. 'You just danced a magical working, Pasco Acalon. I am never mistaken about such things.'\"\n Four years after we last saw the young mages Sandry, Tris, Daja, and Briar in the Circle of Magic quartet, Sandry is back. Now 14 years old, she is helping her great-uncle, Duke Vedris IV, ruler of Emelan, recover after a heart attack. But there's no rest for the weary mage. A mysterious murderer is afoot, and it quickly becomes clear that Sandry and her reluctant young protégé, Pasco, are the only ones who can stop the killings. Unfortunately, Pasco comes from a long line of harriers, or provost's guards, and his burly family does not think highly of a boy who dances magical spells. It takes some fancy footwork to convince Pasco of the need for his special brand of magic, and Sandry is just the girl for the job. This first title in Tamora Pierce's new series, The Circle Opens, will thrill fans of her terrifically popular previous books, including The Circle of Magic quartet and The Song of the Lioness quartet. With her spellbinding choreography of wit, gore, and intrigue, Pierce never takes a false step. (Ages 9 and older) --Emilie Coulter",
