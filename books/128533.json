  "title": "The Healthy and Happy Life Series: Food and Dieting, Emulating Nature to Achieve Weight Loss and Better Health",
  "description": "We all know we need to pay attention to nutrition in order to live a better life. But with all of the conflicting ideologies coming at us left and right, if we give in to society's notions about what is good for us and what is not, we lose something extremely important. The ability to be one with nature. So ask yourselves...just because we can do something, should we? In this book, topics such as human evolution, food groups, and misconceptions about what we need are all discussed in ways often kept quiet by the food industries. This is a first step manual in understanding how to look at food in a completely different light for a happier, healthier future.",
