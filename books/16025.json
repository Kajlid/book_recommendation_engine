  "description": "\"I don't care about your conscience. All I want is for you to kiss me again.\"Lady Madeline Matthews would rather shame herself than sacrifice her freedomâ€”which is why, to avoid a marriage to an aging, lecherous lord, she seeks out the company of Logan Scott. A torrid affair with the notorious womanizer would surely condemn her in the eyes of good society.Though a legend in the bedchamber, Logan is, in truth, an intensely private man tormented by past betrayals. Now a forward little minx is disrupting his life with her vibrant charm and unspoiled beauty, a high-spirited enchantress completely at sea in London's sophisticated whirl. But when what begins with a kiss threatens to blossom into something more rapturous and real, will Logan and Madeline have the courage to drop the masks they hide behind in the name of love?Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 0380781441; ISBN 13: 9780380781447",
