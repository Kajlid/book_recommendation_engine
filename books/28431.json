  "title": "The Young Magician",
  "description": "Every known age has not ended well, to say the least. Entire continents have been decimated time and time again at the hands of the demon hordes, forcing civilisation to start over in every instance, all culture and art and history destroyed. Now, in the last days before the gates of hell fall open again, it seems as if all efforts to avert disaster have failed, but for one small sliver of hope. A boy is found whose potential is unequalled, a boy who could hold the secret to the demons' realm, a boy who could be the very salvation of man. But not even the Order's greatest champions could guess the true secrets hidden away deep inside of this boy, secrets that could ultimately destroy them all. Commended in the Austalian Literary Awards, The Young Magician begins a remarkable tale.",
