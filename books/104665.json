  "description": "In the heart of winter, half-frozen and more dead than alive, Ellie’s husband returns from a distant war. She nurses him back to health, overjoyed at his survival; but it soon becomes clear that this man, recovering in the bedroom upstairs, is far removed from the young boy that Ellie married. He has changed; he screams in his sleep, beset by nightmares, and there is a darkness in him that she has never seen before. Ellie begins to suspect that he has done terrible things. Who is the rider that watches from the edge of the wood? Why is her husband lying; what is he hiding from her? More importantly, who is the scarred woman that stalks them, determined to exact her vengeance, and how far is Ellie willing to go to redeem her husband’s actions? Her decisions will rip her from the farm she loves, and send her tumbling into a world of darkness; hunted on all sides as she finds herself fighting in a war that is not her own. Will she survive? And will she ever be the same, even if she does? A Woman Scarred is a novel set in a rich, fantasy world, where the difference between good and evil is not always so simply defined. It is a story of love, loss, betrayal and war. And, at its heart, it is a story about how revenge is an insanity that can destroy even the best of us.",
