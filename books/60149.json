  "description": "Superman came to life just when the country needed a hero. Facing the still-fresh wounds of the Great Depression and the growing threat of another World War, he flew into the collective conscious as a man of steel who could leap tall buildings in a single bound and fly faster than our fastest trains. Today, we still need heroes, they're just not always as clear cut or normal as a man in blue tights with X-ray vision and a billowy red cape. Okay, that's not so normal either, but you get our point.",
