When historian Willie Clarke dies of mysteriously of dehydration in the California deserts, ex-football hero Jim Knighthorse is hired to dig a little deeper--and discovers a shocking connection to one of the West's oldest mysteries.Over a hundred years ago, an unnamed cowboy was murdered in the California desert and, due to freak weather conditions, would become mummified within twenty-four hours.

That is, unless private investigator Jim Knighthorse can survive long enough to untangle one of the West's greatest unsolved murders.READING SAMPLETo the east, high on the high cliff above, something flashed.
