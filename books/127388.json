Four years have passed since Wren left Nevermor – since Rifter promised that he wouldn’t forget her. Now 19, Wren is shut away in an asylum, accused of madness and of murders she didn’t commit. When Rifter finally comes for her, it is not a moment too soon, and in her absence, Nevermor has changed. Under a cloud of mysterious darkness, the land has died.At Rifter's request, Wren sets out across the broken world to gather the Wolf Pack, now separated, so that they might take back the land that is rightfully theirs. Out of love and trust, Wren agrees, but she finds out quickly that things are not all as they seem, and everyone has a different story to tell.",
