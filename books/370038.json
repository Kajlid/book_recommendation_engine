  "description": "From the idyllic childhood world of the Small Faces 'Itchycoo Park' to the Beatles 'Lucy in the Sky of Diamonds', Lewis Carroll's vivid imagery has exerted a strong influence on '60's psychedelia. In his fascinating introduction, Jeremy Reed highlights the psychedelic nuances of the text reveals how this Victorian eccentric - with one of the most vivid imaginations in literature - was to inspire and set a precedent for some of the most legendary songwriters in popular music. He also questions the casual assimilation of Alice Through the Looking Glass into children's literature. Alice Through the Looking Glass remains a fascinating book, and is here presented in its true adult context for the very first time.",
