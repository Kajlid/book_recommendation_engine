  "description": "From the moment Kitty, a ballerina doll, is assembled in the Doll Factory, she questions her existence. She ends up in a suburban home where a little girl plays domestic games with her and Soccer Scotty, a male doll happy with the status quo. The restless Kitty escapes, along the way meeting Army Jim, a military action figure. He’s heading for Dolltopia, where dolls have created their own society, separate from humans. She joins him on the journey and the biggest adventure of their lives! They give themselves makeovers, meet a helpful black cat and other free-thinking dolls, lead a raid on the Doll Factory, and Kitty undergoes plastic surgery by Dolltopia’s mysterious Doctor. Just as she’s getting settled in, Soccer Scotty tracks her down. Things get even worse when a human discovers Dolltopia! Acclaimed graphic novelist Abby Denson brings her trademark manga- and punk-inflected style to this imaginative graphic novel.",
