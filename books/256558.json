Now, the legions of the fae rule the broken world, and humanity has nothing left but a handful of protected cities and a heaping helping of regret.Enter Vincent Whelan.

He makes good money. Lives the good life. Has a good future in store. As long as he can ignore his traumatic memories of the past.But when a new job with an odd twist blows onto his doorstep, Vince finds himself unwittingly drawn into a vast conspiracy lurking underneath Kinsale's thin veneer of civilization. Old friends suddenly return to haunt him. New enemies appear at every turn. And Vince fears he isn't prepared to confront either one.But if he doesn't put his detective hat back on and solve this case on a tight deadline, then what's left of the city he calls home might just crumble to dust.Â What Fate Portends is the first novel of The Frost Arcana, an action-packed urban fantasy series set in a post-apocalyptic world.",
