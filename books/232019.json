  "description": "Elaria Tanager comes from two old, distinguished family lines. As in ancient and divine. Her father's people are witches, and her mother's are sirens, which makes her something very rare. Elaria is a spellsinger, able to weave words into witchcraft, and she's made a lucrative business out of her talents. Need someone to change their mind? No problem. Rather have them dead? Sure, but it'll cost you extra. Anything is possible, if Elaria sings the right lyrics. She's made a name for herself within the paranormal community, and now a fairy duke has come all the way from Tir Nan Og to hire her. The pay is impressive, but so is the target. The Onyx King of the Shining Ones, one of the most powerful magic users in all the realms, and someone wants him dead. Despite her misgivings, sentiment sways her, and Elaria takes the job. If she can catch him off guard, she'll be able to kill the Onyx King with just a single song. But intrigue abounds in Tir Nan Og, and the King of Onyx may not be the villain she was led to believe. Will he be able to change her tune or will this be the spellsinger's last lullaby?",
