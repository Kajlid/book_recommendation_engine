  "description": "Seven years ago, Roan Bucklin left the family ranch for college, leaving foreman Patrick Lassiter with a mix of sweltering emotions: relief, regret, and nearly overwhelming desire. Afraid that Roan would regret giving himself to an older man, Patrick let him go without a word about his true feelings. But Roan took Patrick's heart with him. Roan had harbored a crush on Patrick from the time he'd turned fourteen. He thought he'd gotten over it, grown up, moved on, but now he's back and home to stay. After one look, he knows he has something to prove to Patrick - that he wants to be claimed by the cowboy who has always possessed his heart. Includes the Bonus Novella ~ Justice Years of eating, breathing and dreaming revenge have left the three Abrams brothers homesick for a place that doesn't exist. When they happen upon the small town of Justice, the welcome and acceptance seems too good to be true. As each brother finds a reason to stay, the desire for revenge fades - until one Abrams brother disappears. Then Justice bonds together to support its own, and the brothers discover they've finally found a home. Read full chapter excerpts at www.dreamspinnerpress.com",
