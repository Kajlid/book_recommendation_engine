  "description": "Q437B was ready to die for the Second Revolution. Then she entered the Muertre… Q and B expected death when the Elders ordered their execution. What they discover instead changes everything they thought they knew about their world. Saved by the mercy of the Elders, they awaken in the Vrai Domicile, a mysterious place hidden below the Sixth Domicile housing hundreds of former rebels. Except these rebels have been brainwashed, conditioned to be blind followers. Q quickly learns of the Elders’ new plan for her – she is to become their warrior, to reunite the Vrai and Sixth Domiciles with purity, love, and unwavering faith. But to Q, she’ll be undoing everything she and the rebels fought for. Now Q and B must fight to survive once more, forced to forge new alliances with strangers who promise nothing is as it seems. But surviving comes with a choice – follow the Elders and quash the Revolution, or defy them and free the people, putting B's and Grandmother’s lives at risk. In a place where the fire of rebellion is extinguished at every turn, can Q continue to be the spark that fuels the Revolution?
