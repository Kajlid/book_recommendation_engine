  "description": "Talk about taking your work home with you...For better or worse, Harper Bukoski is married to her dream job at a small marketing agency. Thanks to the mismanagement of its morally-lax owners, it's on the brink of disaster. Despite the dysfunction around her--including a nagging suspicion that the clueless new account rep is her boss’s mistress- Harper clings to the hope that her loyalty and diligence will keep the office on an even keel.But the tightly-wound workaholic goes into a tailspin upon meeting Jed Sanderson, whose account is keeping the agency afloat. Harper is troubled by her undeniable attraction to a man with three potential dealbreakers stacked against him: he’s a client; he’s a recently-divorced father of three, and (the doozy!) he’s buddies with her disapproving boss. If Harper listens to her head, she might miss out on something extraordinary with Jed. But if she follows her heart, she risks imploding her career and bringing down the entire agency along with it.",
