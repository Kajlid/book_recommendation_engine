  "description": "Prince Jaymin barely escapes when invaders overrun Alasia and murder his parents. Forced into hiding with his young bodyguard Erik, Jaymin's life depends on maintaining his disguise. But living in hiding isn't enough for Jaymin. His people are suffering under the enemy's oppressive rule, and he is determined to defeat the invaders and reclaim his kingdomâ€”somehow. But any action he takes will place him in the spotlight, and Erik can only do so much to protect him from the soldiers scouring the kingdom for the missing prince. Jaymin must choose between the relative security of anonymity and the risk of standing up to the oppressors. If he does nothing, he might just survive, but what good is a prince who doesn't try to defend his kingdom?If you enjoy the finely crafted cultures and world-building of Mistborn, Song of the Lioness, or Farseer, you'll love the land of Alasia!
