  "description": "Condom dresses, space helmets, and vegetable coats have debuted on fashion runways—now a dead body is the trend. Filleted and stitched into a gruesome skin coat, a corpse worn by an anorexic model saunters down fashion’s biggest stage. The remains are identified as Annabelle Leigh, the teenager who mysteriously disappeared over a decade ago from her boyfriend’s New York City mansion. After years of seeking the truth, new evidence puts golden boy Cecil LeClaire at the center of the crime. He teams up with Ava Germaine, a beautiful and badass ex-con with a knack for breaking codes. Together they investigate the depraved and lawless modeling industry behind Cecil’s family fortune. Model agencies promise the American Dream, but what secrets hide behind those emaciated scowls? In high fashion modeling, selling bodies is organized crime.",
