If none will pay, he and the White Company brutally seize what they desire. As he leaves stains of his presence up and down the country, those who curse him at their defeat can soon be those who praise him for their deliverance.It is a world of massacre and pillage in which life is less than cheap and no one can be trusted. To survive, a man has to be quick thinking, fleet of foot and strong in his sword arm: Hawkwood is such a man.",
