  "description": "An incubus, a witch, a seer, and a necromancer walk into a bar...Whatever it was that Julian had done to deserve her life turning into some kind of clich√© superhero story with her as the reluctant lead, she regretted it dearly.But with children disappearing and a potential threat to the world afoot, she has to put aside her aversion to being the 'hero', step up to the plate, and hunt down the sick mastermind behind all of it.All the while attempting to not fall in love with her new incubus partner who was everything she'd always wanted in a lover.And everything she couldn't have.The clock is ticking and every wasted day is another that countless lives are lost. She'll need help from even the unlikeliest of sources to put her enemy in the ground once and for all.",
