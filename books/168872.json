  "description": "He's a billionaire, and a bear, and he'd never let anything happen to his mate.  When billionaire tech mogul Ryder Hart returns to Bearstone Park, he isn't expecting to meet the love of his life and prove his father right about mates and love at first sight. He isn't expecting curvaceous, stubborn accountant Janna Wright.  Janna doesn't know what to make of enormous, famous, gorgeous Ryder suddenly pursuing her. She's still trying to get over getting cheated on in a past relationship, and her mother taught her that if something seems too good to be true, it usually is. But when Ryder makes her an offer she can't refuse to work with him up at his huge, luxurious mountain lodge, she accepts, despite the danger to her heart.  Now Ryder just has to show Janna that men may be dogs, but bears rule the forest. And what a bearllionaire wants, a bearllionaire gets.",
