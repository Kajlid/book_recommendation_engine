Circumstances force his hand and he must find a way to get her to uncover her buried memories of their past before someone else steps up to take her from him. For as long as she can remember, hybrid wolf Cadence has loved Jason with every fiber of her being,but he’s consistently shoved her away until the love that’s there is bound tightly in anger and shame. No one can take his place in her heart, but that doesn’t mean that there aren’t wolves willing to try. Will Cadence be able to get through Jason’s icy demeanor to the heart of the boy she’s always loved? Can Jason undo the past so they will have a future together? This book contains red-hot werewolf loving, plenty of neck biting, and misuse of a kitchen counter.
