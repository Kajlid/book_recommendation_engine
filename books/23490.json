  "description": "Alyson's smug little life falls apart early in Heuler's new novel. Her boyfriend leaves her for her best friend and takes the dog! An underqualified male is hired at a higher level than hers at the magazine, and she gets angry and blames gender for her problems. Madam Hope, the neighborhood fortuneteller, offers her tea and a sympathetic ear; the next morning Alyson wakes up as Bob. The clothes and toiletries in the apartment have all changed to those of a man. No one in her office is surprised that a man comes in, and her best girlfriend thinks she/he is gay. For this, Madam Hope will take her/his soul. There is payback and revenge galore in Bob's plans, and lots of power plays in Madam Hope's. Does Alyson/Bob succeed? Does she/he get the raise that she/he deserves? Does Bob ultimately become as big a jerk as all the other men Alyson has dealt with? Who wins in the end? Silliness aside, Heuler's tale poses interesting choices and asks serious questions.- Danise Hoover, Booklist",
