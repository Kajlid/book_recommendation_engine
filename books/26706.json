No matter how much testosterone floods a boardroom, I can always rise above it and get the job done.Which wins me the plum job of negotiating one of the biggest mergers in the country. All I need are a couple of signatures, and then I can use my bonus to buy an apartment with Kelvin, my beta assistant and best-friend-with-benefits.But all that comes crashing down when I’m triggered by a switch.My hidden omega nature takes over, hungry for knots, and bites, and a pack of my own.I always thought switches were an urban myth. But the guy who triggers me is part of the merger deal, and I’m suddenly hot and needy for my billionaire bosses, a royal omega, and my best friend…I just have to remind myself this is a heat of convenience.I’m here to do a job – and so are they.So why does it feel like a mind-blowing merger is on the table?The Omega Merger is a standalone in the Billionaires in Heat series.❤️ Omegaverse (reverse harem)❤️ Sweet angst❤️ Designation switch❤️ Billionaire bosses❤️ Steam, steam, steam!Full TWs in the Author's Note.",
