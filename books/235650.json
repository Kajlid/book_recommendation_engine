  "description": "\"I was a human surrounded by shifters. They told me it was impossible to become like them, they said humans were humans and shifters were shifters, and that was that. They lied.\"  Bree had always wanted to be a shifter. When she and her daughter save a wounded wolf, she has no idea that it will lead to the life she's spent years dreaming of: the life of a wolf shifter. Getting used to her new body and mind is one thing, but getting used to her new soulmate? That's a completely different story.  As far as the human world knows, humans can't become shifters. When someone sees what Bree has become, the world learns that they were wrong. There is a way for humans to turn into shifters but no shifter is willing to tell them what it is. The world as they know it is about to change, how will the shifty ladies handle it?",
