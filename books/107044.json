  "description": "From the moment Mother'Sson is born, he never speaks a word, and his father, the Emperor, never stops talking. As Mother'Sson grows, he amazes all who know him with his extraordinary magics and gentle ways, but the Emperor can only fret -- what kind of Emperor will a silent ruler be? Ultimately, it is Mother'Sson's silence that teaches his father to listen and to understand the world around him . . . before the boy ascends into a heaven of dragons. Set in a fantastical Qin Dynasty China, author Jennifer Anna has again woven a story that, at it's heart, captures the power and wonder of children. Theresa Brandon's unparalle4d artwork encompasses the emotion and depth of the tale with masterful strokes. This first edition includes an illustrated plate autographed by the author and artist. Includes sixty full color art plates.",
