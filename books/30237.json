  "description": "Wayne Benson doesn't require nursing care. He's not a senior citizen. He isn't even retired. But this healthy 30-year-old bachelor believes the comfortable life of The Sunset, an assisted-living retirement community, would be a soothing alternative to his hectic lifestyle. Everything he desires-gourmet meals, laundry services, camaraderie, tranquility-is available for one all-inclusive monthly fee. The only problem? He isn't the required minimum age of sixty-two. So, he dons theatrical make-up and gray wig to age himself forty years, and is accepted into The Sunset.Will everything go as smoothly as planned? Of course not! His elderly love interest becomes suspicious of his under-cover-of-darkness-only lovemaking, his neighbor wants to go to strip clubs and experiment with ViagraÂ®, the head of security is more interested in extortion than security, and the woman who runs The Sunset may be onto his scheme. Can young Wayne survive old age?",
