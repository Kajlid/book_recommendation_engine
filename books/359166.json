  "description": "I left to protect my heart. Instead I shattered it. Will I ever have the courage to fix it?Six long years. That’s how much time has past since I ran away with my tail between my legs, cutting off all communication. And it will be even longer if I have any say over it… to bad I don’t.A family emergency has me rushing home to my small town of Voyageur Bay. While risky and outside my usual and safe visiting time, I’m confident I won’t run into them.T.J., Brice, and Aaron, professional football players and the men—my best friends—who I’ve avoided from the moment we slept together one drunken night. I couldn’t choose between them so I did the next best thing… I ran. With preseason upon us, they should be safely with their team in Colorado and nowhere near home. But when I see them at a party, sparks fly. And I’m in danger of being burned… again.My only hope is to gather the courage I need to finally choose… choose all three of them.",
