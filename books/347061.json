  "title": "Equally Shared Parenting: Rewriting the Rules for a New Generation of Parents",
  "description": "An empowering guide to the Equally Shared Parenting movement, for the millions of Generation X/Yers looking to discover a new model for parenthood.Equally Shared Parenting arms readers with the tools to create a balanced life that is rarely experienced by the parents of young children-an evolution that goes beyond the involved dad married to the working mom. This is a lifestyle in which couples create their own model as parenting partners, equals and peers. Every couple gets to write the rules that work for them. For Marc and Amy Vachon, it means working equal hours, spending equal time with the children, and taking equal responsibility for the home. No one is the keeper of the to-do lists; neither of their careers takes precedence.Equally Shared Parenting clearly outlines the benefits and challenges of equal parenting, covering everything from child-rearing practices, career, and home, to self, money, and society. It presents both the philosophy behind this lifestyle and the everyday steps needed to achieve and maintain it, regardless of income bracket, lifestyle choices, or profession.",
