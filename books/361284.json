  "description": "Lycan Warriors, Book FourBrioni believes there is good in everyone. Even the mysterious new lycan who joins Earth's organized resistance. He does not mingle with the others, kills without passion and never, ever takes his goggles off.One night, she happens on him secretly playing the ocarina. The haunting music calls to her, as does Haruto’s loneliness. For once, when she reaches out, he does not respond with his trademark smirk or disappear. And as she shares herself with him, Brioni learns just how wicked a lycan’s touch can be and how a mere lick can unleash a fire she had not known possible. His flesh brands hers, his mouth sears a decadent trail on her skin. Pure sensualization. Until all hell breaks loose.Haruto never cared about consequences, to himself or others. Until now. He would do anything to shield his precious “Goth Fairy” from harm. He would kill for her. Or die. And the enemy knows.",
