  "description": "Caja has always preferred sexual encounters of the casual kind. A busy entrepreneur, she simply lacks the time to invest in anything more than friends with benefits type relationships. Besides, the last time she tried the commitment thing her fiancee tried to steal her company. It takes only one encounter with Michael, a sizzling hot elementary school teacher to make her question her principles, her libido, and finally her sanity. Unfortunately for Caja, Michael just isn't a casual sex kind of guy. He lets her know in no uncertain terms that he’s not prepared to settle for anything less than a committed relationship. To Caja’s stunned amazement he cuts her off leaving her bewitched, bothered and bewildered beyond belief. Before she gets the chance to address the way he has turned the tables on her, outside forces threaten her nascent empire. Surviving this attack will take all the skill and fortitude Caja possesses. And for the first time she realizes that having someone to lean on is not necessarily a bad thing.",
