  "description": "Winner of 2013 \"Comic Book Finlandia\" prize, the debut work of Finnish siblings Jaako and Lauri Ahonen combines a dark story with glimmers of hope and friendship with beautifully painted illustrations and the mostly-wordless charm of a Chaplin film.Disney meets Kafka in this beautiful, intense, original tale! The story of a very small and very scared little bird, who lives a lonely, isolated life in a great big house with his infirm mother. He's never been outside the house, curious but terrified of the world outside, and he will never leave if his mother has a say about it.",
