  "description": "Eleven neatly aligned crystal caskets glowed in hull of the ghost ship.With a shaking hand, Flint stepped to the first in the row and brushed away the thin layer of frost that had collected there.His heart skipped a beat.A woman lay inside the first casket. Brown, curly hair flowed like liquid amber past elegant shoulders and over ample breasts. Her brightly colored satin gown, so different from the coarse wools of the women of Norpont, barely managed to conceal a tall and elegant body that epitomized femininity.Upon her neck, embedded in a shield of gold, was a single red gemstone; its reflected inner fire ignited by the twinkling torch-light.Flintâ€™s eyes traced her chin, her full lips, and finally reached her blue, piercing gaze.He looked only for a moment, but like all men were fated to do, he fell into the depths of her ocean and was lost forever.",
