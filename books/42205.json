  "description": "Father Paul is the youngest and most attractive priest to be a part of the Vatican, and has a countless amount of women who find him sexually stimulating. Father Paul is also rumored to have a very sexual and seductive way of cleansing women of their sins, and many women have told of how he violates them in devious and sensual ways, but thatâ€™s exactly what the women are looking for from this handsome priest. Joaquin Marks, a young religious schoolgirl has seen Father Paul and desperately wants alone time with him, longs for nothing more than a confession with Father Paul and will go to great lengths to get it. After enticing him with a sultry letter and a promiscuous photograph, Father Paul demands to see Joaquin immediately.
