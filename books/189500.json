  "title": "Kasey Screws Up the World",
  "description": "Sibling rivalry goes too far... Sixteen-year-old Kasey Fishbein has a lot to repent for. She single-handedly abandoned the dance team right before Nationals, ruined her best friend's love life, alienated the guy she loves, and permanently injured her older sister's hip, effectively destroying Lara's prominent dance career in one fell swoop. Guilt keeps eating away at Kasey but no one will listen to her apologies. So she does the next best thing: she starts a blog to confess her sins. But the only way to truly earn forgiveness from those she wronged isn't to offer them an explanation. It's to fix everything she broke. She may not be able to help her sister dance again, but there has to be another way to get her back on her feet. Literally. Right?",
