  "description": "If the characters in ‘Bossy’ prove anything, it’s that getting it on at work doesn’t mean you need to wipe all papers off the surface and get busy on your desk. The settings in this new mini-anthology from Ladylit are as diverse as the positions the ladies in these five stories find themselves in. A doctor finds comfort with a nurse in Cheyenne Blue’s romantic tale of love in the ultrasound room, while Laila Blake’s story shows a professor who can’t resist one of her students on a sweltering hot day in the classroom. Add a maid whose mistress demands full servitude, a sexy mechanic offering roadside assistance and an A-list actress who has trouble hiding her secrets from a Hollywood reporter… and you get ‘Bossy’: five productive tales of lesbian lust.",
