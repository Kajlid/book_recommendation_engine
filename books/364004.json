  "title": "My Fake Boyfriend Is Better Than Yours",
  "description": "Seventh grade was supposed to be fun, but Tori is having major drama with her BFF, Sienna. Sienna changed a lot over the summer―on the first day of school she's tan, confident, and full of stories about her new dreamy boyfriend. Tori knows that she's totally making this guy up. So Tori invents her own fake boyfriend, who is better than Sienna's in every way. Things are going great―unless you count the whole lying-to-your-best-friend thing―until everyone insists Tori and Sienna bring their boyfriends to the back-to-school dance.",
