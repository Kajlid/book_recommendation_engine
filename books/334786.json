Now he spends his days hiding on a remote farm in northern Alaska. The same farm he was sent to at age eleven to be trained by the CIA. Peter only ever wanted a normal life and to be left alone. But the world refuses to leave men like Peter Black alone. An enemy like no other is coming. An enemy that has no mercy. No compassion. Only sheer ruthlessness of will. Forced to become Azrael once again, Peter must use every skill in his repertoire. Otherwise the people he cares about most are going to get hurt.",
