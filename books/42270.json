  "description": "Mother and baby share a magical night.Baby is fast asleep when Mama spies the first flakes of his first snowfall. \"It's snowing!\" she sings. \"Baby, it's snowing!\" Mama bundles Baby in thick warm furs and scrunches into her coat. Out into the snow they go, to see it, smell it, hear it, taste it, touch it â€” and play in it. Olivier Dunrea's exquisite hymn to snow is the story of a solitary night when a mother introduces her baby to the beauty and pleasure of falling snow.Olivier Dunrea is the creator of numerous picture books, including Bear Noel, which The New York Times Book Review called \"as simple, complex and elegant a story as each single snowflake.\" Mr. Dunrea lives in Narrowsburg, New York.",
