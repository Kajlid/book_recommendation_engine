  "description": "He’s the hot new Spanish teacher.I’m the principal.That spells trouble with a capital T.My story is simple. I’m one of the lucky ones. I had a man who rocked my world. I loved with my whole heart. Then, I lost. But at least I’d loved, and I had a son to keep his father’s memory alive. I never thought I would be interested in a man again. Between herding a teenager toward manhood and running the highest-ranking elementary school in Azalea County, I didn’t have time for anything more than a fictional book boyfriend.Then, Mr. Morales strolled down my hall and hola’d his way straight to my starved libido.Work used to be my sanctuary. Now, every day is sweet torture. I can’t lead a staff meeting without picturing him naked. One smile renders me speechless. I’m swooning in the halls, and it’s not because one of the students brought tuna fish for lunch. I may be hot for teacher, but I’ll never have another man in my life. Especially one like Mr. Morales who’s more trouble than he’s worth. Don’t miss out on this steamy romantic comedy set in the small town of Mossy Oak, North Carolina, where you’ll find the best bookshop in the world, a gold-medal winery, and an abundance of book boyfriends.",
