  "title": "Jaz, Tall Men, & Mayhem",
  "description": "Not even that recent close call with a dead body, or those interrogations by the authorities can deter Jazmine Davidson from enjoying her new life in Tel Aviv. Jaz, back on her feet and gainfully employed in the city’s hottest new nightclub, Max’s Place, wonders why she ever considered going back to teaching. Granted, bartending is a far cry from her previous profession, and not exactly what some relatives might approve of, but it beats the heck out of a classroom. Besides, where else can you find work in Israel where you don’t have to know Hebrew? And so what if the clientele are usually drunk and the hours are hideous? With customers ranging from pro basketball players to hip young locals, Max’s is never dull. But then one of those tall, ball-playing jocks dies right there at the front door of the club, and Jaz, once again, finds herself in the middle of a murder investigation. It’s bad enough when the cops question her, but what is it with the anonymous threats? At least this time she has friends to turn to. Infiltrating smelly locker rooms, crashing high-end parties, and eves-dropping on private conversations, could lead Jaz to the killer. Then again, it could lead the bad guys right to her doorstep",
