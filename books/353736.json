  "description": "If Stephanie Fields was asked to describe herself, sheâ€™d say she was ordinary, calm and cautious. Her quiet life was exactly as she wanted it to be, or so she thought, until a mysterious stranger entered her shop. He had a knack for drawing her out of herself, for pushing her buttons, for making her feel... But now, just when life was getting interesting, someone was stalking her.",
