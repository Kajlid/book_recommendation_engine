The only way he could save me was to open a rip between worlds. The only way for me to save myself was to go through it. Sometimes, fleeing one dangerous place just brings you to another. Annwyn. The realm of the fae. There is magic and beauty here, though around every corner, threats lurk. But I’m a threat too. I’m not a girl in a gilded cage anymore, and no one is going to stop me from finding my way back to Slade. But returning home means facing danger and secrets. So I have to burn bright enough to light my own way… Or else I might be swallowed by the dark.
