  "description": "ASHLYN It was supposed to be a vacation. Five whole days on the beach with my best friend before we made the move from Seattle to New York. I never expected to meet a man who would make me change the way I saw love and sex. I've always believed you can have one without the other. So, when I hooked up with a one-night stand while on vacation, I never expected him to be standing in the middle of my hotel room hours later. Proclaiming to be my best friend's brother. RYDER I'm married to my job. I'm twenty-nine and help run a fortune 500 company. I hadn't seen my sister in four years, and I wanted to surprise her. What better way than on her vacation? What I ended up getting was a woman who knew exactly what she wanted. And for that one night, I was it. I knew that I wanted more. You don't spend a night with someone like her and let her walk away that easily. It took me two seconds to decide I wanted him for one night. It took me a day to understand that he was gonna want more. I've always had the means to buy anything I want. Too bad, she is priceless. I've always believed in love. But I'm selfish. I want more ... But can he give it to me? Or when this gets hard, does he walk away?",
