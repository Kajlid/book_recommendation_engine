  "title": "Bastet",
  "description": "Kellan Largant is a grad student at Harvard. His thesis is on ancient Egyptian religious cults. While immersed in his research, he comes across an obscure reference to the Earth Warrior cult. Little does he know that one sentence in a dusty, tattered book will engulf him in a battle between good and evil. A battle that could be the end of the world as he knows it. The stray cat wandering the streets around Kellan’s house is more than an abandoned feline. Bastet has roamed the earth from the days when Egypt was young. He’s watched the pharaohs rise and fall, new gods come and go. His purpose, however, has remained the same—protect the earth at all costs and keep the secrets of the Earth Warriors from regular mortals. He’s sent to keep Kellan Largant from finding out the truth about the cult, but also to keep the unsuspecting college student alive. One man will do anything for the spell that created the Warriors. He wants immortality, and killing Kellan for the secret is just the beginning of the trouble he’ll cause to get what he wants. NOTE: Don't miss Book II in the Earth Warriors, available soon from Amber Allure!",
