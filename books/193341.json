  "description": "Amya Priam is a Seraph; she has the ability to send her soul to Sojourn into people’s bodies. And for some unknown reason, she is valuable to a group of Rascals, creatures who look like normal humans beings but feed on humanity. She, her best friend, Samera Cohen, and Xander Macfrey have returned safely to the Protectors of Amani Headquarters after their escapade in England. But this feeling of security is soon shattered when Protectors from all around the world insist that Xander receive the death penalty for crimes he hasn’t committed. Before any solution can be worked out, however, a bigger problem arises. HQ falls under attack, forcing the trio to seek safety in a small Canadian city called Sherbrooke, where new discoveries and danger lurk around every street corner.",
