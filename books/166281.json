  "title": "Love, A Foot Above the Ground",
  "description": "A story of love, loss, and inspiration set in the 1960s, told to Jessica Huntington in the 1980s, and shared with us today.  For fans of the Jessica Huntington Desert Cities Mystery Series, the story is narrated by the amateur sleuth in that series, Jessica Huntington. The love story is Bernadette's--Jessica's confidant and sidekick.  A tragic, but ultimately uplifting story of love, lost and found again. In Bernadette's words, \"it's a real happily ever after story.\" Her story is not so different than that faced by anyone who takes that leap of faith into love. A love that lifts us up about a foot above the ground, leaves us vulnerable to loss, but can push us toward something more lasting.",
