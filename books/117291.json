  "description": "The Unforeseen Cuckold sees both Jill and Matt's behaviour manifest in ways neither quite imagined before. Jill has betrayed her bull's trust, and she must face the devastating consequences. Matt, meanwhile, can barely resist the temptation of his attraction to Francesca.Jill struggles with an inner war, revealing the ownership of that man from her past, her master, is burdening her. She realises she is seeking control one second, and the absolute annihilation of it the next. She is teetering on the brink of two possible precipices... Holy matrimony, with its lifetime of commitment... And sexual slavery, submitting herself to the might of a furious, possessive older lover.Jill rebels, exploring her cruel, dominant side, perhaps in an attempt to regain control of herself, and forces Matt to wear her skimpiest thongs. He fights, but mistress Jill truly breaks her cuckold, labelling him everything from sissy to pantyboy... While Francesca offers Matt sexual sanctuary from such torment.Jill realises she must face Gary's final ultimatum if she wants to be his again, and discloses to Matt, “Master isn't around anymore. It's possible he's gone forever. But his physical presence is irrelevant. I feel him in my head... In my heart...” Jill pushes her glorious legs apart. “And in here.” She strokes her inner thighs to her underwear. “He's here, challenging how serious I am about becoming someone else's wife.” Jill presses her panties inwardly. \"He owned me, Matthew. He truly possessed this. Even in marriage to you, it'll be his. The past dictates the present, and it shapes the future. It cannot be changed. And he cannot be replaced... But my needs are changing... Shifting... And I truly believe I need to go dogging with Gary.”",
