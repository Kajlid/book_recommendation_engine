  "description": "It was a busy day on Lake Chicopee. But it was an eclectic bunch of sightseers and tourists that had the strange, local residents rubbing their hands with delight. There was Calvin Dieb, the lawyer setting up the property deal, who'd lost his car keys; there was Linda Lachuk, the tabloid journalist who could smell that big, sensational story; there was dumpy Janice DeWeese, who was just on a walking holiday but who longed for love. But most promising of all, there was Wesley Higgins, the young man from Birmingham, England, who was there because he knew the legend of the ghost of Okeewana.All he had to do was immerse himself in the waters of the lake and he would find his heart's desire.",
