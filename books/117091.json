  "description": "There was something to be said for the expression fiery passions. From the moment Draco Watatsumi Lo Jin realized he'd go into the phase his people called dragon heat, he knew he'd be craving, needing, wanting one woman. Not just any woman. Anika Crews. When he was accused of acts that shamed his name, his brother, his kind, she'd stood by him, helped him. And in that time, he'd come to realize that there would be no sharing himself with any other female. No committing his existence to a mate unless it was her. He'd swim the seven seas if it meant he could have her in his arms. After all, he was a seadragon.",
