  "description": "Pretending to be a hot hockey player’s girlfriend shouldn’t be a problem.Except when that player is my brother’s teammate, Foster Craig, with the body of a god and a British accent that melts the panties straight off my lady bits. Did I mention that I might have a teeny crush on him?But after a picture of an accidental kiss goes viral, he makes an offer I’d be hard pressed to refuse. A few dates in exchange for a lot of money. It seems harmless enough. And besides, I have a dead car, a baby to take care of, and a romance novel to write.I just have to remember--No. More. Hockey. Players. Especially one who scores more off the ice than on.Even if he comes to my rescue after my car breaks down. Or attempts to make me a cake for my birthday. Or dances with my two month old son when he thinks I’m not watching. I'm trying to resist him, but when he offers to help me test out \"positions\" for the novel I'm writing, things get a little… complicated. (And I’m not just talking about the Reverse Wheel Barrow with a Corkscrew Twist.)And I find myself breaking my rules one by one.If I take my heart out of the penalty box, am I going to end up being checked by yet another player?",
