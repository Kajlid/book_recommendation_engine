  "description": "A host of dark and dangerous characters from international banking, prostitution, ageing financial institutions and the dark web collide together, in a race against the clock to pull off a twisted act of revenge. Despite coexisting in the same 'professional' circles, they desperately try to manipulate one another, but who is really in control? CEO Dominic pays handsomely to indulge in his warped fantasies, whilst his company's share price enters free-fall. Tracy and John force themselves into the shadowy recesses of human existence, driven by past demons, dominated by heroin. Kev plays mild-mannered middle manager, in the office during the day, but undertakes bleak explorations into depravity at night. Anthony is risking it all; hell-bent on revenge for those he holds accountable for his downfall. Fast paced, unconventional debut novel, from the author of 5* rated novella, Comedic Depression.\"I never thought I would be the kind of person who could ruin those around me. Honestly, I didn't intend for this to happen. It was a result of how they treated me - or should I say, of how badly they treated me. Revenge starts as a snap decision, but once the journey has started, its difficult beast to stop\"",
