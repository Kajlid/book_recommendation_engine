  "description": "Her Secret Wish was previously published in the Protect and Serve anthology, but the book has been significantly expanded. Rachel Searles, a former Marine Helicopter Pilot, normally did the rescuing, so she’s a little off balance when Denver PD officer Dean West comes to her aid in a crash. Even injured she recognizes that he’s incredibly handsome and seductive. But he also has a caring heart that appeals to a part of her she’s denied for many years.  Dean West is intrigued by the warrior woman’s spirit. As she adjusts to her new life, grounded but still vital, he wants to be a part of it. Will he be able to surmount her fears and convince her to take a chance on flying with her heart?",
