  "description": "Desperate to save her family's struggling gold mine, Elery Hearst orders her crew to dig a new tunnel in a last-ditch effort to intersect the original gold vein. Rather than saving her legacy, however, the tunnel collapses, killing one of her men. Initial reports blame the tragedy on faulty equipment--an old machine Elery should have replaced.Before she can come to terms with the guilt and regret consuming her, Elery's brother disappears in search of the Lost Dutchman, a legendary mine of vast riches, and what he believes to be the solution to his family's grave financial situation. To find her brother, Elery must now ask for help from the one man she'd rather avoid--Lucan Milner, the twin brother of the miner who died in the collapse.Still struggling with the loss of his only brother, rescue tracker Lucan Milner reluctantly agrees to help with the search. But when Elery insists on coming along, her presence forces his emotions to the surface. How can God expect him to forgive her?Then, Lucan's tracking dog is injured, bringing the search to a halt. Lucan and Elery realize the only way to find her brother is to find the Lost Dutchman Mine. And Lucan holds the secret that can help--journal pages written by the Dutchman himself.But sharing them with Elery not only rips open his grief-stricken heart, it puts both of them into the path of a killer. In these deserted mountains, they aren't the only ones desperate to find the lost mine.",
