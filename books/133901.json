  "title": "Wildwood: fairy tales and fables re-imagined",
  "description": "These fanciful stories are based on well-known European fairy tales and fables. As with the originals, some are light and whimsical, others ferociously grim. They are written in the traditional language and style that we remember from childhood, but unlike the originals, they are not for children. Adult lovers of fairy tales may, on reflection, have wondered how fared the wedding night of a princess who could not endure a pea; what became of Hansel and Gretel after their hideous ordeal; what inner anguish the naked emperor suffered as he doggedly paraded past his gaping subjects; and whence came the outlandish tale of a wolf successfully passing himself off as a grandmother. These and other questions are answered in Wildwoodâ€™s fourteen satirical tales.",
