Cassandra Holland: I thought life on the wrong side of the tracks had toughened me up, but nothing had prepared me for the elites at Blossom High.

And things were about to go from bad to worse when my old enemy shows up on campus, ready to prove to everyone around that nobody could mess with her.  Through it all, could I ever forgive the three boys who had been by my side before they betrayed me?  Would I ever even get the chance?  The final book in the Blossom High Duet.",
