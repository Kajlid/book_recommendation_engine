  "description": "Alaric Schuyler.Enigmatic, cocky, and my new brother-in-law.He had cerulean blue eyes and a smile so beautifully devious it could entice the devil to do his bidding.We were never supposed to happen.One night changed everything, tying him and me together in a sordid twist of fate, trapping me in his dark, chaotic world.The lucid dreams and sick fantasies followed.He became the star of my nightmares, always lurking in the shadows, awakening dormant demons one esoteric melody at a time.I became his muse, a part of everything he did.He would be the death of me. And in the end, I wanted nothing more.AUTHORâ€™S NOTE:*** Contains graphic language, frequent graphic sex, explicit scenes of horror, and very dark themes.***",
