  "description": "Chet Holmes has been called “one of the top 20 change experts in the country.” He helps his clients blow away both the competition and their own expectations. And his advice starts with one simple concept: focus! Instead of trying to master four thousand strategies to improve your business, zero in on the few essential skill areas that make the big difference.  Too many managers jump at every new trend, but don’t stick with any of them. Instead, says Holmes, focus on twelve critical areas of improvement—one at a time—and practice them over and over with pigheaded discipline.  The Ultimate Sales Machine shows you how to tune up and soup up virtually every part of your business by spending just an hour per week on each impact area you want to improve. Like a tennis player who hits nothing but backhands for a few hours a week to perfect his game, you can systematically improve each key area.  Holmes offers proven strategies for:  • Management: Teach your people how to work smarter, not harder  • Marketing: Get more bang from your Web site, advertising, trade shows, and public relations  • Sales: Perfect every sales interaction by working on sales, not just in sales  The Ultimate Sales Machine will put you and your company on a path to success and help you stay there!",
