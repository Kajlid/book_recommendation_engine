  "description": "Our past defines who we are. There are things from my past that I will do anything to keep hidden. Things that I know Beth wouldn't understand. How could she when I don't understand what happened myself? I blame myself everyday for the things I've done, and as I get closer to Beth I realize that maybe I'm not ready for this. Maybe I don't deserve her. Regardless, I know she can never find out. But if there was one thing I know better than anyone, it's that secrets donâ€™t stay hidden for long. And sometimes when they break, they are scandalous.",
