When he invites greenhorn Levi Black to share his bungalow, Abe never expects to bring him into their bed. After a seven-year stint in prison for assault, Levi wants nothing more than to outrun his past. In Abe's and Chapel's loving arms he finds solace ... until the family that fought to convict him unexpectedly shows up. Torn between his new makeshift family and his ghosts, he struggles to stay true to himself while Abe and Chapel race to meet a critical deadline and foster Levi's love.An MFM Lumberjack Romance",
