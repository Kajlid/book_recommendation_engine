  "title": "The Karma of a Woman",
  "description": "A brave work of searing honesty, beautiful both in its visual and poetic expression.Barbara Piersonâ€™s short memoir in verse is a powerful personal account of the actualization of her natural right to create and destroy life, and the imprints it left on her soul. Beautifully illustrated with mandalas by Kimberly Febo. Pierson wrote the poem in this book when she was 26 years old, after her second experience with an unwanted pregnancy. Her purpose, she explains, is neither to promote, condemn, nor argue what is right or wrong. It is, instead, a channel for others to tune into for support. Her hope is that it will serve to create empathy and understanding for the pain and deeply personal circumstances that might drive a woman to what is perhaps the most difficult decision of her life.",
