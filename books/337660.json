It kicks off with the birth of the next generation of Beans: the baby Pod'l'pool Cuties. It chronicles the discombobulation of Mr. Spook's fork by greedy Goofy Service Jerks. Meet Mr. Teach'm, who raised Mr. Spook on a cloud. See the crazy breakout origin of Heyoka, Beanworld's upside-down-and-backwards Bean. Read how Professor Garbanzo first discovered the Four Realities and much, much more The Beanworld is a self-contained, weird fantasy dimension that operates under its own rules and laws, but it also echoes deep truths about our own world at the same time.
