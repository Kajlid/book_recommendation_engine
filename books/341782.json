  "title": "Riceyman Steps: A Novel",
  "description": "Edited with an Introduction by Edward Mendelson and Robert Squillace - 'The Bennett novels stand up to anything Europe has put out'. Elizabeth Bowen Henry Earlforward, a shabby Clerkenwell bookseller, has retired from life to devote himself (and his wife Violet) to a consuming passion for money. Miserliness, long disguised as procrastination, can become a fatal illness. Bennett's bleak story is saved, however, by the Earlforward's maid buxom, warm, ignorant and sublime in her spontaneous greed for life. \"Riceyman Steps\" is a modernist masterpiece; a profound psychological and symbolic exploration of the forces of love and death. This edition contains \"Riceyman Steps\", appearing here in Bennett's corrected version, and its sequel, \"Elsie and the Child\".",
