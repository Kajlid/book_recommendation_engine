  "description": "Malcolm Theodore Puddle is a 21-year shipping clerk from way back East. The Mountain Man's former neighbor, Humbolt Puddle, has died and left his crumbling 600-acre ranch to his only living heir just as a greedy and ruthless cattle baron began circling it like a vulture. Smoke is the not the pitying kind but poor, unsuspecting Puddle is walking into a death trap. Any enemy of Smoke's neighbor is his enemy, too, and kill-crazy hired gunmen are threatening the whole valley. Puddle may not be much, but he's all Smoke has, as a take-no-prisoners mountain man and a timid tinhorn make for an army of two in one hell of a fight.",
