  "description": "A wonderful collection of more than 200 traditional recipes represent the best of British country cooking, including lesser-known regional country gemsThere are mouthwatering recipes here for every occasion, including soups, starters, and light meals; hearty stews and pies; delicious puddings and teatime treats; and fruity jams and spicy chutneys. The rhythms of rural life influenced country meals and dishes and led to tasty slow-cooked stews and hotpots and the rituals of baking bread, cakes, and pies. There is a balance of classic \"good plain cooking\" and rich, well-seasoned dishes often rooted in a particular region and focusing on local ingredients. Cooks can choose from time-honored family favorites such as Slow Roast Belly Pork with Root Vegetables, Shepherd's Pie, Apple Cake, and Bakewell Pudding, or discover lesser-known regional country gems like Cornish Fish Pie, traditional Welsh Stew, or Cumberland Girdle Cakes. Includes dual measures.",
