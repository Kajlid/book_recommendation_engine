  "title": "Dairy Cows and Duck Races: A Northumbrian Farmer Remembers",
  "description": "As a boy, all Philip Dixon wanted to be in life was a farmer, but getting there would be a lot less straightforward than he'd anticipated! Starting work on a farm at the age of fifteen, he found himself handling some highly temperamental bulls, meeting some very “witchy” women, getting married and raising a family, acquiring his own farm and became part of the Round Table team that invented the plastic duck race!Philip's story begins in Northumbria in the far north east of England in the 1960s, moving a few miles south to Yorkshire in the north of England, then back to Northumbria when he realises that losing the effective use of one arm in an accident means he can no longer run the farm and decides to start his own dairy business. Even then, some very dirty tricks force him into bankruptcy and our story ends as he begins to make plans for a very different future",
