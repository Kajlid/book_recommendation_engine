His brother left to seek riches playing baseball in America, and now the brother's ex-girlfriend won't leave Naota alone. Then, from beyond the stars drops an impish defender sent forth to stop alien robots from destroying the Earth. Where do the alien robots come from? Well, from Naota's forehead for starters.
