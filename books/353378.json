  "description": "This little piggie went to the market... We all know the familiar or do we? Why did one little piggy go while the other stayed behind? And what could have sent the littlest piggy running at such a clip toward home? Now David Martin spills the whole hoggy truth in five little stories, each hilariously illustrated by Susan Meddaugh, creator of MARTHA SPEAKS, MARTHA CALLING, and other popular picture books. Children will love this zany new take on a favorite game.",
