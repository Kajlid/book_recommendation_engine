  "title": "Breaking Free",
  "description": "Having visited 60 countries, and being pretty fearless by nature, his travelogue does not disappoint when it comes to delivering raw, unique stories. Backpacking can lead you to places that you never imagined ending up in. It was never his intention to get kidnapped in Syria or to be arrested numerous times. He illegally hiked parts of the Great Wall of China, solo climbed the Mont Blanc, hooked up with the Asian mafia to negotiate a smuggling deal and obtain a counterfeit driverâ€™s license, drove 6,000 miles through uncharted terrain on a motorcycle, and enjoyed a cup of tea with scar-covered Hezbollah members among the Middle Eastern spices. Join Jeffrey in his exuberant, funny and beautiful adventures and experience the world in a way few people get to see.",
