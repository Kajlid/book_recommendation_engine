  "description": "It’s official. I’m now the Council’s most wanted.Me, and my army.Our rag tag collection of Werewolves, Sabre-shifters and any other paranormally gifted creature we can find.We’re taking on the most powerful organisation in the world; The Paranormal Council.No pressure, right?Four months ago, I was an assassin, driven by an unrelenting obsession to revenge my mother’s death. I had no ties, no complications. Now I’m the centre of an age-old prophecy and destined to save the world.How did that happen?To challenge me even more, I have not one, but two soulmates who hate each other with a vengeance. Oh yeah, small detail. One has the feline persuasion; a Sabre-tooth, and the other is a Werewolf.Cat versus dog. The age-old adversity.Times about a thousand.It’s a wonder I’m still sane.That is solely because of one man: Ash. The Blackfoot Shaman.If he is a man that is.He could be anything.…Probably is.Now all we have to do is win this war and preferably stay alive.Easy, right?The Prophecy is the second book in the Prophecy series and can be read as a standalone. Lovers of steamy Urban Fantasy will love this new series.",
