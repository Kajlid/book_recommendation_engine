  "description": "Sergeant Rett is yet unaware of the motivating forces behind the long war in the Nyorfian system, much less her role as a Player in a game of gods. All she knows is that once she and F-troop arrive on Epnoce with the rest of the 2023rd, a harsh climate and heavier gravity are the least of her concerns. Pam is gone--just when she could use the support the most. Jaq wants a transfer. Ariam is acting evasive. Her longtime best friend Evetez seems to be doing all he could to get her in serious trouble--and succeeding brilliantly. All she needs now is a close encounter with an old nemisis from the past...Series Reading Order: Convergence, Gravity, Stratagem, Carakenne, Kyarta Girl",
