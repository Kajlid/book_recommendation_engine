  "title": "Music Theory in One Lesson: Discover How Easy Music Theory Can Be!",
  "description": "Music Theory in One Lesson was developed to make music theory more approachable than ever before. This book is packed and carefully formatted with rich, easy to understand diagrams. The use of space and visual learning really sets this book apart from the rest. The ability to read music is not required at any point in this book, so anyone can learn! The book is short and sweet, giving you the tools necessary to explore music in any direction you please. Audio Examples are provided on the Music Theory in One Lesson website.“As a music major, I’ve had to complete four semesters of college music theory. I can honestly say that in those four semesters I did not learn, much less understand, a fraction of what I did reading Music Theory in One Lesson. Each topic is expertly condensed and explained in a refreshing and enlightening way. This text takes all the pain so typically associated with learning music theory and replaces it with one exciting ‘Eureka!’ after another. I highly recommend it.” — Therese Carmack",
