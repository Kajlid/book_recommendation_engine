And when Sydney is targeted by a deadly Lord, one who is bent on destroying her, she may just be the line between the hunted and the hunter.Excerpt:“A gentleman through and through, aren’t you?” My sarcasm was barely concealed in my voice.He raised his eyebrows, walking over to where I was sitting in one quick stride. \"Well, you’re right on that front. I'm no gentleman.\" His smile grew wider as he leaned closer, caging me in with his body. I couldn’t help but sense the waves of power emanating from him. Before he could close the gap between us, he breathed softly, “If you have just a tiny bit of common sense, you wouldn’t try to antagonize me.”",
