  "title": "Martha Stewart's Healthy Quick Cook",
  "description": "\"Martha Stewart's Healthy Quick Cook\" presents an all-new collection of 52 quick, easy menus - with more than 175 sensibly lightened recipes - for the kind of food we want to eat today. Instead of concentrating on calorie counts, fat grams, and sodium content, Martha teaches how to eat well intuitively: how to make a variety of grains, fruits, and vegetables a delicious part of everyday eating; how to create menus that are supremely satisfying and nutritionally sound; even how to indulge a sweet tooth properly by enjoying small portions of such classic desserts as whisper-thin lemon tarts, ginger cookies, and fruit crisps. And her recipes come from all over the world, making healthy meals as exciting as they are fulfilling.",
