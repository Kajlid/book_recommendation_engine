  "description": "The greatest treachery is a false freedom... Wyatt Simmons and Megan Simplot are neighbors, living peacefully in the hills of western Oregon. That is until their murders reveal a surprising truth about life after death. PRISON EARTH presents our planet as a penal colony where the souls of an alien species' worst convicts are implanted in humanoid bodies to live among us. While these beings believe they are normal humans, the truth is that sophisticated computers and alien minds manipulate the daily lives of everyone on Earth, with the goal of rehabilitating the alien criminals. But this carefully managed system breaks down when different alien species fight for the key to the ultimate power of the universe and the very existence of all known life. Though initially stunned by this new reality, Wyatt and Megan must risk not only their new bodies, but their precious souls in the struggle to prevent a cataclysmic explosion as destructive as the Big Bang.",
