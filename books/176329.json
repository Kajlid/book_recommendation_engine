  "description": "Inspector Witherspoon always triumphs...but how does he do it? Even the inspector himself doesn't know-because his secret weapon is as ladylike as she is clever. She's Mrs. Jeffries-the determined, delightful detective, who is also Inspector Witherspoon's housekeeper. While death is unpredictable, the murder of Mrs. Hodges was foreseen at a spooky seance. Mrs. Jeffries may not be able to see the future in a crystal ball, but she can look into the past and put things in order to solve this haunting crime with the help of the staff at Upper Edmonton Gardens.",
