  "title": "The Inner Elvis",
  "description": "Just why was Elvis all shook up? According to clinical psychologist Peter Whitmer, Ph.D., the King suffered as a \"twinless twin,\" and was forever tormented by the death of his infant twin brother, Jesse Garon Presley. Some of the conclusions in this hefty psychological analysis of Elvis may raise eyebrows, as will some of the odd nuggets of information Dr. Whitmer offers, but even readers who take this book with a healthy dose of skepticism will have to admit that it's an interesting and offbeat look at a life that, 20 years after it ended, remains a perennial object of fascination.",
