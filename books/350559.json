  "title": "Get Her Off the Pitch!  How sport took over my life",
  "description": "Get Het Off the Pitch! is the story of one woman's foray into the very masculine and rather baffling world of sport. Lynne Truss, author of Eats, Shoots & Leaves, spent four years as an unlikely sports writer for The Times. It was a job that took her round the world (via the most difficult journeys and least glamorous hotels) and introduced her to some of the greatest living sportsmen (and a lot of obstructive men with clipboards). During her time in the press box she was cold-shouldered by fellow sports writers; tried unsuccessfully to interpret bizarre commentary and memorise results statistics; circled Wembley in an airship eating chocolate cake; wept at football matches and, much to her surprise, discovered a lasting love of golf.Hilarious, perceptive and at times very moving, Get Her Off the Pitch! is the perfect book for those for whom sport is a matter of life and death, but also vital for those who have no idea what all the fuss is about.",
