  "description": "Aydan Flynn is your everyday, socially-ungifted, ordinary girl with a semi-perfect life—a great school, an awesome family, and of course a part time job that she’s always late for, and another that she’ll be starting over the just-beginning summer. What’s even more wonderful is the fact that she’s going back to her birthplace India to work as a tour guide for her Aunt Sadhna’s travel agency! What could possibly go wrong, huh? Well the answer to that question is…everything. First the seemingly innocent stranger blows up the plane, and then they crash-land/fall a million and two miles from their destination! Then, an enormous, seemingly impossible reality is uncovered and Aydan seems to find herself in the center of a war between the supernatural. And when things seem like they couldn’t get any worse, a mind-blowing secret is uncovered, along with an astounding truth that both seem to revolve around Aydan. Of all the summers they could ruin and destroy each other during, they had to choose this one. Even worse, Aydan’s existence is being eaten away by the deity inside her. Her actual personality and actuality are dying from the poison of having more than one person inside her. By the end of her quest for peace in three different worlds, will any of her be left?",
