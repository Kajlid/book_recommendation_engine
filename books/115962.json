  "description": "What could be worse than a witch cat who couldn't ride on a broomstick? Wobble had been a very nice witch cat until Maggie, his fat chuckling witch, got a new broomstick. It had a thin, slippery handle, and when Wobble found he couldn't ride it, his personality suddenly changed. Now he was as cross as he was black.Finally Wobble, that unhappy cat, actually pulled the broomstick out to the trash barrel and thought his problems were solved. But Maggie found that her old vacuum cleaner also had flying magic, so she made her annual Halloween flight with her cat after all. What Wobble discovered and what the children saw in the sky that night combine to make a surprising climax.",
