But first, she needs to get permission from Kenji, head of the Japanese mafia who controls the red light district under his father's watchful eyes. With one meeting, Kenji traps Nyomi in his gaze and locks her into a deal—spend time with him during her three-week stay, and she will earn the access she needs in order to make her book a best seller. But Kenji's plans for Nyomi not only include allowing her a look around, but also a first-hand taste of the kinds of things that go on behind closed doors. And if Nyomi isn't careful, she just might find herself falling for Kenji, a man with many demons and a passion so dark, it could change everything you think you know about love.No Ordinary Love is a dark erotic romance from bestselling erotica author Kenya Wright.",
