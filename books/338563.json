  "description": "Thanks to Lady Farnese's selfless sacrifice, Guts, the Black Swordsman, and the rest of his companions are free to carry on their journey aboard the ship of Farnese's brother, Magnifico — that is, if they're willing to leave Farnese behind. But having to choose between their mission and their loyalties might not be a problem for long if the Kushan emperor and his legion of monstrous minions have their way. With a host of Kushan forces descending on Vritannis, there might not be much left of Farnese's family — or any of the citizenry — to worry about!",
