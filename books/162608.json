  "description": "What happens when a bunch of thirty-year-old degenerates survive an apocalyptic zombie outbreak? They get into even more trouble in the aftermath. Duh.That’s right, Charlie Campbell and several of his loser friends have escaped a nightmare Chicago fraught with zombies and an occupying army, only to find the wild-lands beyond aren’t any safer. Looking for sanctuary, this group of low-skilled and untrained anti-heroes must fight infected mobs, nerdy dads, tunnel dwelling freaks, special forces, and each other to survive.Facing death at every turn, the gang must make friends, find allies, adapt to this mad new world, and do it in a hurry. Will they survive? Will they find a cure? Will they drive each other crazy? But most importantly, will they run out of beer?If you liked the zombie mayhem, rowdy comedy, and over- the-top storytelling of the original Dead Drunk, you will be even more blown away by Dead Drunk II: Dawn of the Deadbeats. So adjust your trucker hat, light that generic cigarette, grab a cold one from the fridge, and let the shenanigans begin.",
