  "title": "A House Called Askival",
  "description": "A stunning and beguiling debut set in India, with a dual narrative, one in the past just after Partition, and the other in the present day James Connor is a man who, burdened with guilt following a tragic event in his youth, has dedicated his life to serving India. Ruth Connor is his estranged daughter who, as a teenager, always knew she came second to her parents' missionary vocation and rebelled, with equally tragic consequences. After 24 years away, Ruth finally returns to Askival, the family home in Mussoorie, a remote hill station in the Northern State of Uttarakhand, to tend to her dying father. There she must face the past and confront her own burden of guilt if she is to cross the chasm that has grown between them. In this extraordinary and assured debut, Merryn Glover draws on her own upbringing as a child of missionary parents in Uttarakhand to create aÂ sensitive, complex, and epic journey through the sights, sounds, and often violent history of India from Partition to the present day.",
