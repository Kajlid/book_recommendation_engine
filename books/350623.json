  "title": "Wounds of Honour",
  "description": "From an exciting new thriller writer for fans of Conn Iggulden and Simon Scarrow, this is the first book in an exhilarating trilogy that lavishly brings to life the great events and battles of the times, and will take its hero far and wide through the Roman Empire Thrilling, authentic, and action-packed, this novel introduces soldier hero Marcus Valerius: a centurion  stationed on Hadrian's Wall in the second century during a revolt against the Roman Empire. Marcus Valerius Aquila has scarcely landed in Britannia when he has to run for his life—condemned to dishonorable death by power-crazed emperor Commodus.  His plan is to take a new name, serve in an obscure regiment on Hadrian's Wall, and lie low until he can hope for justice—but then a rebel army sweeps down from the wastes north of the Wall, and Marcus has to prove he's hard enough to lead a sentry in the front line of a brutal, violent war.",
