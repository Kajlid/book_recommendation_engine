Orien believes himself to be gifted, reading books alone in the attic about the theatre arts, he hopes to be accepted into the Penhaven Arts school, but his struggles in his current schooling cause his teachers and his parents (who are going through a difficult separation) to worry that he might have problems with focus and anxiety. Orien is offered guidance by his therapist and his tutor, but he ends up developing a much stronger bond with a runaway late youth, who is staying with his family, much to the disapproval of Orienâ€™s elder brother.'The Boarder' is only available on kindle, and is part of the Orien series, which also includes the novels 'Orien Battles the Fog-Devils' and 'Orien and the League of Artists'.",
