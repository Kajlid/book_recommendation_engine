  "description": "I always thought that when I fell in love it would be easy, like catching the perfect pitch. The right girl would slide into my life as seamlessly as a ball into my glove. That’s what I wanted. A typical boy meets girl, girl falls for jock story. But that’s not what I got. I had to fall for the one girl I couldn’t have. The one girl I shouldn’t want. My best friend Cal’s younger sister. Against my better judgment, I helped Emmy the night she got into a fight with her loser boyfriend. I did it because it was the right thing to do. What happened afterward was a mistake. A mistake Cal can never find out about. The problem is that it’s a mistake I want to make again…and again. Even though Emmy is pushing me away, I know she wants it too. If we act on our desire people will get hurt, but I don't think I’m strong enough to fight my feelings. I’ve never been the type of guy to take a risk, but for Emmy I will. I’m tired of playing it safe.",
