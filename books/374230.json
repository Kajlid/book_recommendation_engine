Despite Gemma's larger-than-life personality and Alice's quieter, calmer character, the two are inseparable - until that is Alice has to move house, all the way to Scotland. Gemma is utterly distraught, particularly at the thought that Alice might find a new best friend. Is there anything Gem's brothers, or perhaps her grandad, can do to help?

A charming, funny and touching story will be adored by all Wilson fans from 7 upwards.",
