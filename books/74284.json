  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Natalie Waite longs to escape home for college. Her father is a domineering and egotistical writer who keeps a tight rein on Natalie and her long-suffering mother. When Natalie finally does get away, however, college life doesn’t bring the happiness she expected. Little by little, Natalie is no longer certain of anything—even where reality ends and her dark imaginings begin. Chilling and suspenseful, is loosely based on the real-life disappearance of a Bennington College sophomore in 1946.For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.
