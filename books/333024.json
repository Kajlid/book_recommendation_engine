  "description": "Where can you find weredragons, beaststalkers, and werachnids all in one room? Jennifer Scales's family reunion.  Getting through high school is hard enough. Jennifer Scales has the added pressure of her weredragon life, taking trips to Crescent Lake to morph into a dragon under the constant threat of enemy attack. What's worse, she's also half beaststalker from her Mom's side. Beaststalkers and weredragons are mortal enemies, and tension is growing over some suspicious deaths lately. She must prove to both sides that they can live in harmony, just like her family. Well, most of the time. That is until Jennifer finds out that she has a half-brother with a few too many legs.  Unfortunately he's bent on some payback for a lifetime of abandonment and Jennifer's dad is his number-one target. Her life's starting to look like a daytime talk show. Somehow she will have to convince everyone to get along, before they take matters in their own claws.",
