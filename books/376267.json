  "description": "In this philosophy classic, first published in 1951, E.R. Dodds takes on the traditional view of Greek culture as a triumph of rationalism. Using the analytical tools of modern anthropology & psychology, he asks, \"Why should we attribute to the ancient Greeks an immunity from 'primitive' modes of thought which we do not find in any society open to our direct observation?\" Praised by reviewers as \"an event in modern Greek scholarship\" & \"a book which it would be difficult to over-praise,\" The Greeks and the Irrational was Volume 25 of the Sather Classical Lectures series.",
