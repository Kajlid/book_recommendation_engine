  "description": "Sandy is haunted by dreams from her past, a past she'd rather forget. However, with each passing moment, they only get worse. Her inability to sleep causes chaos in her professional life and the time comes to deal with the skeletons in her closet once and for all. Sandy's journey not only takes her to places she'd rather stay away from, but it leads her to love that she thought was lost forever.Romeo’s Redemption is witty with surprising twists, characters that are easy to love and a story that goes beyond the usual clichés. This is a story of love lost and regained with an interesting journey in between.",
