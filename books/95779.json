  "description": "Drew Evans is a winner. Handsome and arrogant, he makes multimillion-dollar business deals and seduces New York's most beautiful women with just a smile. He has loyal friends and an indulgent family. So why has he been shuttered in his apartment for seven days, miserable and depressed? He'll tell you he has the flu. But we all know that's not really true. Katherine Brooks is brilliant, beautiful, and ambitious. She refuses to let anything-or anyone-derail her path to success. When Kate is hired as the new associate at Drew's father's investment banking firm, every aspect of the dashing playboy's life is thrown into a tailspin. The professional competition she brings is unnerving, his attraction to her is distracting, and his failure to entice her into his bed is exasperating. Then, just when Drew is on the cusp of having everything he wants, his overblown confidence threatens to ruin it all. Will he be able untangle his feelings of lust and tenderness, frustration and fulfillment? Will he rise to the most important challenge of his life? Can Drew Evans win at love? Tangled is not your mother's romance novel. It is an outrageous, passionate, witty narrative about a man who knows a lot about women...just not as much as he thinks he knows. As he tells his story, Drew learns the one thing in life he never wanted is the only thing he can't live without.",
