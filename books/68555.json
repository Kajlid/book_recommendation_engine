  "title": "The Mage's Tomb",
  "description": "At the bottom of a crater, surrounded by steep cliffs, Edwin Hubbard was born in the lonely, isolated village of Chardwick, a place where outsiders aren't welcome and any mention of the supernatural is forbidden--and feared. Though Edwin may not stand out as the best looking or most charming fifteen-year-old boy in Chardwick, he has an unexplainable way of drawing unwanted attention to himself. Edwin would face dire consequences were anyone to discover that he has befriended a strange creature made of black smoke, or that he harbors dark secrets of sorcery. But Edwin isn't the only one with secrets. His best friend, Walt, has a few that will change the life of every person in the mysterious village of Chardwick. Walt is the key to unlocking Edwin's own great destiny... if Edwin can survive the encounter.",
