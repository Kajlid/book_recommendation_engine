  "description": "Amber McKenzie considers herself a bland, normal student until she feels the touch of something cold and invisible. Scant hours pass before she's attacked by her best friend. She returns home to find her family slaughtered, forcing her to rely on the dubious protection of a D&D \"mage\" and a woman who may, or may not be a vampire. Is the threat real, or is Amber just \"touched in the head\"?",
