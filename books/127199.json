That new life, however, meant enrolling at the dark haven known as Demon Reform Academy.Being his daughter painted a target on my back, one that invited hostility and intrigue.Five demons pushed their way into my life, each with a cryptic agenda—to break me or heal me.A chaos demon created havoc, determined to make me quit.A shadow demon craved my pain.A fear demon desired my terror.A vengeance demon sought to annihilate my tormentors.And a dream demon summoned me into his dreamscape every night.I was here to work on myself, but a whirlwind of rumors, dark magic, and a secret society threatened to plunge the academy into deeper turmoil—and me along with it.",
