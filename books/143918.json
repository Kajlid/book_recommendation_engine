The boat basin was deserted and cluttered with debris. Their neighbors in the swank bay community hadn't bothered to welcome them home.Now Connie stood at the big living room window starting, shocked, at a machine-gun platoon of young soldiers digging foxholes in her front lawn.She had no way of knowing that she was one of only 452 adult female survivors in the area or that her body was in danger of being violated by thousands of sex-starved men . .",
