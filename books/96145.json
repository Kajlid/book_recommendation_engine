  "description": "The story takes you back a few months before Scornfully Yours in Carter’s POV. Carter Mason was the playboy soccer stud in their campus. Coming from wealth and good genes, he was used to getting everything he wanted. At a young age, he witnessed how love can become your worst enemy. It was a man’s downfall, an irrevocable poison that will forever haunt you, until you’re out of fight and gasping for your last breath. Lust at first glance. That’s what Carter instantly thought when his eyes landed on Emma Anderson for the very first time. She was gorgeous woman who wore her sexiness and naïveté with confidence. Both wanted to enjoy each other without the complications of love and all the drama it came with. The one thing they both avoided unexpectedly sprouted, causing a rift between them.",
