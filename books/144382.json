But my strongest challenge ever is a maiden named Sarah Banks...Ah, those lips, those eyes! Any normal man would gladly surrender heart and soul to her charms. But I am not a normal man. My father's wild outlaw blood surges through me, nearly boiling over with a single glimpse of Sarah's curving body. I am drawn to the girl, yet I cannot trust my own dark nature. Oh, the sweet torment of my double bind!Now all I can do is swear to protect her from my other sideâ€”even if it means giving up my one chance at bliss...Steadfastly yours,Colin, Earl of Haverwood",
