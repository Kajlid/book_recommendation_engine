  "title": "Immodest Proposals: The Complete Science Fiction of William Tenn, Volume 1",
  "description": "Immodest Proposals contains the majority of William Tenn's short science fiction. It includes such classic stories as \"Child's Play,\" \"Time in Advance,\" \"Down Among the Dead Men,\" and \"On Venus, Have We Got a Rabbi.\"The next volume on the series, Here Comes Civilization, will contain the remainder of his short science fiction, the novel Of Men and Monsters, and the short novel A Lamp for Medusa.Tenn has long been considered one of the major satirists in the field. The Science Fiction Encyclopedia calls him \"one of the genre's very few genuinely comic, genuinely incisive writers of short fiction.\" Theodore Sturgeon had the following to say:\"It would be too wide a generalization to say that every SF satire, every SF comedy and every attempt at witty and biting criticism found in the field is a poor and usually cheap imitation of what this man has been doing since the '40s. [But] his incredibly involved and complex mind can at times produce constructive comment so pointed and astute that the fortunate recipient is permanently improved by it.\"",
