  "description": "Fire dragon Orion Garrison is rich, eligible, and hot in more ways than one, but that hasn’t been enough to find him a true life mate. And even his billions won’t keep shifter matchmakers The Mating Game from showing him the door when the he arrogantly demands they find him a woman to bear his dragonlings. Cadence Bergmann has always known the chilling truth – if her ice dragon half starts to show, she’ll be married off to someone from her long-estranged clan, even if she can’t shift, can’t fly, and her icy breath is only good for chilling margaritas. When fire meets ice, things get steamy, despite interfering in-laws, a bitter ex, and a clan rivalry stretching back centuries. But when their future young are threatened, will Cadence be able to keep her cool and access her inner dragoness?",
