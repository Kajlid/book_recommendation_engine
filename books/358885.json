  "title": "The Missing Girl",
  "description": "This is the story of five sisters—Beauty, Mim, Stevie, Fancy, and Autumn—and the man who watches men. He could be any ordinary man . . . but he's not. Unaware of his scrutiny and his increasingly forbidden thoughts about them, the sisters go on with their ordinary lives—planning, arguing, laughing, and crying—as if nothing bad could ever breach the security of their family. In alternating points of view, Norma Fox Mazer manages to interweave the lives of predator and prey in this unforgettable psychological thriller.",
