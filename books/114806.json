  "description": "Dead Shambles (Dead and Still Singing)First of my 'Amateur Vile-Horrors' Trilogy of stage-plays.'Dead Shambles' is about seven survivors of a zombie apocalypse who have retreated to their local police station in the hopes of finding safety. However, once behind safe firm walls they realize that there is more to fear in post apocalyptic Britain then the hoards of ‘undead’ that are waiting for them outside. Who are the real monsters in this tale? And are they on the inside or the outside?This play is written for a large non-professional cast and as such I will not be seeking royalties for non-profit making amateur productions. Please see the previous copyright section at the beginning of this book for more details. I have tried to create an adaptable cast of characters, with a script that gives as much flexibility as possible for casting within existing drama groups.Over all ‘Dead Shambles’ is designed to give actors, musicians, dancers, and technicians an opportunity to experiment, explore and above all, have fun. It is also a great opportunity to play a zombie!I have provided song lyrics, but it is up to your production to adapt the play to a specific music style. Is your production a 'big number' style musical, a Rock Opera, a jazz fest, or a rap and street-dance bonanza. Maybe you prefer to perform the lyrics as poetry instead, or even omit the songs altogether. Either way, you may adapt the lyrics to reflect your chosen style and the music you have chosen to accompany each number.I have also tried to pitch the use of ‘bad’ language in this play to be reasonably acceptable to audiences and players who are aged fifteen or older. Please feel free to tone language and content up or down according to the needs of your production.",
