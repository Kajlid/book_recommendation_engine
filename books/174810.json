  "description": "She was as untrustworthy as she was voluptuous.Had I―Michael of Finlandia―but known this, I would never have saved the mysterious beauty with eyes of different colors from the lust of the Moslem pirates. Nor would I ever have married her. But at first I did not know. And after we became slaves of Suleiman the Magnificent, it took all my quick wits just to keep us alive. All my quick wits, and my brother's skill with guns, and Giulia's gift of prophecy. So we rose to wealth and power. And then, fascinated by her magnetic eyes and her loving ways, I set out to follow the Crescent, leaving her behind to intrigue in the sultan's harem. And to bring about my undoing.",
