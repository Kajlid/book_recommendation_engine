  "description": "Dear Author,Please tell me more about these 3 hotties. All I know is that one is a werewolf, one is a vampire, and even though they should be sworn enemies, there is a human in the middle that brings them together. What brought them all together? Can the love they have for the human over come their hatred for each other?Photo Description: Three naked men in an intensely sexual moment: in the middle of the trio, a dark-haired man kneels up against a blue-covered bed, elbows braced, hands touching the erection of the second slender man kneeling at his face. His eyes are closed, expression tight, as the third crew-cut man arches closely over his back, penetrating him from behind.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Hot Summer Days\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.Read the story here or find it in Don't Read in the Closet, Volume 3.__________Genre: paranormal, ménageTags: gay m/m, ménage, threesome, werewolves, vampires, HFNWarnings: mild violence, vampire feeding (blood)Word Count: 11,118",
