  "description": "HalimaI’m wrenched from a five thousand year sleep into a new world. It was supposed to be uninhabited. Humans were supposed to have died off. Those of us preserved in the stasis tanks were supposed to rebuild.But there were survivors.And now those survivors have formed factions. The leading tribes enslave those weaker and language keeps them apart.Funny, because in my past life I was the interpreter and I intend to bridge the gaps so that when we escape, we do it together. But I have to get past the warlord watching me first.Ero Communication between tribes is unheard of. Forbidden. A death sentence. I should kill the little slave that dares defy this edict.But the signs suggest something unthinkable. That this little creature is mine.I need to find a way to get rid of her before she dismantles everything, escapes, liberates slaves, brings warring tribes to my doorstep…but to do that, I’ll have rid myself of this weight she hung around my throat like the loop end of a noose.Want. She makes me want her.Taken by the Pikosa Warlord is a full length (100k word) barbarian warlord romance that takes place on the war and climate-ravaged Earth that the satellite humans now living in Voraxia and Sasor left behind. It is a complete standalone with a smart tenacious heroine, the violent warlord unsure what to do with her and a happily ever after.",
