  "description": "What you’re about to witness comes from a dark place. It’s taken a lot of planning, but you should know that every single thing I’m about to do is deserved. More than deserved, it’s owed, tenfold. Nothing I could do to these people will ever be enough to get even.  ***  Charlotte McLintock has a new identity and a new look as Raven Deighton. She needs it so that she can infiltrate the elite private school that’s covering up her twin’s death. They claimed it was suicide, but she knows better.  Her plan’s been almost two years in the making. What started off as a desire to know the truth has turned into a burning compulsion for vengeance. However, she soon finds that life at Westchester Preparatory Academy’s not what she expected and that everyone’s hiding secrets - even the four hot guys she’s rapidly falling for.  Her one mission is to uncover the truth about what happened to Lizzie so that she can make everyone involved pay, and she’s not about to let anyone or anything - even her own torturous heart- stop her from burning them all to the ground.  *** Vengeance is a contemporary New Adult reverse harem bully romance, with dark themes and a twist. It works as a savage standalone piece (if you love a cliffhanger) but will actually form part of a trilogy with closure at the end of the series. ***  ***WARNING*** This book carries an 18+ warning. Vengeance is a medium to fast burn dark romance. It contains hot guys, foul language and sexual scenes, including some graphic physical bullying, and potential suicide, depression and sexual assault triggers. I would love for you to read this book, but please be aware that it comes with a warning.",
