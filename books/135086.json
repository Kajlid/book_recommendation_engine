  "description": "Supernatural circus performer Leathan doesn't let herself get close to anyone. It's too painful when her curse literally rips those connections out of her heart. That's why she does her best to weed out the friendship sprouting between her and Renni, the gregarious star of the show.When Renni is murdered, the ringmaster tasks Leathan with catching his killer. But all signs indicate the culprit is one of the Extravaganza's own, and the more she learns about her fellow troupers, the farther she feels from the truth—and the closer she is to forming fatal new attachments.A darkly fantastical mystery reminiscent of The Night Circus and Even Though I Knew the End, THE EXTRAVAGANZA ETERNIA will enchant and delight.\nPraise for The Extravaganza \n\"The Extravaganza Eternia is a mesmerising journey through a magical circus full of wondrous creatures with friendship and love as our final destination.\"—Eugenia Triantafyllou, author of The Giants of the Violet Sea\"A glittering tale of big top murder that will swing you breathlessly from the dark depths of loneliness and betrayal to the sparkling heights of hope and human perseverance. The circus is in town! Get excited. Osani’s work is not to be missed.\"— C.J. Lavigne, author of In Veritas",
