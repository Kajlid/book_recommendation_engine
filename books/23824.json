  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Amy lies in a coma. Moira, eleven years older, spends the evenings at her sister's bedside, telling the story of her own life--her secrets, her shameful actions, and her link to the accident that has brought Amy to this bed. In her second novel, Susan Fletcher probes the troubled bond between two sisters: how their lives are undone by the tumultuous forces of envy and loneliness and, in the end, how love emerges as the greatest force of all.",
