  "title": "How to Paint Landscapes",
  "description": "How to Paint Landscapes is a collection of poetry dealing with the issues of trauma, pain, hope, feminism, first love, and self-discovery. It also deals with the themes of poor mental health, specifically the struggle with OCD, the realities of belonging to the Greek culture, and the fear of being forever trapped within the confines of abuse. This poetry compilation is about escaping the seemingly inescapable, and never putting your brush down until you see freedom emerge upon your canvas.",
