  "description": "Europe's master of modern wordless horror returns with his third book. With T. Ott's Tales of Error , Ott directs a nod toward the classic horror formulas of EC Comics ( Tales from the Crypt, Shock SuspenStories, Weird Science ) and Rod Serling's Twilight Zone , with a decidedly contemporary spin. This collection contains six beautifully rendered and horrific stories. \"Honeymoon,\" the opening story, depicts the love and happiness of Doris and Dave, to the shock of their friends. A final postcard of the couple's honeymoon reveals the happy duo to be literally joined at the as Siamese twins. E.C. purists will surely appreciate Ott's skillful manipulation of images and text, seemingly directing readers in one narrative direction before leading to an unexpected but credible ending worthy of O. Henry. From the classic war story to unraveled romance, Ott puts his personal twist on several classic genres. Adding to his large European audience, particularly in France and Germany, Ott continues to build an American audience. His meticulous scratchboard style is unparalleled in its craftsmanship, provoking awe and admiration in the face of the repeated horrors portrayed; Ott is unequivocally one of the preeminent horror cartoonists being published today. 48 pages b/w illustrations.",
