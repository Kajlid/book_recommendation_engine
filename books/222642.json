  "description": "When I was young I was convinced celebrities could save me,\" Julie Klam admits in The Stars in Our Eyes, her funny and personal exploration of fame and celebrity. As she did for subjects as wide-ranging as dogs, mothers, and friendship, Klam brings her infectious curiosity and crackling wit to the topic of celebrity. As she says, \"I've always been enamored with celebrities,\" be they movie stars, baseball players, TV actors, and now Internet sensations. \"They are the us we want to be.\" Celebrities today have a global presence and can be, Klam writes, \"some girl on Instagram who does nude yoga and has 3.5 million followers, a thirteen-year-old 'viner, ' and a Korean rapper who posts his videos that are viewed millions of times.\"  In The Stars in Our Eyes, Klam examines this phenomenon. She delves deep into what makes someone a celebrity, explains why we care about celebrities more than ever, and uncovers the bargains they make with the public and the burdens they bear to sustain this status.",
