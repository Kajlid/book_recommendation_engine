Please see that entry instead https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2... \"Ms. Annalisa Crawford does a good job of drawing you in and then revealing the darker side of the story.\" ~ The Online Book Club “The Boathouse collects misfits. Strange solitary creatures that yearn for contact with the outside world, but not too much. They sit, glass in hand, either staring at the table in front of them, or at some distant point on the horizon.” … so says the narrator of Our Beautiful Child. And he’s been around long enough to know. People end up in this town almost by accident. Ella is running away from her nightmares, Sally is running away from the memories of previous boyfriends and Rona is running away from university. Each of them seeks sanctuary in the 18th century pub, The Boathouse; but in fact, that’s where their troubles begin. Ella finds love, a moment too late; Rona discovers a beautiful ability which needs refining before she gets hurt; and Sally meets the captivating Murray, who threatens to ruin everything. Three women. Three stories. One pub. Our Beautiful Child explores the defining moments that turn emptiness into eternity in this spine-tingling collection of literary ghost fiction stories. The Boathouse collects spirits and wanderers who must all come to face with their loneliness in these woven stories, filled with twists and turns until its stunning denouement.",
