Yet deep in the Caverns of Maht, Hukum, the sorceror-lord of cavern-dwelling Eathal, plots his Vengeance.Cedrin, a street-wise calvanni (knife-fighter), is summoned to the secret underground tunnels of the Brotherhood of the Night. There, Cedrin is forced to join in a rebellion against the rulers of his native Athria. Caught between the threat of death and his suspicions that all is not what it seems, he must try to keep his friends alive and escape.Ellen, daughter of the assassinated Athrian Sarlord, is named as heir before his death. She struggles to assert herself as the new ruler, little suspecting the civil war that will be unleashed on Athria within days.Ellen's father warned her never to reveal her hidden powers of Sorcery, but as Hukum's minions close in, it seems she has little choice.",
