  "description": "Rose Zarelli has big plans for sophomore year--everything is going to be different. This year, she's going to be the talented singer with the killer voice, the fabulous girl with the fashionista best friend, the brainiac who refuses to let Jamie Forta jerk her around......but if she's not careful, she's also going to be the sister who misses the signals, the daughter who can only think about her own pain, the \"good girl\" who finds herself in mid-scandal againÂ (because no good deed goes unpunished) and possibly worst of all, the almost-girlfriend...The motto for sophomore year? When all else fails, stop looking for love and go find yourself.",
