  "description": "This antiquarian book contains Alexandre Dumas’s historical novel \"Ten Years Later\". Serialised between 1847 and 1850, this is the second instalment of the final episode in the d’Artagnan Romances. Set between 1660 and 1667, it chronicles Louis XIV’s metamorphosis from juvenile monarch to Sun King. A veritably thrilling romantic romp in seventeenth century France, “Ten Years Later” constitutes a must-read for fans of Dumas’s seminal work, and would make for a worthy addition to any collection. Alexandre Dumas (1802–1870) was a famous French writer. He is best remembered for his exciting romantic sagas, including \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"The Count of Monte Cristo\". Despite making a great deal of money from his writing, Dumas was almost perpetually penniless thanks to his decidedly extravagant lifestyle. His novels have been translated into nearly a hundred different languages, and have inspired over 200 motion pictures. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. We are republishing this antiquarian book in an affordable, modern, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author.",
