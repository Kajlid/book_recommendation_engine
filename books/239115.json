She has no idea she’s an heiress with a target on her back and boys are the least of her worries.Arie thinks his college internship will be easy: pose as a high school senior and protect Emma. He never expected to fall for her.Sparks ignite, but danger is near.

You don't want to miss this sweet romance.” - Victorine E. Lieske, NYT's bestselling author.",
