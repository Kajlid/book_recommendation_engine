  "description": "Kajitsu has never known a proper family. Her dad's a deadbeat and her mom changes husbands like most people change socks. Kaijitsu isn't alone in her dysfunction - Taro and Natsu, the hottie stepbrothers she hasn't seen in seven years, are also refugees from negligent parents. Abandoned by everyone but each other, the three not-quite-siblings make one last attempt at building a family. It's hard enough getting along in a home with rampant hormones and no adults, but when an unexpected bundle of joy is dropped in their laps, can they learn to be parents, too? From brand-new publisher Go! Comi, an imprint of Go! Media Entertainment.",
