  "description": "When a disgruntled adjunct faculty teacher decides to get revenge on the head of her department, she begins a dark (and darkly comic) journey into the cracks between modern society and the secret depravity that lies underneath. She has to navigate the demons of technology, creativity, and Hell itself, but soon she must face the deepest, darkest horror of them all: her own personal failures.\"Polly Schattel's 8:59:29 is an expertly rendered fable of moral conflict. Threaded into the high-velocity plot is a playful but exacting study of obsolete forces leaving residue on the contemporary world. It's a tale of demons and hexes, of class and education, and of technology's pernicious expansion as a governing social force. Wicked, sardonic, intelligent horror fiction.\" -Mike Thorn, author of Peel Back and See",
