  "description": "The Perfect Cover Claire Thompson Ryan doesn't know what he's getting himself into when he signs on for the season at a gay resort on a private Caribbean island. Eager for what he sees as an easy job in paradise, Ryan fails to mention he's straight. Convinced he can handle any sexual overtures with a smile and a shrug, he's unprepared for the onslaught of men eager to get their hands on the new guy. With his long blond hair, green eyes and a body hot enough to make grown men cry, Ryan must sidestep the constant attention from guests and staff alike while trying to maintain his front. Sean, a year-round employee, dreads peak season when hot young studs arrive to invade his space, focused on casual sex or finding a sugar daddy. When Ryan is assigned to his bungalow, Sean expects more of the same. Yet when they meet, he becomes an instant believer in love at first sight. He promises himself to win Ryan's heart. It never occurs to him the odds are absurdly stacked against him.",
