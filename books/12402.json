  "description": "As soon as Rose saw the single purple converse left on her porch she knew that her friend was gone. The question that bothered her was not so much why the shoe was left for her, but who had the other shoe? Was it Patrick, who claimed he didn't love Shade anymore? Was it Eli who was supposed to be Rose's best-friend, but was secretly in love with Shade? Or was it someone Rose didn't even know, a stranger? And then Rose meets a stranger of her own, Dysan who is so many of the things Shade was, an artist, a musician, and a slight bit wild. Will Rose let what happened to Shade keep her from falling for Dysan?",
