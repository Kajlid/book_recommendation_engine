  "description": "--- This title is not currently available ---Heaven or hell? Dream or nightmare? Where passion is concerned, the veils are thin.  As her Wytchfae powers intensify and nightmares invade waking reality, Neva Jaxony seeks answers in her shadowy past. Then a mysterious stranger enters the picture, and she falls hard. Is he the man of her dreams or part of the darkness that threatens to consume her?  Rugged warrior Bane Heughar has orders to prove Neva is not malevolent-- or kill her before she can turn demon. He never expected to find her so bewitching, or so damn desirable. He has until the Solstice Moon to carry out his mission. All he really wants to do is take Neva in his arms, kiss her senseless, and for the two of them to disappear off the radar. But when the Underworld is involved, no one can hide.",
