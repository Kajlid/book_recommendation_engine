  "title": "Hidden Evil",
  "description": "A sadistic killer is on the loose in the United States. The only items linking the killings are the lack of physical evidence left behind. Massive amounts of information are entered into the crime databases in each state every day, but without some kind of pattern, they are never linked to those happening in other states. Serial killers are smart and learn how to avoid capture. The question is, can this one outwit the nation's foremost expert that is finally assigned to the case? Sam Adams is the Special Agent in charge of an elite FBI unit that tracks serial killers. It took a congressional aide, who is the son of one of the victims and the help of a DC Metro detective, to convince the FBI that the cases were related. The three of them set off on a course to track this animal down and bring him to justice.",
