The priest Luther rallies an army of Karak, his aims unclear. Further north, Cyric continues to proclaim himself a god, and his followers are many. Caught between two enemies, Darius and Jerico must stand together to prevent the destruction of everything they hold dear.And the key to their victory might be someone sworn to kill them both.THE BROKEN PIECES by David DalglishEven the strongest can break before a furious god.",
