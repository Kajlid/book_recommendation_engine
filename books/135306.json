  "description": "Jack in a Box is the sublimely witty and assured fictional debut of an ex racing greyhound called Jack who strives for a better hand in life than the one he has been dealt. Jack's story is often funny but also refreshingly candid. By the time he was two years old he had run in hundreds of races but was considered 'two slow' by the industry. Unbeknown to Jack he escaped having a bullet in his head but was instead thrown from a van into a ditch on a busy road near Canterbury in Kent after having 'his identity' ripped from his ear with a pair of pliers. He was one of the 'lucky' ones that ended up in a rehoming centre where he was loved and cared for until an owner could be found for him.Jack's story which starts in Canterbury ought to be repulsive to anyone who has an ounce of decency in their souls, but it turns out to be a hugely enjoyable.On a more serious note, the sheer scale of the cruelty within the Greyhound racing industry is immense and when you place a bet on a race you are in effect saying that you don't mind about what is happening to these loving, trusting dogs. Jack included.I hope this story isn't one that you read and then forget about as although it is fiction it is based on fact. And it is what is happening right now in one of the most cruel industries around today. Please have the courage to read it. This book should strike a chord with many of us whose voice never gets heard.",
