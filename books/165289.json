  "description": "“The Inevitable” is a melange of fictional pieces of prose that explore the plethora of human emotions in the face of challenging situations. Celebrating the humane angle, the stories alternate between noir and drama, etching deep creases of the darker side of human emotions while painting vibrant shades of love, poignancy and irony all the same. Interspersed with thought-provoking poetry, each story is introduced with a poetic prelude that gives the reader an insight into all that’s coming next.",
