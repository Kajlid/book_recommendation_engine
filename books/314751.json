  "description": "From the Introduction: \"In 1970, Bruce sustained a rather severe injury to his back. His doctors ordered him to discontinue the practice of martial arts and to remain in bed to allow his back heal. This was probably the most trying and dispiriting time in Bruce's life. He stayed in bed, virtually flat on his back for six months, but he couldn't keep his mind from working - the result of which is this book.\" Linda Lee \"Jeet Kune Do, you see, has no definite lines or boundaries - only those you make yourself.\" Gilbert L Johnson",
