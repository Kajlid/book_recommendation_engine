  "title": "The Cave",
  "description": "In the literary novel The Cave, friends are trapped beneath Jerusalem following a massive explosion that destroys the historic Old City. Isolated from the outside world, the group contemplates suffering, death, and their fate under competing forces of faith, power, and survival, as they search for a way out in near absolute darkness. From the lively streets of Ben Yehuda to Zedekiah's Cave, through a labyrinth of ancient tunnels beneath the Old City to the Western Wall, people of conflicting ethnic and religious backgrounds are forced to confront their differences and similarities to survive. The Cave is timely with subthemes of current Judeo-Islamic-Christian relations - most notably the volatile Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is reflective of the ever-present and competing forces of survival, faith, and power. Inside the cave, the group differs on their perspectives of God, Jerusalem's destruction, and the best path forward as they race against time and growing conflict.The Cave confronts what many today are thinking but reluctant to discuss about traditional religious thought and the root cause of conflict, through a story of real, current, and unfortunate possibility. The Cave will resonate where inevitable and rising consensus challenge traditional religious explanation. The cave itself serves as a metaphor for human thought, and the perspectives advanced or restricted by traditional religious dogma. These topics are explored from both traditional and non-traditional viewpoints.In the end, The Cave questions our current human trajectory led by traditional religious thought and offers a simple and universal path forward for what ultimately matters - survival of the human race.",
