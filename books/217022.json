  "description": "Laney has become obsessed with a website where people confess sex stories. She wants a story of her own to tell, but has no prospects for the type of encounter she needs. Her friend suggests Brad, a nerdy guy who went to their high school. She says he’s changed over the years and is now exactly the sort of guy Laney wants. While she doesn’t believe that fat, awkward Brad will be the answer, she agrees to go see for herself. Brad has spent the years since graduation at work and in the gym. His frustration at being unattractive to the girls from his school led him to an obsession with exercise, and he sculpted his body into a work of art as a result. When Laney, the number one object of his teenage sexual frustrations, wanders into his empty gym looking every inch the hot bitch she was in school and finally interested in him, Brad is not sure whether to be angry or excited. When she makes her intentions clear, he discovers he can be both. Laney is looking for a story to tell, and boy does Brad give it to her. Right there on the gym floor. THIS STORY IS INTENDED STRICTLY FOR ADULTS. Meaning be 18 if you want to read it. It contains potentially controversial adult themes and all the crude language one would expect to describe them in glorious detail. 6600+ words.",
