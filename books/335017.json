  "title": "Dominatrix: The Making of Mistress Chloe",
  "description": "For over 15 years, Mistress Chloe has been Queen of London's fetish scene. As a professional dominatrix, she has seen it all - famous footballers, pop stars and politicians have sought out her services, and no sexual deviation surprises her. Yet Chloe was a shy adolescent, who only found her vocation when her then-boyfriend took her to a fetish party in 1985. Since then, she became submerged in an underworld that most of us don't even know exists and has risen to the top of her profession. Witty, intelligent and outrageous, Mistress Chloe's memoirs are an eye-opening insight into what really goes on in a dominatrix's dungeon. If you've ever wondered how to keep mind and soul togther when there's a cross-dressing dwarf in your living room, this book is for you.",
