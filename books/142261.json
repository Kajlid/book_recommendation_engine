Her hand trembled in mine as she looked at me with fearful eyes. My entire world spun on its axis.Nina...It was a mismatch made in heaven: innocent girl from the boonies moves in with a tattooed, pierced, badboy.I came up with a bet, a plan to tutor her in math and coach her through her phobias. What I wasn't betting on was becoming addicted to her.But I was living a double life on weekends, and once she found out about it, she'd be gone.I had to protect myself and that meant one thing: I couldn't fall in love.In Jake Understood, pivotal scenes from Jake Undone are retold from Jake's point of view combined with ALL-NEW material from both the past and present time after Jake Undone left off.
