  "description": "From the Wall Street Journal bestselling author of 44 Chapters About 4 Men (inspiration for the Netflix original series Sex/Life) comes an immersive romantic suspense trilogy with a dark, dystopian twist.I knew my fate the moment I surrendered. I’d seen the public executions on TV. No jury. No bail. Just a hole in the ground and a bullet between the eyes, broadcast live in high-definition. There are worse ways to die, I told myself. I was doing the right thing, exchanging my life for Rain’s. Survival wasn’t everything. But the moment I heard those steel bars close behind me, I remembered who the f*ck I am. A good man would sacrifice himself for his woman. I’m gonna survive for mine.Or die trying. * Previously published under the title Dying for Rain. ** A comprehensive CW is available on the author’s website.",
