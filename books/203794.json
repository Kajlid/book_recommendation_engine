  "description": "Eli St. John is a very bitter man. His wife, the only woman he ever loved, was murdered five years ago. The image of her death haunts him nightly. To bury his consuming grief, he vows to never get emotionally involved with a woman again and throws himself into his work as the financial manager of his family’s business. After a family meeting at his home where Eli learns he has an illegitimate older half-brother, he becomes angry, leaving his home in a rage. As he walks along a section of beach, he finds a severely injured woman washed ashore. She has no memory of who she is or what happened to her. Recognizing her accent as English, Eli gives her the name of London. “London” is really Reanna Hollingsworth who traveled to the Caribbean in search of her missing fiancé. Her ship is attacked and the last image she sees is of her beloved fiancé as a pirate. When she awakens—her memory gone, she finds herself in the home of a brooding and handsome stranger. As she recovers from her injuries, she finds herself attracted to the ill-tempered man, but fate has a way of intervening. Revengeful pirates and abduction place a seed of doubt into Eli’s mind as to Reanna’s true intentions and her feelings towards him. Can he overcome her apparent deception, accept her into his life and allow her to become the keeper of his dreams?",
