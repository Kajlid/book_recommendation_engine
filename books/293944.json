  "title": "In the Shadow of Rome",
  "description": "Roman soldiers, based on the Antonine Wall, Rome’s most northerly frontier in Britain in the 2nd century CE, live, work, and fight beside native Britons who have settled in the shadow of the wall, in the village known as Clotagenium (Old Kilpatrick) on the banks of the River Clwyd (Clyde). Life is dangerous, and conflicts arise between the soldiers and raiding Caledonii from north of the wall. Alongside the raids and battles, a personal conflict between Sigdan, an ex-sea-wolf, now a Roman auxiliary, and a dangerously incompetent officer, leads, inevitably, to a final– very Roman, reckoning in the arena.",
