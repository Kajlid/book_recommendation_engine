  "description": "Money ~ power ~ fame  Kelsey  Growing up in the arms of one of the wealthiest families in America, I lived a champagne lifestyle and never wanted for anything.  That life came with stipulations… 1. Marry the man I don’t love. 2. Make my parents proud.   Wrong.  I left my Manolos and fancy apartment behind and fled that life to find out who I really was.  Someone unexpected bulldozed my life.  Riley Jackson  He was the man everyone, including me, wanted, but his future was one I wasn’t sure I wanted to thrust myself back into. And when he chose a career over the family business, his family supported him instead of pushing him away.  My past collided with my future. I didn’t see it coming. If I had, I would’ve ran far, far away.  Now I’m stuck in the same position I started in two years ago, except this time, it’s not my decision to make.  Loyalty to your family? Loyalty to your own happiness?  Which would you choose?",
