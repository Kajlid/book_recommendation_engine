Still others are emotional prisoners.\" In best selling Lies Women Believe, Nancy exposes those areas of deception most commonly believed by Christian womenâ€”lies about God, sin, priorities, marriage and family, emotions, and more. She then sheds light on how we can be delivered from bondage and set free to walk in God's grace, forgiveness, and abundant life.
