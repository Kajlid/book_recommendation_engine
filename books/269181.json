From wizards to weathermen, many know the powers of the four elements-natural forces that can direct the fates, change destiny, and unite lovers in the most unexpected ways. Now, those magical elements-air, fire, water, and earth-come together in perfect balance, and a perfectly unique romance anthology, from four charmed authors. In Air find romance in a breathless retelling of the Cinderella fable from award-winning Sharon Shinn, \"an amazing writing talent\"(Best Reviews). In Fire blazes adventure in a parallel dimension of werewolves and love-slaves from USA Today bestselling Rebecca York, \"a true master\" (Rave Reviews). In Water resides fantasy and a remarkable universe of magic, demons, and dangerous passion from \"thoroughly original\" (Starburst) award-winner Carol Berg. And in Earth discover the ultimate in profound pleasure from Jean Johnson, \"a fresh new voice in fantasy romance\" (Robin D. Owens).",
