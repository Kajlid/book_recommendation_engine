  "title": "Inside Nudging: Navigating Behavioral Science Applications",
  "description": "/* Inside Nudging: This Excerpts version has been discontinued */Inside Nudging is a book written primarily for management professionals and those interested in implementing behavioral science (which includes behavioral economics and finance) in business settings. Situations include the incubation of innovation centers, behavioral science overlay capabilities, or advancement of existing organizations. The book will introduce the Behavioral GRITâ„¢ framework and cover key takeaways in leading an organization that implements behavioral science. I will also address specific cases related to developing programs and applications, and viewpoints from various vantage points, including program leaders, researchers, executives, and academics.What makes the special edition of Inside Nudging: The Excerpts unique is that it is a book project in the business development phase. Until the entire book is fully released, excerpts will be published for free by certain publishers while the book is live in development. Along this journey, I invite people to contact me with suggestions for the book or other business development inquiries.The application of behavioral science is in the early adoption phase. Many companies will benefit if they take time to develop the right catalyst codes to unlock the opportunities. I hope Inside Nudging helps you with your journey.Stephen Shu",
