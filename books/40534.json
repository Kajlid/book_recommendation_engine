  "title": "Groom Lake",
  "description": "Journey Below Area 51While the glory days of the government's operating location at Groom Lake are past, Bryan O paints a vivid picture of the installation's rise and relevance in the evolution of fringe sciences, and will stir debate with his depiction of a new, heavily shrouded spaceport in the Rockies. Groom Lake is not just a novel; the narrative is a briefing on America's black budget programs and practices. The story gives a historical account of shadow government activities, methods and reasoning, intertwined with a fast-paced plot where intelligence agents guard their fringe programs from inquisitive civilians, China's Ministry of State Security and a congressional task force investigating black budget spending. Bryan leaves readers wondering if the book is truly fiction, or if he is possibly a ghostwriter for the government in a top secret program called Project Meshing that is intended to raise public consciousness about certain fringe sciences.",
