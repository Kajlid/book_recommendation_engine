  "description": "Cole Turner’s ex-wife is getting remarried. No amount of alcohol can drown that out, but taking home the hot brunette at the bar is a good enough distraction. That’s all Paige is meant to be—a distraction.Paige Minor is too busy studying for her law degree and getting over a bad breakup to care about finding another boyfriend. All she wants is one night of careless fun with a complete stranger. Cole seems like the perfect candidate. When Cole goes to pick up his son from his ex’s perfect house, with her perfect fiancé, and perfect new life, the last person he expects to see is Paige. She definitely shouldn’t be the one opening the door. As he stares at the person who was in his bed less than twenty-four hours earlier, a single thought occurs to him: I just slept with my ex’s new stepdaughter.**********One Night with Hemsworth is the first book in a series, but can be read as a standalone. No cliffhanger!",
