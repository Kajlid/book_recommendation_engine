  "description": "Far from the coal smoke and rain of his queen’s capital of Saxony, Lord Enforcer Jarvis has fallen. His only friend is Telos, the snow leopard shifter he saved from certain death, at risk of his own life. And they are surrounded by the Night Children that Lord Jarvis is sworn to fight, vampires, werewolves, shifters, genies, and witches. Desperate, Telos begs the vampire queen for Jarvis’s life.There is more at stake than one man’s life. In Jarvis’s blood run secrets, about to be exposed. There is a new enemy. The world of progress and the gods of the past are about to meet.For Telos, though, the world is simple. He craves survival for the man who rescued him. Even if he can find clemency from the vampire queen for the Saxony lord, he may still not be able to save the man he has come to love, from the most dangerous enemy of all, Jarvis’s own soul. Meanwhile, Telos himself is not whole. His mind, cruelly tortured by a warmongering warlock, is a walking Pandora’s Box of terror. Yet Telos is still determined to risk it all.For Jarvis, it is a choice, between his loyalty as a lord enforcer of the proud Saxony empire, or a daring and uncertain future on the wrong side of his code of honor. And more than his life, or even Telos’s life may depend on the decision of his heart.",
