  "title": "Drawing the Dragon",
  "description": "Drawing the Dragon is a genre-fusion tale of what happens after humans leave Earth â€“ only scratching the star-strewn surface of what they discover about the universe and themselves. A story about the power of intention, galvanized by compelling villains and passionately charged heroes. Both sides learn that hate consumes reason, love can cross any distance, and reality is what you make it.",
