Let the games begin.Tomboy Miss Araminta Ellsworth and her dearest friend, Aggie, were the most backward graduates Mrs. Turcotte’s Seminary for Young Ladies ever produced, more interested in batting and bowling than sewing and simpering.

If Minta is going to keep her friend’s person and fortune out of Taplin’s dangerous hands, she’ll need to think of something—fast.Mr. Nicholas Carlisle has always lived in his stepbrother, Francis’s shadow: at school, at university, and in his family’s prospects. So when Miss Ellsworth approaches him for aid, she finds a willing accomplice. Nicholas fashions a new personality for her, transforming her into Francis’s ideal. To this, he adds a counterfeit courtship, to stir his brother’s competitive side.Their scheme succeeds.Wildly.But the victory might cost them the only prize worth winning—their own chance at love.From the author of the beloved Hapgoods of Bramleigh series called \"sparkling\" and \"swoon-worthy,\" Minta in Spite of Herself is a clean Regency romance and the third book of The Ellsworth Assortment.",
