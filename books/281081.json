  "description": "At the prime age of twenty-one, I had only kissed one man—that was seven years ago—another life, a life full of pain and sorrows. One I tried to forget. I turned my back on my birthright despite my parent’s last wishes. Now, I must return to my childhood home, but I am afraid to face the horrors long forgotten. My past was behind me. However, I also wonder if my future awaits me—the barbaric man who kissed me—one who left his imprint in my soul from just one kiss.
