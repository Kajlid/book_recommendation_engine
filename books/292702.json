  "description": "Kara found out the hard way. Just because she did the right thing didnâ€™t mean a god would give his blessing. Instead, it was the opposite when honoring agreements that grate against a god's wishes.  Now, she is on the run from Odin and anyone following his commands, and she finds herself safe in the wastelands with the wild dragons, or so she thinks. Unless she can find a way to be accepted back into Valkyrie school and not be imprisoned, her future is in peril.  ~  Valkyrie Academy Dragon Alliance Series Marked (Prequel-Newsletter Exclusive) Chosen Vanished Scorned Inflicted Empowered  ~ \"Fun world-building, a flight to the dragon wastelands, and a defying of gods makes Scorned a rollicking read. In this installment, you'll learn more about dragons, visit the wasteland, and discover just how spunky Kara is as she tries to avoid becoming a dragon's lunch.\" Vanessa L., Proofreader, Red Adept Editing",
