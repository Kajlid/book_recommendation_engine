She’s beautiful and talented, and the master of her destiny… until two men shake her very foundation with their protestations of love. Ian McAllister is as handsome and almost as powerful as Rusty, but can’t be trusted. She leaves him behind but their whirlwind romance changes her life forever. Alex Cameron, a one-time lover who finds her again many years later, offers Rusty a very different type of love, one that helps to heal her heart. But their world is magical and with Rusty’s great power comes even greater threats to those she loves.
