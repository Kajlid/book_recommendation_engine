  "description": "Dr. Ray Carmichael is a wealthy African-American doctor and political activist running for office on the platform that the brutality and corruption of the local police force is out of control. Nick Sorenson is a white cop who grew up poor and almost lost his life in gangs and crime before turning his life around by joining the police force. When Ray's brother is beaten by a couple of police officers after a traffic stop, Nick is the Internal Affairs detective put in charge of investigating the incident. Dr. Carmichael's obvious distrust of the police force rubs Nick the wrong way, and the man becomes a pain in his neck. Too bad, because neither of them can deny their attraction to each other. Ray has Nick removed from the case when he decides he'd rather date the man than fight with him. In spite of their differences, they begin an affair and grow closer. Until an explosive incident at a family gathering puts nagging doubts in Nick's head--he's not sure if they can overcome the differences that separate them. When Nick is about to lose everything important to him, will he realize his budding relationship with Ray is worth trying to see the other side?  Gay / Contemporary / Interracial / Multicultural",
