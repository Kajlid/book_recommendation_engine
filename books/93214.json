  "description": "Book Three in the Mastered series. He can't say he wasn't warned... From the moment he's cautioned to avoid the submissive who snares his attention, Dom Michael Dayton is intrigued. With her tight dress, flowing hair and honest dialogue, what could be more perfect than a few hours together? Sydney Wallace fears only one thing-being tied down. She lives for adventure and fun, including the occasional BDSM party. By always scening with different Doms, she avoids emotional entanglements that might complicate her life. A man who owns a ranch and has roots deep into the soil is definitely not the kind of Dom she wants to play with. Sydney has never met anyone as complex as Master Michael Dayton. From the moment he issues his first command, she knows he's different. He watches her reactions, sees what she wants, and unselfishly gives her what she needs. Getting involved with a man like him would be the biggest risk of her life, crossing over all of lines she's drawn to protect her way of life. After the first night together, Michael realises he should have heeded the warning. But it may already be too late...",
