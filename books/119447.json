  "description": "The young son of a Russian oligarch is kidnapped. His father will pay anything, do anything, stop at nothing to get him back. Up to now, everything he has tried has failed. He needs the one man with the know-how, the means and the guts to complete the mission: ex-SAS trouble-shooter Nick Stone...But for Nick, the mission will take him to the poorest and most violent country on the planet, Somalia - a lawless land, ripped apart by civil war and famine, fought over by drug-fuelled, gun-crazy clan fighters. They want to make the world to sit up and take notice - any way they can...Reviews:“Sometimes only the rollercoaster ride of an action-packed thriller hits the spot. No one delivers them as professionally or as plentifully as SAS soldier turned author McNab” - The Guardian (UK)“Nick Stone is one of the great all-action characters of recent times” - Daily Mirror (UK)“Stone is a deceptively complex action hero who does as good a job as many a newspaper columnist in guiding us through the new global politics” - Mail on Sunday (UK)",
