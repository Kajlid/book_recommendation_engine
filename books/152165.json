  "description": "She wants one night, he wants forever.Waking up naked next to a good looking man is not a bad way to start the day. The problem? This hottie is Hank, her best friend’s older brother, who she’s known her entire life. Stopping after one night is the right thing to do. Being with him clearly breaks the best friend code. From his career as a Naval officer to his Boy Scout reputation, everything about him screams monogamy and commitment… two things Paisley has had enough of.When Hank presents a “no strings attached” offer, it’s too good to be true. But, poor choices force her to confront old fears of love and loss, and Paisley has to decide if Hank is worth the risk. The alternative is never experiencing the real deal. Or far worse, settling for less.",
