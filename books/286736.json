  "description": "Being infatuated with my childhood best friend was a beautiful curse.  Our lives were an uphill struggle against every odd, but as long as we had each otherâ€¦we had everything. Then it was all gone.  Now I've built my life to perfection yet still yearning for that boy I used to know. Then one night, through a chance encounter, I see him.  Riot James.  He's an MMA fighter with a beastly body, roped and corded with muscle and gleaming with sweat. His nose, reminiscent of a Roman gladiator, was bent a little like it's been broken. A few times.  It rattles me the way his intensely dark gaze lingers with mine.  He's familiar, determined, damaged, and there's no escaping him.  But with Riot, nothing is what it seems, and in the span of a single heartbeat, my perfect life is turned inside out.  Again.Fighting For Faith is the third book in the Worth The Fight Series.
