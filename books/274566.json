  "description": "From the USA Today bestselling author of Vampire Girl comes a new vampire romance that will suck you in. *** Why am I tied to a tree in the middle of a freezing Ukrainian forest waiting for a god to come devour me? Funny story. While traveling for the winter during my last year of grad school, my Ukrainian friend convinced me to join them in their homeland for a few days. It seemed like a good idea at the time. Only our plane crashed and I woke up here, in a village that's a throwback to the Dark Ages, with no electricity, no Wi-Fi and a strong superstition in gods and human sacrifices. Yay me. I mean, I'm all about the authentic local experience when traveling, but this is a little too authentic. I'm expecting to die from the cold. Not some made-up god monster. But then he walks out of the shadows, and an entirely different fear seizes me. Lust and terror war within me as I'm taken captive by something so much more than a man. A vampire. Straight from the legends. And he needs my blood to survive. But he's chosen to spare me. Unfortunately, I'm not sure either of us will survive the winter. Because something is hunting the people of this mysterious village. Something even a vampire fears. And we may be its next victims.",
