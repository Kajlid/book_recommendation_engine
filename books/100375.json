  "description": "I’ve been faithful long enough.I never claimed to be a good man, but I’ve always done what was expected of me.Find a nice girl. Get married. Have children.That was my duty as a good Christian man.And everything was going as planned when I met Briar.Beautiful. Charismatic. Sexy.But marriage is hard, and after seven years, I feel like I’m failing.Then, a figure from my past enters the picture.Dean Sheridan is cocky and charming. When this twenty-five-year-old needs a place to stay, I should turn him away—especially after I notice the spark between him and my wife. But I don’t.When I pressure him about his relationship with Briar, he does the last thing I expect.He dares me.He thinks he can take what’s mine.And if it’s a challenge he wants, it’s a challenge he’ll get.What started as a game becomes so much more.Between them. Between us.This isn’t how normal couples behave.The games we’re playing are dangerous.And the roles we’re playing are far more.But God help me, I can’t seem to stop.What we’re doing is wrong, but it feels so right, and before long, I don’t recognize the good husband I used to be.",
