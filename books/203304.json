  "description": "Judah St. Michaels is a man who seeks pleasure, not love. Never love. By rule, satisfaction is guaranteed while in his bed—yet, his women are always dismissed still begging for more. His frequent flyers are few, but variety breeds a challenge on which he thrives, and loneliness is not a burden he shoulders. But when he happens upon an exquisite, little redhead—whose shy demeanor he'd like to shatter in one night of passion—her reluctance to accept his offer changes his game completely. Teddy Fitzpatrick doesn't trust easily. The scars that define her cut deep, and love is a dream she's afraid to chase. When a tall, dark, and gorgeous man enters her world, she knows right away that he's the type to break hearts. Yet, try as she might, his persistence is hard to ignore, and her ability to resist soon dwindles down to nothing. Against her better judgment, she opens her heart, surrendering to the dominate force that he is. But happily-ever-afters are not easy to come by, for assholes aren't born, they're made... And falling in love is a fool's errand. *Series STANDALONE. Written for audiences 18+ years of age, due to language and sexual content.",
