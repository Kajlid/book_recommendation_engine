Confident, charming, and handsome as sin, there isn’t a single girl on campus who is immune to this quarterback. Except Allie. ​ Smart. Sassy. Not interested. Allie Perez can’t stand jocks. Especially the spoiled, cocky, womanizing types like Theo. She could have gone her entire college career without ever seeing his smarmy smile again. Except…they’ve been paired together for a major class project. ​ The solution seems simple: set their differences aside for the sake of their grades. Until one bet changes everything. ​ She thinks he's the last guy she should fall for. He's determined to change her mind. What happens when the one person you hate becomes the one person you can't live without?  An enemies to lovers romance filled with heat, snark, and a dash of football.",
