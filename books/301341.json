  "description": "Can you keep a secret?  ⁣I grew up sick.⁣ ⁣Let me clarify.⁣ ⁣I grew up believing that real love stories include a martyr or demand great sacrifice to be worthy.⁣ ⁣Because of that, I believed it, because I made myself believe it, and I bred the most masochistic of romantic hearts, which resulted in my illness.⁣ ⁣When I lived this story, my own twisted fairy tale, it was unbeknownst to me at the time because I was young and naïve. I gave into temptation and fed the beating beast, which grew thirstier with every slash, every strike, every blow.⁣ ⁣Triple Falls wasn’t at all what it seemed, nor were the men that swept me under their wing. But in order to keep them, I had to be in on their secrets.⁣ ⁣Secrets that cost us everything to keep.⁣ ⁣That’s the novelty of fiction versus reality. You can’t re-live your own love story, because by the time you’ve realized you’re living it, it’s over. At least that was the case for me and the men I trusted my foolish heart to.⁣ ⁣Looking back, I’m convinced I willed my story into existence due to my illness.⁣ ⁣And all were punished. Both books in The Ravenhood Duet are now available and must be read in order.Duet Reading OrderBook #1 FlockBook #2 ExodusThis is an angsty, unconventional love story with high steam, loaded with suspense, a little action, and ALL OF THE FEELS!",
