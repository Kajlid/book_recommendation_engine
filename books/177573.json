  "description": "An ordinary young man in extraordinary times! Gideon Hawke is a fifteen year-old with problems. What does he want to do with his life? Should he go to college or get a job? The girl he likes couldn't possibly like him, could she? Her father sure doesn't! Then it happens: on April 19th, 1775 British troops march into Gideon's hometown of Lexington, Massachusetts, fighting breaks out, and Gideon is at war. Amidst savage fighting in Lexington, on the Concord Road, and on Breeds Hill, Gideon learns the hard way to be a soldier, and loses some of his closest friends. He is soon adrift and alone, but a chance run-in with military discipline places Gideon in an elite unit: Thompson's Rifle Battalion. With his new comrades Gideon is once again in the thick of battle. Soon he is leading men in a critical mission that might prove decisive in the struggle to end the British occupation of Boston.",
