  "description": "Game of Thrones meets Squid Games in this standalone introducing the Feastday Crusades, a time of celebration of culture and the best fighters Hafod has to offer. In secret, it is better known as The Killing Corral--a place where death was all but guaranteed save for a few who will open the doors to fame and fortune instead. The talented few. The blessed. The lucky.  Clan, family, dutyâ€”the tenets of the Oren-yaro are clear: you are swords first, servants first. Yet no one expects much from the youngest daughter, not even when your family is sworn to the wolves who rule the land. At an age when most of her sisters have wed and borne children, Anira remain nursemaid to a decrepit father and an ailing mother, forgotten by a world moving too fast for her liking. When her elder brother deserts Warlord Yeshin's army, she is forced to step up to save her family from disgrace.Plunged into a world of bloodshed, Anira becomes the unlikely last link to a tyrant's plans as she is tasked with bringing home the first dragon their kingdom has seen in decades. The arrival of a mercenary band, hell-bent on the same goal, creates a rivalry between her and their stubborn, unyielding leader. With her family's freedom on the line, Anira must risk vengeful ancients, debased rituals, and a tournament from hell, all to seize the prize.When death comes calling, who will pay the price for her allegiance?",
