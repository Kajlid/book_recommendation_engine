  "description": "Everything was finally coming together, but did Abby really know what she was in for after accepting Mr. Edwards invitation? When things really heat up, she starts to wonder if she's made a mistake... Will tears turn to tremors of pleasure at the man's sensational touch? The reviews are in! \"Highly Arousing!\" \"I want to be Mr. Edwards!\" \"What a Sensuous Read!\" Abby’s world became a bit foggier just as he relaxed his grip, never actually letting go. The sudden rush brought all of the heat and electricity inside of her to the forefront of her brain, as if it were somehow amplified by her returned oxygen supply. “Oh daddy…” she moaned softly. Mr. Edwards hand squeezed again with more force than the last time. “Do you like this Abigail?” he asked softly. “Abby could hardly speak and gasped her answer, “Yessss Daddy.” He released her again and she realized that the incredibly strong man had been supporting some of her weight with his hand when her legs buckled slightly as the same high flooded through her again with even more force and a longer surge than the last time. Abby could feel an orgasm coming and he wasn’t even touching any of her sexual areas. Mr. Edwards squeezed again with the same force, and as he did, Abby felt the warmth of his breath on her neck as he leaned in close. In the softest voice, but with just as much authority and formality as ever, he whispered, “I’m so glad you like it rough Abigail, but I am going to be gentle with you when I enter you for the first time tonight. I will give you what you’ve been waiting for. Just the two of us. But first, you are going to show me that you deserve that, aren’t you Abigail?” “YES DADDY!” Abby tried screaming, but it was very subdued as he still had her throat confined in his vice grip. Abby's babysitting job turned into an all consuming obsession with her father's boss. Ethan Edwards had a control over her that she never even knew possible. Everything about what he does to her is wrong, but she no longer has any desire to fight it as he takes her to new highs and explains how things are going to work if she wants to continue receiving his attention. How far will he take her? Will she stop him if it goes too far? Find out as her tale of lust and obedience continues as Mr. Edwards becomes her new daddy.
