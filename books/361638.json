  "description": "Audra Markham is a ten-year-old girl born into privilege, but only in the sense of wealth. The granddaughter of a Viscount, Audra is the object of ridicule in her spoiled and spiteful family. Alone and unloved, Audra seeks solace in the comfort of food. In another part of London, thirteen-year-old Nathaniel Abbot lives a wretched life, forced to steal food in order to survive. Living in squalid conditions at the local orphanage, Nathaniel and three of his friends are spared further suffering when Audra \"rescues\" them from their plight. Two lost souls that cannot find their place in the world suddenly find a place in each other's hearts. Follow the lives of Audra and Nate as they grow from loyal childhood companions to inseparable young lovers, struggling through the perils of their own lives and facing difficult decisions that threaten to keep them apart. Barbara Cerny grew up in Grand Junction, Colorado. She served twenty-two years in the US Army Reserves, retiring a Lieutenant Colonel in 2007. She is an information technology specialist and supervisor at Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio and is currently working on her next book. She lives with her loving husband, Charles, and their two wonderful children, Oksana and Audra, in Dayton, Ohio.",
