  "description": "Caribbean literature has always been exciting and diverse, including over the past decades some of the worldâ€™s most regarded writers. Beyond Sangre Grande: Caribbean Writing Today brings together a contemporary selection from key poets and fiction writers living in Canada, the US, the UK, and the Caribbean itself. Fusing creole and other cultural streams from a changing world, these writers capture the cadences and rhythms of the Caribbean while admitting other influences to demonstrate the vigour and vitality of Caribbean writing today. Whether in the poetry of Kamau Brathwaite, Nobel Laureate Derek Walcott, David Dabydeen, Dionne Brand, or in the fiction of Shani Mootoo, Austin Clarke, or Elizabeth Nunez, this remarkable collection represents a range of writing that constitutes the rich tapestry of Caribbean literature in new and exciting ways!",
