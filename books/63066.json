  "description": "An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found [|25682634].Desperate to save her grandmother from an unscrupulous loan shark, Cynda Avery agrees to Daniel De Marco's wildly inappropriate offer--control of her body for two weeks in exchange for time to talk him into selling his untended peach orchards.Handsome Daniel isn't the redneck farmer Cynda expected. From the feminine clothes he wants her to wear to the confident way he handles every problem to the kinky way he likes to tie her up to have sex, he makes her want to please him. When she finds the key to his mother's disappearance and spends a weekend in jail, will Daniel decide Cynda's an itch he's already scratched or could he cling to dark flesh like hers?Content Contains multiple scenes of bondage, light bdsm play, anal penetration, and spanking, both as foreplay and as discipline. Forks and fruit are used in sexual stimulation, and the story presents a relationship dynamic of domestic discipline. No fictional character was harmed in the making of this story.",
