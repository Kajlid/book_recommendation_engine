  "description": "What do you do when you find out you are the father of a three day old baby, the mother, who you had a one night stand with, wants nothing to do with either of you and you are about to go on a tour that you can’t get out of? Honestly, I don’t even know. I never thought this would be my life. I was in love with my best friend for the last seven years of my life, but Gwen has never seen me that way, and I am over her—I swear. Now she is the one holding me together, helping me care for my baby and get through this tour. I thought watching her care for my baby would be easy, I was wrong. It’s so painful to picture that this could be my life, with Gwen at my side, but why would she want to tie herself to a drummer who knocked up a groupie and is dealing with the consequences when she has her own life drama to handle?",
