  "description": "Sarah Green wishes she were taller. She wishes bubblegum wouldn't lose its flavour. She wishes school would start in the afternoon. But above all, Sarah wishes she could remain a kid forever. When she receives an invitation to the mysterious House of Vine, a secret dwelling where reside two genii, her wishful thinking becomes all the more real. A once in a lifetime opportunity awaits her, the chance to claim a single wish. But like those before her, Sarah must first agree to play a game. And it is a game of the deadliest kind, where terrors lurk behind every corner, where fiendish puzzles break her wits and where the clock shows her impending doom. Can she overcome it within twenty-four hours? Can she uncover the horrible truth behind the House of Vine and its enigmatic hosts? It is, after all, child's play.",
