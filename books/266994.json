  "description": "When Jilda embarks on a cruise with her mother and twin sister, Rosa, she has no idea of the ordeal she’ll face. Feeling unwell, Jilda stays in her cabin while her mother and sister go ashore to explore a Fijian island. Jilda emerges to find the ship has been commandeered by a group determined to use it to transport refugees away from the island nation of Levy Archipelago, which is flooding due to climate change.Conditions on the ship deteriorate quickly due to overcrowding. The refugees grow restless with no idea of where they’re heading, and they mourn the loss of their animals they had to leave behind on the islands. Alone and afraid Jilda finds an ally in Jade—along with feelings she’s never experienced before. But will the relationship forming between them end when Jilda admits she has a boyfriend?",
