  "description": "New Coastal Times (or when the sea swallowed Florida) It's no day at the beach when Hurricane Walter swallows Florida. And Walter is just the beginning, ushering in a world-wide disaster-filled era that destroys everything. Well, almost everything. Broadway showtunes miraculously survive. But Mia Gionfreddo-Fine, a former reporter for a minor metropolitan Florida newspaper, knows that she and her adorable doctor husband don't have it so bad post-Walter. There's a place for them. Somewhere a place for them. At least, that's what they hope. Heading toward upstate New York with a quirky band of fellow travelers, they encounter scary religious fanatics waiting for Jesus in the Okefenokee Swamp, martial law in the remaining cities, and a government-sponsored free love commune for displaced youth. Some things, however, never change, including love, friendship, family and the urge to sometimes sing inappropriately.",
