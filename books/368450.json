  "description": "At a market, a fairy purchases riches found in nature. Then releases them for their own good or the good of others. A different season plays out with each stanza of Fyleman’s verse. Visually exquisite, this is a story to be savored by both parents and children, and is a great book to be shared in preschool story time. \"The artist has created a fairy-world of beauty with animals, plants, reptiles and small details making each double-page spread a breathtaking scene. . . luminous.\" — Publishers Weekly\"What makes this picture book exceptional are the exquisite illustrations.\" — School Library Journal",
