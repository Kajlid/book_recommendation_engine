  "description": "First, Coffeezilla torpedoes my career as a barista.Then he dangles my dream job like a carrot on a stick.So what do I do? Make a deal with the devil.I learned the hard way: trust no one.That’s why I’m stuck serving lattes in the first place.Then Trent Saunders, aka Satan, waltzes in.Mr Hot Shot is too busy barking into his phone to stop and read.Is it my fault he missed the big DO NOT USE sign on the table?Ok, maybe I shouldn’t have laughed when he spilled coffee all over himself.But he deserved it.And for that the Table Tyrant got me fired!At least I got the last word. Or so I thought…Because it turns out, this gorgeous grump is the answer to my professional prayers.He wants me to design high-end furniture for his grandmother.A sweet old woman who mistakes me for his girlfriend.And does this genius bosshole correct her?No! He asks me to play along!Which means I’m stuck fake dating a man I loathe.What’s even more annoying? He might not be a total villain.He’s actually kind of sweet. Sometimes.But I’m not about to fall for his whole “nice guy’ routine.I mean, what kind of a woman would I be if I fell for a jerk?",
