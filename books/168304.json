  "description": "\"I'm not who you think I am.\"  While his rodeo days have come and gone, cowboy Jack Drummond is in for the ride of a lifetime…with life itself hanging in the balance. An unexpected encounter with his old flame, Mara Jennings, triggers a series of events that Jack never could have predicted. There's just one Mara isn't the same woman Jack remembers. She looks like Mara. And sounds like Mara. But reignited passions aren't enough to hide the fact that she's harboring a big secret-and hiding out from an even bigger enemy. Now, learning the truth might be the only way to stay alive. Or it could tear them apart-permanently.",
