And that Rafe O'Shea isn't the kind of man to let a disastrous first date deter him from asking for a second. Rafe knows Meadow is meant to be his mate from the moment he sees her, but her friendship with the mysterious fae leader Smith brings a new level of complication into Rafe's life. When Meadow is kidnapped by a rogue pack, Rafe will pay any price and fight any monster to rescue her. With Valentine's Day right around the corner, Rafe wants his mate safe with him and to show her everything is right in the world. But if she can't trust herself or her new powers as a muse, how will she ever trust him?",
