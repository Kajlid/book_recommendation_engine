  "title": "The Secret of Mary",
  "description": "A short, famous classic on \"true devotion to Mary\"--an excellent, easy means of attaining holiness and salvation, a way followed by Popes and Saints, but also perfect for lay people. It is at least every bit as good as his True Devotion to Mary! Small but powerful--seems almost divinely inspired!",
