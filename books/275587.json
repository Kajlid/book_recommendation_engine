  "description": "A remorseless killer. A string of innocent, clean-cut victims. Detectives M.C. Riggio and Kitt Lundgren must race against a cold-blooded predator who moves at breakneck speed in this heart-pounding thriller from New York Times bestselling author Erica Spindler.\nHot on the heels of their last case, partners Mary Catherine (M.C.) Riggio and Kitt Lundgren, detectives in the police department's Violent Crimes Bureau in industrial, blue-collar Rockford, Illinois, are called out to a college studentâ€™s apartment where a young man with no criminal record, not even a noise complaint from his neighbors, appears to have been murdered in his sleep.\nThe trail seems cold, until another victim turns up, and then anotherâ€¦ each one striking closer to home for M.C. The growing list of seemingly emotionless kills leaves M.C. and Kitt little to followâ€”like the first victim, all the targets are young adults, kid-next-door types whoâ€™ve never taken a step outside the law. Meanwhile, the case starts to take its toll on M.C.â€™s personal life, setting her on edge with her partner and putting their hard-earned friendship in jeopardy. As M.C. and Kitt hunt a faceless killer, they are led deep into the cyberuniverse, where no one is who he seems and you never know who's watching. At the heart of this mesmerizing thriller is the relationship between two headstrong women as they struggle to balance their dual roles, to learn to trust, and to walk the fine line between upholding the lawâ€”and taking it into their own hands.",
