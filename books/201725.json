  "description": "(The story timeline takes place after \"Daniel and the Mysteries\" series)The Heldic tribe has two classes - the higher class (aristocrats), who engage in battles and defend their lands, and the lower class (plebeians), who do housework and aren't allowed to fight, although the motto of the Heldic tribe is \"I am warrior, I am Held\". The high-class Helds call the low-class \"Serons\", which means \"Zeroes\" in Danadonian, their language.One day, a young Seron girl, Wolvena Nillin, decides that she should fight for her rights, and she, as well as all the other plebeians, should be allowed to defend the Heldic lands. Wolvena's dream is to at least once see King Daniel the Magnificent and Prince Drahtar - the king and the prince of Dragharon, the kingdom of dragons. She counts them as her heroes because Daniel was the one who ended the war between the Draghars and the Helds, and Drahtar ended the war between the Helds and the Lavadans. Since the wars are over and the Heldic tribe has become peaceful, the girl believes that changes should be made in their traditions too. Will Wolvena be able to achieve her goals and change the Heldic life, or will she fail?
