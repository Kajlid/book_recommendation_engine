  "description": "Rose Gray is troubled, and has always been alone. When she reunites with her long lost sister, Sonnet, her mental fragility snaps to the point of murder. Sonnet has all but given up on her now. Circumstances - beyond unusual and strange - have made Rose the way she is; for not only can she travel through eras, she can decide where to go. For a perfectly sane girl, this could be a gift: for Rose, it could be danger for anyone she has ever had the misfortune of meeting. A childhood with gypsies, an apprenticeship with a dark man, and a love affair with a dangerous boy, are what's normal for Rose - as is time spent in Bedlam.Lizzie is an orphaned nurse, resigned to a life of changing bedpans and fluffing pillows at the world's most notorious insane asylum. Finding an old diary proves a welcome distraction from a medical world who doesn't take nurses too seriously in 1931. But falling into the world of the diary's author, Rose Gray, Lizzie is swept into an ever deepening mystery; one that could leave her just another victim. Because, although the diary in Bedlam hospital may be old, Rose is not. And she never really left.",
