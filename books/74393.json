  "description": "Doherty's second ancient Egyptian mystery, following Mask of Ra (1999), brings the court of Hatusu (short form of Hatshepsut), the pharaoh queen, to life. In 1479 B.C.E., after a great military victory and a purge of opposition in the court, Hatusu assumed the throne. She needed the support of the priests to ensure success. When several priests at the Temple of Horus are murdered, her chief judge, Amertoke, must find and punish the guilty parties.",
