All the illustrations are full-page color with a total of 120 images plus several more diagrams.The I Ching is a philosophy dating back to the origins of Chinese civilization that evolved along with Chinese writing and culture. This philosophy of right living is based on the premise that everything in the universe arises out of two forces, Yang and Yin, the Chinese words for creative and receptive energy or masculine and feminine forces. The concept is that if you follow the way of nature you will find the right way and right time for action or non-action in one's own life.",
