  "title": "The Zombies: Hung Up on a Dream : 1962-1967",
  "description": "In 1964, an unknown band hit number 2 in the US charts with \"She’s Not There\". Surviving gruelling package tours, they were soon at the vanguard of the British invasion that stormed America. Novelist and musician Claes Johansen follows them from suburban beginnings on an adventure through a pop industry in its infancy. In 1967, before going their separate ways, the Zombies recorded their swansong, Odessey and Oracle. When Al Kooper championed its posthumous release in the States, this classic LP started to undergo a series of re-evaluations. (It recently featured amongst Mojo magazine’s best 100 LPs of all time). Here, this timeless masterpiece is fully explored.",
