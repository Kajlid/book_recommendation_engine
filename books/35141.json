  "description": "This is a 12,000 word novelette based on actual events. It may not be homicide, but to DI Lorne Simpkins it’s still murder. When a reporter friend of DI Lorne Simpkins gives her a tip about a story involving ex-racing greyhounds, Lorne is sceptical. But after delving into it, she’s horrified to discover the grisly fate of racing dogs that are no longer useful to their owners – and she’s determined to bring the cruel and uncaring owners to justice… “Animal welfare is so close to my heart, the real-life plight of these former racing dogs moved me to tears. I’m delighted to donate all profits of the book to PUPS, The Protection of Unwanted Puppies Society.” Mel Comley – Author. .",
