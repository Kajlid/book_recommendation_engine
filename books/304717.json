  "description": "When you grow up in a small town like Great Meadows, you learn to create your own entertainment. You can either spend your time getting high, partying at the field, or working on cars. For Veronica Russo, there’s a certain solace found underneath the hood.As the youngest sibling of the Russo family, Veronica is under the watchful eyes of her four older brothers; four very protective, very overbearing, and very outspoken brothers. Every guy in town knows Veronicas label: strictly off-limits. They have succeeded in enforcing it; running off every guy that so much as looks in her direction. That is, until Chase arrives back in town.Close family friend and motorhead, Chase Daniels, returns from deployment, and his world is turned upside down when he comes face to face with Veronica again; shocked to find that she is all grown up. The more he surrounds himself in her company and learns that there is more to Veronica than he ever knew, the more he feels an intense pull towards her. There’s just one problem—his best friends won’t allow it.Is the fallout of life-long friendships worth the possibility of something more?",
