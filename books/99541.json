  "description": "\"Something's coming. And it involves a man.\"The tarot and the pendulum were in agreement, but Sybil Richardson was dubious. Despite her position as secretary of the Society of Water Witches, Sybil's psychic skills were notoriously mediocre. When Nicholas Fitzsimmons entered Sybil's bookstore, her suspicions were confirmed.Nick was a skeptic who scoffed at premonitions, past lives and everything else Sybil considered important. But he'd change his tune soon enough--most people did after spending a night in Danbury, Vermont's only bona fide, haunted house.",
