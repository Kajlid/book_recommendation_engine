  "description": "Time travel isn't just a reality -- it's a business. And a damn big one.  But in order to guarantee safe and comfortable travels for the tourists of the near-future, the generations before them must be kept completely ignorant about the existence of this tightly-regulated industry that they've always been a part of -- something that's achieved with precision thanks to the time travel mantra: AVDI VIDE TACE.  HEAR. SEE. BE SILENT.  When a struggling comedian is offered a job at Panachron, the world's premiere time travel provider, he soon realizes that he has no say in the matter and must relocate to the underwhelming future of casual chronological tourism, where everyone is itching to escape the moment that they're in.   DIRTY MACHINES is a playful and darkly humorous look at the bureaucratic and boring reality of tomorrow's time travel culture.",
