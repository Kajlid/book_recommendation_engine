  "description": "Falling in love with your boss shouldn’t be this easy…and this hard.Luka Moreno—a cute, vivacious advertising exec—is absolutely crushing it at work. He’s flying up the ladder and nothing can stop him now… except for the terrible decision he made while dating a coworker. So terrible, this ex is now blackmailing him, putting Luka’s job in danger. When Thomas Badgley, an impossibly gorgeous and gruff VP, is temporarily transferred to his office, Luka vows to stay far, far away. Falling in love with his boss would only make the whole mess ten times worse. But the universe keeps throwing them together, in one adorable situation after another—accidental couples costume, fake dating, roommates, and, would you believe, more fake dating. As their friendship grows, Thomas comes to believe in Luka in ways he never believed in himself, and his feelings are becoming harder and harder to ignore. How can Luke continue saying no, when his heart so desperately wants to say yes?",
