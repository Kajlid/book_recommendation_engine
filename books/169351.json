  "description": "Adela Reyna has found herself in a place of terror, uncertainty, and slavery--and she is the slave. She and her fellow experiments, nicknamed the Black Panthers, have dismal prospects for rescue, and perhaps worse dangers await them beyond the treasure-filled mountain, in a cruel, fearful, and unforgiving world. But Adela soon finds that the only way to truly escape this harsh environment is through her old companion, her Charango.",
