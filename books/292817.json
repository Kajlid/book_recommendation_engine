  "description": "He enforces the rules, she breaks them. Addison Cooper dates...a lot. The problem? Her whole dating life is a series of first dates that never lead to more. She’s starting to think she may never find someone who will accept her as she is. With no one special taking up her free time, she agrees to help her brother get a mentorship program off the ground. What she doesn’t expect is having to work alongside the cop who always seems to be there when she’s at her worst.As a dedicated police officer, Jackson Reed plays by the rules. Always. Even off the job. His number one rule—no relationships—has never been tough to follow...until now. Lately, his friend Ethan’s younger sister has slowly been creeping under his skin. Addison’s recklessness and her sassy, sexy mouth drive him insane. For the first time in his life, he’s tempted to throw caution to the wind—no matter the cost. Is their wild, one-of-a-kind chemistry enough to base a relationship on, or will they both end up alone in the end?",
