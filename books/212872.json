  "title": "What If This Is Heaven?: How Our Cultural Myths Prevent Us from Experiencing Heaven on Earth",
  "description": "If life is about the journey and not the destination, could it be that this is heaven—this physical life we are living here on Earth? What we experience in our daily lives often feels like anything but heaven. But what if we understood how powerful we are—that we are powerful enough to mold both our internal and our external reality?Anita Moorjani, the New York Times bestselling author of Dying to Be Me, is convinced we can do exactly that. The process, she explains, requires dismantling many cultural myths mistaken for indisputable truths. Beliefs such as “We get what we deserve,” “Loving ourselves is selfish,” and “Coincidences are just that—coincidences,” are ingrained within us from birth, pervasive and influential, leading to generations of misguidance.Following her near-death experience, Moorjani began to embody truths she learned in the other realm, discovering that letting go of these outmoded myths allowed her to experience heaven not as a physical place but as a state of mind, right here and right now. In this examination of our common myths, she shares stories and examples from her own life, revealing the lies beneath the surface of what she was taught and absorbed. By freeing ourselves from these falsehoods, Moorjani asserts, we can leave fear, heartache, and self-imposed boundaries behind and instead live lives full of purpose and joy.",
