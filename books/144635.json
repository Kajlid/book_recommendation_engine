  "description": "Andre Esperanza used to have a photographic memory -- back when he developed clandestine electronic surveillance technology for the US government. Now he's a photographer on his way to bankruptcy with nagging missing frames in his memory. That's just as well, because he wants to forget his former life and revive his life through the pursuit of art. One day, while taking pictures on a beach, his art and past collide when he aims his lens at a woman dressed in a pink ballerina outfit and drawing pirouettes on wet sand. The burst of 51 photos he shoots reignite painful, missing memories of a life he thought he'd left behind. He wants to know who she is, but every step he takes closer to her produces more anguish and turmoil in his troubled psyche. And if that weren't enough, US and foreign operatives want to get their hands on those 51 photos. Reluctantly, Andre will have to face how this Pink Ballerina fits into a career he abandoned and how she ties in with his achievements and failures, which to him pretty much look the same.",
