  "title": "The Effects of Childhood Trauma on Adult Perception and Worldview",
  "description": "This study examined traumatization in childhood and the potential effect upon the adult individual. Previous research has focused on safeguarding children and minimizing the effects of trauma. The intent was to determine the underlying factors that contribute to an adult's perception and worldview in relationship to childhood traumatic experiences. Participants were adult men and women who self-reported traumatization in childhood. The core of the research was a semiguided interview protocol. The research used three supporting questionnaires as a basis for demographics. The research anticipates clarification between the effects of childhood trauma and the plausibility that the trauma may be a source of difficulty for adults, therefore perpetuating one's life struggles or being a source of inspiration to move forward. It was discovered that those children who possessed the factors that reinforce resiliency tended to have a more positive perception and worldview.",
