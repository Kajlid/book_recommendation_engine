  "description": "ChazI swore five years ago that I'd never allow another woman get to me. To never allow them in my heart. Not after everything that happened, not after the heartache and pain I felt. I've lost people before, but never in the way I lost her. After being on my own for this long I've determined all I need is my music and the people I call my family -- my band.Or so I thought. The moment she walked into Music Lullabies . . . things changed.I felt a cosmic pull, something which caused me to try and fight it at every turn.I did my best to stay away from her until I hear her sing. She put me under her spell that day without knowing. Like a damn Siren from the water.It wasn't just her voice that pulled me in, but her beautiful heart too. Now Iâ€™ll do everything I can to protect her when the darkness swarms in. I refuse to lose her no matter what.Will it all end in despair like everything else in my life has? Or will there finally be bliss?",
