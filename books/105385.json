  "description": "5-Star Superhero Spectacular. The first DC Special is also one of the earliest Dollar Comics, an 80-page, ad-free innovation DC pioneered in the late 70s. Includes a Flash story written by Cary Bates, with art by Irv Novick; a Green Lantern story written by Denny O'Neil, with art by Joe Staton; an Aquaman story written by Gerry Conway, with art by Dick Dillin; and an Atom story written by Paul Kupperberg, with art by Steve Stiles. The Batman story, written by Martin Pasko with art by Mike Nasser and Joe Rubinstein, is a crossover with the short-lived Kobra series, and serves as its finale (originally planned for the unpublished Kobra #8).",
