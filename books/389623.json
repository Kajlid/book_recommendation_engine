  "title": "The Reason Why the Closet-Man Is Never Sad",
  "description": "In this new collection of prose poems, Russell Edson presents, beneath a sprightly surface, vignettes that are surprisingly pained, dark, animistic. As in his earlier works, Edson undermines our familiar descriptions of the world and restores it to its strangeness and lyricism. This volume can be read either as an anthology of black humor or as a series of cosmological and visionary tales",
