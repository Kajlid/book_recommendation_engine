  "description": "The 13 stories collected here, written between 1924 and 1928, draw on D.H. Lawrence's experiences in New Mexico, Mexico, Italy, Germany, and England, and feature thinly disguised, often malicious, portraits of friends and acquaintances. The title story recounts the flight of a woman from her home to seek a more spiritual existence. These stories demonstrate the extraordinary range of Lawrence's style.",
