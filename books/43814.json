  "description": "When Prince Leon disappears and his people are unable to find him, they turn to the dragons for help. Nyle is the unlucky dragon tasked with finding the missing prince, a duty he dreads as it forces him into the confounding human world and away from his collection of pretties.Locating a missing prince should be a simple matter, but if Nyle has learned anything about humans since being forced out among them it's that they needlessly complicate everything. When he finally locates the errant prince, however, what Nyle finds is a treasure worth all the complicationsâ€”worth protecting at all costs.",
