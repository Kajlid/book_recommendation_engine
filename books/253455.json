  "description": "Winner of a Northern Lights Book Award for “children’s literature of exceptional merit,” Gwen the Rescue Hen is the heart-warming story about a sharp-witted chicken whose adventures inspire compassion for farm animals.Gwen has spent her whole life in a big egg-laying hen house, so she knows very little about what chickens can do (besides lay eggs, of course). A fateful tornado turns her world upside-down and sideways, landing her in a strange new place that's nothing like the hen house.Using her wits and chicken superpowers, Gwen dodges danger at every turn until she finds safety and friendship with a boy named Mateo. Together they discover how extraordinary an ordinary chicken really is.The book includes a bonus section called More About Chickens, where curious readers can learn that chickens have extraordinary eyesight, a complex language of 24 sounds, and are descended from dinosaurs, among other fun facts about chickens.Gwen the Rescue Hen is the second book in our Farm Animal Rescue Books for children. The first is Sprig the Rescue Pig.",
