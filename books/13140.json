As a well-known author and lecturer Gwen shared her observations of the universe. She was owner and president of Presscraft Papers, Gwen Frostic Prints, of Benzonia. Over the years Gwen had been awarded honorary degrees from many colleges and universities. In 1978 Michigan Governor William Milliken proclaimed May 23rd as Gwen Frostic Day in Michigan, and in 1986 she was inducted into the Michigan Woman's Hall of Fame. Attuned to the spirit of nature, Gwen sketched flowers - birds -trees - grasses and other little things one finds - out where they grow and live - cut each linoleum block by hand for the notepapers - calendars and books to share with you the grandeur and wondrous simplicity of nature -its serenity - and beauty.",
