  "description": "I’m what you call normal by day, and woo woo by night. As a college student, I spend my days in class and my evenings selling sage to PTA moms who do moon rituals to manifest better parking spaces. My best friend is a cat who likes pizza, and a “night out” includes hand delivering mysterious packages to the local “coven” of small business owners that repeatedly invite me to their meetings—clothing optional.My life is weird. But it’s not magic. Magic isn’t real.At least, that’s what I believed– right up until the moment he walks into my store.Alex Channing is rude, brutish, and a constant pain in my ass. He’s also the hottest specimen I’ve ever seen. Maybe that’s why words fail me in his presence. Or maybe it’s the pinging feeling in my gut that says he’s more than what he seems.But when he miraculously saves me from certain death, at the hand of a monster whose very existence shouldn’t even be possible, I’m forced to reconsider what’s real.My denial is strong but the reality of who—and what—Alex really is can’t be ignored. Neither can the existence of the monsters who hunt me. The truth is, magic is real. And the only thing I’m more in danger of losing than my life—is my heart.",
