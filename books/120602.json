Ani Forrest has spent most of her life fumbling down what she thinks is the right path. For the last five years, she has spent every moment trying to see the world. But no matter how hard she tries, nothing ever feels right. With her father’s health failing, and an urge too strong to resist, she finds herself back in the sleepy Tennessee town where she grew up.  However, fate has tempted Ani with a choice to make; does she resume the life she once had or does she take the opportunity to follow something different? Cash Roberts, the man who once held her heart, is vowing to win Ani back. But the seduction of something new is too strong to resist when a handsome stranger shows up in town. Knox O’Connell has brought his M.C. to Coker Creek in an attempt to get away from the anarchy and chaos of Ireland. The last thing he needs is the enticement of a free spirited woman; that is until she turns his world upside down.  Will Knox be able to win Ani over? In the midst of rival M.C. retaliation, will she be able to put her worries aside and follow the path that fate has given her or will she stay on the road that has always been familiar? What would you do if your past and present collided together, leaving you standing at a crossroad unsure of which path to take.  Explicit Material: This book is intended for audience 18 years of age or older.",
