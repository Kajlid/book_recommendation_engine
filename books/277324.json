  "title": "Gypsy Rizka",
  "description": "Living alone in her wagon on the outskirts of a small town while waiting for her father's return, Rizka, a Gypsy and a trickster, exposes the ridiculous foibles of some of the townspeople. High comedy as much as a celebration of Rizka's brains and brassiness, her flouting of conventions, and her own brand of magic, this book is infused with Alexander's recognition and respect for the rich and good heart of its main character and the human truth of accepting others' differences.",
