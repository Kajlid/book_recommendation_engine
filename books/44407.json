  "description": "When an anonymous box containing a human heart arrives for barrister Lucas Hayne’s birthday, he’s thrust into a byzantine rollercoaster of mystery, treachery and murder. Simultaneously, Lucas experiences his first precognitive incident from “The Knowledge”: a mysterious affliction, causing him moments of absolute clarity and understanding. Lucas initially rejects The Knowledge, and cannot face being the target of a sociopathic maniac, but the fiery detective, Paige Cartwright, desperately needs his help, as five years earlier, Lucas received a similar hearty gift. Lucas and Paige must unravel the mystery, force Lucas to face his demons and unmask the killer hell-bent on ruining Lucas’s life.The Start of Something Beautiful is the first of twelve episodes in the first series of the modern day sci-fi thriller serial Watchtower. Thrilling plot twists, heart wrenching drama, and more cliffhangers than Beachy Head. Let the first of these 30,000 word novellas into your life, impossible to put down until you grab the next one.",
