  "description": "When the Upheaval arrived, most of the world was caught off guard. People did not realize what was happening until it was too late, until the dead created by the Enillo Virus began to rise and prey upon the living. For them, the white flag of surrender had been raised. For John Talon, the Upheaval meant the destruction of his world. On his own, John would have stood a better chance. But he must care for his infant son and protect him from the hordes of undead who roam the world, searching for new victims to infect. John must make a choice. Will he fight to survive and take back what has been lost? Or will he surrender himself and his son the dead?",
