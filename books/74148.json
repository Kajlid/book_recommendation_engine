  "description": "Thanksgiving. It’s never been a particularly important day to Thor, but this year he has something and someone to be thankful for: his growing relationship with his lover and submissive, Bobby.Bobby asked Thor to come home for the holiday weekend with him and without a bit of hesitation, Thor agreed. After the chilly, but not unexpected welcome from Bobby’s conservative parents, Thor isn’t sure this is such a good idea anymore.Tension and discomfort keeps everyone on edge and Thor knows something has to give and he escapes outside to clear his head.The confrontation that ensues leads to a wicked walk in the woods where Bobby and Thor find they do indeed have a great deal to be thankful for. Maybe even more than they realize when Thor and Bobby’s father agree that apple pie is better than pumpkin.",
