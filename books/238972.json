Super-cool sleuth Lenny Aaron is back battling murder, mayhem and her own personal demons in another darkly funny whodunnit.A pill-popping loner with a penchant for green tea, Zen meditation and bonsai, Lenny is making a living out of catching cats with a bit of PI work on the side.When she is hired to track down a malicious vandal at a private film school and a student is brutally murdered, Lenny is drawn into a world of Hitchcock-sized egos and deceptive camera angles.Another bloody murder, a smoke screen of motives, and Lenny finds herself hunting a serial killer while her private life unravels like a B-grade movie.Which will crack first: the case of Lenny?",
