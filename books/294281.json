  "description": "*Be sure to read the author's note for a special announcement!  This is book 2 in the Aces High MC - Charleston Series and this is a series that should be read in order.  Lucy  I fell in love with Charles “Double-D” Brothers when I was just 16 years old. He was 19 and had just patched into the Aces High MC in Charleston, SC. The falling in love part didn’t matter though, because our life – our love – wasn’t destined to be an easy one. Then again, nothing worth having ever is. In the beginning – I was too young, he was too wild, and my family was able to send me away to keep us apart. Later, when I was 20 and he was 23 our paths crossed again. This time he was the one ready for me, but I wasn’t quite there yet. I allowed the club whores and rumors to drive me away, and then I let my pride and more lies keep me away despite the secret I took with me.  Double-D  The perfect woman was out there waiting for me to find her – again. Twice I’d lost her now, and twice it had been avoidable. It’s a damn shame that life had a nasty habit of screwing me over because we were far from done with the roller coaster we’d been on so far. It didn’t matter though. The ride could keep on getting bumpier, and I’d never jump off. She was worth every single thing I had to endure just to feel her in my arms at the end of the day. If only I could keep her from running again…  *This is not an insta-love story. It’s the story of a lifetime.  As with The Other Princes (Aces High MC - Charleston Book 1) this is a different book in the MC Romance sub-genre. It deals heavily with internal family issues and less with outside club vs club drama.",
