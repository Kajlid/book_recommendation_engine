  "title": "Serpentine Enigma",
  "description": "Dr. Joanna Russo, Geneticist, an honors graduate of England’s Cambridge University, guided research for a genetic laboratory just a subway ride away from her apartment in New York City. There were no clues or omens that might foretell events soon to engulf her, changing her life forever. And the Serpentine Enigma is where it all began… Joanna received an invitation from Ian Slattery, her Cambridge doctorate mentor, to join him at the Serpentine Foundation. Joanna accepted an exploratory trip and soon found herself involved in the shadowy world of intelligence. Reunited with Fiona Clark, her best friend from Cambridge days, they discovered a secret mysterious foreign network providing unlimited funds to the Serpentine Foundation. Slattery was developing genetic memory for political and military advantage. Joanna doubted he could significantly accelerate development of human knowledge but soon found she was mistaken. Indeed, the stakes were higher than either of them could have anticipated; they were dealing with ruthless people. Set against the disparate worlds of science, politics and intelligence, Joanna and Fiona devise the Foundation’s destruction, a ploy fraught with risk, both personal and professional. There was no one they could really trust; a dangerous world where two extraordinary women make the difference between life and death.",
