  "title": "Oath of Challenge: Conquering Kate",
  "description": "Twenty-nine-year-old Kate is happily single and thoroughly independent. She thinks men are pretty much like expensive stockings...sexy when you first try them on, but apt to run like hell at the first snag. From bedroom to boardroom she's never met a man she couldn't handle. Tair will be no exception. She'll walk away smiling after two fun filled weeks of sex... Tair is a psychic warrior cop who's used to winning at whatever game he plays. He knows Kate's deepest fantasies. He knows what it will take to seduce her. And he knows this particular game is the most important one he'll ever play. \"Definitely not to be missed.\" - Michelle Gann, The Word on Romance \"This is the second book in Marly Chance's Oath series and I highly recommend both. This was a fun read from the beginning and I couldn't put it down.\" - Laura Lane for Sensual Romance",
