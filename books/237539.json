  "description": "~ A thrilling and magical debut from Vesper Lyons ~ Thirteen-year-old Arthur Pendragon is heir to the throne, and thoroughly bored of his life in London. So, when he’s sent away to boarding school, he thinks it might finally be his chance to be a bit more normal. At first, Arthur’s life at Badon College is everything he expected it to be. But when he discovers that one of his new friends has been keeping an unbelievable secret, he quickly realises that ‘normal’ is entirely out of the question. As Arthur, Merlin, and their friends are drawn into an age-old web of magic and myth, they soon learn that some legends are more than just a story. Arturus Rex is the first instalment in Vesper Lyons' thrilling new series following Arthur Pendragon as he fights for his own place in history. What is the Brotherhood? What happened to Anne Catterick? And why is Arthur at the centre of it all?",
