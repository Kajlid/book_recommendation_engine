  "description": "Stones of power and one princess to save them all.The Far Stone Endurant is broken, and a prophecy foretells doom…She should have been the chosen princess to deliver them. But Pergi can’t love Prince Teyrnon, and that's a deal-breaker.Pergi has prepared all her life to become the ruler that her father wants. Without sons, he knows she could only retain the throne if she marries the neighboring prince, combining their kingdoms. Yet the same prophecy that calls for the reunification also warns that they must join by love. Supplanted by her younger sister in this technicality, Pergi waits with ill grace for Sadira to marry Teyrnon and steal her birthright. No one expects that Sadira would do a runner on her wedding day. What starts as an impromptu rescue of the wayward bride leads to a desperate struggle against a deadly foe.The dark lord Malchor ensnares Sadira in his opening bid to gain all the Far Stones of power. With them, he will subjugate all the peoples of Miran. At every turn, Pergi and her fellows run deeper into the conflict. Ancient lore, untold enemies, and secrets awaken to plunge them into overwhelming danger. They fight against evil and doubts in competing measures. Untried companions must trust each other with their lives and face the unknown together. Pergi again owns the responsibility to fulfill the prophecy, though it has become more unattainable. Can her adamant sense of duty rise above all the forces crushing her?It's not a game of hearts as they try to stay ahead of Malchor’s ruthless schemes. Their world lies on the brink of dire conquest, and the crux is Pergi’s impossible burden. The answer might not be what anyone envisions.Pergi’s epic journey begins in this first installment of the Far Stone Cycle!",
