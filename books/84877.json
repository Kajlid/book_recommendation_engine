It's two days from Valentine's Day, and Katelyn's sister Kandace wants Kate to help her catch her estranged husband cheating. Katelyn's just fine with this as it gives her another excuse to avoid Dominic, whose only crime is being Practically Perfect in every way possible. Dominic just wants Katelyn to stand still long enough to give her a Valentine's Day to remember. The only problem is, Katelyn hates Valentine's Day. Join Dom & Kate, from The Bird Day Battalion, as they try and navigate the \"And then what?\" of a Happy Ever After. \"It's either 'Do, or do not. There is no try'. You're going to have to go all in and change her mind about it, or accept you've got the only woman on the face of the planet that doesn't want a date on Valentine's.\" -- Kyle Anderson",
