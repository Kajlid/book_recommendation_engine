  "description": "An oppressor's assault, a father's terminal illness, an elder knight's enigmatic challenge...could a single thread interweave them all? When Danae Baledric leaves home in search of a cure for a degenerative malady that's killing her father, she never expects her journey to teach her the price of her own ignorance. In Curse Bearer, Danae learns the eternal war between The Creator and the Impenetrable Darkness is waged one soul at a time. Danae's investigation reveals not only the spiritual nature of her father's danger, but that the forces of Darkness are hunting her as well. For power, even employed in ignorance, has its cost. A commitment to a life of service to the Creator extends Danae both deliverance from her debt and the ability to intervene on her father's behalf. But something bars Danae from claiming redemption-her insistence she must achieve her goals in her own strength. It's an epic tale of curses and miracles, where headstrong ignorance creates bondage, and the desire to serve offers freedom.",
