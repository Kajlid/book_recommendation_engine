  "description": "A note from Jade Leighton's journal\nYears ago, a tragic accident robbed me of my mother and emotions. Because I find beauty in darkness and thrive outside social norms, I've been labeled a \"freak\" at school. I know my continued apathy hurts my loved ones, but I'm not about to change. Nothing will ever hurt me again.Then I wake up in an alternate reality...and everything else has changed. Goth is in. I'm considered cool, and my archenemy--the formerly popular Mercedes--is the freak. But my real friends won't talk to me...and the new boy is getting under my skin. As my world spins out of control, I'm desperate to return to normal. But the more time that passes, the less I'm sure what \"normal\" really is.",
