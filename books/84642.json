  "description": "Roger, a frustrated New York City public high school teacher and member of Manhattan’s underground pickup artist community, abandons his traditional economics curriculum to teach the art of seduction. With such enticing new material, perhaps his underprivileged students will be more engaged in class, and thereby better behaved—he can only hope that they won’t use their newfound knowledge for evil means.However, when Roger gets into an argument on the subway with the powerful Mr. Miller, who becomes so upset that he sets out to destroy Roger’s teaching career, Roger reluctantly decides to seduce Mr.Miller’s beautiful teenage daughter, Katie, to get revenge. Little does he know that this seduction will have a lasting effect on his life, and the lives of his students.",
