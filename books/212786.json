  "description": "In this series of books titled “The Occasional Swearing” comedy writer Jimmy Perrin takes a look at different topics, then tries to figure them out. Some readers call it clever wit, some readers call it rambling sh^t, but one thing is for certain... You will be able to relate to some of the things he writes about and will have a laugh.  The former best selling novelist, has turned into a factual writer. Where he tangles with myth and reality, then bravely takes on whatever subject is thrown his way.  INSIDE THIS BOOK... Jimmy takes on the subject of sex in a big way, then tries to point out what couples need to be doing to make things amazing, whilst trying not to over excite himself writing it. He tackles the art of seduction and takes it down, convinces us masturbation is the way forward, then backwards, then forward again in the palm of his hand. Then most importantly, shows you the value of honesty under the duvet, by making things up and teasing you towards the point of premature ejaculation.",
