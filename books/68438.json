  "description": "“We were the creatures desired throughout the ages…Foolish humans didn’t even realize it, living in their own little world”Lily, Kai and Ash are three of the rarest creatures alive--Sirens, so rare that they aren't even aware of each other. In a time when creatures of myth and legend are hunted and sold in horrifying slave trades, they each discover different ways a person can be imprisoned. Each girl is drawn to the quiet island of Rhine, whose origin is as mysterious and fantastic as the Sirens themselves. Trials await all three women in their quests for freedom, and the lines between right and wrong become blurred as they fight the ties that both hold them back and bind each other together. “It is one of those books where you root for the good guys, and beg for the bad guys to be hung up by their toe nails. Over all a very good read, and definitely something fresh and new.” Quinn Loftis- Author of the Grey Wolves Series",
