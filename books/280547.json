A kid needs stability—not to mention presents under the tree—and Logan’s desperate.Then he meets lonely Seth and makes a deal.Can Logan temporarily pretend to be live-in boyfriends to increase Seth’s chances at a promotion? If it provides a roof over their heads for the holidays, hell yeah. Logan considers himself straight—he doesn’t count occasional hookups with guys—but he can fake it. Besides, with his shy little smile, Seth is surprisingly sexy.Make that damn sexy.Shocked that Seth has only been with one man, Logan can’t resist sweetening their deal to teach him the joys of casual sex. No strings attached. No feelings. No kissing.No falling for each other.Easy, right?The Christmas Deal by Keira Andrews is a steamy gay Christmas romance featuring fake boyfriends, bisexual awakening, a clueless single dad with an angry preteen, and of course a happy ending.",
