  "title": "Of Curse and Covenant",
  "description": "Have you ever loved someone so much that you would do anything for them? Truly anything? I have. I have waited and plotted. I’ve drawn his enemies near and I've listened to their dark whispers. I’ve learned. I've stowed away my feelings—locked them somewhere deep inside. Those are things I’ve always been good at. They’re things I could do. It's almost time now... I’ll finish what he started even if the fight takes my life. I owe him that and so so much more. My name is Diana Granger, and it's time for me to pay my debt.  AUTHOR'S NOTE: This is an Arcane Arts Academy prequel novella told from the point of view of Diana Granger. These events *mostly* transpire before Harper Hawkins was ever born. It was first published as part of a larger collection of Academy novels and novellas titled 'Paranormal Academy,' but is now available to be read on its own as part of the AAA series.",
