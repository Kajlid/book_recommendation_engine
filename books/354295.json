  "title": "The Vampiric Housewife",
  "description": "In the sleepy town of Sangre Valley, Buicks still have tailfins, girls don poodle skirts, and families gather around their black and white televisions to watch The Donna Reed Show. But not all is as it seems in this 1950's town. The milkman leaves bottles of blood on the doorstep instead of milk, and the grocery store sells human heads as produce instead of heads of lettuce. The residents of Sangre Valley are vampires. Valerie Murray is a vampiric housewife with three beautiful children, a successful husband, and a lovely home. But after a dinner party for her husband's boss Dr. Venjamin, Valerie learns the doctor's dark secret and her world is turned upside down. Now to save her children from Venjamin's depraved plans, they must flee Sangre Valley and run for their lives. But what faces the family outside their small town is nearly as terrifying as what awaits them within.",
