  "description": "When sensible Catriona Hurst sets off in pursuit of her wild twin sister, Caitlyn—whose plan to trap the handsome laird of Clan MacLean into marriage will lead her to sure disaster—she never expects the journey to end with her own wedding. First Triona is caught in MacLean's carriage, then she's roundly scolded, and then—to her shocked surprise— thoroughly kissed! She is caught, body and soul, by the laird's enigmatic younger brother, Hugh MacLean, who had set a trap for the unprincipled sister and refuses to believe that he's caught the other. While Hugh is enchanted by Triona's delightful response to his kiss, he soon realizes that she is not who he thought, but an innocent whom honor demands he wed immediately. And he also discovers that letting the passionate Triona into his bed is far easier than keeping her out of his many concerns—even the ones he'd planned to keep secret!",
