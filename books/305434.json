  "description": "This is a warm, funny, educational, and very human story... a reminder that we are all just humans trying to be our best. And that, like this book, is a precious thing.”Colin Mochrie, Actor/Comedian/Producer,\"Whose Line Is It Anyway\"Finally, I was revealing my true self to the world; someone I had recognized since the age of four. I confidently declared, “I'm a transgender woman-but a woman just the same.” In nearly an instant I had conquered my lifelong insecurities, fears, and demons by facing them with unapologetic authenticity. I was confidently staring down a societal construct that immersed itself in long-held sexual and gender-related mythology and ignorance. Had I finally overcome the mortal heartache of being a person who to me was anything but natural? Or was I about to be sideswiped by more adversity than I could have ever possibly imagined? This must-read book will help extricate you from your irrational fears and help you uncover the courage and confidence hidden within you to become your best version—unapologetically you. It will help you discover a new understanding of the world, and yourself, all through the lens of one woman's rebirth into the person she was always meant to be.",
