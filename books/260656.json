  "description": "With the Death Star destroyed, the Empire has declared martial law throughout the galaxy. A thousand worlds have felt the oppressive hand of the Emperor as he attempts to crush the growing Rebellion. As the Imperial grip of tyranny tightens, Luke, Leia, Han, and the rest of the small band of freedom fighters continue to press for the salvation of the planets — but such a small crew stands little hope of succeeding against the dominant might of the Empire. But sometimes that's all it takes — a little hope. Dark Horse Comics is proud to present, in an all-new package, the comics adaptation of Star The Empire Strikes Back — The Special Edition . By Archie Goodwin and Al Williamson, this classic adaptation is reprinted from the original Star Wars comic-book series and is now collected with an all-new cover to celebrate The Empire Strikes Back — The Special Edition .",
