  "description": "In this wonderful, whimsical book, renowned photographer and dog lover Jill Freedman takes us into the world of the dog and shows us around. Through her camera, and with great style, she introduces us to dogs working as shepherds, as guides for the blind and as part of the fire department. In Jill's Dogs we meet dogs who sing and dance, dogs in costume, dogs at the beach and even visiting the zoo. We encounter dogs that look so funny that we want to burst out laughing (but we don't, for fear of hurting their feelings) and dogs who are clearly the noblest of beasts. But mostly we see them doing the doggy things that touch our hearts and make us revere them as our irreplaceable friends and companions. The book includes a warm and witty introduction by Jill Freedman and a foreword by Roger A. Caras, president of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. This copy is in As New condition with its original dustjacket and is signed by the artist.",
