  "description": "\"When I was quite youngand quite small for my size,I met an old man in the Desert of DrizeAnd he sang me a song I will never forget.At least, well, I haven't forgotten it yet.\"'Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are?' is a classic Dr. Seuss story about a boy called Duckie who feels quite unlucky, and an old man who goes on to recount all the other people who are in far more precarious a situation than he. It's a story of optimism, of looking on the bright side of things, and above all, a story about being grateful for one's place without loosing the inertia to improve it.With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic \n'Cat in the Hat'\n, and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.\nEdition Details:\nDr. Seuss. Did I Ever Tell You How Lucky You Are? New York: Random House, [1973]. First edition, first printing. Quarto. 47 pages. Publisher's binding. Illustrated in full color.",
