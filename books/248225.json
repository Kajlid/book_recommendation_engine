  "description": "Creep. Freak. Crazy Eyes. I've heard it all. Over the years, they've slammed me with every demeaning name in the book. Their taunts warped me like a steady stream of poison. Anger replaced anxiety as I started believing the cruelty spat my way. Until she showed up and changed everything.  Lennon Bennett is pure innocence—warm sunshine breaking apart my stormy existence. She's everything good and maybe I can be too. For her. With her. Because of her. Lennon doesn’t know I’m beckoned closer with each breath. She isn't aware that I'm completely consumed with her. It’s become my sole purpose to protect her, by any means necessary. But if she discovers the depth of my obsession, it will be the end of me. So, I remain in the shadows. Waiting. Watching. Wanting. She'll be my first. My last. My only.  Watch Me Follow is a TOTAL STANDALONE new adult romance.",
