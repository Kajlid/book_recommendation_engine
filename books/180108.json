  "title": "Bone Song",
  "description": "Sarah Kennedy nailed the essence of the book in her jacket blurb. Bone Song IS about scars, about how childhood leaves its mark on us forever. Some of those marks become silvery with time, more shadow than scar. Some remain livid. Others, like oysters building pearl around the irritation of sand, form layers of padding against future damage.",
