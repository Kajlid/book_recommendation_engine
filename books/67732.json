  "description": "**This book was pulled from publication. It has been re-vamped & re-edited, and will be re-released with a new title, Scorned.**I was seconds away from marrying the love of my life, seconds away from becoming Mrs. Sean Scofield… Then that bitch fucked up everything…My name is Melody Carter and I’m one of New York’s youngest and harshest movie critics. Even though half of the movies I’m forced to watch are utter crap (Utter. Crap.), the best ones are usually the romantic comedies. Those are the ones where the couple falls in love at first sight, the ones where the groom ditches the bride at the altar in favor of the real love of his life—some woman he met three weeks ago.At least that’s what I thought until that very thing happened to me…Now, I refuse to give any of those movies more than one star, and if my boss tells me to tone down my words on any more of them, I’m going to rip his head off. I don’t care that Matt Sterling, Hollywood’s sexiest actor alive, is offended. I don’t care that he’s storming into my office and demanding that I change my review, and I don’t care that for some strange reason, he’s pursuing me and making me feel things I’ve never felt before.Not at all. A jilted bride is forever jilted, forever jaded, and true love only comes once in a lifetime…Right?Book one in the Jilted Bride series.",
