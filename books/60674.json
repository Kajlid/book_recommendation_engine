As Wyndemere’s empire cracks and unrest rises, the Legatee orchestrates the Rebellion. Danger Has Not Disappeared...But Neither Has Hope Though the overthrow of the tyrannical regime is imminent, Maria’s role as the “woman who started it all” is not widely known. So why the foreboding of danger? Promise floats in the air. Many around her find happiness, even as the tension spirals toward a breaking point. But Maria flounders. What does Maria Morris want to do with her life? What is her destiny…now? Rendered Powerless, Maria Must Make A Painful Choice… One That Will Alter the Future of the Galaxy Forever When James invites her to headquarters where Maria assumes a new role among The Followers, tragedy strikes. The enemies she had thought long gone are capable of far more than she imagined. Will she have the courage to stand for what she believes, no matter the cost? Will she have the strength to surrender her dreams when all seems lost and she can do nothing at all?",
