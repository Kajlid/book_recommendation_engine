But last night, Aiden crossed a line.The worst part? My public humiliation was caught on camera, and the video’s a viral sensation.Now, the entire internet is raving about our “off the charts chemistry” and “crackling sexual tension.”Apparently, everyone is delusional. And blind.Yet when Aiden turns up on my doorstep, asking me to pose as his girlfriend, I find myself saying yes. Even if that means taking a couples vacation with him. Yup, couples vacation. With my mortal enemy. Who I have to pretend to be madly in love with.Great.I can put our war on ice for a little while, Aiden Shaw.But in the end, someone’s gotta lose.And it’s not going to be me.The Neighbor War is a laugh-out-loud funny, swoony, closed door romantic comedy. Expect some mild language and suggestive jokes alongside sizzling hot chemistry and tension you could cut with a knife—all without the explicit scenes.",
