  "description": "To say that teachers have a lot going on in their classrooms is an understatement. As a career changer, Ms. Frank is thrown into this world of teaching, and is taken in by the amazing kids she meets. Follow her first three years of teaching ESL as she struggles to focus on the children despite the many obstacles that come up along the way. If you are a teacher, this book may give you someone to relate to, and some ideas to incorporate into your own classrooms. For teachers and non teachers alike, let this book shed light on a troubled system. Something has to change to stop the constant bullying and harassment of teachers, and to get us all refocused not on testing, but on teaching to the child.Available at Teachingtothechild.com or Amazon.com. Also available for Amazon Kindle.",
