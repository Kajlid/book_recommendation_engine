  "title": "Vikramaditya: An Archetypal Portrait",
  "description": "This book seeks to reconstruct a portrait of the legendary king Vikramadityabased on the paradigm of post-modern literary historiography. It attempts to addressthe problematic embedded in the narrative of myths with riddled historythrough its focus on the archetypal core of meaningâ€”on that constant which does not change, even in the face of change.It examines the numismatic evidence of punch marked coins of Ujjain, the mythic narrative and cultural practises of the Vikramaditya tradition through an archetypal lens and synchronically traces its interlinkages with analogous parallels in world culture.It consists of essays which provoke abstract, archetypal portraits which stimulate a perceptible rather than an empirical sketch. The book leverages on the autonomy given to the transforming paradigm of historiography to augment the conventional narrative with the often-disregarded element of myths. It innovates the structure and methodology to recreate but does not undermine the central authority of the grand narrative, which it rather seeks to strengthen and reinvigorate. It recolours to restore but takes care not to disfigure as it reshapes the traditional narratives. The archetypal portrait finds a middle ground between the grace of aesthetic conventions and the contemporary frame of redefinition.",
