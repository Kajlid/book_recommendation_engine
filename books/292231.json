  "description": "Instead of becoming a famous fashion designer as she’d dreamed, Brett Bishop ends up working for the twenty-four-year-old daughter of an A-list designer instead. Even though her career plans didn’t turn out as she expected, she still believes her expectations for her love life will be met. Brett is ready to meet Ms. Right Forever if she can get a break in the schedule her young boss dictates. Evangeline Scott, known as Scotty, also dreamed of being a famous fashion designer. Years of fighting tooth and nail for a toehold in the fashion industry have taken their toll. Scotty has lowered her expectations and is the latest designer for I Am Alex, a clothing line for young adults. Her boss Alex and her congenial attitude is like a breath of fresh air, but Alex’s chief designer, Brett, is something akin to morning breath with a dash of garlic, yet oddly interesting. Scotty and Brett are more alike than they realize when they first meet, but it takes a crash landing in the wilderness for them to truly realize just how perfect they are for each other. They just have to survive Alex and her sister Cass who can’t stand each other, their Uncle Mark who can’t stand up to his own dog, and whatever lurks in the Montana mountains. Robin Alexander’s latest romantic comedy is loaded with laughs, love, and a tiny bit of wildlife.",
