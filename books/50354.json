  "description": "Revelation and the End of All Things is a highly readable guide to Revelation that engages the questions people most often ask about this difficult book in the Bible. After discussing sensationalistic interpretations of Revelation -- showing how these approaches work and why they are problematic -- Craig Koester ably leads readers through the entire book of Revelation, keeping in mind the situation of both first-century and twenty-first-century readers. Koester's exceptional grasp of Revelation's history, text, and purpose allows him to present the book's message in a way that is clear, engaging, and meaningful to modern readers.",
