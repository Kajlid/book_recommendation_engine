  "description": "Read the book that started it all! Get to know Judy Moody through mad-faced moods, funniest-thing-ever moods, and every mood in between.On the first day of school, Judy Moody doesn’t have high hopes for third grade. Her new desk won’t have an armadillo sticker with her name on it. Her new classroom will not have a porcupine named Roger. And with her luck, she’ll get stuck sitting in the first row, where Mr. Todd will notice every time she tries to pass a note to her best friend, Rocky. On the positive side, Judy does have a little brother who comes in handy for practicing doctor stuff, she gets a cool new pet, and she has a huge Band-Aid collection. She also has a lot of individuality and attitude, and when Mr. Todd assigns a very special class project, she really gets a chance to express herself! A funny first chapter book for anyone who has ever felt a little out of sorts.",
