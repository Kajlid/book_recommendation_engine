  "description": "In the early 20th Century, a pair of North Carolina mountain children sow the seed of a love that becomes their only solace in the hard yet beautiful world they know.  They grow it from steep ground of poverty, ignorance, and violence.  A landscape so brutal it can kill hope long before claiming life.Bloodshed years later finally sends Frank Locke on the run, deep into wilderness, abandoning his extraordinary love, Mary Lizbeth.  When a whitewater river washes this desperate soul into the hands of Sophia, he discovers a luminous woman steeped in mystery, trapped in a tragically brilliant life.  Far ahead of her time.  Secreted from the world.  As she awakens Frank’s mind, they rise to meet a love that binds three people for a lifetime.This love triangle forms a beauty no one sees coming.  From the wilds of Appalachia, crossing nearly a century, it runs deep into a lush American fortune, and lives in letters of adoration and hope of the least expected.In a rhapsody of Southern voices, mingling hilarity and sorrow, She-Rain speaks of lives soaring beyond heartbreak, fundamentalism, and self-destruction.  Through the most graceful longing, two women in love with one man ultimately prove the power of human hearts to answer high callings.  They show us all how to heal -- and thrive -- to the very end.",
