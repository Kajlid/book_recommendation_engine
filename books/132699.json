  "description": "Meet James: A secret agent trapped inside the dire confines of the Mayview Hospital, a mental health facility, on a mission to liberate the prisoners of this institution. Only one thing stands between James and his freedom, his sanity. James is a paranoid schizophrenic, although this truth often eludes him, especially when the voices call to him in the form of a mysterious and dangerous woman he calls Eve. As he struggles on his road to redemption James must learn to confront his past in order to better accept and control his illness. On this journey he meets Emily, a woman who will change life as he knows it. As James and Emily grow closer together James is forced to make a decision to either continue with his treatment or be with the woman he's come to love. What James must understand is Emily has her own dark secrets and that love does not always conquer all. Held Hostage is a story about mental illness and the sometimes deathly hold it has on its unwilling captors. It's a story about life, loss and the friendships in between. But mostly, it's a story about love.",
