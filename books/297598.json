  "description": "My first love was my best friend, Zachary Rostov. He was the boy next door, my secret keeper, and knight in rugged denim; he saw me even when the world looked away.He loved me before anyone else did, but he broke my heart into a thousand pieces and took the shattered shards with him when he walked away. I left behind the small, poor town in Indiana we both grew up in and moved to Chicago. I was still poor, desperately so, and that poverty had me make a choice, had me make a terrible decision that led me to almost being arrested. The only reason I'm not in prison is because of one man.Vincent Jamison.Vincent isn’t the boy I left behind. He’s a man—dominant, powerful, rich. His life couldn’t be more different from the one I remember living in Indiana. He sweeps me off my feet into a fairytale, like the ones I always dreamed of, and I think maybe my prince has finally come.But Vincent doesn’t just want to save me. He wants to claim me. Own me.And as I realize that Vincent and I have very different meanings of happily ever after, I can’t help but think of my past; it’s blurring with my future, and I wonder if my white knight from long ago can keep his promise to always save me.",
