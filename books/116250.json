  "description": "The Man-God gave his life out of love for the Varian people of Arathia, by ripping his own heart from his chest to provide life-sustaining light and warmth in an eternally dark place. The Ree-Kyae are pure evil, and cannot live in the light of love, so they've figured out a way to shatter The Crystal Heart. Now, by collecting all the pieces and reassembling The Crystal Heart of the Man-God, itâ€™s up to Kinley to repair the damage done, and restore the balance, beauty, light, and warmth of The Crystal Heart. The only question left is can it be done?",
