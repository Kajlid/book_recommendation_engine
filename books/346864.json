  "description": "The renowned neurologist and bestselling author of Awakenings takes us on a journey into the world of Deaf culture, and the underpinnings of the remarkable visual language of the congenitally deaf. • \"This book will shake your preconceptions about the deaf, about language and about thought.... One of the finest and most thoughtful writers of our time.\" — Los Angeles Times Book ReviewLike The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat, this is a fascinating voyage into a strange and wonderful land, a provocative meditation on communication, biology, adaptation, and culture.  In Seeing Voices, Oliver Sacks turns his attention to the subject of deafness, and the result is a deeply felt portrait of a minority struggling for recognition and respect—a minority with its own rich, sometimes astonishing, culture and unique visual language, an extraordinary mode of communication that tells us much about the basis of language in hearing people as well. Seeing Voices is, as Studs Terkel has written, \"an exquisite, as well as revelatory, work.\"",
