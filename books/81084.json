  "description": "The Incident at Montebello is a historical novel based on a true event— In 1930, Italian Premier Benito Mussolini was driving through the Italian countryside with Cornelius Vanderbilt, Jr. when his car struck and killed a little girl, Sofia Buonomano. The Buonomano family is torn apart by Sofia’s death and is caught in a political firestorm that spreads from their village to Rome and across America and Europe. One family member, 16-year-old Isolina, witnesses the accident and recognizes Mussolini as the driver. She lies to the police to protect herself and her boyfriend, but she’s caught. Falling deeper into trouble, she confides in Sofia’s mother, Lucia, and sets off an unexpected chain of events. Lucia, who now knows the truth, voices her disapproval of Mussolini and comes in conflict with the police and her husband Donato, an ardent Fascist. As Lucia and Donato become increasingly estranged while struggling with Sofia’s death, Lucia is attracted to Elio Sardolini, a Jewish anti-Fascist living in town. The family’s love and loyalty is further tested when the incident becomes an international scandal and Mussolini orders the police to silence all opposition. One family member is killed and the rest must choose between their allegiance to Mussolini and their allegiance to each other.",
