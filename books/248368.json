Poetic and beautiful!\" --- Editor's Pick Publication Review.\"This is the work of a sensitive poet who molds language as though on a potterâ€™s wheel that results in unspeakably beautiful art.\"--- San Francisco Review Of BooksSometimes our simplest wishes can be the most difficult to attain.The Ghost Years is brutally honest and jarring, from its immersive beginning right through to its startling, unpredictable conclusion. It's a young man's attempt to pick up the pieces and start over only to be presented with greater obstacles than he could ever have envisioned. Through visceral first-person accounts and stark, vivid imagery, the story chronicles the obstacles of depression, drug addiction, and the trials of homelessness that he endures on his path to self-discovery. He is taken to unimaginable and devastating places, both physically and mentally. How much control does he really have over his fate? The Ghost Years goes deep beneath the surface through unflinching plot twists and hauntingly poetic prose.",
