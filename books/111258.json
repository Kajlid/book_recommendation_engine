  "description": "In this Victorian romance, a bakery heir’s path to high society takes a detour after succumbing to temptation with a ravishing widow.Ann Haldene is the most beautiful woman Gawain Redcake has ever seen. A gifted healer who soothes his battle-scarred body like never before, the widow’s touch has a powerful effect on him. It’s no wonder the rugged Redcake heir forgets his quest for a society bride during one passionate night in Ann’s arms. But once he learns she is pregnant with his child, he searches for her, intent on giving her his name, if not his heart . . .Ann is shocked by Gawain’s proposal, mostly because he has not uttered a word of love. For the sake of their baby, she accepts, even knowing that Gawain dreamed of marrying to secure a title and all she has is a severed royal Indian bloodline. Now the new bride faces her greatest showing her husband that their union is more powerful than pedigree—and love is the ultimate reward . . .“A delightful, sexy glimpse into Victorian life and loving with two wonderfully non-traditional lovers.” —Jessa Slade, author of Dark Prince’s Desire and the Steel Born series “This fast-paced read is both sweet and fun. It’s rare to find historical romances that feature couples who are of anything but Anglo-Saxon decent, and this one does a solid job of addressing some of these difficulties.” —Library Journal",
