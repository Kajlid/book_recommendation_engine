  "description": "1332 A.D. \nAs the premier commander for Roger Mortimer, Earl of March, when he commandeered the throne from a young Edward III, Sir Mathias de Reyne is the type of knight that all men aspire to be; fair, powerful, intelligent, and bold. Men on both sides of the Mortimer/Edward lines respect and admire de Reyne for his outstanding character, including Dragonblade himself, Tate de Lara. Before the war separated men into two groups - those that supported Mortimer and those that supported the rightful king - Mathias, Tate, Kenneth St. Hever and Stephen of Pembury were inseparable friends. But then, sides were chose and lines were drawn. When Roger Mortimer lost his head, Mathias de Reyne was spared because of his great and fair reputation. Stripped of his lands and titles, however, he was forced into obscurity. He became known in legend as The Fallen One.\nMore than a year after being stripped of his knighthood, Mathias now makes his living as a blacksmith in the north Cumbrian town of Brampton. One morning, he hears cries for help and, being an innately brave and helpful man, follows the cries and comes upon a terrible scene. Rescuing a young woman from a fiend, he very quickly realizes that the young woman is the most beautiful he has ever lain eyes upon. The Lady Cathlina de Lara is a lush beauty with dark hair and flashing dark eyes, and the attraction between the pair is immediate. But she is also a de Lara, related to the man who took Mathias’ titles from him… his former best friend. \nStill, he cannot forget the dark-eyed beauty and soon finds himself swept up in a wildly passionate love affair, breaking his promise to never bear arms again by resuming his knighthood without the permission of the king and fleeing to Scotland.\n\n\nFrom the brutal Scots borderlands to the fields of Dupplin Moor and a historic battle, join Mathias and Cathlina as their journey in life takes them on a passionate adventure of love, life, learning, and the redemption of the man once known as The Fallen One.",
