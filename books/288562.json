  "description": "Abducted by aliens? Yes. Mistakenly bought as a family pet? Yep. Actually, unexpectedly starting to enjoy the ride? I just might be. I've been abducted, sold, and then sold again, all before I even knew what was going on. Luckily for me, I might just have been bought by the three nicest....guys....in the universe.  Maisy has to adapt to her new life traveling through space, lucky for her she has a set of three alien brothers to help her along...big, furry and very affectionate, these brothers only come as a set.  *Contains themes of a very adult nature, meant for mature readers only. Warning - alien biology.*",
