But his fatal leap coincides with the arrival of Dr. Goldsworthy--a student of the famous Dr. Anton Mesmer and his research into animal magnetism. Sir John's suspicions grow when he learns that Goldsworthy's patron in London is none other than the beautiful Lady Lammermoor. And the deeper Jeremy investigates the Lammermoor family, the more suspects he discovers who stand to gain from Lord Lammermoor's death.",
