  "description": "New Year's Day, 1999. Vic Reeves wakes up to discover a flock of seven white doves of peace flying around his bedroom, \"casting a Disneylike sense of well-being about.\" However, all is not well; Vic re- awakens several hours later to discover that the doves have stolen his prized bust of \"a foreboding sense of gloom now hangs over the home\". So begins Vic Reeves' Sunboiled Onions, a fictional diary packed with Vic's own paintings and drawings of a month in the mind of one of the UK's most popular comedians. Like his TV series with sidekick Bob Mortimer, Sunboiled Onions has a surreal menace in its humour, reflected in Vic's weird drawings of famous figures, which are often uncannily accurate yet strangely disconcerting with their eyes drawn too far apart. Elvis crops up throughout the book, appearing as Sir Walter Raleigh in King Lear (naked from the waist down, of course), buying fan heaters from Argos with Frank Sinatra and ironing his slacks in his bucolic cottage. Alongside such reveries, Vic deals with the problems of his everyday \"January 10--Flies swarm around the pork in my attic, so I get rid of it, all 150 lbs of it, in a ditch near B&Q\". Along the way, Vic muses on various celebrities and their foibles, including Michael Jackson, Abba, Henry VIII, Eric Morecombe and Richard Nixon. Those who love Reeves and Mortimer will celebrate Sunboiled Onions as another manifestation of the genius of the man they call the Darlington Dadaist. --Jerry Brotton",
