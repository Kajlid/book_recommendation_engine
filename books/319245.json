  "description": "Becoming a runaway bride was not in my wedding plans, and neither was Drake. For Kat Morris, finding out her groom and high school sweetheart had cheated was bad enough. Finding out it was with her sister and her sister was pregnant meant she could only do one thing. Leave. So she stole her fiance’s car and drove, running out of gas in the small town of Forever, Tennessee. Drake Wallad has seen it all as the owner of O’Malley’s, the best bar in Forever, but a gorgeous woman crying in a wedding dress is a new one. The second he lays eyes on her, he’s a goner, but her past comes back to ruin their future. Love wasn’t in their future, but there’s no running away from true love.",
