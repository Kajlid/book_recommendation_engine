  "description": "Our marriage crumbled three years ago, but I’m ready for a baby and I want him to be the father. I’ve dreamed of being a mother, but so far, that dream has fallen flat. Now, my options are limited to choosing a dad from a catalog or sucking up my pride and asking my ex for help. Seth Isles has all the charm of a bulldozer, but there’s no one else I’d rather have as my baby’s father. I’ve got nothing to offer, so I’m shocked when he agrees to my outrageous proposal. The trouble is, the more time we spend together, the more I remember why we fell in love… and forget why it ended. Is this our second chance at happily ever after, or will we break each other all over again?",
