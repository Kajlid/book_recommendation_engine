  "description": "When someone you love dies, your world goes blank. All you can see is their body laying there in the dust, not moving, lifeless. All you can hear is your heart racing inside your chest. You can’t hear the sounds of the battle around you, your friends calling you back, and you can’t even hear the blood curdling screams coming from your own throat. You feel like you can’t move, but you keep moving closer to them. All you can feel is pure agony. You would give anything to save them. In my case, that would mean I would have to be willing to give my life in order to save his.“By earth, water, wind, and fire, bring back the object of my desire.”",
