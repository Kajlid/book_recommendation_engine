  "description": "For thousands of years, a legendary clan known as the Phoenix battled the menacing Beasts that threatened the land of Pardes. The Phoenix protected the Races of the world from their devastating wrath while maintaining peace in the land. In what history would call the biggest battle to ever be fought, both the Phoenix Clan and Beasts vanished from the world, leaving any trace of their existence to be foretold within the words of stories and legends. War ravaged the lands for the years to come as the Races fought amongst each other in hatred. Finally, peace found a home in the world of Pardes. In the first book of a four part saga, Shadow, a young reckless boy stricken with a life of boredom, meets Emerald, a beautiful princess destined for greatness. Little do they know that this meeting will start a journey that will send them down a path of love, betrayal, and sacrifice that they never knew existed. Ancient legends will rise, the Races will expose themselves, and the peaceful world that they love will be thrown into a chain of catastrophic events that only together they will be able to overcome. Darkness is everywhere. Traces of the ancient Phoenix Clan looms, and the rise of the devastating Beasts is all but inevitable. Friends will become enemies, loyalty will be questioned at every turn, and the sacrifices that Shadow and Emerald must make to save their world may be too much for either of them to bear.",
