He’s had a taste of what most people would call success – a college degree, a well-paying office job, a beautiful wife, and a baby on the way. But his world still has a giant, gaping hole in it, right where his sense of purpose should be.If Nick is to find happiness, he will have to face his ugly past, and his own demons. As a troubled teenager during the 1990’s, he and his friends must navigate a harsh world of poverty, drugs and alcohol, broken relationships, and wasted dreams. As an adult, Nick struggles to learn from his mistakes, and to put one foot in front of the other as he searches for a life worth living.",
