  "description": "Cybele Moondragon is an unemployed English graduate student who is disillusioned with her life and tired of being in debt. She decides to resurrect a matriarchal cult based on the pagan goddess Cybele in order to make a lot of money and empower men and women who are stifled in more traditional, patriarchal religions. Cybele is joined in her quest by her best friend Janus Styx, a Psychology graduate student who helps with the funding for the cult but, unknown to Cybele, manipulates vulnerable members of the cult for his own purposes. Gabriel Anderson is an undercover investigative reporter who realizes he can get the inside scoop on the birth of a pagan cult in Winnipeg and its possible links to eco-terrorism. Cybele slowly discovers that while she leads ceremonies in hopes of showing her followers the path to spiritual enlightenment, Janus is playing a dangerous game of manipulation with his. Will Cybele succeed in resurrecting her life and ushering a new matriarchal religion into the world or will she fall prey to Janus's machinations and become the scapegoat in his quest for power and control? You'll have to read the book to find out.",
