  "description": "The writer of popular works such as The Chronicles of Narnia series for children has also touched the world with his biographical journey to Christianity. Lewis was a profound thinker with the rare ability to communicate the philosophical and theological rationale of Christianity in simple yet amazingly effective ways. In The Pilgrim's Regress, Lewis records his search for meaning and spiritiual satisfaction that eventually led him to Christianity. God in the Dock contains forty-eight essays and twelve letters that cover topics as varied as the logic of theism, good and evil, miracles, and ethics. And in Christian Reflections, he addresses Christianity and literature, Christianity and culture, petitionary prayer, modern theology, and biblical criticism.",
