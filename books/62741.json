Son afterwards she was offered a role alongside Gregory Peck in Roman Holiday, for which she collected the Best Actress Oscar. More successful parts followed: she won the Tony award for Best Actress for Ondine, captivated audiences as Natasha in War and Peace, and was highly praised for her brilliance in a serious role in The Nun's Story.Hepburn's dress sense was close to perfection and her clothes - many of the m by Givenchy, who dressed her for Funny Face in 1957 - placed her on the world's twelve Best Dressed Women list for several years. Her personality and sensuous yet untouchable beauty made her irresistible to the public.
