  "title": "Patient: Crew",
  "description": "A cryptic and fantastical adventure told from the point of view of Shanna, a farm girl from Sunny, TX. Her life has been consumed by seven voices. They control her mind and body and she can assuage them only by writing, using her ambidextrous skills, their quips. Born into scandal in the heart of a West Texas community, Shanna is forced to leave home at an early age. Her therapist's tell-all book launches a manhunt and Shanna is forced to flee again, but a psychopath who wants the crew of voices for his own has other plans. A compelling tale of loyalty, promises and truth.",
