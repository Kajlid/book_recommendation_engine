  "title": "Defrag",
  "description": "There are two kinds of Runners in Neosaka - those who believe in luck, and those who survive. Glitch, a hacker with more talent for computers than people, is one of the latter but when she is hired for a simple data-grab from the 189th floor of the Eyes in the Sky corporation, all her preparation can't avert disaster. Caught between a deadly security force and a rival team of Runners, Glitch's loyalty to her own puts her survival in jeopardy. Forced to ally with her enemies, she struggles to pull together the fragmented pieces of the job and make it out alive.  Defrag is the first book of The Glitch Logs series. Defrag is a novella-length work, approximately 100 pages long in print-version.",
