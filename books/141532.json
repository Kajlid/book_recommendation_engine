  "description": "There are many books chronicling the History of Science Fiction …But they don’t contain the landmark works themselves. Volume One of this new series has carefully curated 10 novels (including Frankenstein, by Mary Shelley, The Coming Race by Edward Bulwer-Lytton, The Mummy! by Jane Webb-Loudon) and novellas vital to the development of the genre. Some are world-famous classics, while some have unfairly been lost in the mists of obscurity. Each work is annotated in terms of its contribution to the dazzling phenomenon of modern Science Fiction in general, with an emphasis on Steampunk specifically, analyzing the politics, social issues and literary background that led to the story’s creation. The books are illustrated and unabridged, for the reader to savor.This volume FRANKENSTEIN; OR, THE MODERN PROMETHEUS, by Mary Shelley.SYMZONIA, by \"Captain Adam Seaborn\".THE MUMMY!
