Alice the chrononaut falls down an unmarked dimensional rift, or rabbit hole, which transports her to the wondrous lands as imagined by author Lewis Carroll. But this is a very real place, as any parallel reality that can be thought of can be created. Wonderland is being torn apart by warring kingdoms, cruel monarchs, cosmic corporations, odd gods, and the forces of Cthulhu! Characters from both Aliceâ€™s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There are joined by a cast of Disney-like talking animals as well as fantastical creatures such as mermaids, faeries, trolls, and minotaurs.
