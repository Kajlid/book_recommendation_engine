  "description": "(A Science Fiction Novel: The temporal war was won, but they were stranded in the past.) In Medieval Spain, when Christians and Moors fought for both land and the hearts of men, Francisco escapes from his drunken uncle. Orphaned on the streets of Toledo, Francisco has nothing more than the clothes he wore and the family’s most prized possession. A secret. A simple stone with mystic powers that heals all ills and injuries. With it, he struggles to restore his honor. Since 3188 BC, the surviving soldiers from a future time war have fought among themselves and altered Earth’s history in the guise of gods or in the cover of shadows. The Key’ari consider the Earth timeline a fresh chance to correct the errors of alternate histories, and they intend to manipulate it in hopes of creating a utopia. The other faction, the Sittiri, fear that continued intervention will further disrupt the continuum and destroy the galaxy. As the Key’ari threaten to overrun the outnumbered Sittiri, the Sittiri discover that Francisco is the answer to prophesy and could end the war. Each faction strives to recruit him without killing him or ripping the timeline again.",
