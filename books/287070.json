  "title": "Grad Night",
  "description": "This is not YA horror, and these aren’t your typical teenagers.  The teachers at DS High know something’s not right. It’s the reason they don’t stay late to grade papers, they leave school in packs so nobody’s alone, and they stay away from the one boy with the cult-like following. Evil walks the high school hallways and everyone knows its name: James Bender.  They’ve made it through the school year unscathed. Well, almost. Now, the graduating class is planning something special for their favorite teachers. It’s by personal invite only.  Teachers are dying for an invitation. Here’s yours.  Join us at this year’s Grad Night party. It’ll be one you’ll never forget.  Carver Pike takes ordinary circumstances, cinches them tight with razor wire, and then saws back and forth. Gasp for air, holler for help, and pray for an end to the madness.",
