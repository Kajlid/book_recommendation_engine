  "description": "For thousands of years, Stone Holders have lived in secret, passing the Stones from hand to hand, generation to generation. Now, with the help of satellites, algorithms and nearly limitless power, Ryzaard tracks them down. And kills them one by one. Only Matt and the two precocious children, Yarah and Leo, remain hidden. With Jessica, they’ve escaped off-planet, one big happy family, living a fairytale existence far from Earth, without fear, free from Ryzaard and his madness. Now all of that is about to change. Pulled by bizarre dreams, Matt returns to Earth to discover the truth. With each passing day, Ryzaard grows stronger, bolder, closer to achieving global domination. His final stroke will murder millions and create a new world religion. Only Matt, Jessica and the children stand in his way. As Matt begins to fight, he faces a second stark truth. Another Stone Holder with infinitely more power has joined forces with Ryzaard, sharing his hatred of Matt and the children. She’s capable of destroying worlds, entire galaxies. And she has revenge on her mind. This is Book Three of the Stones Series.",
