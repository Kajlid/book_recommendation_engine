  "description": "\"Boling threads his way through the stories of his many characters with humor, compassion and rich details of Basque tradition…Moving.\"― Washington Post Book WorldIn 1935, Miguel Navarro finds himself on the wrong side of the Spanish Nationalists, so he flees to Guernica, the most ancient town of the Basque region. In the midst of this idyllic, isolated bastion of democratic values, Miguel finds more than a new life―he finds a love that not even war, tragedy or death can destroy.The bombing of Guernica was a devastating experiment in total warfare by the German Luftwaffe in the run-up to World War II . For the Basques, it was an attack on the soul of their ancient nation. History and fiction merge seamlessly in this beautiful novel about the resilience of family, love, and tradition in the face of hardship.",
