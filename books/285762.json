  "description": "When I met Ryan, I might've been trying to break into his basement.It was for a good cause. I swear. Also, my dog broke in first.Ryan Blake is jaw-dropping handsome, wealthy, and cocky. Not quite my type. By some miracle, he doesn't call the police on me when he catches me trying to rescue my dog. He even fetches a doctor for me. Don't ask why.I don't figure I'll see him again. Then, I do. Then, he kisses me. Once. Twice. Is three times the charm? To be honest, I swooned at the first kiss.All swooning aside, we are seriously opposites. I wear cowboy boots and skirts. He wears suits and ties. He's all New York City. I'm a Southern girl looking for a new start. We even talk at different speeds.The list of things I don't expect from Ryan is long. I don't expect him to think twice about me. I don't expect him to nearly bring me to my knees with a look. I don't expect him to be so much more than I ever imagined.Â I absolutely don't expect to fall for him. So hard I'm skidding sideways just to catch my balance.",
