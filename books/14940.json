  "title": "Bubbles: Spheres I",
  "description": "An epic project in both size & purview, Sloterdijk's 3-volume, 2500-page Spheres is a late-20th-century bookend to Heidegger's Being & Time. Rejecting the century's predominant philosophical focus on temporality, Sloterdijk, self-described \"student of the air,\" reinterprets the history of Western metaphysics as an inherently spatial & immunological project, from the discovery of self (bubble) to the exploration of world (globe) to the poetics of plurality (foam). Exploring macro- & micro-space from the Greek agora to contemporary urban apartments, he's able to synthesize, with immense erudition, the spatial theories of Aristotle, Descartes, Gaston Bachelard, Walter Benjamin & Georges Bataille into a morphology of shared, or multipolar, dwelling--identifying the question of being as one bound up with the aerial technology of architectonics & anthropogenesis. He describes Bubbles, Spheres' 1st volume, as a general theory of the structures that allow couplings--or as the book's original intended subtitle put it, an \"archeology of the intimate.\" Bubbles includes a wide array of images, not to illustrate his discourse, but to offer a spatial & visual \"parallel narrative\" to his exploration of bubbles. Written over the course of a decade, the trilogy has waited another decade for its English translation from Semiotext(e). Volumes 2, Globes, & 3, Foam, will publish in coming seasons.",
