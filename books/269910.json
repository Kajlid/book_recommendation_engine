He doesn't believe a word she says—until the item is stolen right out from under them.Recovering the artifact before the real thief can unleash its ancient magic requires insider knowledge—information the mysterious trespasser possesses. Teaming up with a stranger isn't Kai's idea of smart, but he'll need all the help he can get to take on a notorious rogue and arcane power from the time of the gods.Originally published in the limited-time charity anthology, Love Potion.",
