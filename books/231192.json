  "title": "Can Homosexuality Be Healed?",
  "description": "Too often, especially in the church, the subject of homosexuality causes deep misunderstanding and painful rifts. Is it really possible to believe that homosexuals did not choose that lifestyle, and yet maintain biblically that the behavior is sinful? Yes, says author Francis MacNutt, and the prayerful result leads to a new Jesus Christ can transform the homosexual's orient-ation so that he or she can actually become heterosexual.The striking clarity and practicality of this book will guide the compassionate reader who feels intuitively (and biblically) that homosexuality is wrong but fears being labeled ignorant or \"homophobic.\" And homosexuals who want to change will find that specific prayer brings extraordinary results.",
