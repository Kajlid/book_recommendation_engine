  "title": "Sassy in Diapers",
  "description": "This is a SHORT. This is NOT a standalone full length story. It is intended to be read in order after you read the previous books.  Time to revisit Karla and Nate.  Karla Wolfe is scared. Motherhood is coming much faster than she can accept. The last thing she wants is to be a replica of her own mother.  Nate Wolfe loves his mate unconditionally. Except, he’s not really sure what’s going on with her lately. His concern for her leads him to ask his family for help.  What comes next is hilarity, romance, love, tears and babies. Will Karla figure out motherhood or will she feel lonelier than ever?  Reader's Note: If you don't like sex of any kind, this is probably not the book for you. Intended for 18+ readers only.",
