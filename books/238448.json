  "description": "Nick Reese wakes from a three-year coma to find the world he once knew is gone. An ancient virus has infected two-thirds of the world's population, turning humans into either incredibly intelligent super-humans or large and indestructible animalistic creatures. For the survivors, there is no government, no antidote, and no safety. With the help of a beautiful hematologist named Faith and a man they call the Commander, Nick must survive long enough to discover the origin of the virus and learn how his blood could hold the key to a cure. But he has to do it while being hunted by the infected. And failure means the extinction of the human race. Author and Hollywood actor John Prather intertwines history and science to create a plausible post-apocalyptic tale. The Nephilim Virus is an intense thriller implementing spiritual ideas. The Nephilim Virus is a nonstop race against time from beginning to end.",
