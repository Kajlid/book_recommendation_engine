  "description": "Sister Frevisse is sinfully good at discerning the mysteries of the soul--and solving the crimes of the human heart in this charming series.It's Christmastime, and the sisters of St. Frideswide cannot turn away travellers, even the players knocking at the nunnery door. But along with the motley troupe comes the grievously wounded husband of the cloister's scullery maid, Meg. They swear they found the drunken wastrel in a ditch, but the tale sounds like another song and dance. Especially when two dead bodies are waiting in the wings....Now Sister Frevisse must find out if one of the actors is a murderer in masquerade--or face a very unmerry Yuletide season.",
