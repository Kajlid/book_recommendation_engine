  "description": "Minnow Wilder is beautiful, broken, and in need of adventure. Her life is turned upside down after her mother dies unexpectedly, and she is forced to move to Shadow Brook with her last living relative. Everything about Shadow Brook gives her the creeps, even her familyâ€™s estate where she now lives, but Minnow soon learns that what goes bump in the night is worse than she could have ever imagined. On Halloween night, she discovers the truth about herself and her family. Armed with an ability to seduce and manipulate others, Minnow embarks on a journey to avenge her family, discover the extent of her true identity, and tame her growing attraction towards two equally unavailable men. After a series of temptation, deception, and distrust, she finds herself in the center of an ancient battle of good versus evil. Now she must decide which side she is on.",
