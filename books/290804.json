  "description": "Reynolds Walker has had enough drama and heartache to last a lifetime. Finally back on track, she’s looking forward to the quiet life she’s built for herself. When she comes home to discover her almost-fiancé dead and his killers hunting her, she’s left with no choice but to run. Little does she know that the past she’s fought so hard to escape is about to catch up with her.   Clay Buckson has carved out a new life for himself. As a member of Steele Raiders MC, he has everything he’s ever wanted, except for the one woman he can’t have—Reynolds Walker. When his world threatens to destroy hers, he has no choice but to step in. Can he save her before it’s too late, or will he lose her again forever?  Sometimes you have to fight for love, but sometimes you have to bleed for it.",
