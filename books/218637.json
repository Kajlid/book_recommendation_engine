  "description": "It was a beautiful New England beach town in which dreams were made, and love, like the tide, would fall and rise again....Kiley Harris hasn't been to her family's summer home at Hawke's Cove for nearly twenty years. As a child, she couldn't wait to be reunited with her two best beach-house friends, Grainger Egan and Mack MacKenzie. Kiley and the boys were an unshakable trio -- sailing and swimming every day, playing cards on the porch at dusk, and sharing their dreams. But everything changed the summer before they left for college, when the boys' friendship turned to rivalry over Kiley -- with tragic results. Since then Kiley has been in self-imposed exile from the place she once loved so much. But now that her parents are ready to sell the property, Kiley feels compelled to return to Hawke's Cove with her teenage son Will and come face to face with the past...and with the man who may be Will's father.Summer Harbor is a moving story of the frailties of youth, the wisdom that comes with age, and the never-ending mysteries of the heart.",
