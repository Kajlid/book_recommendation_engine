  "title": "Memento Mori",
  "description": "I is about Mori Lee Monroe, who a) writes letters to dead people, b) is spectacularly unlucky, and c) is dying of AIDS. Told in Mori's letters to the dead, the story follows Mori and her (also soon-to-be-dead) friend, Finch, as she risks her life to take a final road trip in search of immortality (and to visit everything on her list of Places to Eat Before I Die). Their route ends at her meticulously chosen cemetary plot, because Mori knows that in doing something spectacular enough for her name to live forever, eating her weight in chocolate-covered bacon, and (maybe) falling in love, she will probably lose her life.",
