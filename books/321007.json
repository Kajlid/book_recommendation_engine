  "title": "Awful Reckoning: A Cade Chase and Simon Pack Novel",
  "description": "In the heart of Silicon Valley, antifa kidnaps a Stanford student, the daughter of Wil Chambers, a man of exceptional wealth. Long ago, as football teammates at LSU, Wil and Cade Chase pledged mutual in extremis assistance. Cade drops his plans for transforming American secondary education and leaves Rockledge, not knowing when or if he will return. What follows is the toughest endeavor Cade has ever undertaken, because it challenges his conceptions of friendship, morality, right and wrong. Although this grisly tale begins with the kidnapping of Julie Chambers, it quickly morphs into something that veers far off the standard kidnap script. Cadeâ€™s tiny hand-picked squad has the courage, competence, equipment and stamina to defeat a small army. Cade is out to leave this antifa group headless. And when his mission is done, antifa will never know who swooped in to inflict this pain. But the word will get around.",
