  "description": "What happens when the lights go out and might never shine again?In The Eagle has Fallen, the United States has been attacked with an EMP device that destroys the electrical grid and renders all electronic devices unusable. America spirals into anarchy as society collapses without access to life sustaining resources, while gun barrel diplomacy becomes the only law of the land in the new Wild West. Follow James Robertson, a self-professed prepper, as he and his new extended family struggle to secure their homestead in Western Washington and rebuild a community and state in a post-apocalyptic world. Experts have suggested that 92% of the population will perish in a complete grid down scenario while James and his new allies attempt to prove them all wrong. Can the rule of law and common decency be restored faster than the hungry and despotic can tear it asunder?",
