  "description": "Six teenagers live on the same block, their lives interlaced by one common thread. Survival. Together, they form The Big Mistake Club. Rejected by their own families, they turn to each other and to Miss Cora Baker, an elderly neighbor. The club members would lie, protect at all costs, and even kill for each other. Anna commits suicide. The rest of the Mistakes vow to do whatever it takes to make it to graduation and out of the neighborhood for good. Miss Cora steps in and provides The Mistakes with a chance to change their future. She gives them a place of their own, away from their abusive parents. A sanctuary, where they feel safe and sane. Financially, she sets them upon a successful path. No matter how much Miss Cora does for them, they are still Mistakes.What started as six, is down to five. Who will make it away from the Hell they know as family? Will they keep on the successful path that has been set before them by Miss Cora and make it to graduation? Some of them will make it and some of them won’t. Abuse, sexual abuse, depression and withdrawal, losing best friends, peer pressure, and other situations that teenagers face every day, everywhere, are touched on in this book. “A modern day fairy tale for the youth too jaded to believe in Cinderella.” Sandra Ely, author and beta reader",
