  "title": "The Demon's Bride",
  "description": "I’ve belonged to a demon my entire life and nothing is my own. Not my body, which belongs to the Legion of spirits within me. Not my soul, which belongs to the demon master who’s coming to claim me tonight. Not my life, which has already been entirely decided by his cult of worshipers. Determined to live a life that belongs to me, I commit the ultimate sin and run from the only family I’ve ever known. Freedom lies in the arms of a hardhearted angel named Gavreel, but the demons we must rely on for protection from the hellish Duke who owns my soul are masters of temptation. The hardest part about saving my soul is resisting them.  Note: This is the first book in a slow burn WhyChoose romance series, stories get progressively steamier as the series continues.",
