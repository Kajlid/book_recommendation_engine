  "title": "My Two Elaines: Learning, Coping, and Surviving as an Alzheimer's Caregiver",
  "description": "Former governor of Wisconsin Martin J. Schreiber has seen his beloved wife, Elaine, gradually transform from the woman who gracefully entertained in the Executive Residence to one who no longer recognizes him as her husband. In My Two Elaines: Learning, Coping, and Surviving as an Alzheimer's Caregiver, Marty candidly counsels those who take on caregiving roles. More than an account of Marty's struggles in caring for his wife, My Two Elaines also offers sage advice that respects the one with Alzheimer's while maintaining the caregiver's health. As two-thirds of those with Alzheimer's are women, he offers special guidance for men thrust into an unexpected job. With patience, adaptability, and even a sense of humor, Marty shows how love continues for his Second Elaine.Net proceeds from the sales of My Two Elaines are used to promote Alzheimer's caregiver support.",
