  "title": "The Keeper",
  "description": "I was what I was because of a blood lust that stemmed back eons; a lust for power that was never ending and destroyed more nations than any one person could fathom.  Though Earth had always been our playground, we made it our home, and took it over in a swarm of black robes, empty promises, and even emptier hearts. My kind killed for the sake of killing. We ripped leaders to shreds just to watch them bleed. It was what we had always done, or at least that was what my father would have liked me to believe.When his happy childhood was ripped away from him by a maniacal black widow and a father that was blinded by power and greed, Declan vowed to be the last face either of them saw before they took their final breaths.  Raised a killer, labeled the most ruthless Keeper, Declan was the best at what he did—what he was bred to do—but he wanted more. As the son of the cruelest leader the world had ever seen, Declan grew to know the pain and suffering of those unfortunate enough to be under his father’s rule.  He was The Keeper. He held the key to his father’s downfall, and in a world full of deception and intrigue, he was the puppet master.***Author's Note***The Keeper is the companion novel to The Supremacy, and a reader request. The Keeper is The Supremacy from Declan's POV, plus a little more.",
