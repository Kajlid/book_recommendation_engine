  "description": "When Sloan Cartwright awakens in an African hospital with no memory, she is astounded to find three beautiful women claiming to be her wife. An attempt on her life makes her realize that her biggest problem is not which woman is her wife, but who wants to kill her and why. She discovers that she holds secrets that will topple governments and bring down illegal poachers in Africa. The only problem is that Sloan can’t remember where she hid the evidence. Sloan quickly realizes that she must trust one of the women to help her escape Africa. Which one will it be? Wife Number Amarosia (Amy) Cartwright, a beautiful Halle Berry look-a-like who tells Sloan that they have been married for five years and make their home in Africa. Wife Number Leigh Redding Cartwright, blonde, wholesome, girl-next-door beauty who obviously adores Sloan and claims they have been married for seven years and live in New York. Wife Number Alexandra Roland Cartwright, gorgeous international business mogul who has flown into Africa to take her wife home with her. Sloan isn’t sure it is her the women want or the evidence she has hidden. You will laugh and cheer for Sloan as she juggles the three beauties while trying to stay alive and escape from a country where everyone wants her dead.",
