  "description": "Supermodel Jayme Alan has strutted on catwalks all over the world, but his glamorous career comes to an end when his boyfriend, celebrity designer Victor Velasquez, dumps him for a younger man. After drowning his sorrows in alcohol, Jayme gets a chance to make a comeback. It's only a small show in Key West, but it includes a week's vacation at the clothing-optional gay resort, TomCats. It's lust at first sight when Torque Bowman, part owner of TomCats, meets Jayme. Torque thinks he's found the submissive man he's been looking for and he plans to ask Jayme to extend his visit. But when Torque finds a magazine article about Jayme and Victor, he flies into a jealous rage and breaks off all contact with the model. A hurt Jayme flies back to New York and eases the pain by throwing himself into his career. Torque discovers the truth, but is it too late for another shot at love?",
