  "description": "Cosmina, Alexandria and Daniela were quite the sight. Their beautiful dark Gypsy looks hid the darker side of their heritage, as the men in their lives would soon find out. Caught in their alluring web; humiliation, desperation and hilarity ensue when they each foolishly get on their bad side. In this War of the Sexes, the men have no chance!  Enjoy this femdom tale of magic, revenge, forced CFNM, and endless teasing and denial as three desperate men all suffer under the Gypsy magic of the very gorgeous, but equally dangerous Three Enchantress Sisters!",
