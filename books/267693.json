Pursued by a vicious military general who wants them dead or alive, Tess has to decide if she can trust Shade Ganavan, a tall, dark and arrogant stranger with ambiguous motivations.\nShade Ganavan had oodles of arrogance, oodles of charm, and oodles of something that made me want to kick him in the nuts.\nWhat Tess and Shade don't know about each other might get them killed... unless they can set aside their differences and learn to trust each other - while ignoring their off-the-charts chemistry.\nShade swallowed the bad taste in his mouth. Two hundred million. He could buy back his birthright and live like a king forever on that. \n\nCaptain T. Bailey.\n\nBeautiful. Ballsy. And Brave.\n\nA wanted criminal.\n\nIndecision clawed at his chest. He knew where she was.\n\nThe easiest nab and grab of his life was waiting for him. He could land two hundred million in his account. Double that if she still had the goods.",
