  "description": "Niklosi Jevasari, Valendran prankster and deadly warrior, vowed he was going to avoid a mate for as long as he could. Nik liked nothing more than his life of missions and danger, living only to work hard and play even harder, taking nothing seriously if he didn’t have to.  BJ Markson was a small town cop with more cows in her jurisdiction than people and less drama than drying paint. One night when she’s called out on a noise complaint, she finds a dangerous stranger killing another man and turning his body to dust.  Suddenly, the warrior who hates complications and the cop who doesn’t believe in anything are going to clash in a battle of wills and beliefs that will end with one life changing forever and the other begging for a chance to escape . . . Niklosi’s Nightmare.",
