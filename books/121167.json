  "description": "What if it takes a monster to save a kingdom?I'll never forget the sight of my little sister's lifeless bodyâ€”or that my rogue magic killed her.Sorcery like mine is punishable by death. So I live in the shadows, stealing from the corrupt to give to the needy. Maybe a little good can wash the blood from my hands.It seems like a decent plan... until I try to help a dying noblewoman and somehow steal her soul instead.Now her ghost is demanding I take up the quest that got her killed: exposing a conspiracy at the royal college to unleash a deadly power on the entire kingdom.Do I want to infiltrate the cutthroat world of haughty elites? Gods, no. But if I can save the kingdom, I could save my own soul too.So I'll pose as a refined lady, attending their classes and fancy balls, sneaking and spying like I learned on the streets. But I can't tackle this threat alone. I'll need to win the trust of the dead woman's allies: four arrogant noblemen.Four damaged yet dangerously enticing men. No matter what they stir in my heart, I can't afford to let them get too close.Because if they discover the monstrous things I'm capable of, saving my soul will be the least of my worries...*Thief of Silver and Souls is the first in a new fantasy romance series full of forbidden magic, impossible love, hot damaged men, and a rebellious heroine who's so much more than she imagines.*",
