Then they will find peace. Not so. Charles is still on the loose, and has become so powerful that even capturing and imprisoning him won't stop him. Space is being pioneered in the future using, unfortunately, time travel, and a virulent blend of intelligent life is heading toward Earth. Finally, the false realities created by the missions to capture Charles are encroaching on the lives of Dani and Aideen and threatening the reality in which all of humanity resides. Someone must restore The Balance of Time, before it's too late.",
