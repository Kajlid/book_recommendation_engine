  "description": "Hospitals are for dying. At least, that was the case with Pemberton Freebody. The Long Island hospital surgeon testified that Freebody died of a self-inflicted wound. The insurance company was happy not to pay up on his $100,000 policy. But the Sloan Guaranty Trust and John Putnam Thatcher ordered their own autopsy—with damning results. When unnatural death struck again, it was clear that someone was prescribing murder as the best antidote to hospital scandal.(Publisher’s description)",
