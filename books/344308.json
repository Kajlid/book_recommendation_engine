  "description": "Danny is a teacher in small town Colorado, trying to live down his wild teenage years and living his life the only way he knows how; one day at a time. He's had a tough time of it, but Danny figures he's managed to become respectable, or at least less than notorious. The last person he expects to ever see back in town is Harlan Quinn, his old best friend and consummate bad boy. And when he finds out Quinn is the new Sheriff it's even more of a shock. Quinn knows there's more to his old hometown than meets the eye. There's trouble brewing, big enough trouble that he's willing to go undercover to figure out who's behind it. Quinn knows there's more to Danny than old memories and quiet living, too. There was a lot of passion in his old friend once upon a time, and he's willing to bet it's still there if he scratches the surface. He sets out to stir things up in more ways than one, pushing Danny to admit that there's more to life than he has, and that their old town just might manage to be new again.",
