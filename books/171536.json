Chase Wright is perfect. And hot. I mean like, burn up your dress hot. However, Chase isn't professional at all. I hate what he does to me with his sinfully sexy blue eyes. I hate that he wants me in his bed.  One month…that’s all I need him for. All I have to do is stay out of his bed.  But the rules slowly begin to change. My fake fiancé suddenly becomes my fake husband. When Chase offers me an indecent proposal, it's too late to fire him. It's too late to decline.  Authors note: Full-length novel. Due to sexy, steamy situations only for readers 18+ Includes free prequel novella THAT GUY",
