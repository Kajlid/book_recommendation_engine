  "description": "Xylon Warriors - Initiation By Ruth D. Kerce Book 1 in the Xylon Warriors series Warrior Braden Koll is on a mission to retrieve DNA-compatible women for breeding on the planet of Xylon. His current assignment is to locate an Earth woman-Alexa Sandor-found to be a match, and sexually initiate her into The Lair of Xylon. The lesser problem is she doesn't know anything about The Lair, him, or that she is a Xylon by birth. The greater problem is that, after meeting Alexa, Braden wants this woman for himself, even though the Warrior Council decreed she must mate another. Alexa Sandor is experiencing nightmares about a strange planet and a responsibility she doesn't understand. Now a man, supposedly from that planet, has come to \"initiate\" her into their society. The sexual ceremony, he explains, is to prepare her for breeding, so she can help produce children to save Xylon from domination by the Egesa-a half-creature, half-humanoid race of Slave Masters. Despite her initial disbelief, this powerful, sexy man captures her heart with his strength and tenderness. He shows her things about herself and her body that she never thought possible. Ultimately, she believes his story, wants to help, and stay by his side forever. But. She needs to find the strength to leave Earth and travel to an unknown planet. If she can't, she will have to turn away from the only man she's ever loved. And her decision will not only affect the future of Xylon, but Earth as well.",
