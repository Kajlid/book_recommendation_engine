  "title": "Order of Chivalry",
  "description": "An archaic guild known as Black Serpent needs to locate the questionable Thirteenth Knight’s body and revive him using the Holy Grail to break a curse inflicted on them by the warlock Merlin. The grail is in shatters, and the pieces are possessed by the descendants of King Arthur’s Knights of the Round Table, so Black Serpent must hunt them down to complete the chalice. However, Merlin has other plans, and he recruits the remaining descendants - now deemed the Order of Chivalry - as guardians to the Holy Grail’s remains. Will the renewed, unseasoned order succeed in keeping the fragments safe from the cursed creed by working as a functioning unit or crumble under their grapple with ego, conflicting ideals, and fear?",
