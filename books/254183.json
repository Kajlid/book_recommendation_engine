A roomful of weeping women and me the wrong side of the door.’‘Maud watched her sister twitch, three, four times, then peace and stillness.’‘A little Sambuca spurted from my mouth and landed on her fringe, but she was too far gone to notice.’‘He loved to sniff her all over. She was clean and  full with high-end product.’‘I’m eating myself.’ A wild animal scream rips  from her throat.’",
