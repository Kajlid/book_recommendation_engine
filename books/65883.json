  "description": "When her husband is brutally murdered in broad daylight, activist-turned-schoolteacher Rosa Rios finds herself immersed in the blood soaked world of the Mexican drug cartels. She and her fly-by-night sister Mercedes travel across a lush, storied Latin American landscape, from the decaying seaside city of Acapulco to the mystical pyramids of Palenque. Rosaâ€™s quest for vengeance leads her to Ponchis, a brash young assassin whose actions determine the future of La Familia, the most prominent of the cartels. With him is Bruce, the charming American pilot with a nightmarish past. When American and Mexican politics collide with the world of organized crime and corruption is the norm, who can be trusted? Only the supposedly psychic healer Tamara Castro may know for sure.The Mexican Rose is the first book in the House Of Cartels Trilogy by author Alex St. Clair. It bluntly depicts the erosion of the Mexican way of life in a way that shocks, educates and entertains.",
