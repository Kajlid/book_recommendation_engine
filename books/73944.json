  "description": "In this children's picture book for ages 4-7, what happens in FrogBog Forest doesn't always stay in FrogBog Forest. An incurably curious secondgrader and her little brother, despite admonitions from teacher and parent, venture into a strange, yet beautiful forest. What is at first enchanting and fun, becomes a heart-thumping adventure to find their way back home. Desperate help comes in the form of Dennis, a frog like no other in the world. Along the way, the children learn a heart-felt lesson in returning the kindness of strangers.",
