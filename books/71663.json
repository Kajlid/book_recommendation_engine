  "description": "Artist Adele Proust is over her ex, activist Jack Thomas — well, sort of.. At a 3-chord punk bar, she slams down a Shiner to forget him, but when shouts of “Fire!” send the nightclub into chaos, Adele stumbles over a slashed-up corpse. The details of that murder scene etch into her memory, then she’s yanked away. The nightclub is in flames. Any clues to the slasher burn with the corpse, until Adele brings them back in a painting--reversed. She paints the background huge and the victim small. Her signature technique, reverse perspective, brings out a pivotal clue: a paper currency strap. Thugs with big guns come after her. Sure, the FBI can protect her, but they want something too. That victim was one of their agents and the murder suspects include Jack Thomas and her best friend, Marvin. Without explaining much, the FBI asks Adele to spy on her friends, for her country. Adele refuses until someone starts killing them off.",
