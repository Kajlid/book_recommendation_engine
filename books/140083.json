  "description": "Vengeance or Forgiveness? What would you choose? Being a teenager has its ups and downs. Ups? Hot boys, the mall, best friends, dreams of an amazing future. So much potential. Downs? Hot boys, parental drama, frenemies, emotional craziness, snakes emerging from your head when angry… Yeah, I was surprised, too. How am I supposed to stay on my carefully planned path when my true biological heritage presents its ugly head—ahem, heads. And when the messengers of my so-called destiny happen to be two of the most incredibly hot and irritating males on the planet, I’m left fantasizing about my previously boring life. Am I supposed to believe that my duty is to seek vengeance? Or to grant mercy to the offender? And how on earth am I qualified to make these decisions? I’m bound to make mistakes along the way, but keep your fingers crossed that I don’t inadvertently send the world to Tartarus in a hand basket.",
