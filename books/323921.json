  "description": "Silas Spencer had a gift, but potential lovers tended to bolt when he tried to explain that he could see and speak with 'displaced' spirits who needed guidance or help. He thought he'd found someone special in co-worker Josh Dalton, but Josh saw their night together as a moment of weakness he could never allow himself to repeat. When Josh's deceased mother appears to Silas asking for his help to make things right with her son, Silas can't bring himself to say no, even though it could lead to a badly broken heart.",
