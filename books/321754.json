Not only did we continue to push him to be as controversial and funny as he possible could, but we wanted to know what questions he would ask the celebrities he truly admires the most.It's no secret that Jimmy inspires to a lot of celebrities around the world, but who will save his blushes, as we insist he must ask this talented group of people the questions nobody has ever dared to ask them before? Will he be able to avoid asking Kylie a question about her bum? Will he get starstruck talking to Robson for the first time? Will Jimmy be able to deal with Mr Willis, when clearly the name Tudeski will cause conflict between him and his boyhood hero?Twenty-three UK and American celebrities to interview and talk about, but the question is â€“ Who would you interview and what would you ask them given the choice? Jimmy Tudeski didn't have a choice, we insisted he do this!",
