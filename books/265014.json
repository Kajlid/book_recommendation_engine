  "description": "They say opposites attract.I never believed that until I met Abby.I was an Ivy League student, the eldest son of an affluent family, living a life of luxury and rubbing elbows with D.C.'s elite. Sounds great, right?Too bad prestige comes with a price.When the expectations became too much, I decided to escape to the hills of West Virginia with my best friend for a summer of fun, some R & R and a little white water rafting. I wanted to lose myself in the outdoors, but instead found her—a petite waitress and all around spitfire—she knocked me off my game, making me want more than the casual, no strings attached relationships I was used to.To me, she's not just another summer fling.She's something that could last.",
