  "description": "My name is Justin, and when I was seventeen, I fell in love with a boy named Damon.Damon was sick, only I didn’t know it at the time. And like any disease left untreated, it festered and burrowed into the unaffected areas of us, until we were both so far from healthy, we were killing one another. Then a tragedy sparked our implosion.With nothing of us remaining to salvage, I was left to pick up the pieces, while Damon found his escape in the abyss. Leaving me alone with his alter, Blake. Damon and Blake are two halves of a whole. But Damon is the coldest part of darkness, and Blake the warmest part of light. Which form of ecstasy would you choose? I love Blake with a ferocious intensity akin to the peeling back of skin. Except Blake isn’t Damon, but Damon was gone—until now. What once threatened to tear us apart has become our catharsis.Outnumbered in a relationship with the man who is my life, I’ve begun to learn more about love than I ever thought possible.But can our love survive the merge? **Please use the Amazon \"Look Inside\" feature for a list of what to expect.",
