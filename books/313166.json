  "description": "Pumpkin spice has never been my thing. But you know what is? Doctor Tanner Hayes, the new gynecologist in Stone Creek who’s so good looking that he has all of the women in town ready to drop their pants.I wasn’t planning on staying in town long after Thanksgiving. It was supposed to be a quick visit to see my dad and his new family, and then I’d be on my way to figure out my next step, whatever that was.Unfortunately, Tanner is as delicious as a forbidden piece of fruit and suddenly, I’m ravenous. But I’ve learned the hard way not to get too close and to keep my distance. My heart tells me that I should walk away, but the problem is that I can’t.I made a promise to my mother on her deathbed that I would live my life and be happy, so why does it feel like I’m making a huge mistake?",
