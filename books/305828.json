  "description": "A Dark Enemies To Lovers Mafia Romance. The deal was sealed the moment she stepped onto that stage. It was like seeing a ghost. Sunshine blonde hair, pale skin, and azure eyes that held a thousand secrets. I didn’t know what caused her to end up on that auction block. And I didn’t care either. All I knew was that I had to have her…no matter the cost. One-million dollars later and she became just that. Mine to break. Mine to use. Mine to keep. We all have secrets, and when I discover hers, no one will be able to save her from me. *This is a complete standalone, 100k+ word novel. It contains dark themes, including violence and sexual situations. As always there is no cheating, and a happily ever after.*",
