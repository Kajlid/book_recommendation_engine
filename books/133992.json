  "description": "In the mountains of East Tennessee lies the town of Elders Keep. Things aren't exactly right in the Keep, and as the town heads towards the holiday season, the evil force that lives within the woods comes pulsing to the forefront.  It's all downhill to New Years, and no one in the Keep is safe.  This collection of eight short stories is your invitation to join the citizens of Elders Keep as they make their way through a harrowing holiday season.  Only the dark and twisted mind of Jeffery X Martin could create a town where humor and terror live side by side in such harmonious agony.  Welcome to Elders Keep. If you lived here, you'd be dead by now.",
