  "title": "The Love of a Master",
  "description": "There are good-looking, willing young men in every hidden corner of America — men like Tim and Marc who know a worthy top when they see him. John Preston’s powerful and darkly insightful classic The Love of a Master follows the Master’s patient, deliberate, and wickedly inventive training of his two boyish but determined devotees as they release themselves to their submissive natures, to the “fear and anticipation” that come with true service. Will Tim step up on the slave block and give himself body and soul to the highest bidder? Will his friend Marc do the same or accept the Master’s rare offer of a permanent — if painful — position in his home?A legend in gay porn, Preston drew on his extensive knowledge of the S/M scene of the '80s to create this hot, savage, and psychologically penetrating portrayal of S/M power exchange between men.",
