  "description": "LAURA DELACROIX BELL--this dazzling trust fund girl's size 14 figure doesn't stop her from attracting the sexiest scoundrel in town, or the admiring eye of the Glass Slipper Club. However, a salacious secret could take her out of the running. Michelle Mac Mackenzie--brainy, cynical, and maybe a tad judgmental, Mac would rather bury her nose in a good book than embrace her deb destiny. But being a debutante was her late mother's dream. Ginger Fore--this adorable tree-hugger wants to wear her grandmother's vintage ball gown instead of splurging on an expensive dress. Yet when she gets tangled up with an older guy, Ginger will have plenty more to think about. Jo-Lynn Bidwill--a former child beauty queen, Jo-Lynn is a bitchy vamp who makes it her mission in life to take out the debu-trash. And Jo-Lynn's sights are set on Laura Bell. From the Trade Paperback edition.",
