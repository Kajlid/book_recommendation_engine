  "title": "The Fall of the Dragon King",
  "description": "The line of Dragon Kings has ruled for a thousand years under the weight of a prophecy that their pride would one day bring about the end of the world. Prince Hadrin, next in line for the Dragon Throne, had given this prophecy no more thought than any of his forebears until increasingly violent earthquakes cause everyone to fear the prophecy may be coming true. Now, presented with the chance to avert this fate, Hadrin embraces a second prophecy and agrees to marry Father Mora, a priest descended from the holy man who saved the world a thousand years ago. But his decision is met with resistance on all sides, and Hadrin is left to hope that his and Mora's commitement to each other will utimately save the world from destruction.",
