After leaving Earth, Syd learned the truth of his father's disappearance on the planet Ashfall--his father had died protecting a devastating secret about the history between humans and Denzans.Syd is now faced with a choice--free humanity from imprisonment on Earth, which will allow them to come into physical power beyond their wildest dreams; or destroy Earth so that humans never have a chance to enslave, torment, and kill other species again. It has been prophesied that Syd is destined to become a world-killer, but Syd is determined to choose his own fate, and knows there must be another path forward that will honor his father's sacrifice.",
