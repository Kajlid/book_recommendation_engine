  "description": "For some, knowing the truth is worse than living a lie.\nEverly Martin, eighteen years old and fiercely ambitious, takes pity on Nicolai after accidentally swiping right on a dating app. She doesn't have time for love, not with her desperation to finish college and earn enough money to help her single mom pay the bills. But from the moment they meet at a coffee shop, Nicolai terrifies her with the instant connection they form. He couldn't have come at a worse time, because that same morning, Everly learns she's pregnant. And to make matters worse, she isn't sure who the father of her child is. Though Everly is determined to stay far away from Nicolai, he reappears in her life, this time in a way she can't ignore. While fighting her growing attraction for him, Everly is haunted by the knowledge that her baby's father might actually be a terrible person. She's willing to find out, even if learning the truth ultimately ends in heartbreak. Nicolai might not have a place in Everly's future, but when he helps her discover a shocking truth about her past—a truth that could either change everything for the better, or destroy it even more—Everly must decide what's more important: giving her child the life she's always wanted, or following her heart and choosing love.",
