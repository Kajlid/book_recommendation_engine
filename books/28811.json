  "description": "Larry and Allison rang in 2020 with high hopes for the year ahead. On the surface, they appeared to live a blissful version of his latest fairytale. Life seemed almost too good to be true. Then, Carla Kimbrel interviewed the author and sparked something deep inside him. Against Allison's wishes, Larry began taking notes for book three... He was more intrigued by the sexy thirty-something flirt than he wanted to admit. Days later, in a harried call, Carla informed him of a global conspiracy she had been researching. The two agreed to meet so she could explain how her ex was The Monster behind a virus cover-up that would cause a global pandemic. But when Carla mysteriously ends all communication, Larry realizes nothing is as it seems. Was Allison too close to the doctor who dated Carla? Did Carla cancel the authorâ€™s interview because of it? Or, did Carla come into Larry's life for a different reason? While this dark fairytale played out at a time of pandemonium, Larry desperately searched for answers to a storyline that put their relationship to the ultimate test.",
