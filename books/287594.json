  "description": "This just in: your favorite purr-nalists are back and reporting on all of the most pressing cat issues in this fourth collection of Breaking Cat News comics for middle-grade readers.Anchor cat Lupin and his faithful field reporters, Elvis and Puck, are as cute and funny as ever in Elvis Puffs Out. There’s no shortage of news to cover this time around: In the wake of a winter snowstorm, the team tries their hand at meteorology (with mixed results). Man and Woman nurse a stranded kitten back to health. And the pessimistic, straight-laced Elvis demonstrates that even he has a soft side. The fun continues in the “More to Explore” section, with lessons on wooden-spoon puppet theaters, the basics of reporting your own news stories, and—as always—charming paper dolls to craft.",
