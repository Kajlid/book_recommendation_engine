  "description": "I’m not the type of girl who picks up a man on a rooftop bar.Not the kind of girl who lets a man’s hands roam my body, discovering I have no panties on.Never the girl who has hours’ worth of o’s from a smoking-hot one-night stand.But Dominick makes it so easy to say yes.His body, his moves, and his oh-so-wicked tongue have me saying it over and over again.Yes, please.Yes, more.Yes, right there.He worships every inch of my body, and I’m still sore the next morning when I meet him again.This time, he’s Mr. Dalton, my sister’s cutthroat entertainment lawyer.And he has a proposition for me.He wants to make me famous.Of course, that means sharing a screen with my wildly jealous sister.It means giving up my career.It means the whole world will suddenly know everything about me.Which presents one catastrophic problem—Dominick doesn’t date famous people. So, do I take a chance at becoming a Hollywood star, or do I pass up the opportunity to be with the man who gave me a taste of forever?",
