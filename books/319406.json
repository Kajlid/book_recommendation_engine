  "title": "Experiments in Imagining Otherwise",
  "description": "We collectively build and collectively shatterâ€”every broken window is a new opportunity; every burnt ember is construction material.This is a book of failure and mistakes; it begins with what is stolen from us and proposes only an invitation to imagine.In these playful written experiments, Lola Olufemi deftly navigates the space between what we have been told, what we know to be true and what we cannot yet conceive. Weaving together fragmentary reflections and prose poetry, this is an exploration of the possibility of living differently, grounded in black feminist scholarship and community work.Olufemi shows that the horizon is not an immaterial state we gesture toward. Instead, propelled by the motion of thinking against and beyond, we must invent the future now and never let go of the otherwise.",
