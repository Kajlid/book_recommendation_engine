  "description": "The empty bar that someone was supposed to swing to himDid not arrive, & so his outstretched flesh itself becameA darkening trapeze. The two other acrobats were thieves.--from \"Elegy with a Darkening Trapeze Inside It\"The Darkening Trapeze collects the last poems by Larry Levis, written during the extraordinary blaze of his final years when his poetry expanded into the ambitious operatic masterpieces he is known for. Edited and with an afterword by David St. John and published twenty years after Levis's death, this collection contains major unpublished works, including final elegies, brief lyrics, and a coda believed to be the last poem Levis wrote, a heart-wrenching poem about his son. The Darkening Trapeze is an astonishing collection by a poet many consider to be among the greatest of late-twentieth-century American poetry.",
