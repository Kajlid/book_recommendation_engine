  "description": "It began as Global Warming, and then worsened to become known in the 22nd century as the Horrific Decline. Unless something drastic was done, the human race faced certain extinction. But because it had already progressed beyond the point of no return, nothing could be done to avert that fate €¦ unless they could somehow make changes to the past.Part science-fantasy and part romance, both serious and fun, Grave New World takes you on a new kind of adventure with intense and surprising turns. It is fiction to be enjoyed.€œWe humans are the only species capable of bringing about our own extinction, and the only species so inclined. I wrote Grave New World to help raise the public consciousness about the perils of global warming and climate change, and to underscore our responsibilities for keeping this extraordinary planet a place where life can flourish.€€” ken sheffer",
