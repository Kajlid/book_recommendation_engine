  "description": "Bad-girl Brett Higgins is used to waking up next to beautiful women she hardly knows. Problem is, this one's dead.Tough, sexy, and dangerous, former underworld figure Brett Higgins knows the dark side of desire. But thanks to the love of ex-policewoman Allie Sullivan, all that has changed. Once of great interest to the Vice Squad, Brett's adult entertainment business is now completely legit. And her only personal vice is a penchant for steamy cyber-sex. But if keeping her hands on the keyboard keeps them off other women, that's better than cheating, right?Unfortunately, Brett's interludes on the Internet leave her vulnerable to someone from her shadowy past. Now the target of a terrifying conspiracy, Brett has no choice but to run. The pursuing police think she's trying to get away with murder. If her enemies find her first, she'll be lucky to get away alive.",
