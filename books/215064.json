  "description": "Fired from his job at the Supernatural Enforcers Agency due to his short fuse, Zane Matthews starts his own detective agency. Mostly it’s cheating spouses, with a little bit of underwear theft, and Zane spends his days trying to learn how to control his anger and get back into the SEA. But that changes when the beautiful and kind Sky Danvers walks into his office. She thinks she’s being stalked, and his howling bear will do anything to protect her. Even if it involves attending yoga classes and eating tofu.  But rare species are going missing across the country, and Sky is the rarest of them all. Can he save her, learn how to control his temper and prove he’s the man she needs?  Caution! This does contain swearing (there’s a lot of use of the f word!), as well as scenes of a sexual nature with m/f interaction intended for mature readers.",
