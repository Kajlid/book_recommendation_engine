  "title": "Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault: Essays from the Grown-up Years",
  "description": "From the iconic creator of the \"Cathy\" comic strip comes a collection of funny, warm, and wise essays in the style of Nora Ephron and Erma Bombeck, centered around the particular challenge of caring for aging parents and growing children, all while trying not to lose oneself in the process.As the creator of the \"Cathy\" comic strip, Cathy Guisewite found her way into the hearts of readers over 40 years ago, and has been there ever since. Her deeply funny and relatable look at the life of a frazzled career woman became a cultural touchstone for women everywhere, and now, in her debut essay collection, Guisewite returns with her signature self-deprecating wit and warmth, this time taking a look at her own life. The autobiographical essays that make up Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault offer a disarming, hilarious, and wise look at the lives of \"the sandwich generation,\" which Guisewite calls \"the panini generation.\" In this collection, Guisewite turns her uniquely wry and funny gaze to her own day-to-day life, with topics ranging from the mundane--teaching her parents to use TiVo, organizing four decades of photos, attempting to meditate--to the more profound--her struggle to find a purpose post-retirement, helping her parents downsize their lives, and her personal definitions of feminism. Humorous, warm, and poignant, Fifty Things That Aren't My Fault is ideal reading for mothers, daughters, and everyone who is caught somewhere in between, and on the threshold of \"What Happens Next.\"",
