  "description": "When your mind is a weapon, freedom comes at a price.The final installment of the Mindjack Trilogy is here! Four months have passed since Kira left home to join Julian’s Jacker Freedom Alliance, but the hole in her heart still whistles empty where her boyfriend Raf used to be. She fills it with weapons training, JFA patrols, and an obsessive hunt for FBI agent Kestrel, ignoring Julian’s worries about her safety and repeated attempts to recruit her for his revolutionary chat-casts. When anti-jacker politician Vellus surrounds Jackertown with the National Guard, Kira discovers there’s more to Julian’s concerns than she knew, but she’s forced to take on a mission that neither want and that might be her last: assassinating Senator Vellus before he can snuff out Julian’s revolution and the jackers she’s come to love.For more information, see the Mindjack website.In the meantime, you may want to check out my Mindjack Origins short stories!Mindjack Trilogy (novels): Open Minds, Closed Hearts, Free SoulsMindjack Origins Collection includes: 3 mindjack novellas (Mind Games, The Handler, The Scribe), EXCLUSIVE DELETED SCENES from Free Souls, and moreRecommended Reading OrderMind Games (prequel short story to Open Minds)Open MindsThe HandlerThe ScribeClosed HeartsFree SoulsMindjack Origins Collection",
