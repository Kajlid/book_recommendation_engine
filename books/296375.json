Except none of them can recall exactly how they came to be there, or what they are supposed to do. Dystopia. Where are the others? There must have been others. It's a huge facility, after all. It must be some sort of experiment. They're test subjects. How long have they been there? When will they get out? How come there has been no outside contact? Utopia or dystopia. As the questions mount, so does the tension. Who will escape Armageddon House?Michael Griffin's riveting new novella ARMAGEDDON HOUSE grabs you and doesn't let go. It will stay with you long after you've turned the last page. This is a haunted house of a different sort.",
