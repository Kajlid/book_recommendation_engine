Werewolves, vampires, or even worse. Being a shapeshifter is my blood. Am I a boy? Am I a beast? Maybe now I have the power to stand up and find out what happened to my mom (with the help of Uncle Van Helsing, of course).Thus begins the story of Mr. Rushin, a vampire-werewolf hybrid (a verewolf) and his adventures through time to stop the diabolical plans of Dr. Frankenstein.",
