  "title": "Thomas' Christmas Delivery",
  "description": "It is Christmas eve, and Thomas wishes he was safe and warm in his shed with the other engines. But Thomas is a Really Useful Engine and has several important deliveries to make. Will he get home in time to make sure his stocking has been carefully hung? And when a big blizzard blows up, Thomas fears that Father Christmas may not find the engine shed at all.The Reverend W Awdry first started telling his young son tales of Thomas, Percy and the other Really Useful Engines in 1944. In 1945, he started writing the tales down, and upon their publication they were immediately embraced by train lovers in Great Britain and worldwide. Before his death in 1997, the Reverend wrote 26 volumes of stories that continue to thrill generations of young readers.",
