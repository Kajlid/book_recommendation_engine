  "description": "Things could be worse for LAPD Detective, Kate Sexton. Okay, so her ex-husband cheated on her and the DVD of his indiscretions made the rounds of the entire department, she's broke and living above an appliance store with her canine partner, Bernie, who is a sexual predator, her British friend, Natalie, has a vocabulary that would make Howard Stern blush, and her mother is hallucinating about having sex with a dead president.But things could get worse, like Kate could be stalked by a sadistic serial killer while she tries to solve a thirty year-old murder and save the life and reputation of a cop wanted for the crime. Come to think of it, maybe things couldn't get any worse because this is Kate's life.Can Kate elude the killer, solve the cold case, keep Bernieâ€™s sexual wanderlust under control, keep her best friend out of trouble, save a cop from death row, and find love again? Only time, loads of trouble, and tons of laughs will tell. Hollywood Assassin has more twists and turns than a car chase down Sunset Strip with a Hollywood starlet at the wheel.Hollywood Assassin is the first book in the Hollywood Alphabet Series.",
