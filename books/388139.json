  "description": "THE STROKE OF SURPRISINGLY GENTLE HANDS ...THE FLASH OF FATHOMLESS BLUE EYES ...THE SCORCH OF WHITE-HOT KISSES ...And once again, Harriet Ginoza was swept away into rapturous fantasy. The up-to-date psychologist knew the object of her desire was all she should despise, yet time after time, she lost herself in visions of a dangerously handsome rogue straight out of a historical romance.As politically incorrect as her dream lover was, Harriet never believed he would cause her any trouble. Then a twist of fate cast her back to the Old South, and she met him in the flesh. But to her disappointment, Etienne Baptiste refused to ravish her --- or fulfill her other secret wishes. If Harriet had any hope of making her amorous illusions become passionate reality, she'd have to seduce the charming Creole with a sweeter savage love than she'd imagined possible ... and savor every minute of it.",
