  "description": "Shelly Myers has finally rebuilt her life two years after her new husband, a Dallas police detective, was gunned down on the church steps minutes after they'd said, \"I do.\" She returned to her beloved Smoky Mountains in Tennessee to help her parents run their cabin rental and river rafting business -- and to heal. Now, the murderer she helped send to death row has been released because of bungled evidence, and Troy's partner, Detective Reed Tanner, has arrived on her doorstep to protect her from Eddie Victor, who has sworn to kill them both. Reed is determined to protect Shelly like he didn't protect Troy. But Reed isn't prepared for the attraction he feels toward Shelly or the fact that she obviously feels the same way toward him.",
