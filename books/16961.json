  "description": "A biography of the metrosexual. By his dad.Back in the flaky-skinned Nineties, Mark Simpson predicted the future of men was metrosexual. The fully-hydrated 21st Century has proved him so right.But, argues Simpson, contrary to what you have been told, metrosexuality is not about flip-flops and facials, ‘man-bags’ or ‘manscara’. Or about men becoming ‘girlie’ or ‘gay’. It’s about men becoming everything.\"Metrosexuality is the end of the sexual division of bathroom and bedroom labour. In fact, it’s the end of 'sexuality' as we’ve known it.\"More fun-packed than Beck’s bulging briefs, or Ronaldo’s ego, Metrosexy will leave you gasping and giggling and gagging for more.PRAISE FOR SIMPSON AND “Wildly intelligent and terrifyingly funny, his outlandish predictions on the fate of mankind have all proved unnervingly prescient. I dread to think what he might come up with next. Read him at your leisure but ignore him at your peril.” – Jake Arnott, author of ‘The Long Firm’\"Much has been written about metrosexuals, but no one has done it as well as the man credited with coining the term, Mark Simpson.\" – The Times of India“Simpson writes with enough panache to make most of his contemporaries toss their laptops in the waste-disposal and weep.” – Independent on Sunday",
