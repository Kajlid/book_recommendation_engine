  "description": "Three girls. Three boys. One of them's a total psycho.It's teenage life as it really feels. Only funnier.The Ashbury-Brookfield pen pal program was designed to bring together the \"lowlife Brooker kids\" (as they're known to the Ashburyites) and the \"rich Ashbury snobs\" (as they're called by the Brookfielders) in a spirit of harmony and the Joy of the Envelope. But things don't go quite as planned. Lydia and Sebastian trade challenges, like setting off the fire alarm at Brookfield. Emily tutors Charlie in How to Go On a Date with a Girl. But it's Cassie and Matthew who both reveal and conceal the most about themselves -- and it's their secrets and lies that set off a war between the two schools.",
