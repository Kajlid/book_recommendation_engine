  "description": "Pawfiles presents a dog-by-dog glimpse at the personalities and character quirks behind some of her favorite subjects.In what other book of portraiture will you find a model bio that includes \"chases rats and pigeons\" followed by \"loves filet mignon and creme brulee\"?Welcome to the dog-centric world of photographer Kim Levin. Nearly a decade ago, Levin began shooting photos of dogs (and occasionally cats) in and around Central Park. What began as a dog-loving photographer's hobby has blossomed into a successful career as a pet portrait artist nonpareil. With nine books of dog photos to her credit and a booming portrait business, Levin has become a virtual Avedon for the pet set.Pawfiles is filled with portraits by turns charming, touching, and goofy. Each dog's mini-portfolio is accompanied by its stats (age, breed, and home) and a short but revealing \"about the model\" statement. About Oliver, a 2-year-old English bulldog, we learn of a Beanie Baby obsession. Simone, a 7-year-old poodle, is described as \"airhead by day and tramp by night,\" and Max, a 12-year-old border collie, \"enjoys butt rubs\"--but, then, who doesn't?This hard-to-resist book is sure to elicit the same two-part response from all dog 1) I need this on my coffee table, and 2) My dog should be in the sequel.",
