  "title": "Beyond the Writers' Workshop: New Ways to Write Creative Nonfiction",
  "description": "An innovative new approach to teaching and writing creative nonfiction from veteran teacher and critically acclaimed author Carol Bly.Teachers and writers everywhere are facing the limits imposed by the prevailing models of community or MFA “workshops” or, at the high-school level, “peer review.” In Beyond the Writers' Workshop Carol Bly presents an alternative. She believes thatworkshopping’s tendency to engage in wry scorn and pay exaggerated attention to technical details, causes apprentice writers, consciously or unconsciously, to modify their most passionate work.Inspired by a philosophy of individuality and moral rigor, Bly combines ideas and techniques from social work, psychotherapy, and neuroscience with the traditional teaching of fresh metaphor, salient dialogue, lively pace, and analysis of other literary work in her pioneering new approach. She also includes exercises and examples in an extensive practical appendix.",
