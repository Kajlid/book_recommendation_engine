  "description": "Arden Crisanto, twenty-five, is the only daughter of a wedding gown designer--and a geek. An archaeology student, she dreams of digs rather than dresses and dates, to her mother's disappointment. Under normal circumstances she would never consider getting married to anyone, except maybe her favorite professor. But when her mother is diagnosed with cancer, Arden becomes determined to make her dream of seeing her walk down the aisle in her original creation come true. She considers her sweet but awkward buddy Rob in the role of the groom. He ought to agree to a marriage that won't be for keeps. After all, an unromantic science geek like him couldn't fall in love with her for real, could he?",
