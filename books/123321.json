  "description": "From 1991 to 1995, Drew Hayes self-published an independent comic called first I, LUSIPHUR, then POISON ELVES. THE MULEHIDE YEARS contains all 200 issues of Drew's seminal work, the origin story of an antihero named Lusiphur. In a surprisingly progressive medieval era where magic and violence rule the land, Lusiphur leaves the employ of an increasingly paranoid feudal lord to trek across Amrahly'nn in search of adventure - which he finds in abundance.",
