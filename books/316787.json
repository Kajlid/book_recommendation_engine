  "description": "They said I deserved the monster’s wrath…And they were right.I’m the traitor and the villain in my own story.When I walked away from the Armanelli Family, I broke the oath that bound me to them.By blood, I now belong to the bratva.I’m the Russian Princess, set to inherit billions and solidify alliances where no one else can.But, by love, I belong to Rome.The underboss of the Italian Mob.The man whose piercing dark stare licks up my body like he owns it.Rome glares at me with indecisiveness.Wanting to stand beside me, but also rip me apart.The twisted part in me yearns for him to do both.He is the one obstacle I must overcome.One large, tattooed, cold-hearted hurdle I have to live without.Yet, can the monster in him leave me behind too?There’s an undeniable tie that will always tether us, and I don’t think he can ignore the pull.He's the monster after all.And the monster always comes for what’s his.This book is the final installment of the New Reign Mafia Duet. It is not a standalone. Please start with Heart of a Monster.",
