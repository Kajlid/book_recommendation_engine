  "title": "The Complete Saki",
  "description": "Hector Hugh Munro is perhaps the most graceful spokesman for England's \"golden afternoon''—those slow and peaceful years prior to the outbreak of World War I. The good wit of bad manners, elegantly spiced with irony and deftly controlled malice, has made Saki stories small, perfect gems of the English language. Here for the first time, are the collected writings of Saki—including all of his short stories (\"Reginald\", \"Reginald in Russia\", \"The Chronicles of Clovis\", \"Beasts and Super-Beasts\" \"The Toys of Peace\", and \"The Square Egg\"), his three novels (THE UNBEARABLE BASSINGTON, WHEN WILLIAM CAME and THE WESTMINSTER ALICE), and three plays (THE DEATHTRAP, KARL-LUDWIG'S WINDOW and THE WATCHED POT. You are invited to meet once again Clovis, Reginald, the Unbearable Bassington, and the other memorable characters etched so superbly by the pen of H.H. Munro.",
