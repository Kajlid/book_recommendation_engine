  "description": "Do you know who you are? Easy question? Well, think again. Robert Hunt is one teenager who knows that there are a whole lot of people inside you, like a collection of masks. You change your mask according to the situation you find yourself in. A year ago Robert found himself in one pretty weird situation. He lost it for a while, and almost thought he was a psycho. So he wrote it all out in order to understand what happened to him and why. Believe it, don’t believe it–it’s up to you. Just remember this–whoever you choose to be, there is always a flip side.",
