  "title": "The Making of a Psychiatrist",
  "description": "Dr. Viscott does a very good job in relating many important issues in a psychiatric residency, and he does not lapse into complex, technical word frenzy. No. The author portrays himself as a sometimes goofy guy who thinks he's right most of the time--and who wouldn't? He relates his experiences in clearly described personal anecdotes and, true to the reviews, THE MAKING OF A PSYCHIATRIST does indeed read like a novel. It is a novel, of a medical doctor's residency as a psychiatry student.",
