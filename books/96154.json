  "description": "After her father suddenly leaves, turning the family upside down, Ji-won is forced to pick up the pieces and keep her grieving mother from falling apart. When her mother tells her that eating fish eyes will bring good luck and hints that it may help her father return home, Ji-won tries one and immediately begins dreaming about eating eyes. Human eyes.Instead of Ji-won's parents reuniting, however, her mother starts dating George, a Caucasian man with an obvious Asian fetish. Tormented by her dreams, Ji-won becomes obsessed with his beautiful blue eyes and begins noticing blue eyes all around her. No longer able to control her urges, she finds opportunities to feed her hunger, growing more and more reckless each day. And, as her obsession grows, so does her selfishness: the things that once seemed important to her no longer do, and Ji-won, who has always been hopelessly devoted to her family, decides that she must do the one thing that will end her cravings once and for all.A brilliantly inventive, subversive novel about a young woman unravelling from feeling for too long - because of race, because of misogyny - completely unseen, THE EYES ARE THE BEST PART is also a story of an immigrant family falling apart and trying to find their way back to each other.",
