Before her lineage was awakened and she became more than human. Escaping the Clinic wasn't enough to rid her of this life they gave her. The life she doesn't want. As allies are found and families forged in the midst of a Realm seeking her death, Eliscity realizes that though the Bloods War ended over three centuries ago, the fighting didn't end with it. Now it's up to Eliscity to decide whether it's a battle she wants to be a part of. What will it mean for her? Can she find the life she doesn't remember? And will it be worth fighting for? \"Not only are we a secret the Clinic wants kept, we're a secret the Clinic needs kept. The Realms not ready for us.\" As the Gentle Reigness, Acanthea stands to inherit the Realm. It's a Realm of Blood highs, Extinction Laws and secrets - secrets Acanthea is desperate to dig up, even if it means running away. What does her father have to do with the children rumored to be missing? Can the strange family she meets truly be what they say? Will the Realm survive uncovering the truth? As Acanthea gets closer to the truth she has to wonder; are some secrets better off buried?",
