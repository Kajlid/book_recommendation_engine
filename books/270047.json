  "description": "In a world where magic thrives in secret city corners, a group of magicians embark on a road trip—and it’s the \"no-love-interest\", found family adventure you’ve been searching for.  Sixteen-year-old Blythe is one of seven magicians powerful enough to cause worldwide panic with a snap of their fingers. But Blythe spends her days pouring latte art at her family’s coffee shop, so why should she care about having apocalyptic abilities?  She’s given a reason when magician anarchists crash into said coffee shop and kidnap her family.  Heartbroken but determined, Blythe knows she can’t save them alone. A war is brewing between two magician governments and tensions are too high. So, she packs up her family’s bright yellow Volkswagen, puts on a playlist, and embarks on a road trip across the United States to enlist the help of six strangers whose abilities are unparalleled—the other Guardians.",
