  "title": "Morgan's Curse",
  "description": "In this 26,000 word sequel to “Merlin's Magic Wang”, we learn that over a thousand years ago, Merlin cursed his cheating lover Morgan Le Fay to switch bodies every time she has sex. This leaves her doomed to inhabit either a pregnant female body or a near-powerless male one. She and her succubus servant are determined to end the curse by killing Merlin while he's still a helpless infant.===I've said that I prefer being a woman, and that's certainly my professional preference. As a sorceress whose power stems from fertility magic, it's pretty much the only way I can actually wield any significant fraction of the power I held before being cursed. But when my curse is over, I actually am going to miss having sex as a man. I find it very hard to decide which gender I actually prefer fucking as, because they're both awesome.Julie had begun moaning softly, her voice barely audible over the waves crashing on the beach behind us. “I'm going to cum inside you”, I whispered into her ear. She gasped, and I could feel her pussy clench reflexively around my cock as she thought about it.“Okay,” she panted, “I'm on the pill anyway. Just don't stop, OK?”I chuckled as I thrust harder, burying myself as deep as Rudy's cock was capable. I squeezed her ass, feeling every inch of her body as she pressed herself against me. “You're still gonna get pregnant”, I told her.She bucked her hips harder. “I'll have any baby you can sneak past the pill. I'll name him or her Lucky”, she panted. I was getting close to my climax, and Julie had just given me the closest thing to informed consent I've had in years. A fire built up in my lower body as my erection grew harder and stronger. My breath began coming in ragged gasps, and she squirmed beneath me as her orgasm started, then she shrieked as it reached full blast. “Fuck me”, she commanded. “Get me pregnant if you have to, just fuck me! I'll have your baby!”I couldn't hold out any longer. Her legs were wrapped tightly around me, and her taut hips were pressed against my thrusting groin, straining to pull me inside her just a fraction of an inch deeper. Sperm shot out of me like a cannon, bathing her womb in seed and guaranteeing conception. Julie gasped and panted, then sighed in contentment as I rolled off of her. I've learned the hard way not to stay on top of a woman long after cumming inside of her. After all, the newly pregnant girl trapped under a disoriented and unconscious man would be me a few minutes later.Immediately after I rolled over, my back picked up a coating of sand where I'd been sweating.“Oh my God”, Julie said as she shifted her hips experimentally. “I can't believe I let you cum in my pussy.”I smirked and ran my finger along her thigh, and then traced a line up to her belly. “I can. I just can't believe you doubt that I got you pregnant.”Julie gave me a saucy look. “You're really sure of yourself, aren't you Morgan? It's almost like you're...” and she trailed off. I started feeling distant and disconnected first, and the world went out of focus. The world went dark murky for a moment, and then it shifted and slowly came back into focus. I was still looking deep into the eyes of someone I'd just fucked, but now I was in Julie's body, looking back into Rudy's face.I stretched my legs, feeling the cum ooze out of my pussy as I did so. I finished Julie's sentence for her as, “...yes, it's almost like we're pregnant, except that we are.” I stretched my limbs and yawned, stretching my body experimentally. No hidden pains, no trick joints that I noticed. Next, I flexed my power ever so slightly with a basic vision spell.",
