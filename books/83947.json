  "description": "Chance Murdoch, a 40 year old single father of two, falls in love with a woman twelve years younger than he. The first problem he must overcome is the age difference. Chance is not sure he can date a woman much younger than him. The second problem is the ex-wife from hell who is bound and determined to see him as unhappy as she is. She will stop at nothing to keep the two of them apart, even fabricating a story to try and win custody of their children. There is a third hurdle of finding happiness with his new love and it's the hardest hurdle of all, she's his teenaged daughter's high school calculus teacher. Can a simple man like Chance balance the love for this woman, the protective instinct for his children, and the possibility of alienating his daughter by dating her teacher, and still overcome the bitterness of the woman who left him with two children? All he wanted was to finally find happiness and now he is faced with a choice, his children, or the chance of a lifetime.",
