  "description": "“The social networking dimension of poetry is ubiquitous in Japan, but in America it is a rare phenomenon. The writers of this collection have set the admirable goal for themselves to present a collection that uses a newly devised form known as “specular poetry.” …the discoveries they have made in their group’s exploration of form are worthy of attention, and the larger community should certainly take note.” Mark Schorr, executive director, Robert Frost Foundation",
