  "description": "Sometimes, happily ever after isn’t meant to be…   Scarlett Powers couldn’t be happier! Her bookstore has taken off, her worst enemy is locked in jail, and life with Prince Charming is better than she’d ever imagined.  Then, the death of a star witness in the Montgomery trial ruins everything. Mysterious letters arrive for Scarlett. Noelle Summers whirls into Luck with news of her own. A kidnapper is on the loose. He's not only asking for money—he's threatening the lives of those Scarlett loves most.  Suddenly, Scarlett has more questions than ever, and none of the answers seem to be adding up. If Scarlett can’t uncover the mastermind before it’s too late, she’ll have a lot more to worry about than \ntwo little lies... \n  ** **  Note: This book can be read as a standalone, though it is part of a larger mystery series. It is rated PG-13 for some mild language. No graphic gore or sex, but there is some kissing...you've been warned. There is no cliffhanger.  \nOne Little Wish is a full-length, southern cozy mystery with a strong female protagonist and a hot-as-sin hero. Two Little Lies is the sequel.",
