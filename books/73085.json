  "description": "Peace has returnedThe 'War That Wasn't a War' has ended. The Dispersionists have been broken and peace has returned to Chung Kuo, but DeVore's mission to destroy it is far from over. Employing the Ping Tiao, the 'Levellers', and officers within the Security Service still loyal to him, DeVore sends autonomous copies of himself from Mars to destroy the Seven by any means necessary.The Seven lost their three most experienced T'ang in the War and have been left extremely vulnerable. Wang Sau-leyan, the new T'ang of City Africa, uses this weakness to attack them from within, but without the continued loyalty of men like Tolonen, Karr and Kao Chen they will all topple.Welcome to the Future(from Corvus)",
