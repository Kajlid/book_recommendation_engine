Her albums sell millions, her tours sell out and she has a hit DVD. Her name is known around the world. Now she s back home for a holiday charity concert and to say a proper goodbye to the past. A past named Duncan Rousse.Five years ago, Duncan pushed Tara away for one reason: to force her to reach for the stars. She deserves the life she s earned, even though it left him with a broken heart that s never healed. Having her back in his arms only makes the pain worse, yet the last thing he can do is beg her to stay.One wild, passion-filled night in the sexy Cajun s bed has Tara s body singing with pleasure. But can they both get what they want this Christmas?\"",
