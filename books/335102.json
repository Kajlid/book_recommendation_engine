  "description": "Young love. Unpredictable. Fleeting. They say it never lasts. Falling in love when you’re a teenager isn’t supposed to shape your life, but it had defined us. I was fifteen when I fell for the boy with stars in his eyes. At seventeen, desperate to fight the currents pulling us apart, against our families’ wishes, I married him. Determined to make it work, I headed to college while he moved across the country, each chasing our own dreams. Falling in love had been easy. Making it work was the hard part. I watched and cheered from afar as Dean became an unrecognizable A-lister. I spent my days pretending to be happy and enjoy my normal life while he fell further into the pit of fame, a new tabloid headline every week. Somewhere along the way, we lost ourselves and each other. Just when I thought we were ready to let go, a scandal rocked our world. Fate had the last laugh. We may be able to give up on ourselves, but we’d never give up on each other without a fight.",
