  "description": "The decisions Rose made all those years ago still haunt her and continue to affect all of her relationships. She has never gotten over the love she had for her first husband JJ and the end of their marriage. Her second marriage is over and Rose is determined she will never fall in love again. While she is fully aware of the mistakes she has made throughout her life, her decisions and actions continue to be the same. The Sunday Rose series is a historical fiction account of certain events that happened in the life of my maternal grandmother, Georgia Mae Biggins, also known as Mama Georgia. I want to thank her for telling me about her life all those years ago but most importantly, for giving me a launching pad for my imagination. This allowed me the opportunity to spin a great story around her life and fulfill my passion for writing. Thank you Mama Georgia for always being there for our entire family, but especially being there for me. Author R. Jay Berry is a retired educational administrator whose love for the Lord and her family have led her to write this historical family sketch. R. Jay lives in Texas with her husband, Bernard, and their dog Strawberry. They have one son Stephen and daughter-in-law Jewel.",
