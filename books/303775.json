What happens when you make a pact with your boys to stay single and never fall in love? Well, you get the Playboy Pact.We were friends, her and I.Best friends. It was easy. Simple. Comfortable.

Because a guy and a girl couldn’t just be best friends without emotions getting involved, right? Without noticing, everything shifted, and I was experiencing all these new feelings… Jealousy. Possessiveness. She’s mine. Yeah…For the first time in my life, Mila wasn’t merely a girl I trusted and hung out with on a regular basis. She had become… …the woman I was in love with.",
