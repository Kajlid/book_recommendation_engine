  "title": "When Race Trumps Merit: How the Pursuit of Equity Sacrifices Excellence, Destroys Beauty, and Threatens Lives",
  "description": "In the wake of George Floyd’s death, all of the major institutions of American society and culture – from corporations and universities to media and entertainment to the arts and sciences – have embraced the view that the only way to reckon with systemic racism is to ensure equality of outcome. In her brand new book, When Race Trumps Merit, Heather Mac Donald exposes how the application of such a radical theory is not only undermining our academic standards but is poised to cause real harm and damage to society by lowering standards in science and medicine, erasing classic music and art, undermining military preparedness, and compromising the safety of our cities—and will ultimately eradicate Western civilization as we know it.",
