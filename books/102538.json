  "title": "Love Your Enemies: How to Break the Anger Habit & Be a Whole Lot Happier",
  "description": "When people and circumstances upset us, how do we deal with them? Often, we feel victimized. We become hurt, angry, and defensive. We end up seeing others as enemies, and when things donâ€™t go our way, we become enemies to ourselves.But what if we could move past this pain, anger, and defensiveness?Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, this book introduces us to the four kinds of enemies we encounter in life: the outer enemy, people, institutions, and situations that mean to harm us; the inner enemy, anger, hatred, fear, and other destructive emotions; the secret enemy, self-obsession that isolates us from others; and the super-secret enemy, deep-seated self-loathing that prevents us from finding inner freedom and true happiness.",
