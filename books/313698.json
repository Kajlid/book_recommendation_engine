He seems to have everything--money, education, a promising career, sex, and a mildly dysfunctional family. However, he cannot seem to shake the feeling that something is missing.   Plagued with countless sleepless nights and recurring nightmares of an unknown origin, Khai turns to a life of meaningless hookups with strangers to cope. After falling for Terrence, a former escort and addict turned married man, Khai finds himself resorting to drastic measures to keep their toxic love affair alive.  \"I mastered the art of suppression. It is my armor. Without it, I get irrational. I get reckless. Things get broken. People get hurt. Relationships go up in flames, and when the dust settles, I curl up in my closet in a fetal position with eyes full of tears and whisper to myself, look what you made me do!\"",
