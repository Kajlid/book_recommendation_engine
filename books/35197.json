  "description": "How do you say no to a man at thirty thousand feet?When Grier Thompson is called to Indigo, Alaska, to deal with the estate of her estranged late father, the last things she expects to find are a hotly contested will, a hostile half sister who has never known Grier exists, or an entire town that doesn’t take kindly to this stranger.Except maybe for Mick O’Shaughnessy.An Indigo native, Mick has all he wants in life: a soft flannel shirt, a nice cottage, and a thriving airline charter business. Could this simple life get any better? One look at Grier and Mick discovers the answer is a resounding yes. She thinks so too—and if it weren’t for her family baggage, maybe she could relax and enjoy herself before it’s time to return to real life.But then an unexpected visitor from Grier’s past unsettles the community just when the residents are finally starting to warm to her. By the time Mick comes out of the clouds to realize he’s fallen head over heels in love, it might just be too late to win Grier’s heart.",
