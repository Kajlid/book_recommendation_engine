  "description": "He was gorgeous, older and guarded.I knew he was trouble from the moment we locked eyes.We met at work, on my first day as a barista.He smiled, I melted …. then he tasted my coffee and threw it away.Again, the next day, and the next.He hated the coffee, yet still came back.I knew his game.He called my coffee death in a cup.I called him god’s gift to women.I wasn’t lying.Then we ran into each other outside of the coffee house, and that’s when things got interesting.No longer suave and sweet with impeccable manners.Mr Garcia had a darker side, his appetite, thick and heavy.He set me on fire.Unable to help it, we fell hopelessly in love.The highest of highs.But his demons are dark, as are mine.I’m not sure if we can make it and I know that I have two choices.Walk away now to save myself.Or try and hold on and let love be the light.I choose option two.",
