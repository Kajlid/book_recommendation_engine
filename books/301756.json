  "description": "I had something to live for.The moment I saw him, I knew.  His eyes would hypnotize.His lips would speak the most beautiful promises. His body? Made for pleasure.  But if Corrado Capitani thought that he could fool me into thinking he was a good man, he was wrong. The moment I saw him, I knew the truth.Those eyes hid his poisonous heart. Those lips were vessels of deception. That body? Made for inflicting pain. He wasn’t sent from heaven. He was sent to drag me back to hell. I had something to die for. Alcina Parisi had a price on her head, and she’d eluded the best. She thought no one would ever find her, but I did. Everyone in our world called me Scorpio—the man who never let the enemy go. But she was a weapon, not an adversary, and I’d claimed her as mine.",
