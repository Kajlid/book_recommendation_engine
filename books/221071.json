  "description": "Daniela had an unconventional upbringing. As she grew up in New York City, she would often shadow her father during his work as a consigliere and mediator between different factions of the New York City Mafia. She quickly learned how to talk to volatile people and recognize danger.   When Daniela’s father is arrested while she is away at school, and an associate is soon found murdered, he makes her promise that she won’t get caught up in the lifestyle. He wants Daniela as far away from the crime and vice of New York City as possible.   Daniela keeps the promise for ten years. She marries a stable man and has two beautiful children. She resigns herself to a life in the suburbs as a stay-at-home mom, but she can’t help but miss the excitement of her former life.  When Daniela’s best friend’s husband begins acting suspiciously, Daniela recognizes danger once again. Daniela is intent on exposing the truth behind the man. She hopes it will give her leverage against the district attorney supervising her father’s imprisonment. Her investigation will take her back to the world her father desperately wanted to protect her from.",
