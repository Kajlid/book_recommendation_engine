It is the year 1307 and the ancient Order of the Knights of Christ and the Temple of Solomon is in grave danger. The King of France and Pope Clement V are plotting its destruction and scheming to appropriate the Order's most sacred and dangerous secret. This is taken away by Etienne de Congost, a battle-weary but incorruptible man who flees through a world in ruin, dodging plots and papal spies in a life and death struggle. Will he keep the secret from the evil hands of king and pope? The outcome of Etienneâ€™s desperate journey is discovered 700 years later by a writer who visits Lockenhaus Castle in Austria to research a book on the Templars. Together with an eccentric local woman he begins to untangle the web of destiny that binds them both to the mystery of the Seal. Good Reading Magazine Koulias is a beautiful writer who has expertly crafted a tale set in a fascinating time in history and made it relevant to our lives today.",
