  "description": "Stephen Hawking worked to create a theory of Everything. Now Geir Gigja is revealing the reason for everything.  Who is \"I?\"  Geir Gigja was born in Iceland, the land of ice and fire, which in ancient times was believed to be the gate to heaven and hell, the beginning and the end. As a young man critically injured and lying in a ten-day coma, Geir Gigja experienced a dramatic spiritual revelation, yielding new insights into the real meaning of the universe. He has spent the decades since then interpreting the metaphor of the Bible, in context with the Icelandic Sagas, then translating it all into English.  He has spent a lifetime opening the door to a brave new understanding of the creation of us all. \"I Is God\" provides the keys to unlock the metaphor of the Bible.   \"I Is God - The Journey Begins\" is the first of five books that will span this epic undertaking.",
