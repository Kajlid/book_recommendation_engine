  "description": "Up until the age of 64, much of Kari Rosvall's early life was shrouded in mystery. Then, one day, a letter arrived through the post . . .In it was a small black-and-white photograph of Kari as a young baby, the first she had ever seen. Kari was to finally discover the dark secret of her She was a Lebensborn child, part of Hitler's 'Spring of Life' programme, which encouraged Nazi soldiers to have children with Scandinavian women in order to create an Aryan race.And so began a journey back to her to Norway where, at ten days old, she was taken from her mother, packed into a crate and sent to Germany to join the other Lebensborn children; to post-War Germany and her eventual rescue by the Red Cross from an attic, a tiny, neglected outcast of a dead regime.Nowhere's Child is a remarkable story of reconciliation, of forging new beginnings from a dark past and of the discovery of family later in life. Ultimately, it is the life-affirming account of what it really means to find a place called home.",
