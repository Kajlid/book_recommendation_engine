  "description": "For years, sixteen-year-old Amanda Anderson thought her father was a salesman at a car dealership in downtown Anaheim. But when two strange men chased Amanda and her father from one of her softball games, she learned otherwise. He was actually a spy for a top-secret intelligence agency, and as soon as Amanda knew his secret, the agency decided to recruit her as well. Before she could blink an eye, she was given a new identity, rushed to a training facility in Nevada, and sent on a mission to thwart the plans of a diabolical madman intent on destroying the world.",
