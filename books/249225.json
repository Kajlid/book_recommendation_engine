  "description": "It was his lips. The way his stare sent shivers down my spine. The way his rough voice whispered my name.  So I caved. I did what I knew I shouldn’t.  But as quickly as he’s there, he’s gone. Leaving me confused. Devastated. I hope I’ll never see him again…  Then I do.  He’s my new boss. And he has secrets.",
