  "description": "Rescue Me Gently is sure to leave you breathless and left wanting more. It’s an old-fashioned love story about a young woman who is faced with the one thing we are all faced with at one time or another—when to give it up. Hannah Brooke Stone chose to wait. She knew in her heart that one day, when the moment was right, she would know she had found her soul mate; the man who would complete her and change her world. But things change; just like they always do. Not only does she realize she may be a victim of her own morality, but she has an ex-boyfriend who betrayed her, a mystery stalker who won’t go away, and a desire to give it up—to a man she’s never met. It’s like going to bed one person and waking up another. Suddenly, it’s just too much for her to handle and there’s nothing left to do, but get out of town. She thinks a vacation away will help her put things back into perspective, but little does she know fate has a plan that will leave her breathless. The life she knew will soon be over. She’s destined to be swept away by Conner Dawson, and it’s going to happen fast; so hold on tight, and don’t worry. When it comes to this man, she will have no regrets.",
