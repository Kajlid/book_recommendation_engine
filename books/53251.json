  "title": "The Drought",
  "description": "Welcome to Junction, Texas Population: 626 and steadily declining Odd things have been happening around town. Hugh McManus went out to one of his grazing pastures and shot the better part of a fine herd before shooting himself. Luke Casteel crawled into a drainage pipe and never came back. A herd of wild javelina attacked and killed Rod Sawyer. And the thing is, the dying isn't nearly done. Jared Riley knows there's something sinister about the heat. It's got people acting crazy and it's got him hearing things. A voice keeps whispering, \"It's gonna get mighty hot. Yes sir we like our meatloaf and taters well done, served up pipin' hot.\" Convinced the heat is tracking them, picking them off one by one, he sets off to find help. Trouble is, the people who have the answers are more dangerous than the heat. Driven by strong characters and a twisting plot, THE DROUGHT delves into the supernatural world where ghosts roam the landscape and a voodoo curse floats on the wind.",
