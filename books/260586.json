  "description": "“Zimmerman has powerfully captured the joy, danger, and fantasy of Stevenson’s novel. . . Pure fun, a potent coming-of-age story, and a rollicking swashbuckler.”— San Francisco ChronicleIn Treasure Island , Tony Award winner and inventive adapter-director Mary Zimmerman has penned a spirited, energetic adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s most beloved novel, proving again that “a strong story full of larger-than-life characters and the quest for filthy lucre has no age barrier” (Chicago Sun-Times).Enlivened by rum, mutiny, and buried treasure, Treasure Island is the classic pirates’ tale, widely regarded as the forerunner of this genre. After discovering a treasure map, young Jim Hawkins sets off to sea as cabin boy aboard the Hispaniola, where he encounters one of the most unforgettable characters in literary history—peg-legged buccaneer Long John Silver, a malicious mutineer and charismatic father figure.",
