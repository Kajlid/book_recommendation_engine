  "description": "A Christmas tale for young children that celebrates the true meaning of the season “Come!” drummed a woodpecker one cold, wintry day. “A baby is coming. There’s work to be done!”    One by one, from field and forest, the animals make their way to a barn. The cow has sweet-smelling hay to offer the baby. The bluebird has the gift of song. And a lamb has soft, cozy wool. But the shy little fox has nothing to offer . . . or so he thinks.   With its gentle text and warm, expressive illustrations, this irresistible take on the Nativity story invites even the youngest child to discover the truest gifts of the Christmas season: the ones that come from the heart.",
