  "title": "I Feel Relatively Neutral About New York",
  "description": "Have you ever loved something, but also totally not loved it at the same time? Would you like to \"heart\" New York, but you're not quite ready for that kind of commitment? Have you ever had the feeling that other cities probably have pretty good pizza, too? This light-hearted skewering of the Big Apple sets the record straight with semi-informed opinions, questionable charts, and some slapdash Photoshop work. On a scale from one to spectacular, we give New York a five. And after reading this book, we think you ll agree! Or whatever.",
