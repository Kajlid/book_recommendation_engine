  "description": "Here is a book that should not be taken lightly -- if for no other reason than that book store proprietors have sharp eyes. It is the custom to pay one dollar per copy and it is hoped the trend will continue. If you find yourself in need, however, and must resort to that vanishing but basic flower of human ingenuity, the Clean Getaway, we forgive you and trust you to mail in the money at some late date when the dice have rolled in the right direction.",
