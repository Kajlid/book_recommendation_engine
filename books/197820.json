  "description": "Lucy sits cross-legged on the floor, staring intently at her sleeping baby, willing him to do something, anything, to distract her from the boobs that surround her. She sighs too loudly and the Mum next to her mistakenly takes it as an invitation to chat. “Please, no!” thinks Lucy, as she looks up and is confronted with a mammoth, blue-veined breast, just inches from her face.  Lucy’s preparation for motherhood had involved lots of catalogues and plans for the nursery, the baby’s wardrobe and dreams of a beautiful blonde-haired princess laughing and dancing on a beach. The reality was a bald baby boy, whose bodily fluids were so plentiful and pungent that her first greeting to visitors had become, “I’m sorry about the smell.”  Not so long ago, Lucy had been a confident, successful, professional someone who stopped at nothing to get good results. Now she couldn’t even get out of bed without crying. There is no hiding behind a mask when there is baby poo on your face. And there is no persuading a perfectionist that doing alright, is actually perfectly alright.  Through her dark and devastating depression, Lucy somehow retains her sense of humour. Is this enough to help her survive? Will she ever fall in love with her baby? Will she ever become the mother she thought she would be? Most importantly, will her boobs ever stop hurting?  This funny, no-holds barred reflection on the hard reality of becoming a Mum for the first-time is hilarious, toe-curling and tragic in equal measures, much like motherhood itself.",
