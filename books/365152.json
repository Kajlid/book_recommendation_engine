  "description": "Previously published as American Diva\nWhile guarding a beautiful, high-maintenance pop star, a stuntman wrestles with frustration - and intense desire. Raven-haired, blue-eyed Jack Price hates being the only single member of Thrillseekers Anonymous, and he wishes his friends would stop trying to play matchmaker. He already has someone on his mind: Audrey LaRue, the gorgeous pop star - and diva extraordinaire - he's guarding from a vicious stalker. All Audrey ever wanted to do was sing, write songs, and inspire other girls to do the same. Suddenly, she's a megafamous celebrity - and she hates it. The paparazzi document her every move. A crazed stalker threatens to kill her. Anyone in her position would throw an occasional tantrum - or ten. As Audrey's tour marches on, the pressure - and the danger - build. But Jack rarely leaves her side, watching her and giving her the sexiest smiles she's ever seen. Can they keep this relationship professional - or will they succumb to overwhelming desire?",
