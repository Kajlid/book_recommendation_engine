  "description": "At exactly midnight on December 31, every electronic device made in China for the last 30 years stops working. From the U.S. electrical grid and all its back-ups, engine control-management systems, early warning systems on U.S. satellites, every motor vehicle, aircraft and ship made after 1985, to even simple memory chips inside children’s teddy bears—every electronic fuse, resistor, or connector that was “Made in China” becomes dormant… forever. The shutdown of the United States of America, and 97% of the entire world, is accomplished by 12:30 am U.S. Eastern time on the first day of the New Year. It takes only 30 minutes to completely dismantle the whole of modern Western civilization as we know it.INVASION USA I - The End of Modern CivilizationINVASION USA II - The Battle for New YorkINVASION USA III - The Battle for SurvivalINVASION USA IV - The Battle for Houston-The AftermathAlso check out T I WADE's \"AMERICA ONE\" Series.",
