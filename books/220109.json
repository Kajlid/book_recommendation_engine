  "description": "“Lynch provides classic comic-book repartee in beginning-reader-friendly vocabulary ably matched to Haspiel’s bold images and zippy colors; the highest-quality production supplies good, old fashioned fun and a superhero lesson that packs a wallop.” – Kirkus Reviews Mona and Joey can’t stop fighting! When the Mighty Mojo decides to give his powerful costume to them, these argumentative twins fight so much they rip it in half. Now each one is only half as strong! Can Mo and Jo find a way to combine their powers, fight evil Saw-Jaw and save their town? Two master cartoonists, writer Jay Lynch and artist Dean Haspiel, create a loving, tongue-in-cheek superhero tale where the kids’ biggest battle is just learning to get along.",
