  "description": "Lucy Aright is not the sort of woman to be swept off her feet. She is sober, career-minded and numb since the death of her fianc√©. So it's completely out of character for her to race a man in traffic- and even more unusual when they meet again and she is irritated, intrigued and finally enraptured by the driver, writer Greg Miller. Within eight weeks, she is seriously considering his pleas to marry him and wondering if she can take on his two motherless children. But before she can make a decision about becoming part of Greg's world, events plunge her right into it. Her careful existence is shattered as she has to figure out how to handle two vulnerable children and face that she doesn't really know the man whose life has so overwhelmed hers.",
