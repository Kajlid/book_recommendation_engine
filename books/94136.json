  "description": "Khrushchev Remembers is a unique -- and enthralling -- historical first. Never before, in all the years since the great Russian Revolution, have we had access to the intimate political reminiscences of a Soviet leader. Never before have we had the opportunity to penetrate to the power center of the Kremlin itself -- as we do now in tehse absorbing, often shocking, sometimes bizarre, frequently ingenuous, occasionally humorous, always illuminating recollections of the man who sat at the summit of power in the modern Russian empire from 1953 until 1964 and whose impact on the outside world, particularly the Western world, was so vivid and unsettling. Includes an introduction, commentary, and notes.",
