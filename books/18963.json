  "description": "NYT Bestselling Author of Cinder and Heartless, Marissa Meyer, says, \"Coleman's unique vision of Wonderland is a joy to read!\" Hatter won the Diamond Award from the League of Utah Writers for Outstanding Novel of the Year. In a world that doesn’t need saving, a young man ignorant of social norms is the unlikeliest of heroes. And despite his extreme dislike of confrontation, Hatta knows his destiny is to mend a rift that doesn’t exist. On the other end of the spectrum is Chism, a young Elite soldier who thrives on conflict. How will this rash, obsessive soldier aid the child-like Hatta in his journey? The Cheshire Cat, Queen of Hearts and other familiar characters emerge to fill their eminent roles in the tangled ascent into madness of literature’s most lovable lunatic. *NOTE on the Numbering of the Jabberwocky is Book 0 in the Knights of Wonderland series. Hatter and Jabberwocky are written in the same world and have some crossover of characters but since the characters in Hatter are the main actors in the rest of the series, Hatter is Book 1.",
