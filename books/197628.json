  "description": "Holy guacamole Skippyjon Jones is crazy-loco for dinosaurs The kitty boy enters (via his closet) the land of dinosaurs in search of the fabled \"Skipposaurus.\" Instead he runs into his old \"amigos, \" the Chimichango gang. When a T-Mex threatens the pack, it's El Skippito, the great sword fighter, to the rescue. With yips and yowls, he drives the big baddie away, so all the dino-dudes can rattle their bones another day. This fourth entry in a series that \"Kirkus Reviews\" called ?ay caramba, mucho fun, ? will win even more fans for the Siamese cat with oversize ears and an imagination to match.",
