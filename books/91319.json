  "title": "Vegas and the Mob",
  "description": "Las Vegas was the Mob’s greatest venture and most spectacular success, and through 40 years of frenzy, murder, deceit, scams, and skimming, the FBI listened on phone taps and did virtually nothing to stop the fun. This is the truth about Vegas like you’ve never heard it before. By the 1950’s, nearly every major crime family had a stake in a Las Vegas casino. Some did better than others. Casino owners watched-over their profits while competing crime families eyed each others success like jealous lovers. Murder often followed.This is the story of how the Mob, most notably Lucky Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Moe Dalitz and Bugsy Siegel moved into Las Vegas, built and stole casinos, and skimmed them dry, right under the nose of the FBI.",
