  "description": "At the end of our understanding only liberation can be found. Aperson intertwined in their analysis is seeking, open to questions towardsthemselves, asking about the state of uncertainty. The author brings uponus the existential questions of fear, love, existence and finally healing. Heruntrivial prose sketch carries within the imprints of a psychologicalportrait of a woman, who changes her own fears into strength of positivebeliefs.Marta, the main character of the whole ado, performs an attempt to breakeven with her past. What will be the course of this relies on three basic filters, which everyone posses. These are first of all our attachments, beliefsand finally our fears. Marta is consciously decrypting these in herself forthe sake of this book. Finally itâ€™s up to us which of them will reach ourawareness and in what degree will they be allowed to reform inside of us.And this is where the therapeutic dimension of the story materialises itself.",
