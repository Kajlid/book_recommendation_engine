  "description": "[Audio CD Library Edition in vinyl case][Read by Jeff Cummings]Fatal Forecast chronicles the dramatic fight for survival of eight crewmembers aboard two fishing boats ambushed by a horrific surprise storm at Georges Bank, a fishing ground southeast of Cape Cod. Soon after the boats reached the fishing ground, they were hit with hurricane-force winds and massive ninety-foot waves that battered the boats for hours. The direction of the wind made it impossible to turn back. The 'Fair Wind' soon capsized, drowning all but one of the crew members. The 'Sea Fever' was nearly torn apart.Fatal Forecast provides an hour-by-hour account of the struggles faced by the crewmembers of the 'Fair Wind' and the 'Sea Fever' and focuses especially on Ernie Hazard, who endured three incredible days in a lifeboat in open water. The book also details the dramatic rescue attempts made by the Coast Guard on a day in which it received more mayday calls than any other in New England history.",
