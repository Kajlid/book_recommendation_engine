  "description": "Colter Greyson is off limits. There’s a long list of reasons why I can’t give into the attraction that simmers between us. But quite possibly, the biggest reason being…He’s my best friend’s father.With my sarcastic sense of humor as a weapon, I fight off all of his advances. My heart is safe behind the titanium walls I’ve carefully constructed. Until it isn’t.Until the night the life I knew is snatched away, and I find myself with nowhere and no one to turn to. Colter transforms once again from my sparring partner into my white knight.He comes up with a solution to my problems. All I have to do is say, “I do.”Maybe this can work…as long as I remember, Colter Greyson isn’t mine to keep.",
