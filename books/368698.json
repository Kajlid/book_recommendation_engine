  "description": "Matt and Petey are a young gay couple in love. They're a Dom/sub couple. They're an Owner and his pup. In Puppy Love 2, the couple begin to build a life together. The close knit relationship they share with another D/s couple, Alex and Drew, begins to flourish. The four find their lives interwoven with each other, and ultimately the foursome become a family. The tragedies and struggles they go through are remarkable, and the emergence of Petey's sociopathic nemesis Ryan Connors only heightens the drama. Will Matt and Petey's love for one another be strong enough to weather the storms they are forced to face? Will Matt revert to his selfish habits of infidelity and womanizing? Will he demonstrate the maturity that is required to be a responsible Master to his pup? Will Petey ever realize that he has genuine worth, and will he find the confidence within himself to be the hero he was born to be?",
