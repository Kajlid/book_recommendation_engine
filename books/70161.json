  "title": "The Between Times",
  "description": "Like George Orwell’s Animal Farm and 1984 Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, The Between Times is a social cautionary tale. Beautifully written, it’s a short book about a small girl trying to understand what she’s not allowed to know. For fifteen years, the prophecy spread by word of mouth. From mother to daughter, father to son, it spread. In the dark days of the United States of America, a girl will be born. She will have the power to make people fade from sight. Sound will disappear with a wave of her hand. She will have the power to control the between times, and during that time, the girl child will call to her all the spirits of the past, present, and future. They will come and join hands with her. Together they will become one power, one body, and that body shall control the magic of the between times. From that day forward, the darkness and despair will disappear from our country. The world will be made new, and all people will once again be equal under the eyes of the law. Kindness will return to our world. Men and women will no longer be the property of the rich.",
