  "description": "They say the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long; in the case of Rex Mantooth!, he burned five or six times as bright for, like, ten minutes or so. Ape Super-Spy Rex Mantooth! blazed across three stories to inexplicable critical acclaim. These blistering bits of nonsense are now lavishly collected with corrected and re-toned art, the official text, covers, essays, scripts, annotations, pinups, and more.Featuring a foreword, a preface, an introduction, and publisher's note by some of comics' most notable luminaries and more exclusive material than anyone can possibly imagine. THE ANNOTATED MANTOOTH! is exactly like a DVD about a museum that's full of Monkey comics about stuff that 'splodes and dudes gettin' kicked.It's like if James Bond's a gorilla and Ian Fleming was drunk the whole time he wrote James Bond. With contributions from Warren Ellis, Joe Casey, Larry Young, Robert Kirkman, and Jeremy Love.",
