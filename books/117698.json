  "description": "HOW WOULD LIFE BE DIFFERENT if you could live, love, and mother with a full tank of energy and deep reserves of calm?Most moms are brought to their knees in gratitude and love for the gift of motherhood. We wouldn't trade this role for the world, and yet, many of us are not experiencing it the way we want to be. We don't have the reserves of inner calm, we don't feel ready for our days with energy and vitality, and we don't know how to keep ourselves replenished while we're pouring out our lives for those we love the most. It's a paradox that leaves us feeling like we're wasting the most precious and amazing years of our motherhood journeys feeling depleted, scattered and flat. Whether you feel like you're drowning, or like you're treading water day after day and getting more exhausted by the minute, the first step is to take care of the core essentials of your wellbeing. Replenish explores the seven core essentials that get us out of the water and able to catch our breath again so we can live, love and mother with greater calm, clarity and vitality in the world.",
