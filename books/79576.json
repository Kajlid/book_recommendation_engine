  "description": "‎'Danger Lorelei, he's coming'Icy whispers brush against her cheeks when she's sleeping.Most nights she wakes to the voices of her ancestors, always at 2:47 am.Like all monsters, only the light keeps them at bay.Lorelei Huntington knows what it means to fall for the wrong guy.She knows what it's like to hide in the dark and wait for the light to save her.She knows how it feels to watch while everyone you love,and everything in your life, is taken.After fifty years of looking over her shoulder and running for her life, certain she could feel his breath at the base of her neck, the icy voices come back.Again their whispers find her vulnerable and exhausted, just as they used to.Fearful of seeing him again but desperate for answers, she goes home.What she finds isn’t exactly what she left.Who she finds, isn’t exactly dead or aged a dayBut then again, neither is she.Blackwater",
