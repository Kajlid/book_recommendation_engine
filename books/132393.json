  "description": "I had known the guy on the bed, AKA Elliot Sinclair, since I was 10 and, in the subsequent decade or so, I'd felt absolutely no compulsion to get naked with him. Although I’d basically grown up as his maid, with all of the trashy romance connotations that entailed, we'd never even considered a class-defying romp. So what could possibly have happened last night to change that? I prodded my sozzled mind for an answer, but none was forthcoming.Rox has woken up with the hangover to end all hangovers to find herself sharing a bed with her ex-employer’s obnoxious son, Elliot.
