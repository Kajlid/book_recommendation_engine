  "title": "The Jew with the Iron Cross",
  "description": "A bilingual out-of-work British actor is offered a movie role in Germany just before World War Two. His Nazi employers have no idea that he's Jewish as well as British and when war breaks out his fate is inextricably linked to Hitler's favourite, the ice-queen of German cinema Eva Wendt as well as the SS, for whom, as a German movie star, he becomes their poster boy and propaganda puppet.Moving swiftly from pre-war London through Nazi Germany and spitting out its protagonist into post-war Hollywood, Hillgate's masterpiece is a swift-moving Bildungsroman, an erudite, concise allegory for the hypocrisy inherent in Nazi ideals and superstitions and their failure to overcome the essence of the human spirit.Meticulously researched and well-presented, based on true events but fictional, this is the story of what could have happened and raises the question of whether or not Hillgate's protagonist has behaved morally, amorally or immorally.Previously a no.1 on Amazon UK in its genre (spy stories) in May 2007 under the title 'Julius', the film rights of the novel have been optioned and this is a new release exclusively for Kindle, with different artwork and title.This book comes highly recommended by a number of reviewers in both the United States and Europe.",
