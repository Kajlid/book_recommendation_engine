  "title": "The Winning Way: Learnings from sport for managers",
  "description": "What do sporting champions do, what makes winning teams, who is a good leader, why do only some teams keep winning while others win only for a while and then loseâ€¦ Two IIMA alumni, Sports commentator and writer Harsha Bhogle and advertising and communication consultant Anita Bhogle dig into examples from sport to see how they can benefit managers. Contrary to popular perception ability is not a major distinguishing factor in success, especially as the level of competition increases. But if you combine your ability with the right attitude and the passion to excel, you too can become the best that you can be. That is the universal formula for winning that The Winning Way explores. For Anita and Harsha Bhogle, this book marks the completion of 300 successful corporate workshops of The Winning Way that they run.",
