Then a friend tells him about a secret chateau outside Paris where they train women in the erotic traditions of the Code d’Odalisque. For a million a year, Kai can choose a sexual servant to use at will, a woman thoroughly trained in the pleasuring of men.Kai makes the trip and, in the course of touring the facility, meets Constance, a shy and strangely quiet odalisque.

But soon they find themselves forming an increasingly emotional connection, with the end of Constance’s term of service looming over their heads.
