Was his appearance just a coincidence or was there something else behind it? Whatever it was, Everett would be the key that draws Candace back into a fight she had hoped she'd left behind.A fight to save the Ghosts of Arlington.\"An insightful, sensitive, and timely eye-opener on the living casualties of war, Ghosts of Arlington, will grab your imagination, warm your heart, and remain with you long after the final page\"...Candace Bowen Early, Author of the Award winning...\"A Knight of Silence\"",
