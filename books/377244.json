  "description": "Eric is set­tling down into a near-normal exis­tence. He’s learn­ing to cope with a dif­fer­ent kind of closet — being kept from talk­ing freely about his rela­tion­ship with Calais and the other super­heroes — as well as an increas­ingly pro­tec­tive mother, his sister’s new squeaky-clean boyfriend, and a bingo-obsessed best friend.Eric also learns that some­times, being an asset to the forces of good means sim­ply being him­self. In the mean­time, Vin­tage City is under siege from a new threat, one who’s prov­ing to be much more dan­ger­ous than all of the other supervil­lains the heroes have faced com­bined. Good peo­ple find them­selves at the mercy of an angry lunatic who will stop at noth­ing to purge the city of what he sees to be unde­sir­able elements.",
