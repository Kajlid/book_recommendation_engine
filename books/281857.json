  "description": "Smokey Forrester was drowning when it came to being a single Dad. Dealing with the murder of his wife, and helping his two sons get past the trauma of watching it happen, is almost too much for him. Add in the laundry, cleaning the house, balanced meals and keeping his kids bathed and presentable, and even Smokey realizes that maybe he's not juggling it all very well. Martha is running from the violence of her marriage, and she has her two sons with her. Not only does she need to be a strong Mom for them, but she also needs to make money and find a home to raise them in. What she isn't looking for is another entanglement. When Smokey and Martha meet, neither has any idea that they are the answer to the other person's dreams. In their years together, they become each other's safe haven, comfort zone and trusted confidant. The relationship between Smokey and Martha is one that their kids and others around them aspire to. But most of those people don't realize the dark times that the family went through together, the traumatic event that they all survived together and the secret that they have kept hidden for all these years. Get to know the Forrester brothers when they were young, and watch them grow up through Martha and Smokey's memories as the couple prepares to celebrate their 25th anniversary.",
