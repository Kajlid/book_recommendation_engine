  "description": "I once worked for vampires. I’d never thought I’d be one.My throat is always on fire. My mouth is always dry. The only thing that helps?Human blood.As much as vampires need it, it is also our curse. Blood can drive us mad if we’re not careful. That madness breeds a wickedness as the need for blood reigns supreme. We revel in it, desiring the power and vitality it gives us. When we drain someone, we get high; it’s a rush that some vampires love to chase once they cross that line. Vampires will do anything to get it and there’s nothing that will stop them from killing hundreds. Our humanity slips away the more we indulge the need and there is no way to regain it.Alexius makes it his duty to kill any vampire that loses control and I’ve promised to help him. After months, I get to help on my first case, just like I wanted to the night I woke up as an immortal.I thought I knew what sort of vampires we’d be stopping. I didn’t think about how bad things could get.My name is Everly Abbott...And the wicked really do know no bounds.",
