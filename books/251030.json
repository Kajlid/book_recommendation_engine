  "title": "To Hear the Angels Sing: An Odyssey of Co-Creation With the Devic Kingdom",
  "description": "\"Yes, I talk with angels, great Beings whose lives infuse and create all of Nature. In another time and culture I might have been cloistered in a convent or a temple, or less pleasantly, burnt as a witch. Being a practical, down-to-earth person, I had never imagined that such contact would be possible or useful. Yet, when this communication began to occur, it did so in a way that I could not dispute.\"-Dorothy Maclean From wartime employment with the British government to co-founding the Findhorn Community in Scotland, and the Lorian Association in Canada, Dorothy Maclean's life story is an account of a journey through self-discovery to an awareness of the forces that give order to creation. The success and fame of the Findhorn gardens arose in part from Dorothy's telepathic contact with these kingdoms. Many of the messages she received are included in this book, and their wisdom quickens an awareness of our partnership with all the evolutionary streams of life.",
