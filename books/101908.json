  "description": "World governments have all but seized the minds of the public. Behind the scenes, Universal Intelligence agent, Drey Cross is on a personal quest, searching for the identity of God. Now, he's about to find out the consequences of that discovery. Using his special skills of ESP, time travel, and persuasion, he explores cases that lie beyond average human ability. When he realizes that events from previous cases link to his current investigation, it begins the discovery of a bizarre web of worldwide conspiracies. The media, religion, aliens, phony natural disasters, and a drug called DU37 all contribute to the political ambition of domination over people. Torn by personal demands, strange encounters, and intrigue, Drey confronts man's age-old question, 'Who are we and where do we come from?' To his astonishment, the disillusioning answers are only the beginning when he recognizes, human religion is no match for ALIEN RELIGION.",
