By drawing on modern cosmology and ancient Kabbalah, Matt shows how science and religion can together enrich our spiritual awareness and help us recover a sense of wonder and find our place in the universe.Drawing on the insights of physics and Jewish mysticism, Daniel Matt uncovers the sense of wonder and oneness that connects us with the universe and God. He describes in understandable terms the parallels between modern cosmology and ancient Kabbalah. He shows how science and religion together can enrich our spiritual understanding.We \"embody the energy\" of the big bang, writes Matt. Furthermore, \"God is not somewhere else, hidden from us. God is right here hidden from us.\" To discover the presence of God, Matt draws on both science and theology, fact and belief, and on the truths embodied in Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam and Christianity, as well as Judaism.A rich dialogue between the physical and the spiritual, God & the Big Bang takes us on a deeply personal, thoughtful and inspiring journey that helps us find our place in the universe--and the universe in ourselves.",
