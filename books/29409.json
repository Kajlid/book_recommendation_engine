  "description": "“May Gibbs - naturalist, psychologist and artist explorer has mapped out a world of her own and conquered it completely” (Adelaide Advertiser 1918). This review of the first Snugglepot and Cuddlepie book, Tales of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie, captures the essence of what has fascinated generation after generation of Australian children — the fantasy world of May Gibbs. Hers is a world filled with fears and excitement and adventures both extraordinary and everyday, a world peopled with small creatures, the real mixed tantalisingly with the imaginary. Best of all, it is a world so unmistakably Australian that all who read of it know that magic exists in the land, as close as the bush is to their own back doorstep.Tales of Snugglepot and Cuddlepie was combined with its two sequels, Little Ragged Blossom and Little Obelia, in 1940 and since then has never been out of print. In this deluxe classic edition, the colour plates have been restored and the original colour illustrations used on the covers of the first editions have been included as part-title pages.",
