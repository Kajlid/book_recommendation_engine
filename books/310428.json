  "description": "After our conversion, and following the steps clearly lined out by Christ to be one of His, in order to hear \"Well, done, good and faithful servant. Enter into the joy of thy Lord,\" we are required to live a life of holiness and obedience. As flesh, we are unable in and of ourselves to live a life of holiness to perfection, but in mercy, Jesus offers us His grace which empowers us to live a holy, obedient lifestyle and through the work of His Spirit He is able to present us faultless.Utilizing Scripture, we learn how to live a life of godliness and holiness in this present world. May this book be a blessing to you. May it be transparent and point to the Author and Finisher of our faith! All glory goes to Him. May God bless you, encourage you, keep you, and give you peace.",
