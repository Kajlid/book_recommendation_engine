  "description": "The family boat is trashed; sixteen-year-old Matt Mahony has a phone in his pocket that doesn’t belong to him; thirteen-year-old Sinclair Mahony is lying in a hospital bed refusing to tell what happened; their dad is sitting in the dark drinking whiskey; and someone is definitely lying. The only thing Matt knows for sure is that when a Mahony brother says, \"Hit That and You’re Dead\", it’s a guarantee.",
