  "description": "THE GATHERING is an introduction to a series of romantic Highlander ghost stories. You'll want to read this before the individual warriors come along. (It's got a wee romance of its own.)  Soncerae is a Muir Witch with impressive power. But is she strong enough to save the souls of 79 young warriors who cannot escape the moors of Culloden? She tempts them with the revenge they seek but hopes she can prove to them that a heart's desire can mean so much more.  LACHLAN is next.",
