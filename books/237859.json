  "description": "When Bella French's dream boy, Jake, asks her to go out with him to make his ex- girlfriend jealous, Bella does the unthinkable... she says yes. The rules are simple. Two weeks, no kissing, and a few white lies.  The problem is that she can't stop thinking about her fake boyfriend's twin brother, Cole. Can Bella get out of her fake relationship and fall into a real one without exposing her lies, or destroying her friendships?  Funny, smart, and wonderfully romantic, the Boyfriend Agreement is a tale of one girl's journey to help her friends and find love, all without losing herself.",
