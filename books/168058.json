  "description": "My life was normal. My best friend Kate would tell you it was boring but it was mine. If that meant by 9pm on a Friday night I was in yoga pants, and sharing my favorite ice cream with my border collie Zero, I didn’t care. I was content. My perfect bubble came crashing around me when one night I was in the wrong place with the wrong person, and took on a new title. Victim. I hate that word but I find myself struggling to shake it off. Then my way out comes waltzing into my life in the form of Rhys Donovan. Blue eyes that instantly suck me into their vortex and make me forget that awful word I feel virtually tattooed on to my skin. He’s gorgeous, successful, and wants control, and I find myself wanting to give it to him. I should have known though, if I’ve learned anything in life the past couple of months, it’s that things don’t always turn out like you expect. My name is Locklyn James and this is the story of how I met the one man that may just change it all for me, if I can let him in.",
