  "description": "Jerrek Valsys was quite literally cursed. In life and in love. With no wife to see him through those long lonely nights and no way to help tame the beast that currently resides inside him, he’d spent years waiting on his mate with a glowing rock to show up. Seriously. He had. Because the prophecy told him so. But when his beast comes out and finds its mate, he may have to forget about that whole prophecy thing. Even if it means he has to give up his crown as the Fae King.  Kaia Cutestone’s life sucks. She has a job with no future and lives with her dead-beat, soul-sucking brother. The only good things in her life are her friends Jen and Avery. It’s too bad the three of them have just been kidnapped with fairy dust. Yes. Tinkerbell type fairy dust. All Kaia has going for her at this point is that she just ran into the most gorgeous man she’s ever seen. He’s smoking hot, a little dark and dangerous, and she can’t stop thinking about him naked.  Thanks to her love of shifter romance novels, Kaia might be the only person on the planet who can help Jerrek tame his beast and keep him from killing more people. Kaia may not have a glowing rock but she sure is rocking an old ugly necklace. But is that enough to get her a happily ever after and help find her friends?  Reader Note: **This is the start of a fun, action-packed and smokin' hot new trilogy. If you're a fan of fae, elves, and all fantasy creatures, pick this one up. Shifter lovers, never fear, Milly's got a sexy alpha ready for you.**",
