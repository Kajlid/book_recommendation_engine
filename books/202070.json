  "description": "From New York Times Bestseller Mimi Jean Pamfiloff, comes a new standalone Contemporary Romance. HE’S PERFECT FOR HER IN EVERY WAY, EXCEPT FOR ONE SMALL ISSUE. HE’S TOO LATE.My name is Lily Snow. And I was once the kind of ugly that turned heads and made people stare. The worst part was how I let it ruin my life and destroy my relationship with the love of my life: Maxwell Cole, one of the sexiest, wealthiest, enigmatic men on the planet. All because I felt ugly and certainly not good enough for a man’s love.But not anymore.One car wreck, three reconstructive surgeries, and some unexpected money have changed my life. I’ve started my own company, I’ve finally learned to like myself—not love, but like (hey, it’s a journey)—and I’ve met a wonderful new man who’s helped me put Max in the past where he belongs. There’s only one problem: after six long months, Maxwell Cole is back, asking for the one thing I can’t give him. And he’s not taking no for an answer. NOTE: This is a continuation of the story FUGLY, but is a standalone.",
