  "description": "What are friends for?\n\nWallflower Cate Cabot has always been content to keep the world at arms’ length, particularly from behind the register at the upscale Floridian boutique where she’s worked for the last nine years. Her days are filled with old-moneyed locals and nouveau-riche tourists, most of them paying her no mind as she rings up their lavish hauls.Until Odessa DuVernay.At first glance, she’s just another picture-perfect Palm Shores trophy wife—until she proves herself personable, humble, and unassuming. She even goes so far as to take a genuine interest in Cate, inviting her for lunch dates, matinees, and girl talk—a refreshing change of pace for the woman who never quite mastered the art of making (and keeping) friends. But what begins as an unlikely friendship detours into the unthinkable when Odessa leaves Cate a panicked voicemail asking to meet—and then ghosts her. And worse—when Cate attempts to find her, it’s as if the enigmatic Mrs. DuVernay never existed at all… Consumed, Cate refuses to stop searching. But the truth won’t come easy.In fact, it could cost her everything.",
