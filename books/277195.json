  "description": "It’s no secret I’ve always despised Peter Pan.A common threat amongst the factions, I should’ve killed him when I had the chance, long before he sank his claws deep into Tinksley’s heart.But his death at my hands wasn’t what the plan called for…I’d always been drawn to the girl, innocently enough at first…until that vile abomination marked her with his stamp, unleashing a sense of propriety I had no rights to.Didn’t matter—he had her...and I wanted her.Then like magic, he disappeared.I thought my time had come, but the road to owning Tinksley’s heart comes with a price. A price so dark and depraved it strips her of her purity and awakens the beast within. All because of the truth.Sometimes, there is honor in revenge, and it will be my utmost pleasure to watch as Peter Pan finally meets his maker.His maker who will now always and forever be my Queen.",
