  "description": "A life without feelings, a life without decisions; that’s the only life Evangeline knows. Due to the manufacturing of Remedy, her community of Impetus has discovered a way to survive and prevent the self-destructing mistakes of The Before by inhibiting feelings, creating a society that relies wholly on logic and entrusts Impetus to make all the decisions for its people. A chance encounter results in a friendship between Evangeline and Gavin that challenges Evangeline to reassess her conviction in the world she has always known and introduces her to a choice she never thought she had. By defying Impetus on her 18th birthday, Evangeline is taken on an intense journey through the divided populations, power struggles, love triangles and the vitality of physical and emotional feelings. Every single part of her being is tested and challenged to make decisions like she’s never before been forced to do. She must determine who she trusts, who she loves, and who she’s willing to sacrifice in pursuit of what’s right and to fight what she believes is wrong.",
