  "description": "In From the Cross to Pentecost, Bishop T. D. Jakes shares a magnificent depiction of the “Greatest Love Story” ever told—the love story between God and man. For those who’ve wondered about the relevancy of Jesus Christ’s life, His death on the Cross, and His resurrection from the dead, this book can answer those questions once and for all. As a master storyteller and powerful biblical expositor, the Bishop shines a light on how the tragic Fall of mankind blocked access to the tree of life, yet how God grants us access to eternal life through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ on the Cross, opening the way to receive God’s abundant life through the outpouring of the Holy Spirit on Pentecost. You’ll delight in discovering that God’s gift of the Holy Spirit not only gives us power but anoints us to be witnesses for Him. God has something glorious for every one of us who believes and receives it. The relationship with the Holy Spirit empowers us to serve with joy!",
