  "description": "A magic box that grants three wishes is a dream come true! At least that’s what high school student Keita thinks, until he opens the box and finds a girl destined to bring him trouble. Maki’s not just any girl — she’s really a devil princess and she’s after Keita’s soul. Luckily for Keita, Maki can only take his soul after he makes his third wish, and even more luckily, Maki’s really only a demon-in-training. Lacking any real knowledge of how to be evil, she has to rely on the nefarious schemes spelled out in her trusty guidebookso that she can trick Keita into using up his wishes. Until then, Maki’s going to live with Keita — and make him wish he wasn't living anymore! This witty battle of the sexes shares the same screwball appeal as Oh! My Goddess and Love Hina.",
