  "description": "KAT Being raised by my asshole police officer father and my subservient mother, I went to college with a penchant for outlaw alpha males. I knew Dalton Biskette was in the Selected Sinners MC, and a bad boy; but the night he walked into my bar I had no idea how bad he really was. He was tall, covered in tattoos, had gauged ears, was muscular, and had awesome beard. Just watching him walk was enough to make my lady bits itch, but after our first night together I found out although he was a bad boy, he was really good at some things...  He was perfect in my eyes.  My police officer father disagrees...  And so does my former Marine ex-boyfriend who just got out of jail.  BISCUIT The license plate on my bike says it all - RFOF - Ride, Fuck, Or Fight.  I've never met a girl who made me stop and pay attention to her until I met Kat. Kat's tall and gorgeous and can take all I can sexually dish out without complaint. There's only one problem, her father's a cop.  I hate cops.  If he thinks he can stop me from fucking his daughter, he's as wrong as the day is long.  HUNG is a stand-alone MC Romance with an HEA, and is book IV in the Selected Sinners series of stand-alone full length novels. This novel is 71,000 words of action-packed erotic romance. There is no cheating, nor is there sharing of partners, but the sex is detailed, graphically depicted, and frequent. No other book is required to tell this tale. PLEASE be over 18 to enjoy this book.",
