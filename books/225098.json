  "description": "Bad boy rocker Boone Thrasher takes center stage in New York Times, #1 Wall Street Journal, and USA Today bestselling author Meghan March's Real Dirty Duet! I have everything a guy could want—a new single burning up the charts, more money than a man could spend, and a woman I’m planning to marry. Until she doesn’t show up for my proposal. The life I thought was so perfect, isn’t. The guy who thought he had everything, doesn’t. I’ve got my heart on lockdown, but life sends me straight into the path of a mouthy bartender who puts me in my place. I thought I was done with love, but maybe I’m just getting started. Real Dirty is the first book of the Real Dirty Duet. Boone's story concludes in Real Sexy. You do not need to read any other books to enjoy this story!",
