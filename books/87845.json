  "description": "Max Mok has four weddings to attend this year…When I meet Kim Sung at a friend’s wedding, I don’t make the first move. God, no. But she’s delightful and gorgeous, and she asks me to dance. Later, we go to her hotel room and…Okay, I admit it doesn’t go well. She might be all about one-night stands, but I’m not used to having them.That should be the end of it. I can forget about her or, more likely, obsess about it whenever I can’t sleep.But then I see her at a second wedding. Apparently, she’s a family friend of my cousins. All three of them are getting married this summer, and she’ll also be at the next two weddings, along with her parents.Kim is even more beautiful than last time, and I really want the chance to prove I’m not a complete disaster in bed. I also want to take her on an actual date, but she has no interest in dating anyone.More than anything, though, I need to avoid her because I’m too embarrassed to hold a conversation, and my brothers have found out about my unfortunate one-night stand.Oh, no. She’s coming this way. What do I do?",
