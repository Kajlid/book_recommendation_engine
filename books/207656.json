  "description": "Jessica Taylor travels to Rowan Cottage in the Scottish Borders, which has been left to her by her great-aunt Kate. She finds herself confronted by a stranger who later turns out to be the distinctly unwelcoming Adam Brodie. Having inherited some of Aunt Kate’s spirited independence herself, Jessica is undaunted by the knowledge that the curt, ill-mannered Brodie is also the executor of her aunt’s estate.Yet with each encounter, she becomes increasingly convinced that beneath Adam’s mask of indifference there is a stormy, sensitive soul -- one that has been badly hurt in the past. His girlfriend, Ishbel Stevenson, is as possessive as she is beautiful, and used to getting her own way. With Adam secure in her clutches, she has now set her sights on Jessica’s inheritance.But Jessica has her own ideas. Rowan Cottage is not for sale; and her growing friendship with Brodie begins to get on Ishbel’s nerves. Adam Brodie’s mask looks like it might be slipping after all . . .",
