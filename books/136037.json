  "description": "What if you were afraid to even turn the doorknob to your front door when coming home because of what might wait inside? What would it take to make you step out of your shadows, to once and for all break free from the twisted security of familiarity, and take a chance, a little risk, that could change everything?What if you could ask for what you want without being afraid? Could you trust another person that much? Could you trust yourself to ask it and be willing to face rejection, having to try again?And what if you could truly begin to conquer those deep fears that hide inside you, allow your heart to open, become vulnerable, and have the chance for real intimacy--the kind that allows another to come closer than you've ever let anyone before? What if you dared to be loved and because you did, you transitioned into an unbelievable and brilliant joy?My name is Nicky Young. This is my family saga and a love story that tells about the horrible, beautiful, twisted, amazing vulnerability of family dysfunction and how I overcame fears of abandonment and deep intimacy. Relationships were things to be held at a distance. When I learned to open my heart and trust another - and myself - I was able to really, really, be alive.This story is about daring to love and transition into joy.\"I'm very excited about this book in the Broken Bottles Series by Pamela Taeuffer. As a family therapist for more than thirty years, it is my opinion these books are like no other. They offer you an inspiring adventure as well as a thoughtful journey toward trust and intimacy. Truly a stimulating and thought provoking read.\" - Louise Monahan, M.S., MFT",
