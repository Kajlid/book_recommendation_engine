  "description": "In a remote area of Uganda, a terrifying epidemic appears out of nowhere. Traveling quickly through four villages, the disease kills one-half of its human victims. Dr. William Kaplan is a renowned scientist sent to conduct the initial investigation. He suspects that the disease, a viral hemorrhagic fever, is transmitted by a mosquito – a species that no one has ever seen before. Upon his return to the United States, Dr. Kaplan realizes that he has acquired this hideous and deadly disease, despite having taken all of the precautions to prevent infection. Dr. Kaplan survives, but his troubles have only begun. The mosquitoes and the hemorrhagic fever mysteriously show up near his home in Long Island, New York. Kenneth J. Stein’s novel is a compelling story of an emerging infectious disease that leaves authorities baffled. Relying on contemporary science, Tiger Mosquitoes takes the reader on an edge-of-your-seat journey into disease discovery and crime investigation. How did the mosquito-borne hemorrhagic fever arrive in the United States? Is it a type of warfare? Is it bioterror? Another tragedy has arrived on the shores of New York. Can anything be done before it spreads to the rest of the United States? The clock is ticking…",
