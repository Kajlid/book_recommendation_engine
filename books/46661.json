  "description": "What child doesn’t worry about the monsters they can (and can’t) see! In Marlow and the Monster, Marlow has a monster–a very pesky monster. As a matter of fact, his monster has him in trouble with mom and dad fairly often! At his wits end, Marlow decides that the only prudent thing to do is to pawn the monster off on little sister Sarah...with interesting consequences! Marlow and the Monster quickly follows her recently released The Sneezy Wheezy Day, Marlow and the Monster is, in Cramer’s words, “My first trip onto the wild side!” The book is illustrated with quill pen and ink, and the only splash of color is the monster. When asked why, Cramer responds, “Because–only the kids can see it–of course!” By the end of the book, little sister Sarah helps Marlow sees his monster in a very different light. Each illustration takes Cramer between 30-40 hours to create, and she frequently works with “loops” to be able to see the ultra fine details that she renders so exquisitely. TALKING POINTS:� Monsters – Are they necessarily scary? Do they have to be?� Fun ideas on how children can imagine their monster moments as friendly moments.� Everyone is afraid (or pestered) by scary things sometimes, even mom and dad. Sometimes, all you need to do is look at it in a different way.",
