  "description": "Ivan Coyote is one of North America's preeminent storytellers and performers; they are the author, co-author, or co-editor of eleven previous books, and their TED talk has received over 1.6 million views online. Their most recent book, Tomboy Survival Guide, was shortlisted for the Hilary Weston Writers' Trust of Canada Prize for Non-Fiction and was named an American Library Association Stonewall Honor Book.In their latest, Ivan takes on the patriarchy and the political, as well as the intimate and the personal in these beguiling and revealing stories of what it means to be trans and non-binary today, at a time in their life when they must carry the burden of heartbreaking history with them, while combatting those who would misgender them or deny their very existence. These stories span thirty years of tackling TERFs, legislators, and bathroom police, sure, but there is joy and pleasure and triumph to be found here too, as Ivan pays homage to personal heroes like Leslie Feinberg and Ferron while gently guiding younger trans folk to prove to themselves that there is a way out of the darkness.Rebent Sinner is the work of an accomplished artist whose plain truths about their experience will astound readers with their utter, breathtaking humanity.",
