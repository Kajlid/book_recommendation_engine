  "title": "Taking What's Ours",
  "description": "You can't tease two alpha men like Hudson and Ridge and not expect consequences, not when you've become their every obsession.  They have a target... but their one obstacle has long legs, thick curves, and a mouth made for sin.  They do everything together, and Charlotte is no exception. She tempted them... and now they've come to collect. Together.  Can they take what they want and still stick to the plan? Five feet, seven inches of lush addiction says no.  Warning: This book contains situations involving forced submission, dubious consent, and every other scenario surrounding that genre. The heroes are obsessed beyond control. Nothing can stop them from having the only woman they'll ever want. These themes are triggers for some but sweet candy for others. If you're willing to hold off judgment until the last page the ending is worth it, I promise.",
