  "description": "As city-bred Bethany Taylor adjusts to her new life in the picturesque town of Ellsworth, she cannot ignore how the everyday motions are an echo of an older time. When Bethany meets Charles Landon and his wife, Abigail, she comes face-to-face with a past - her past - a century in the making. It is with Bethany's introduction to Abigail's brother, Andrew Wicks, a handsome and hauntingly familiar man, that she can no longer disregard their connection. When the old souls meet, Bethany finds that in her absence Andrew, Charles, and Abigail have not aged a day since her untimely death on the Estate grounds over a hundred years ago. Haunted by what should have been, Charles, Abigail, and Andrew have inexplicably remained unchanged, with only their wardrobes evolving like costumes as generations pass them by. Miraculously reunited, the four friends now face their demons, which have burdened for far too long.When Andrew and Bethany's lives first intertwined, they were both young and guilty of wasting precious moments. Now, as the clock ticks into their second chance, they realize that there is a time and place for everything, and it is happening now in the Town of Ellsworth.",
