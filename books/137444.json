  "title": "The Basement Trains",
  "description": "The poem begins in 'an ancient garden in the midnight city,' where a poet’s nocturnal recollection of the past begins an epic voyage exploring centuries of ideas and continents of profound imagery. \"The Basement Trains,\" written when Payne was not yet 30, is among the best poetry from his \"Early Period.\" This brief but powerful text conjures up a wealth of poetic legacies: from Dante in the underworld, to T.S. Eliot's 'Mind of Europe’; from English Romantic tales, to Classical Greek and Roman myths and peasant folklore. But the real value is beyond the allusions, as here Payne's talent is unique and pure and blossoming into greatness.  English Version: This Free \"1st Kindle Edition\" contains only Payne's original English text; and none of Payne’s photographic “plates” depicting antique Paris. For the bilingual French/English version with plates, you may purchase this work on paperback from ModeRoom Press.",
