  "description": "Aldo Zelnick is the star of a new comic novel series for children. Ten-year-old Aldo lives with his family in Colorado. He's not athletic like his older brother, he's not a rock hound like his best friend, but he does like bacon. And when his artist grandmother, Goosy, gives him a sketchbook to record all his artsy-fartsy ideas during summer vacation, it turns out Aldo is a pretty good cartoonist.",
