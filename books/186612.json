  "title": "THE LOVE HELIX: Four women discover new awareness in the stars",
  "description": "Four women - a lawyer, a teacher, an athlete and a soldier - are abducted by four alien men. Far from being bug-eyed monsters, the aliens have 90% human DNA. Despite the circumstances, the women are fascinated by their captors who have set out to win them over. Especially when they discover it is possible to connect with the men at a level beyond a purely physical one. But a genetic disorder on their home planet of Sacmis has resulted in a massive imbalance between the sexes. Male births have now exceeded female births to such an extent that most men can never hope to have a relationship with a woman. Let alone sex. But the women's discoveries are overshadowed by a serious threat, not only to themselves, but to all young women on Earth. Factions on the aliens' planet plan to take women as slaves and a fleet has been built for this purpose.",
