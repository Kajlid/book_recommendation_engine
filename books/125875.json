I talk to dead people and I’m not all that happy about it.‘Tis the Season’ but I’m not feeling ‘Fa-la-la.’. My BFF drags me to the mall for holiday cheer but getting felt up by tipsy Bad Santa while getting our picture taken doesn’t do it for me.The same boozy Bad Santa is murdered during the Sweet Paws Animal Adoption Gala and it falls on me to track down his killer. Someone’s rescuing the cats and dogs. Maybe -- if I'm lucky -- someone will rescue me too?",
