  "description": "There's nothing more annoying than working in a coffee shop inside a gas stationâ€”and not being able to drive. And having to deliver coffee to your bus driver.Kamikaze Bus Driver sips his coffee, then charges back into traffic before I can even take a seat. I reach out for a seat back to hold on to, but the bus swerves and I fall onto the end of a seat that's already taken, right into the lap of none other than Mike Kyle.I'm shocked. Mike's never been on this bus before. This runs against the laws of nature. I'm just so stunned I can't help blurting, \"What are you doing here?\" completely impolitely. Then I realize I'm still sitting on his lap.",
