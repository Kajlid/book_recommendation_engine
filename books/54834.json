  "description": "From award-winning author Joy Cowley comes an engaging story of two unlikely, but inseparable friends. Snake is elegant, calm and a little self-centered, while Lizard is exuberant and irrepressible. Through a series of small (and not so small) adventures, the two friends bicker, compete with each other, go into business and finally, end up as lifelong friends.There is something the matter with your voice.Ga-runch! Ga-runch! said Snake. I've got a frog in my throat! she whispered. Lizard said, Oh, I know how to fix that, and he gave Snake a mighty slap on her back. The frog shot out of Snake s mouth. It landed in the grass and, quick as a blink, it hopped away.My supper! cried Snake. That was my supper!",
