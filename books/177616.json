  "description": "Six months after Bryant walked away from his normal life, things seemed to finally be going right. He heard that his straight best friend had finally given up on finding the fated mate who had rejected him, and he was even getting married. Everything was happening just as Bryant had hoped. So why was he so miserable?  It might have something to do with how he was the fated mate Cade had searched so long for. Or the fact that he was still in love with Cade. It might also be related to the unplanned surprise in his belly.  When Cade finally sought him out again, it was impossible to keep concealing the truth.  Omega's Confession is a steamy 65-page paranormal gay romance story and the conclusion to the Fated Dates trilogy.",
