  "description": "Breandan is a godling doing godless things. For the one he loves, he is prepared to destroy the balance of nature. His beloved Rae has passed into the Otherworld, and he's determined to bring her back, no matter the consequence. Blood sacrifice is not the only cost for summoning a divine spirit to mortal form. The Loa are desperate to return to the realm of the living, and with Cael bitter in defeat, he considers an alliance even his coven cannot hope to control. Lochlann is conflicted. Blood tied to a vampire, his Wyld is in turmoil, yet he struggles to focus on anything but Daphne. Goblins enroach on fairy borders and swarm over shifter territory. Proud, the new Pack Alpha remains reluctant to bind his kind to the fairies who betrayed them, regardless of his claim on the new High Priestess. Can the creatures of the forests coexist as they did so long ago? Family. Honour. Love. There comes a time when all dreaming ends.",
