  "description": "*NOTE: This revised edition is the author-preferred version, significantly different from the original released in 2008 by Broadmoor Books. One manâ€™s struggle with religion and love is at the heart of this tragic yet beautiful story. Perry Burns, a beloved Catholic priest, is rocked by a letter he receives from Noelle Rose, his lover in a former life. Perry is tormented by the return of memories and the sacrifices he has made for God. Both his conscience and a mysterious stranger practically force him onto the fateful trip into a past that will surface every thought and feeling he has worked so hard to bury. Heaven and hell are on the line, and once again, Perry must choose.",
