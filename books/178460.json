  "description": "*A fun and romantic novel by Amazon #1 Best Selling Author Lucy McConnell  Early on, Pamela Jones realized she had an unusual talent for putting two people together. Over the years, she's turned it into a successful matchmaking service for the ultra-wealthy: Billionaire Marriage Brokers. While she specializes in \"business\" marriages--paring people off because of their skills, education, or training--she can spot a potential love match a mile away. When Pamela has a \"good feeling\" about a bride and groom a business marriage can become so much more.  MaKayla thought taking a job as an event planner for a high-end hotel would be a wonderful lead into opening her own events business. However, a one year no-contact clause leaves her clientless if she quits. With nowhere to go, she is intrigued with Pamela's offer for a one-year contract running charities and overseeing contributions--until she finds out that to take her dream job, she also has to take Gabe...for better or worse.",
