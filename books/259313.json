Born into a family of great wealth, she has never wanted for anything…except for a man who truly understood her. Her parents, constantly exasperated by her inability to find a husband, have just about given up hope. They think her irresponsible and childish, but she thinks they all have missed the point entirely. When another suitor decides that he doesn’t want to marry her, Victoria decides to take matters into her own hands. Finding an advertisement in the Matrimonial Times for a rancher in Oklahoma who is looking for a bride, she decides to write to him.  She is faced with the difficult realization that the life she always imagined might be an impossibility. Disappointing everyone at every turn, she starts to see that she might not be cut out for a life on a ranch with a man who has worked hard every day of his life.  Will she choose to stay and learn? Or will fear overcome her, and make her return home empty-handed?Click the link below to view the book on Amazon! https://amzn.to/2PdmMTq",
