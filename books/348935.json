  "description": "Chris is an ordinary guy with a boring job, a perfect fiancÃ©, and plans for a happy, if predictable, future. But when the dead stop dying and become, instead, simply \"\"changed,\"\" ordinary isn't so comforting anymore. Wandering stray animals suddenly develop a taste for flesh and brains, and while most of the human zombies might be harmless, can anyone really be sure? With the help of a morning show shock-jock who has recently turned into a zombie and the burnt-out walking remains of a businessman, Chris becomes the backbone of a fight for undead rights among the fear, prejudice, and uncertainty dividing the living and the not quite dead.",
