The novel upon which was based the feature film \"Of Love & Betrayal.\"When Jack O'Conner finds a gold piece of eight off the Florida Keys with the partial coordinates to French pirate Jacques de Une Oei's sunken hoard of stolen Spanish doubloons etched upon it, he steals his boss's 76' sailboat and sets out to recover the treasure. What ensues is a series of steamy romantic encounters and bitter personal betrayals, for the remaining two pieces of eight with coordinates on them belong to two women, Sandy Sequoia, a mid-level drug dealer from Miami, and Portia Pennington, the repressed daughter of an English merchant tycoon, both of whom Jack invites onto his sailboat to go with him in search of the Spanish doubloons, and with both of whom he falls in love. When the infamous Hundred-Years Storm arrives just as the three recover the treasure, they must decide between petty selfishness and their tentative love for one another.",
