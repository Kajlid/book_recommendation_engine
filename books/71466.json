  "description": "It is a devastated world where nothing is what it Ancient relics possess technologically advanced powers, members of the old Order are hunted by the governing Watch yet revered by the people, and the great energy that connects all seems to also be destroying all. The only hope lies in Galen, a man of the old Order and a Keeper of relics, and his 16-year-old apprentice, Raffi. They know of a relic with great power that has been hidden for centuries. As they search for it, they will be hunted, spied on, and tested beyond their limits. For there are monsters—some human, some not—that also want the relic’s power and will stop at nothing to get it.  “A gritty and enjoyable tale of adventure, poised on the dividing line between science fiction and fantasy . . . Should easily please Fisher's fans, as well as those hungry for dystopian reading material.”— Publishers Weekly , on The Dark City",
