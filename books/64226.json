  "description": "When one of their own ties the knot with a dominatrix (no pun intended), The Impalers--a vampire rock band--are ready to party down. But trouble awaits them once again when they wake up... Attending their bandmate Saxon's wedding seemed simple enough for Johnny Malone and Drake Hanover. But after waking up in a dominatrix's dungeon, they realize their cash and cell phones have been stolen--along with the bride's wedding dress and the groom. And then there's the matter of the two women in the room... Loose cannon Johnny is handcuffed to Lizette, an uptight paper pusher. She wants to help save Johnny from the horrible fate in store for him at the hands of the Vampire Alliance, but he won't sign the paperwork. Then there's Josie, the waifish caterer from the reception, who rescues Drake from a sex swing. Josie may be cute and make a great cupcake, but Drake knows she might also be the thief. Or it could have been that gang of drag queens all dressed as Cher... Regardless, Johnny and Lizet",
