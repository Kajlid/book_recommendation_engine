  "description": "What do a private detective, a hacker and an assassin have in common? The desire to help when justice needs a hand. Neither the dark, tragic anti-hero nor the James Bond super-hero type, Raja is a wealthy Oxford-educated PI of mixed Caribbean descent who possesses a strong empathic power and a sixth sense for evil that gives him headaches and steers him straight into trouble. His partner Vinny Moore is a gorgeous hipster geek who prefers hacking computers to haute couture. The young husband of a wealthy heiress is found dead on his yacht floating off the California coastline. His death is ruled an accident and the case is closed. The grieving widow, certain her husband was murdered but getting no help from the police, turns to Raja Williams who has dedicated his resources to help those in need of justice. When Raja arrives in Los Angeles and more bodies begin to pile up, he suspects a coverup that may go as high up as the governor. With the help of his partner Vinny, a highly skilled hacker, Raja must unravel the case before everyone involved, including the two of them, winds up dead. A colorful cast of characters, great dialogue and a suspenseful twisting plot make The Color of Greed an entertaining read. This is the first book in the Raja Williams series.",
