  "description": "\"Hilarious, inspiring, and beautifully written.\" – George Mahood, bestselling author of Free Country One August morning, I walked out of my Seville home taking nothing but a small, roll-aboard bag, a Eurail pass, and my husband. We were traveling with no fixed time limit, no reservations, and only a loose idea of our itinerary. Our goal was to see if we could still have the kind of spontaneous adventures we’d enjoyed in our youth. We spent three months on trains, mostly in Eastern Europe, and the results – often hilarious, occasionally harrowing, definitely life-changing – form the basis of my new book, Adventures of a Railway Nomad: How Our Journeys Guide Us Home. \"Adventurous and bold . . . full of twists and surprises.\" – Chris Brady, NY Times bestselling author of A Month of ItalyI traveled 6000 miles on 38 trains through 13 countries: Spain, Italy, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Croatia. \"Karen's storytelling is, if possible, even more enticing than her astonishing journey.\" – Alicia Bay Laurel, bestselling author of Living on the Earth",
