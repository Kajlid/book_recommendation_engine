  "description": "Nicolette Mace: The Raven Siren has her work cut out for her as she battles against one of the most dangerous men she has ever known. Kevin Metis. The man that killed her father, killed her mother, raped and killed her sister and raped her. With the help of Fred, Siren managed to send Kevin Metis to prison for eight years. Eight years of rotting in prison gave Metis plenty of time to plan his revenge. In eight years Siren has made a name for herself as a P.I and Fred has risen up through the ranks to the dizzying heights of Chief. The two are closer than ever and of all their many weaknesses, they are each others greatest. If Kevin Metis being out and out for blood wasn't enough of a threat, he has hired the most deadly assassin, Ryuu Blade, to help him out. Like Siren, Blade does not play well with others and before too long, Siren has dug herself in over her head and under the skin of Blade. Danger is around every corner and everyone coming to Siren for help isn't as helpless as they seem.",
