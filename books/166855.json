  "description": "Anton loves a well-prepared steak. That's all he's hoping for when he meets Greg, his new live-in chef. Flamboyant and confident, Greg attracts Anton immediately, and he finds himself wanting to know Greg better. Much better. It's not just a normal attraction for Anton. He's an unusual man, with unusual desires, and Greg seems to be filling a place in Anton's life that he's never explored. Anton prefers to be a civilized man and not let his werewolf self run free, but itâ€™s the wolf that wants to claim Greg for a mate. Someone disapproves of Anton's relationship with Greg. Someone close to Anton, someone inside his carefully controlled household. As he and Greg come closer and closer to mating for life, the danger gets nearer, forcing them to depend on each other to stay safe, and for Greg to stay sane. Can Anton convince Greg that his wolf would never hurt him and keep Greg safe from the menace outside their relationship, too? Sexy, razor sharp and fast-paced, Bite will keep your heart racing!",
