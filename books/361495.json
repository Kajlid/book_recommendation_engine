  "description": "The body washed up on a beach is the son of a prominent IrishJewish family: ‘one of our own all right, but a Jew nonetheless..’A body which washes up on a beach in the Dublin suburbs leads Minogue into the wider realm of political conspiracy. Paul Fine was the son of a prominent judge whose family had lived in Dublin for generations and who had played a key role in the city’s small, complex Jewish community. When Paul Fine is found dead, the evidence seems to point to a PLO-linked organization. Smart detective work and an unexpected second murder lead Minogue and the Squad in a wholly new direction. Soon he discovers that he has come upon another extremist sect of religious zealots, one which has political ambitions and, just as ominous, police and government connections. As Minogue unravels the enigma of these murders, he finds himself understanding something of the Jews of Dublin, people who feel bound to Ireland and yet remain outsiders.",
