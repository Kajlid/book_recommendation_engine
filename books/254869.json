  "description": "Like all centaur shifters, Sheriff Calhoun is the epitome of honor. He protects his small town of Stallion Ridge and its people from any threat large or small. When word comes in that the notorious Iron Bandits are making a play for a train in his territory he’s both livid and invigorated. If anyone can bring these thieves to justice it’s him and his crew. What he did not expect was having a charming, whiskey-eyed outlaw dumped in his lap that challenged everything he thought he knew.",
