  "description": "Is friendship worth protecting when your best friend is with your soul mate? I am not like everyone else. I have dreams, visions of past lives, that haunt even my waking hours. My past lives are filled with danger, deceit, and fleeting moments of love. And they are beginning to rule every moment of my present one. Since meeting Eric, they have only grown stronger. They are telling me something I cannot ignore: that he and I belong together. I know it sounds crazy, but I can't help believing these visions are real. There must be a reason for them. But what does it mean when they show me horrible things? What does it mean when they tell me not to trust my best friend? I may not have much, not the greatest family or many friends, but I do have a best friend whom everyone adores. Aurora is kind, pretty, and popular, and we have been inseparable since childhood. Since she began dating Eric, though, things have changed between us. Aurora doesn't deserve Eric, or my friendship. But what if I'm wrong? What if I'm crazy? Is believing the impossible a sign that I am losing my mind, or could ignoring these visions be dangerous?",
