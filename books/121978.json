  "description": "\"In their innocence and wisdom, in their connection to the earth and its most ancient rhythms, animals show us a way back to a home they have never left.\" So says Susan Chernak McElroy, a cancer survivor who credits much of her triumph over terminal illness to the love of the animals in her life. From the courage of her dog, Keesha, who taught McElroy how to face challenges with grace and acceptance, to the uncanny victory over leukemia she witnessed in a foundling kitten, McElroy offers a unique and compelling chronicle of her healing journey. In Animals as Teachers and Healers, McElroy shares her story along with other true testaments from many other souls who have been touched, for a moment or for a lifetime, by the loving energies of animals.",
