Parents want their kids to be healthy, and this book, geared toward kids ages 3-12, shows them how. Cooking Light provides the facts about kids' nutrition-what kids need and what they don't need. But it's not just about \"kid\" foods and \"adult\" foods-it is about foods suitable for the entire family.More than 100 kid-tested recipes show parents (and kids) they don't have to become short-order cooks when mealtime rolls around. In this easy-to-use, spiral-bound book, parents will learn how to get their kids involved in healthy cooking-teaching those skills that will prepare them for a lifetime of healthy habits and healthful, delicious meals. Cooking Light The Ultimate Kid-Approved Cookbook is brimming with these fun features to enhance time spent in the kitchen:\"Kitchen Classroom\" and \"Nutrition Notes\" teach moms and kids about nutrition and interesting food facts.\"Meals Made Easy\" provides information about easy pairing of dishes to complete a meal.\"Young Chefs Can\" and \"Older Chefs Can\" boxes with each recipe list the tasks kids of all ages can help with, allowing the entire family to be involved in getting dinner on the table.Quotes from the Kids Tasting Panel throughout the book tell why they liked a particular dish, their serving suggestions, and ideas for extras.",
