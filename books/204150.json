  "description": "Bella never imagined falling in love with the guy she had an one night stand with. Especially a guy who supposedly had ties in the underworld. It happened though. She was ready to build a future with him when his ex-girlfriend showed up and messed everything up. The only thing she could do was run away hoping he’d leave her alone. Little did she know that the word ‘giving up’ did not exist in the Gavino dictionary.",
