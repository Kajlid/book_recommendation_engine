  "description": "A Dragon-Shifter Ménage BONUS BOOK – For a limited time, Claimed by the Dragons comes with the first book in The Hidden Alpha trilogy!  Beautiful, innocent Delyse has been waiting for three years to be claimed by her dragon-shifter husband, Eric Drekinn. Eric’s Beta, Viggo, bought her for his Alpha, but now they are both waiting for the next solar eclipse, when the ancient dragon will rise from his long hibernation. Unfortunately, Delyse finds it hard to wait patiently when the charming, handsome Viggo is just within arm’s reach. Before she knows it, she falls madly in love with him. It’s wrong, it’s forbidden. She belongs to Eric, and she doesn’t even know if Viggo feels the same.  When Eric Drekinn rises from his deep sleep, his young bride is there to offer herself to him. He’s afraid to love again, but Delyse is everything he could wish for. Then, he starts suspecting there might be something more than friendship between his bride and his Beta, and he isn’t sure how to react. On one hand, Delyse belongs to him. On the other hand, Viggo is his best friend.  Eric’s choice will surprise both Delyse and Viggo.  Author’s Note: Claimed by the Dragons is a full, standalone novel with no cliffhangers. However, it is a sequel to Sold to the Alpha (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014...) and The Hidden Alpha (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01B...). Reading these two books first will help you understand the characters and their backgrounds better.",
