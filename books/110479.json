  "description": "How could he possibly know that she, a complete stranger, would inexplicably affect his life and be with him forever, whether she was at his side or not? Drawn together in Russia on a romantic Black Sea beach, Serge and Janna fall headlong in love and rush into marriage. Their divorce months later leads to years of \"if only ...\" Pressured apart by family and fate, they repeatedly cross paths, never quite reconnecting, never quite letting go. Changes in the world, their careers, and their lives, cause them to surrender to external influences. As they build separate lives and families, their destinies, shaped by post-Soviet political intrigue, collapse into a struggle for their very survival, and dreams of a better life. Long time later, distant memories of young, passionate love spawn emails that lead to international calls reviving an intimate, romantic connection to remind them-and us-that Love is Never Past Tense",
