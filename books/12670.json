Rollo tries living with various woodland animals, but he finds out that there is no place like home, and returns to his family just in time for \"the best Christmas ever.\"Among the animals who take him in are an owl family, a mother bear and two rambunctious cubs, some playful river otters, a hungry lynx and a friendly moose family.Jan Brett creates an irresistible, mischievous character that kids will recognize in themselves.
