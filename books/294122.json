  "description": "Luther is the most beautiful of my captors. Still I hate him more than the others. I hate him so much that the darkness inside me comes alive.  When I started university and moved out of my foster parents’ home, I hoped everything would change. That the nightmares, the visions, the voices would stop, but they got worse.  Then three of the most dangerously stunning fae crashed into my life. Intoxicating eyes. Devilish lips. Dangerous intentions.  They insist I belong with them in the Wandering Realm. A place where love is lost, where war is brewing between two realms, and where the once powerful royals are being hunted down and slaughtered.  I’m their savior they say, but there are no saviors amid monsters. These princes who are tasked to keep me safe are keeping secrets of their own. Secrets that will kill me.  So, how am I meant to rid the realm of evil when I feel the dark spreading through my veins?  Scorching hot first book in the brand new ‘WINTER'S THORN’ Trilogy. Reverse Harem Fantasy Romance.",
