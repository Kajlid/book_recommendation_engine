And the burly, axe-toting, mountain man that just rescued me from an icy death sure fits the bill. At least, he would if he could pull that spruce tree out of his back chimney. I’ve always been the nice girl, but all it’s ever gotten me is a cheating ex, a closet full of bridesmaid dresses, and one lonely Christmas after another. Maybe it’s time to try the naughty list… Love,  Millie PartridgeDear Santa, I know I said I wanted to meet a woman. I just wasn’t expecting to find her in my pear tree.

Despite the off-key caroling, the baking disasters, and that one modest house fire, Millie Partridge is growing on me like a sexy little piece of mistletoe. I’m trying to keep it cool, but if she knew all the things I’ve been thinking, it might lead to a not-so-silent night and more than one thing getting laid under my Christmas tree…Send help, Sam Barnes  ★ ★ ★ ★ ★Pine-ing for the perfect holiday romance?
