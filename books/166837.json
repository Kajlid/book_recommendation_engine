  "description": "They have one summer to find what was lost long ago.\n\"Never settle for less than the truth,\" she told him.\n But when you don't even know your real name, the truth gets a little complicated. It can nestle so close to home it's hard to see. It can even flourish inside a lie. And as Chase Walker discovered, learning the truth about who you are can be as elusive--and as magical--as chasing fireflies on a summer night.A haunting story about fishing, baseball, home cooking, and other matters of life and death...from the author of The Dead Don't Dance and When Crickets Cry.",
