Against the backdrop of third world conflict and existential dislocation, this politically charged, modern love story is an entertaining, thought provoking, funny, and passionate journey of discovery that tests the bounds of family, love and trust.Independent, man-eating, international aid worker Lira falls hopelessly for Gabriel, a brokenhearted American reporter on assignment in West Africa. One magical evening in Liberia sets in motion a passionate quest for true love and identity. Separated soon after by time, space, and their own particular anxieties, this novel traces their attempt to reconnect, and face up to their self-destructive demons. Sushi in Liberia is the author's first novel.",
