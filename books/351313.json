  "description": "One by one, Boston's leading citizens are disappearing without a trace. When Hollywood homicide detective Frank Buchanan's estranged uncle becomes the latest victim, he turns to his resourceful, albeit lethally unbalanced friend, Daniel Rourke, for assistance. Cold-shouldered by the local authorities, the two friends embark on an off-the-books, undercover search of Beantown's sordid underbelly for Buchanan's uncle. The stakes are soon raised as the carefully choreographed, artfully mutilated bodies of the missing men and women begin to appear at various city landmarks. At each scene a cryptic note is 'Out of sight, out of mind.' In the final frantic moments leading up to the killers' explosive endgame, Daniel and Buchanan catch scent of their trail, following it deep into the underground labyrinth of a private gentlemen's club named The Colosseum, deeper still into a secret past long thought dead and buried, a past that everyone involved, Buchanan included, is loathe to exhume.",
