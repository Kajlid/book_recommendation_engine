  "title": "The Light in Your Pocket: Illuminate Your Life in 140-Characters or Less",
  "description": "We all seek meaning and purpose in our lives, to know what truly lights us up, and to allow that light to illuminate our lives and our world. But, that takes time. And time is something our emailing, texting, Facebooking, Twittering, sharing-our-lives-in-140-characters-or-less culture has very little, well, time for. While technology is facilitating our discovery of ever faster ways of moving through our lives, and keeping us more connected than ever, we are actually experiencing less meaning and purpose in those connections; with our desire to know what truly lights us up often remaining unfulfilled. Balancing the reality of our 21st century lifestyle with this deep need for inner understanding, meaning and purpose is the challenge of our times. THE LIGHT IN YOUR POCKET: ILLUMINATE YOUR LIFE IN 140-CHARACTERS OR LESS was written to assist you with that balance. A unique collection of insightful quotes and mantras that reflect themes of spirituality, Oneness, community, nature, Divine energy, feminine power, joy, freedom, peace, compassion, forgiveness, self-esteem, letting go, receiving, creativity, gratitude, self-empowerment, being and love (based on the author’s own life lessons and her work as a life coach, writer and speaker), are presented to inspire not only the social media generation, but everyone who could use a small word or a brief turn of a phrase, that just might be the spark to illuminate your own inner light of meaning and purpose for the life you truly desire. And, in so doing, help you discover the universally enduring truth that, in fact, the light in your pocket … is YOU!",
