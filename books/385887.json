  "description": "Helki and Igashu, friends and constant companions since childhood, will soon perform the tribal ritual of the Bow and the Basket. Choosing the basket means living a domestic life, to be a Two-Spirit, a lover of men. To choose the bow means becoming a provider, the head of the family, and a warrior, if war should come. Both are worthy choices, but for Igashu, his fatherâ€™s sole surviving son, the obligation to lead his family after his father's death presses heavily on his heart. Yet if Helki and Igashu choose different paths, their love may not survive.",
