  "description": "A single dad... With a face and a name that contradict his culture, Scott has always known he'll settle down with a nice Latina, one who'll fit into his life and understand his definition of family. With four generations to support, he doesn't need anyone adding to the pressure he's under. But that's way in the future. For the moment, he's got enough on his plate. And an ex-party girl... Ellie is finally making a solid effort to get her life together. She's back at school, has a steady job, and most importantly, she's shed her party girl persona. No more alcohol, no more men, and no more friends who don't have her back. Now if only her new life weren't so lonely. After a chance meeting, Scott and Ellie begin an unlikely friendship, one that soon pokes and prods at their convictions. But what happens when the wrong person makes the world feel right? Turns out that taking a chance on the one person you never saw coming takes courage. Will they dig deep or let it all slip away? Not So Far Away ends on a mild cliffhanger and an implied HFN. For those who can't get enough of Scott and Ellie, the duet concludes with The Here and Now.",
