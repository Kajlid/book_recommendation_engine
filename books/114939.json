  "description": "A rising star at one of the world's preeminent investment banks recounts his power hungry and sex-crazed youth in this outrageous, satirical bildungsroman. From childhood dreams of playing in the NFL to a career on Wall Street playing with middle class pensions— and the schoolyard brawls, love triangles, rock club showcases, and frat house feuds in between— Frank Parker will do whatever it takes to stay on top, however desperate. In Alpha, A.D. Aliwat offers a mesmerizing look inside the mind of a predator as pitiable as he is terrifying and a critical examination of what it takes to really make it in America.",
