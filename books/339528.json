  "description": "love belongs to those who do the feeling ―an exciting collection of new and selected poetry by Judy Grahn. The book contains selections from Judy's entire body of poetic work from The Work of a Common Woman , The Queen of Wands and The Queen of Swords , to new poems written between 1997 and 2008. Judy's poetry is rangy and provocative. It has been written at the heart of so many of the important social movements of the last forty years that the proper word is foundational―Judy Grahn's poetry is foundational to the spirit of movement. People consistently report that Judy's poetry is also uplifting―an unexpected side effect of work that is aimed at the mind as well as the heart. Judy continues to insist that love goes beyond romance, to community, and that community goes beyond the everyday world, to the connective worlds of earth and spirit.",
