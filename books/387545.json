You cut the top off Big Hill and you'd be killing it for sure.' There is gold in the Big Hill on Clare Island. It would make many of the islanders rich. But to claim it would mean destroying the hill for ever. Jessie Parsons and her American cousin, Jack, can't bear this to happen. The Big Hill is the heart of the island, special, beautiful, the perfect place. Can they save it before it's too late? Not on their own, maybe. But they have a secret ally...the ghost of Grania O'Malley.",
