  "description": "LaVerne Williams is an ex-big league ballplayer with an attitude problem and a barbecue joint to run. Ferguson Glen is an Episcopal priest and fading literary star with a drinking problem. A.B. Clayton and Sammy Merzeti are two lost souls in need of love, understanding, and another cigarette. Thin Blue Smoke is an American redemption tale. It is a story of love and loss, hope and despair. Hilarious and heart-rending, sacred and profane, this book marks the emergence of a vital new voice in American fiction.",
