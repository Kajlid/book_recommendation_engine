  "description": "I make my living as a hustler, and I'm great at it. I don’t have a single tell and I use that to my advantage to manipulate any situation. I’ve always known what a person is about to do before they’ve even decided.  That is, until I met Penelope. I can’t get a read on her, and what’s worse, she doesn’t want anything to do with me. Which only makes me want her more.  Now I’m in for the hardest hustle of my life. Somehow I have to convince her she belongs with me. Good thing I’m always up for a challenge.",
