  "description": "Everyone has three lives. A public life, a private life, and a secret life.I’m a junior in high school, and yet, I’ve never been on a date.Everybody says it's because my overprotective brothers scare all the guys away, but I can't help wondering if there's something wrong with me.That is, until I hear a rumor that I’m secretly dating my brothers’ best friend.What?Sure, I used to think Mack was the most perfect guy in the universe, but I got over that crush years ago.And even though he teases my brothers about taking me to Make-Out Point, there’s no way he’d actually make good on that threat. I’ve only ever been the dorky girl next door to him.But when Mack’s sleepwalking episodes lead him to staying a few nights on the trundle bed in my room and we talk and share things we never tell anyone else, I start to wonder if a secret relationship is exactly what I want.My brothers have made it clear that Mack is never allowed near me. But what my brothers don’t know can’t hurt them, right?",
