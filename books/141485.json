The Freewalker commander decides to give her task in exchange for leniency in what could be a death sentence. She must locate an Atlantean crystal that will allow Tyana to return from Earth, where she has been detained by members of the elite bent on returning the former regime to power.  The only problem: the crystal is in the hands of Welon, Cyena’s ex-fiancé, a Mindwalker following his father’s path towards madness.",
