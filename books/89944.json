First, as surgical assistant, and second, as the designer for her new raptor sanctuary.Bailey protects her privacy with the vigilance of a hawk, hiding in her rescue center where she has complete control over her life and her work. Isolated on Washington’s Olympic Peninsula, she’s surrounded by natural beauty and plenty of solitude. Until sexy Ken Pearson walks in with a wounded bird and Bailey finds her life has been invaded by more than just an extra beak to feed.Sometimes pain is invisible, and only love can soar over protective barriers and heal a wounded heart.",
