  "description": "I love three things in this world more than life itself:1. My family and housemates (both current and former)2. Musicals3. My best friend, Eric MoodyThe first two are no surprise to anyone who knows me.The third is a secret I’ll carry to my grave.Because even though Eric fits in well with my crazy family and he’s the outgoing complement to my quiet self, we want different things.I want him. He wants something I can never give. And I refuse to sacrifice his happiness for my own.Most of the time, I manage to keep my feelings for him under lock and key—but things change when Eric moves in with me temporarily.Now, he’s here all the time. And it’s harder and harder not to imagine what life together could be like … if only.The final straw? When he starts helping me prepare for my (forced) lead role in a local musical.Because yeah. You try holding back the tidal wave of feelings you’ve been keeping at bay when your sexy best friend offers to “practice kiss” you.My fortitude is headed straight for the edge of a cliff—and the thrill of the impending fall has never felt so electrifying.Or so terrifying.Fans of Sarah Adams and Emma St. Clair will love this closed-door, friends-to-lovers romantic comedy with lots of sizzle and spice, but no on-page explicit content.",
