  "description": "First staged in Mumbai in 1991, Bravely Fought the Queen juggles between two spaces: A centre stage where an empirical drama removes the mask of hypocrisy from a seemingly \"normal\" urban household; and a small, rear backdrop from where emerges the raison d'etre of each protagonist. The family in focus is that of two brothers, Jiten and Nitin, who run an advertising agency and are married to sisters: Dolly and Alka. Their mother, Baa, moves between the two households, attached more to her memories of the past than to any present reality. Marital friction, sibling rivalry, the traditional tension between mother-in-law and daughters-in-law, the darker moments of business and personal dealings, the play takes us through the entire gamut of emotional experience as it winds to a climactic finish. With its relentless pace, crisp idiom and unflinching insight into the urban milieu, this is a play that confirms Mahesh Dattani's reputation as India's most influential playwright.",
