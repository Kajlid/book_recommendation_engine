  "description": "James “Jamie” Silver is all grown up, working for the same high-profile, überwealthy people she’s spent her entire life surrounded by—as the outsider. With a new hairstyle and a sliver of confidence, she attacks the role daily…because since she was the scholarship kid at a hoity-toity District of Columbia prep school, Jamie has never quite belonged. Especially when it comes to her longtime BFF and secret crush, Ford Conway III. As the oldest son of a Supreme Court justice and the world’s savviest society lady, Ford Conway was meant to attend prep school and grow into someone great. His mom never predicted he’d befriend the charity case. Much to her chagrin, as young kids and college classmates, Ford and Jamie were inseparable. The duo shared all their secrets, until graduation, when they shared a magical night. That is, until Ford forced himself to run away from his family’s political ties and his growing feelings for Jamie Silver.Now a famous Hollywood producer, Ford makes his own rules. Except when his father becomes gravely ill, and he’s forced to come home and runs head-on into the only woman who ever captured his heart. Although James Silver doesn’t remotely resemble the girl he fell for decades ago, his heart doesn’t care. But his mom certainly does…In a cross-country second chance love story, the pair embark on discovering one another as adults and finding happiness in their back nine.",
