  "title": "Survivor: An Abortion Survivor's Surprising Story of Choosing Forgiveness and Finding Redemption",
  "description": "An abortion survivor and leading pro-life spokeswoman tells her inspiring and sometimes surprising story of redemption, healing, and forgiveness, offering grace and support not shame to women facing the most difficult decision of their lives.Raised in a loving adoptive home, at age twenty-one Claire Culwell decided to meet her birth mother. That's when she got the shock of her life. Claire's mother, Tonya, confessed that when she was pregnant with Claire, she'd gone to a clinic for an abortion, but afterward her belly had continued to grow. What both Tonya and her doctor had missed was that she'd actually been pregnant with twins. The abortion that terminated the life of Claire's twin had miraculously spared Claire.Upon learning this shocking news, Claire quickly offered forgiveness and love to her birth mother and embraced the unique opportunity to share her story with the world. But when she faced her own unplanned pregnancy out of wedlock, she was met with censure and rejection from pro-life and Christian organizations. Altered by the experience, Claire reshaped her message, vowing to extend grace and offer empathy to women in pregnancy crisis, while challenging churches to radically support women and truly live out their value for life by promoting adoption.A unique voice in the pro-life movement, Claire demonstrates how God can turn bad into good, and invites readers to generously offer love and compassion toward women and men struggling with unplanned pregnancies.RUNNING TIME => 7hrs.Â©2021 Claire Culwell, Lois Mowday Rabey, and Steve Rabey (P)2021 Random House Audio",
