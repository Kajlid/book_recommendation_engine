After taking over the family businesses when he dies unexpectedly, a family secret comes to light and turns her world upside down. She is thrown into the mix with another gang of criminals with very different lifestyles and opinions. When she meets their leader, the sexy, mercurial and very dangerous Jager she is annoyed by his icy cold demeanor and his belief that their lifestyle is no place for a woman. Determined to change his mind, Tatum sets out on a course that not only causes him to open up to her and see her as an equal, but forces him to face his past and acknowledge that heâ€™s fallen in love with her. When they accept their feelings, will their obligations allow them to be together? Or will it be too late?",
