  "description": "Dublin, 1970s and 80s.Lizzy and Rocky are in their late teens and live in Dublin’s inner city. Both possessing superb musical talent, they've at last formed an emerging rock band in their mother's memory. It was their mother, after all, who drove their musical ambition as she was a professional entertainer. Unfortunately, they lost her, at a crucial time, through breast cancer. They're determined to make it musically in part due to her.Their newly bereaved father doesn't agree. An obstinate military man, Pipe Sergeant Jim Rockingham suddenly dictates the break-up of the band and the immediate enlistment of the boys in the army. While they think he is being cold and callous for its own sake, he is in fact under enormous pressure to repay years of insidious patronage provided by a dangerous local politician who now has ideas for Rocky. Ideas that involve using Rocky as a spy to infiltrate the local VIP Military - Diplomatic Bar & Restaurant. However, when Piper Jim is provided with the name of a young officer for 'elimination', he panics and tries to wash his hands of his involvement. Easier said than done for the heavily compromised Pipe Sergeant. Rocky, having innocently befriended the targeted young officer, overhears the elimination plot. His father pleads with him to keep the plot to himself in case they both become potential targets.But what is the true price of an abject failure to help a friend and military colleague in danger?",
