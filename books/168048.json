  "description": "Does evil exist?Walter, a renowned archaeologist, struggles to make sense of what is happening in Peru. There, deep within a jungle temple compound, an oppressive force has emerged. In the shadow of such depravity, Walter will learn that true evil does exist-and he's about to experience its many faces and incarnations. The scholar's curiosity wrestles with that inner voice, telling him to be weary of the darkness lurking in the shadows.Amid all his questions and fears, Walter knows one thing as certainty: unless it can be stopped or contained or destroyed, this entity will consume everything and everyone in its path. How can any man hope to combat this level of evil? Before he realizes it, Walter is consumed by darkness and let loose a horrible evil upon his family and the world.\"They are not alone.\"This evil pits neighbor against neighbor, husband against wife, parent against child, and turns friends into enemies as it turns their nightmares into reality. Will their love be enough to vanquish this much hatred-or will they need a power beyond their own to overcome it?",
