The series is aimed at kids ages eight and up. Instead of traveling to Russia with mom and dad, ten-year-old Alex and his nine-year-old sister Katie are stuck in a creepy old house with their weird Aunt Karina. Alex thinks that his summer is ruined. But then the kids discover a portal that leads them into the magical world of the Firebird. That world quickly becomes dangerous. The kids search for the way back, but instead find Baba Yaga, the Russian witch. \"We got a little lost,\" Alex says to Baba Yaga. \"And now you may get a little eaten!\" she responds. Can Alex and Katie get back to their aunt's house? Or will they become Baba Yaga's latest victims?",
