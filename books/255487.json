  "title": "Lost in the Crowd",
  "description": "Lost in the Crowd\n is an engaging, humorous, and sometimes poignant autobiographical story that will have you feeling as though you are right there with the author - laughing, crying, and stumbling through all the ups and downs of his amazing, hard-to-believe, often hilarious, crazy, heartwarming journey through life - a journey that recurrently seems to be influenced by mysterious forces beyond his control and understanding.The book is defined by events that occurred in the author's life during the two years it was being written. These events bring the book to life and give it a whole new meaning - a meaning that could never have been envisaged when the writing started in October 2015.It has been described as a brilliantly compelling quirky book of inspiration, coincidence, love, luck, loss, life, chance, opportunism, emotion, comedy, stupidity, amazement, danger, worry, survival, happiness, laughter, and WTF!See www.litcbook.com to learn more.Contains original artwork by chrisriversart.com.",
