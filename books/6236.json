He's an Omega and is destined to increase the power of an Alpha and his Betas each time they use his body. Tristan may be resigned to his fate of being sold to the highest bidder, but that doesn't mean he is going to be happy about being a possession passed from one user to the next. Alpha Jared and his Betas, Cameron and Rhyce, bring Tristan to their pack. From their first encounter, they quickly learn that Tristan is an Omega in power but definitely not in personality. He is stubborn, strong willed, and determined that, while his body may be theirs with the contract, his heart and soul are not for sale. Can they find a common ground for their budding power, or will it all come tumbling down around them when they need it the most? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
