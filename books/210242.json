  "description": "I’d do anything for her . . . even give up my crown.\n As the son of mob boss Don Carlo Bertoli, I’m considered the crown prince of the Bertoli Family, but it’s a title I’d rather earn than have it handed to me.  When Luisa Mendosa, the beautiful daughter of a rival mob boss shows up on my father’s doorstep, I know I shouldn’t be getting involved with her. But with long, honey blonde hair, a voluptuous body, and an ass that would make Sir Mix-A-Lot jealous, I can’t help myself.  Her father doesn’t approve of us, and when he learns she’s carrying my baby, all hell’s going to break loose — maybe even a war. But she’s worth it, and I’ll do whatever it takes to keep Luisa and my baby safe.  **Book 2 of the Bertoli Family Trilogy. Each book is a stand alone and features a different couple.",
