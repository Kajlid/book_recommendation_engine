  "description": "Three months on a private island.Two men.One million dollars.All I have to do is tame Nash Wilde.It’s been two years since my sister and her boyfriend were killed in a plane crash. The last person I expected to show up on my doorstep was his father, Alistair Wilde. Yet, he came with an offer I’d be an idiot to pass up: be his son’s girlfriend for three months, live with the two of them in a remote house, and the one million dollars is mine.The challenge turns out to be harder than I expected. Nash is not just wild, he’s dangerous. And Alistair is far more broken than he lets the world believe. The three of us are bound by grief. It’s up to me to feed Nash’s hunger and heal Alistair’s pain.Lines are crossed.Rules are broken.On the island, there’s no one to tell us this is wrong.I know I have to choose before I tear this family apart.But I belong to both of them—One of them has my body.The other has my heart.",
