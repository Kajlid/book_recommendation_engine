  "description": "From the moment he awakened to find the beautiful Bryony at his hospital bedside, Luke knew he had to have her as his own. Imagine his surprise when he finds that he is already married to her!When she realizes that waiting for her husband to love her is a lost cause, Bryony Blake gives up. But the two angels assigned to watch over them have something else in mind, and as their elaborate plan goes into effect, Luke finds himself waking up in the hospital with no recollection of the past nine years—including any memories of his wife. Although Bryony tries her best to convince Luke that the best place for him is with his parents, he is adamant about moving back into their home, and to Bryony’s great dismay, is determined to win her heart.Bryony wonders what happened to her husband, because he’s not the man she brought home! This ‘new’ Luke has the same face, and the same name, but he is sweet, considerate, and worst of all: he sends her pulse racing like the Indy 500. But memories of how he treated her are fresh in her mind, and she does her best to dissuade him from his pursuit of her. And she’s not the only one trying to thwart heavenly plans; the demon that ‘old’ Luke invited in continues to prowl around, searching for a doorway back inside, and if he has his way, Luke and Bryony will be no more. Thankfully, with a little assistance from two clever angels, Luke and Bryony might just succeed on their journey to find forgiveness, redemption, and lasting love, in this heart-warming supernatural romance.",
