  "title": "Occupy Nation: The Roots, the Spirit, and the Promise of Occupy Wall Street",
  "description": "Occupy Wall Street is the most dynamic phenomenon in progressive politics in more than forty years. Its followers across the country transformed the national debate, galvanizing millions with its clarion call for economic justice: \"We are the 99 percent.\" In Occupy Nation, bestselling social historian Todd Gitlin offers the first narrative survey of the movement—from its historic inspirations, to its inner tensions, to its prospects in the months and years to come. He offers a fascinating account of this remarkable phenomenon while casting an informed look at its continuing evolution—and how it needs to proceed to truly make an impact. Informed by Gitlin's own history in the 60s protest movement—but written with both eyes aimed at the future—Occupy Nation is the key book for anyone looking to understand the revolution playing out before our eyes.",
