  "description": "Journey to an amusement park on a moon!   Funfair Moon, the outer space amusement park where Emily lives, has the highest roller coasters, the most dizzying Tilt-A-Whirls, and the scariest ghost train in the galaxy. Normally, Emily’s heroes Jinks and O’Hare keep it in tip-top shape. But the day the funfair inspector comes, everything goes wrong. Peeploid’s Merry-Go-Round and Fudge Shoppe is spinning out of control, gravity has reversed on the biggest slide, and there are strange little spiny black balls all over the place! Can Emily help fix the carnival before the inspector closes it for good?   For early chapter book readers who are ready for something longer, the Not-So-Impossible Tales are packed with humor, action, and illustrations on almost every page.",
