  "description": "Ex-marine turned security specialist Joel Wilde thrives on the high-wire thrills that come with his job. And he isn't about to give all that up to settle down-not even with a sexy woman like Lora Marshall. Which means that while he's protecting her from a violent gang, he'll need to set a few ground rules to keep things professional. Good thing he's always been a rule-breaker at heart.",
