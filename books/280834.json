  "title": "The Nativity: How the Story of Christmas Can Change Your Life",
  "description": "Learn Something Life Changing This Christmas! After years, sometimes even decades, of hearing the Christmas story so many times, we lose the meaning. The story of the birth of Jesus Christ as told Luke Chapter 2 is the best-known story in the Bible. Ask anyone and they can tell you about Caesar’s tax. Everyone knows about Mary and Joseph’s trip to Bethlehem. Most people can tell you that Jesus was born in a stable. We’ve heard the story thousands of times, over and over, in Christmas pageants, plays, cards, TV programs, movies, and music. To many, the story of God becoming a man - of God taking on human flesh – has become so common that the greatest miracle in history has lost its impact. That’s why The Nativity was written, to help you take a fresh look at the Christmas story – to help you see beyond the familiar and find the true Spirit of Christmas. Turn the pages to find the answers: • Who was the inn-keeper? • Why is Jesus called Emmanuel? • Did Mary and Joseph have children of their own? • Was Jesus born on December 25th? • What was the Tower of the Flock? • Is Jesus coming back?",
