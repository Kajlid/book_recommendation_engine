  "description": "I thought becoming a teenager was going to be fun. Instead, the summer I turned thirteen my life turned upside-down. Dad lost his job and we moved into my aunt and uncle's beach house. Sounded great-but not When I had to share a room with my boy-crazy cousin Fay. Fay was having plenty of fun, but I just got to sit on the beach and watch. It seemed like Fay had the kind of teenage life I only dreamed of. But then the end of summer came and everything seemed different. It looked as if my life might even turn fun-side-up.",
