  "description": "NAPOLEON is a NA, M/M Paranormal Romance and novella (approx. 32K words) in the Pierced Series. It is a stand-alone book and can be enjoyed without having read the first four books in the series. Napoleon Charming-Balak has been crushing on the \"exchange student\" that's been staying with him for the last six months. The object of his crush: Sixten Dahl, a straight boy that seems to get his kicks from flirting with, then torturing, Napoleon in the cruelest of ways. Is it any wonder Nap, and his best friend Moused, are high-tailing it to New York City as fast as they possibly can? If there's one thing Napoleon is hoping for, it's that life in the Big Apple will be exactly what his self-esteem needs to get over the Swedish tease that has been tormenting him all summer long.If he could only stop thinking about Sixten long enough to enjoy it.",
