  "description": "\"Get Real, Dr. Discrediting Television's Most Overrated Psychologist\" is a satirical criticism of Dr. Phil McGraw and his pedestrian advice. I was kidnapped by terrorists, tied to a chair and forced to watch Dr. Phil's daytime TV program for more than three weeks before US commandos rescued me. Over the course of those three torturous weeks, I decided it was time someone put Dr. Phil and his simpleton recommendations in his place.While this book has an extensive amount of humor in it, including some R-rated content, I have attempted to offer actual insight and possible cures for problems that plague our society (such as EMDR therapy). Dr. Phil does not do this because he is just an entertainer. He may have a degree in psychology, but entertainment is his specialty. This book does what no one else has attempted to Force Dr. Phil into an early retirement by ridiculing and thoroughly discrediting television's most loved and hated psychologist. Combined with a short expos√© of the McGraw family and its shady dealings at the end of the book, perhaps we can finally put Dr. Phil out to pasture for good.",
