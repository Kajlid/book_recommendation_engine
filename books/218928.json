  "description": "**CAUTION-------PITCH BLACK READ**  My mother was the Madison Ridge Killer … and I helped her.  At nine, I was given a new start—a new life. My adoptive parents did everything they could to help me forget my past, and for a while, they succeeded. But I was never normal. I never truly forgot all I saw or did.Now, twenty years later, I work in the billing department for a small city newspaper. And like decades before, not that far away, another serial killer is on the loose. I can still see her. I can still hear my mother coaxing me to slide the bright red lipstick over her beautiful victims' lips. But this isn’t her and I’m determined to figure out who it is. I may work behind the scenes at the Rockford Times, but I’m about to get thrown right in the middle of the biggest story our city has ever seen. My name is Anna Monroe and I’m full of secrets.They say you’re not your past. I’m not so sure they’re right.",
