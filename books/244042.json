  "description": "Magic is dying. And I’m the only one who can stop it.  Human. Weak. Sick. That’s what I’ve been told I am all my life. But when magic hunters attack the castle where I’ve been kept hidden since birth, I discover my whole world is built on lies.  Because the hunters are after me.  Running for my life, I’m rescued by four dangerously handsome gargoyle shifters. They say they’re here to save me…but maybe they only want to save themselves.  Because, as it turns out, I’m not merely human. I am a Protector of Magic—if I die, magic will vanish from the world. And my four winged guardians will turn to stone forever.  Wings of Stone is the first book in a new reverse harem urban fantasy series full of romance, danger, and magic.",
