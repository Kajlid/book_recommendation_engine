It’s been dragged through tabloids and rumors and fans that just won’t let us be. Through it all, we’ve remained unbreakable.We didn’t have the perfect marriage because perfection doesn’t exist.But we had love. We had trust. We had chemistry that to this day sets everything inside meon fire. Then one life-threatening statement creates a chain of lies that leaves me no choice but to say those horrible words. I never thought I’d say them. I never thought my husband would ignore me when I did.I never thought the man I love would sever the vows we took.I never thought I’d pack my bags and move from our home in L.A. to our getaway cottage in Hermosa Beach.Then again, I never thought he'd choose the fate of his life over his fate with me.",
