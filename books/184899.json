  "description": "The Unexpected Crush, the hot and sexy series by Alexa Wilder, is now available as a complete series. For the first time you can read all five books in one volume!  She won’t sacrifice her dreams for a man. He proves she doesn’t have to.  Kaia Davenport has left her old life behind. Now an intern at a prestigious hospital, she’s sacrificed so much to get where she is. She’s confident in her job, but when it comes to her curvy body, she’s learned she’s not in every man’s taste. And it’s not like she has time to date - all she cares about is her dream of being a doctor. Unfortunately, she manages to get into trouble during her very first week at the hospital.  Chase Donahue isn't used to people telling him no, especially women. He’s a billionaire and he’s handsome. That’s usually enough to get him everything he wants. Not that Kaia knows who he is when they first meet. She can’t stand his arrogance and his entitled smirks. When he requests her assistance with a project, she hates him even more. Little does Kaia know that all Chase can think of is her spunky attitude and gorgeous curves. She’s exactly the woman he’s been looking for.  Sparks fly and tempers escalate, but true passion cannot be tamed when Kaia storms into Chase’s office to tell him off. Instead, she finds herself in his arms, unable to resist him. Will this be the biggest mistake in her career? Or will it lead to something even more complicated… Love. **This hot and steamy alpha billionaire romance is perfect for fans of Hannah Ford, Lila Monroe, Cassie Cross, and J.S. Scott**  Excerpt from Book One: “I…” I lost my words. I licked my lips, trying to realign my train of thought, but all I could think about was running my hands through his mess of dark hair. Without thinking about it, I licked my lips again.  That must have been all of the answer that Donahue needed, as I was suddenly pushed back against the now-closed door, Donahue’s body pressing against me, his mouth on my own. With a moan, I opened to him, allowing him to dominate the kiss. After what could have been five seconds or a million years, he pulled away.  “God… I’ve wanted to do that for so long,” he panted, pushing even further against me, rocking his hardness next to my thigh. “Since the moment in the bar — if not before. And then yesterday, you sauntered up here in that short skirt and tight top. Your body is to die for.\"",
