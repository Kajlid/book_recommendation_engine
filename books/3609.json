  "description": "In this novel based on true events, a little girl kidnapped by her father must learn to survive in the midst of a chaotic existence. Once upon a time in an exotic land called Miami Beach, a Jewish American princess was born. Not lucky enough to have a fairy godmother or even a mother to watch over her, the princess only had a wicked, malevolent, and misogynistic father. Life was good for the little princess-until she turned three and her father snatched her away from everything she had ever known. Traveling in a 1941 Chrysler with a volatile man who took her to the Catskills, Mexico, and Las Vegas, the princess told herself that all would be well. She was with her father, after all. But the excitement of embarking on an adventure soon waned when she realized she might never know her real name, would never know where she will be living from one day to the next, and would never know if she would be acting like a boy or girl each morning when she woke up. Based on true events, Then There's Tomorrow tells the compelling story of a little girl who must search for her own identity as she learns to cope in a turbulent existence chosen for her by a man who loves no one but himself.",
