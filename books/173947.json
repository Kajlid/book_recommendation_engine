  "description": "Who knew falling in love with my best friend had the potential to single-handedly destroy my entire family?For as long as I could remember, I'd been in love with sexy, lawyer extraordinaire Nicholas Alexander. We’d always had a certain chemistry growing up, especially after we shared one passionate, forbidden, perfect kiss as teenagers. For years, I’d hoped he could look past my overprotective brothers and our age difference so we could be more than friends, I was wrong. Four years ago, I left New York and my heart behind. Now I was back to stake my claim on the only man I'd ever loved. But unbeknownst to me, things were way more complicated than I could’ve imagined when I learn he's engaged—to my sister.Will the love and desire I feel for the one man I've ever truly wanted destroy me? Am I willing to risk it all, for a chance at everlasting love?Catherine Reed was the one woman I couldn't have, but the one I always wanted. She was my best friend’s baby sister, which meant she was definitely off-limits to me and anyone else if I had my way. Not even having a merry-go-round of beautiful girls could stop me from wanting her. Watching her leave was hard, but I knew giving in to what I wanted back then would ruin her... us. All I've ever wanted was for her to be happy and to see her beautiful smile.I haven't gotten to where I am by always doing what's right. She's back. I want her. I have every intention of making her mine.This book does end with a cliffhanger.",
