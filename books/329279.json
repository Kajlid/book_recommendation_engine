  "description": "Is it a sin to let a good man get away? The wedding between Angela Gabriel and Brent Underwood promises to be the Birmingham event of the year--and aspiring event planner Melissa Anderson has been working feverishly to make it happen. During this hectic time, she even agrees to go out on a date with a most unlikely prospect: Marcus Peeples. When it came to Marcus, it definitely wasn't love at first sight. But after a lovely evening together of Bible study at Followers of Jesus Faith Worship Center, Melissa has a change of heart. She learns that Marcus is divorced, a fact she can't reconcile with scripture even though she knows he's a good man and father. But when Marcus's diva ex-wife decides she wants him back, Melissa soon discovers love, divorce, and faith have quite a bit in common.",
