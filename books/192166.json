  "description": "“A gay coming-of-age story that’s rip-roaringly funny and sympathetic.”— People David Sedaris and Sandra Bernhard rolled into one, Mike Albo offers his own unique, witty, and touching tale on being young, single, and gay in today's media-obsessed culture. Juxtaposing a trip to his childhood home—where he has retreated to try to make some sense of his hectic existence in New York City—with memories of growing up gay in seventies suburbia, Albo creates \"Mike Albo.\" This character's memories are from a fictitious life that's outrageous, hilarious, and embarrassingly real. From a typical suburban childhood to his perpetual search for true love, Albo evokes a poignant, nostalgic past and a vibrant, energetic present. By turns vulnerable and jaded, flamboyant and obsessive,  Hornito  is full of subversive humor and outrageous irony.",
