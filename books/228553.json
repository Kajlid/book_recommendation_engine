  "description": "Poetry. Winner of the 2007 Gatewood Prize, Kathleen Rooney's ONEIROMANCE (AN EPITHALAMION) explores the absurdity and divinity of the marriage ceremony through a dizzying dream sequence with playful verse that skillfully blends call and response with Shakespearean odes, romance and cynicism, story-telling and wordplay. Patty Seyburn \"These poems contain deep doubt and true sentiment, providing that pleasure-giving union of provocation and renewal.\" Rooney is a founding editor of Rose Metal Press and the author of Reading with The Book Club That Changed America (University of Arkansas, 2005).",
