  "description": "ASIN B0069CJZSQ moved to the most recent edition hereAdults only. Not for the young or easily offended. A bawdy romp through time, space and credibility, with all the clich√©s shamelessly ridiculed to destruction. It all starts for Tom when a scantily clad time-maiden turns up on his doorstep and whisks him off on a series of missions, each one, he later discovers, intended to get him killed. He survives and rescues a girl from the torture of the offices of a mail order company and they travel to the end of time itself to prevent the assassination of the man who holds it all together. Add to this the Skagan race whose main mode of greeting is somewhat unconventional, and who come into possession of a fleet of warships long before they have evolved the responsibility to use them, and there is a mass of chaotic interconnections that only the warped brain of Wingfield could put together. This is the first of the Dan Trilogy, but is freestanding in itself.",
