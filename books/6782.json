  "description": "George Michael is an enigma. Despite being one of the most open and vocal pop superstars on the planet, George Michael is also fiercely protective of his privacy. From the formation of Wham! In 1981 he immediately found fame and fortune beyond his wildest dreams. This all-access biography uncovers the secret life of the pop star, following his skyrocket to fame and fortune through his solo career and up to the present day. His music formed the soundtrack to the 1980s and he achieved all of this despite growing up in a dysfunctional family where his father openly proclaimed that George had no talent. Wham! split in 1986 but Michael went on to greater things as a solo artist. Along the way Michael has been embroiled in several controversies—among them a court case with Sony; an arrest in a Los Angeles public toilet; minor run-ins over class-C drugs; and traffic offenses in London—but in a refreshing contrast from other superstars, he has been happy to address his issues head-on in and out of the media.Rob Jovanovic's biography tackles all the factors and issues that formed George Michael as superstar as he stands today, and his place as a cultural icon. It also, for the first time, analyses Michael's musical output and groundbreaking videos, and discusses for the first time his recent acclaimed worldwide triumphant 2006 tour, the first in 15 years as Michael returned from the music wilderness.",
