  "title": "The Fart Party, Vol. 1",
  "description": "The Fart Party is online comic by Julia Wertz that is a great snapshot of life in San Francisco as seen through the eyes of a highly sarcastic and sometimes deadly up-and-coming comic artist. The book includes the 80% of comics NOT posted online, interviews, funny fan letters and never before seen illustrations! It chronicles Wertz's first year of making comics, living in San Francisco, going to conventions, moving apartments, finishing college, the demise of a relationship, all that typical crap but nicely wrapped up into tiny little boxes on paper! Includes an introduction by Peter Bagge.",
