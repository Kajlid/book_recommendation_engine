  "description": "Amanda sought a man with a gentle spirit—a poet, or an artist. How could she fall passionately in love with this bad boy with a rope and a spanking fetish?Well aware of her weakness for arrogant, dominant men, Amanda is determined to avoid bad boys. In her blog, Confessions of a Virgin Sex Addict, she encourages women to deny their baser instincts and search for a man with a gentle, artistic spirit.No one suspects her secret life as the receptionist at the BDSM club, DiscipliNation. It’s the perfect gig, friendly people, cushy hours, and enough pay to put her through school. All she has to do is pretend she is part of the lifestyle.James, a professional bodyguard, has secretly admired Amanda for months. Night after night, he visits DiscipliNation, in hopes she will leave her receptionist’s desk to play in the great hall. When a stalker threatens to murder her, James offers to step in as Amanda’s protector, and in turn uncovers her secret life.She isn’t the innocent little subbie. In her own words, she has used anyone and everyone to get what she wants. Is this stalker just a figment of her imagination, another ploy to swindle friends and family? Or is her life really in danger?Thrust together, they both must fight their bodily desires. Being near James twenty-four hours a day is an unbearable temptation. James knows he can protect Amanda from an attacker, but can he protect her from himself?",
