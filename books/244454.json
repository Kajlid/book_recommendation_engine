Other storm clouds gather when Galeran, the courtly knight, is sent by the Bishop of Lisieux to investigate the Normandy Abbey of Jumièges. There have been rumors of corruption in the Church. But Galeran arrives in the town to bloodshed when a beautiful young bride is brutally slain on the eve of her wedding. Investigating both this crime and the Abbey, Galeran soon discovers that the town is riddled with theft, corruption, black magic—and plenty of motives for murder.",
