  "description": "The reaper is knocking at my door. I wonder if he received my invitation. Why else would I have walked into that hospital room? I knew it was a trap. I just didn’t care. That’s the thing about revenge: It’s all-consuming. My only regret is that Louie was shot. Is he alive? Is he dead? I’m afraid I’ll never find out. I feel death’s hand on my shoulder. I won’t go out without a fight. I’ll make sure I take all my enemies with me when I descend to hell. *** Warning: This is a MFM menage romance. Maura Quinn's story is a dark twisted tale with violence, graphic killing, foul language, and sexual content. Some parts may be triggering. ***",
