  "description": "In a mysterious attack on her familyâ€™s lunar outpost, 16-year-old Leda Sengal witnesses the murder of her parents in a violent explosion. Barely escaping to earth, she transforms into a rare beauty, and her grief into a vendetta: find the murderer and make him pay.  Her one shred of evidence may hold the key to the attackers, but letting it go proves dangerous, for her and those who help her. She is aided in her pursuit of justice by a nefarious hacker, a blue-headed sensei, and assorted bots, all the while growing up into the galaxy's most beautiful human. Even though she travels to fantastical off-world places, no amount of training can prepare her for what is to come.",
