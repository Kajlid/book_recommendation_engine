  "description": "Allison Anderson knows she's a little different, but it hadn't bothered her too much-until now. Moving away from everything she's ever known to a new house, new neighborhood, and new school is bad enough, but it's her first year of high school too, making it even more intimidating. She's more aware of her social and physical limitations than ever before. And then there are the new people she meets: the tough-looking girl in her home room; the cute but dangerous-looking boy she first saw before school even started; the quiet, older girl who keeps to herself; the sullen-looking, seemingly isolated junior that doesn't seem to trust or like her at all. Can she trust them? While the peaceful situation of her new home only amplifies the sound of her own doubts, she begins to learn that things are not always what they seem, and her world is turned upside-down by these new friends, two-legged and otherwise. Life soon becomes more complicated, and much more interesting!Bronze is the first novel in The Glister Journals, a Young Adult series in four volumes. Set in California, it is first and foremost a story of friendship. Other themes include first love and romance, high school, family relationships, and horses. Supplementary pages include Vocabulary and Questions for Discussion suitable for book clubs or class use. Ages 15-Adult.",
