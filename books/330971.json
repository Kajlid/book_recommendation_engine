  "description": "The central character in The Crew is Billy Evans; a successful car trader from Romford who has a darker side to his nature; he is a football hooligan. Using violence as a tool, Billy has worked his way up to a position of power within the hooligan hierarchy and now heads one of the most notorious and well organised groups in England. But for him, violence is only a means to an end. He has other ambitions, and not all of them involve football either. His adversary is Detective Inspector Paul Jarvis of the National Football Intelligence Unit (NFIU). He is well aware of Billyâ€™s involvement with organised hooliganism, but more importantly, he also blames him for the murder of a fellow officer during a disturbance at Euston station some years before. The problem is, Jarvis has never been able to prove anything. But he has sworn that he will never give up trying until he does. During the build up to an international fixture involving England and Italy in Rome, Jarvis finds out that Billy Evans is recruiting a gang of hooligans to stage a repeat of the 1995 Dublin riot. With this information at hand, he manages to infiltrate the group and sets out to get the evidence to finally put Billy Evans behind bars. However, things are not as they seem. Billy is up to something and Jarvis is about to find out that not only is Rome a long way from London, anything can happen during the journey. The Crew is about the lengths two men on opposite sides of the law will go to, and the risks they will take, to achieve their own aims. It involves deception, double-cross, violence and racism and builds to an astonishing climax which ultimately ends in disaster. But for who?",
