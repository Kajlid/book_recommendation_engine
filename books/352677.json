  "description": "THE WINDS OF FATEDarian Woodward had been a hero in the War Between the States, but somewhere he s been blown off course. Unjustly ruined by a superior officer, the handsome soldier turns to crime. His blue eyes and daring deeds earn him a name throughout the old Southwest, but bandits seek gold, and this gunfighter s interests are entirely different. Fate has blown in a sexier bounty.A WHIRLWIND OF DESIREThough she is swept away by it, Emily Morgan is less awed by the mystic whirlwind that carries her into the past than by the handsome desperado who greets her. Joining the man s close-knit band of outlaws, Emily learns the fun of being badbut also its dangers. And when the Feds come to capture her Blue-Eyed Bandit, Emily will prove that Western justice has its limits, and true love can break any lawseven those of time and space.\"",
