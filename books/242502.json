  "description": "My name is Zack Adderack, and I’m a screw-up, but I can change, if I have to, I guess. But first, I need to shoot a bear. We—my brother, Rory, and I—have declared war on the trebuchet-loving freaks holed up across the river. The other neighbors, for some reason, despise us—but their feelings pale in comparison to what a crazy old hunting guide up in the mountains feels for us ‘lowlanders’. That dangerous recluse is harboring secrets, as well as a beautiful daughter. Frances. She’s gorgeous, sexy, wild, and even a little mean. It’s been a madhouse ever since Rory and I dragged her home. Not to put too fine a point on it, but I want her with the fire of a thousand suns. But, winning her over isn’t as simple as it sounds. The wildlife’s encroaching, Rory’s jealous, and Ed—poor guy—is facing imminent matrimony. As if all that weren’t enough, this airplane we’re in might be stolen, my parents are dropping in for a visit, and my sister just chambered another round. Welcome to the wilderness of Alaska, home of romantic action-adventure comedy somewhere between Mad Max and Romancing the Stone, but hotter. P.S. You really should read Book 1 of this series before jumping in the deep end. *No cliffhanger on this steamy, feel-good romance.",
