  "description": "Michael Whitehall contrasts the glamorous image of theatrical life with the mundane realities of the business, while passing on some startling trade secrets along the way.A laconic raconteur of refreshingly unstar-struck theatrical anecdotes, Whitehall deftly sketches the social comedy of his eccentric background: growing up in suburban London in the 1950s, his schooldays at Ampleforth and his subsequent adventures as a prep schoolmaster – worthy of Evelyn Waugh himself – before becoming an actors’ agent.Shark-Infested Waters is a charming, funny and piquant view of a world that continues to fascinate.Praise for Shark Infested Waters:“The funniest show-business memoir I’ve read since David Niven’s The Moon’s a Balloon.” - Nigel Havers“One of the year’s funniest memoirs.” – Daily Express",
