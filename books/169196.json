  "description": "Vicki's life had been perfect--now it's definitely not. When her father is laid off from his job, her family's familiar comforts slip away. They move to a city apartment, and Vicki has to forge a new path at her urban school. Worst of all, one night her depressed father simply disappears. Vicki soon finds herself living a double life--fine on the outside, anything but fine on the inside--and that leads to a moral dilemma she's ultimately forced to confront.Told through an inventive mix of poems and journal entries, this intimate narrative reveals Vicki's curiosity, spirit, and honesty as she journeys through loss to discover what really matters.",
