  "title": "Joseph Campbell: A Fire in the Mind",
  "description": "The fascinating biography that illuminates the man whose work changed modern culture• Gives a complete biographical view of Campbell's life and a personal perspective of who he was through the voices of his friends and colleagues• Written by two of Campbell's preeminent students with exclusive access to his notes and journalsJoseph Campbell forged an approach to the study of myth and legend that made ancient traditions and beliefs immediate, relevant, and universal. His teachings and literary works, including The Masks of God , have shown that beneath the apparent themes of world mythology lie patterns that reveal the ways in which we all may encounter the great mysteries of birth, growth, soul development, and death. Biographers Stephen and Robin Larsen, students and friends of Campbell for more than 20 years, weave a rich tapestry of stories and insights that catalogue both his personal and public triumphs.",
