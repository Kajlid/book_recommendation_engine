  "description": "I've discovered that if you wear a big enough hat, no one worries much about what's going on inside your head.Cary should know. Her head is a mess behind the floppy Audrey Hepburn hat she wears. Her best friend is a boy who speaks to her in song lyrics--a boy that only she can see. And no one, not even Cary's boyfriend Danny, knows about the things inside Cary's head. Especially the feelings she has for Wendy, a girl with bright green hair and hard-candy sadness in her eyes. Wendy is sexy and dangerous. Cary thinks that Wendy could love her the way Danny does. There's just one problem. Wendy is Danny's sister.",
