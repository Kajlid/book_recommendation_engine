Just as he is ready to believe that there is a chance for him to move on and live the fairytale, the past comes knocking on his door. And now the bright future is looking really dim.Would you, dearest author, please run my guys through the wringer, break them down and then help them build their new life together without the lies and the fear so that they can finally, finally be happy, forever.Photo Description: A naked man sitting with his knees pulled to his chest and his head hanging down.
