  "description": "King Geek vs the CheerleaderJulia Farrow has it all. She's got the friends, the grades, the smile, the perfect reputation, and the new boyfriend who adores her. All in all, life is pretty much perfect for Grover High's favorite cheerleader. Until she's tagged, that is. That ridiculous Geeks Gone Wild hashtag is still going strong and while Julia has managed to steer clear of the drama unfolding between the jocks and the geeks, one embarrassing photo is enough to flip her world upside down. The boyfriend? He's out. The friends? Turns out they're more like frenemies. And that perfect reputation? Well, that's all about to crumble as the truth comes out about Julia and her secret, passionate love affair with all things comics.But Julia isn't about to go down without a fight. She's spent a lifetime honing her perfect image and when it's ruined, there's really only one person to blame. The school paper's editor-in-chief and the guy behind the hashtag--Matt Cartwright. Sure, he claims he's innocent, but if it wasn't for him she'd still be on track to be prom queen. He might not be able to fix this disaster that her life has become, but there's one way he can make it up to her. He can bring her along to the comics convention he's assigned to cover for his internship with the local paper. He's got the tickets, she needs an escape, and really, it's the least he can do. She's just tagging along as a fan, that's all. It's not like they have to be friends or anything. And those kisses? Well, what happens at comic-con stays at comic-con...right?",
