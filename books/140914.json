  "description": "Cupid, God of Love, has not used his bow and arrow to create love in twenty-five years. Being solely responsible for producing love amongst the humans, had proven to be too much for him to handle. His only disastrous mistake made him feel guilty, and thought he deserved to be alone for the rest of eternity. Valentina Hart, a human, has a few problems of her own. A bad break-up and no sense of self worth may be the key to her undoing. When Cupid and Valentina meet, their attraction is instant. But, will that be enough to bring their worlds together, and save each other from the pain they both keep locked away? What happens when the God of Love has lost the will to create romance? Can Valentina give Cupid what he needs to mend his broken heart?",
