  "description": "Like a Man is the story of the most successful clandestine mission in the history of warfare. Based closely on fact but never limited by it, this World War II action adventure follows three paratroopers from their night-drop into Nazi-Occupied Czechoslovakia until the last shattering moments when they fight an entire regiment of SS troops to the death. The paratroopers' mission, called Anthropoid, begins with a bad drop that puts them miles off their target and far from any help. It leads them by luck, accident and skill through the heart of the underground resistance to the culmination of their mission on a quiet suburban street in Prague. There they assassinate the second most powerful man in Nazi Germany-the head of the SD and the Gestapo, the Protector of Czechoslovakia. How they did what no one else could do, and how they carried themselves onto the pages of history is one of the most compelling chapters in the long annals of secret war.",
