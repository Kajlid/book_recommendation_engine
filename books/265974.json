  "description": "Marissa Grayson’s dream went up in smoke. A devastating fire has ripped apart her family’s bed and breakfast, leaving her off-kilter and scrambling to repair the damage. What she doesn’t need, or have time for, is Rhenn Burleski. Sexy, confident, and dangerous to her heart. A man who clearly knows his way around the female body and will leave the moment the sheets start to cool. Yet that doesn’t stop her from making a deal with the devil himself.Work hard, play harder. That’s Rhenn’s life motto. An electrician by day, Rhenn turns it up at night, always with a different lady friend in tow. He makes sure they know the score: he’s not looking for anything more than one night of fun. However, he knows the second he meets the shy daughter of the bed and breakfast’s owner that his life is never going to be the same. As hard as he tries, he just can’t resist one taste.What happens when their time is up and Rhenn must leave, returning to his old life? Will they be able to walk away, hearts unscathed, or will their time together prove to be nothing more than a fading memory?",
