  "description": "Familiar enemies resurface in this blazing new thriller that finds Shelby racing against time to save the most important person in his life: his own child.\n\nWhen Shelby's daughter, Leslie, fails to show up at his cabin for her long-planned visit to northern Michigan, he's concerned, but makes excuses. When her car is found abandoned by the side of a tree-lined highway, he fears the worst. When her cellphone appears on his front porch, he knows something terrible has happened and that he is to blame. Enlisting the help of the new county sheriff, Shelby launches a search for Leslie, all the while dealing with a prostitute in fear for her life, a sexy writer interested in writing his life story, and the long-banished ghosts of his own past.",
