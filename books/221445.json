You are now under quarantine. \n\nThe very few of the infected who survive are dangerous and will be taken into the custody of the army.\nYoung runaway Callie survived the disease, but not the so-called treatment. Her brother Kai is still looking for her. And his new friend Shay may hold the keyto uncovering what truly happened. From the author of the international sensation Slated comes the first book in a powerful new story of survival and transformation; love and power.",
