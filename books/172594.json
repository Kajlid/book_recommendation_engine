  "description": "What would you do if you found out that your entire marriage was based on a lie, and your seemingly perfect husband was actually a money hungry psychopath with a dark and twisted past? One phone call from her husband's mistress was all it took to unravel Annabelle Montague's life, sending her on a dangerous journey of fear, paranoia, and unshakable nightmares. In order to protect herself from Evan's violent threats, including an attempt to extort her money, Annabelle is forced to leave her charming Virginia estate. She travels to the Outer Banks of North Carolina; the last place her ex-husband would think to look for her. Although she has not spoken to him years, she turns to Cole Cross for help. Cole owns an oceanfront beach house and several rental properties on the Outer Banks, and he is generous enough to provide Annabelle with a cottage to serve as her temporary refuge. Once Annabelle reunites with Cole, her old high school flame who possesses the looks of a Greek God, nothing can extinguish the fiery passion that they harbor for one another; not even the malevolent stalker that waits in the shadows. As two detectives work tirelessly to put Evan Montague in prison, Annabelle fears that her ex-husband may find her before the police are able to apprehend him. The last time they spoke, Evan vowed to kill her if she didn't pay up, and there wasn't a chance in hell of Annabelle giving in to his demands.",
