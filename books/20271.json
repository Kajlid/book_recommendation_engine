  "description": "Professor Peter Shandy, Balaclava College's best amateur sleuth, takes on a pest threatening to wipe Britain's lovely hedgerows. With colleagues Dan Stott and Timothy Ames, he leaves the groves of academe for fancy fieldword in the heart of Wales. Never in their wildest dreams did the three expect the bizarre events awaiting them.... Where Miss Hilda Horsefall's recipe for lye soap becomes as valuable as Dan's knowledge of \"The Chronicles Of Narnia\" and where pursuing the wild asparagus (the giant hogweed) becomes a dangerous expedition.",
