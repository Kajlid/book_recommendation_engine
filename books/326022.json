Or so they thought…Wyatt is finally ready to pursue his dream of becoming a brewer, and Havenport is the perfect place to do it.

But then she meets a tall, rugged bartender who makes her wonder if sticking around just a little longer might be worth it…He’s putting down roots. She’s a flight risk. Can they find their way to happily ever after?
