  "description": "In the future, technology has advanced to the point that people can transfer their consciousness into artificial bodies, so-called personifids - thus living forever. Aphra discovers plans to use the personifid technology to eliminate the ability for these transferred humans to choose between good and evil. The corporation touts it as the ultimate evolution of human morality, but Aphra knows it's a tool to dominate all mankind. The corporation wants her silenced. Assassins, human and machine, close in. Only an outcast couple- people who still hold to an ancient, outlawed faith-have the knowledge and the courage to come to her rescue. Can they prevent this great evil, or will the explosives lodged in Aphra's arm destroy them all before they have the chance?",
