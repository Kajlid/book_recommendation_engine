  "description": "Get this entire trilogy in a box set! Shakespeare never looked so dirty.  Cold. Ruthless. Killer.  That’s my birthright. The only thing meant for me.  Until her.  Because when she gazed up at me, her honeyed hair spread across the pillow, her soft body naked and open, she made me feel like I could be different. She gave me a reason to be different.  Imagine my shock when I’m dragged into an interrogation room, their prime suspect, and she walks in…  Detective Julianna Capulet.  I am so fucked.  Because I still want her. I want her like an addict craves his drug. I need her like a sinner needs his absolution.  And I will have her.  Even if it kills us both...  And so begins a deadly game of cat and mouse, of blood and lust, of love and duty, and of an attraction so fierce the consequences are inevitable.  Inspired by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet, this is a sexy retelling with a HEA!",
