  "description": "I know it’s no secret to you all that I kind of have a thing for my incredible wife. From the moment she smiled at me in a coffee shop, I knew she had to be mine. She broke through my writer’s block and hasn’t stopped inspiring me since. She agreed with my crazy plan to run off and get married, and supported my band’s career when it took off just after. She went on tour with me and endured the challenges that come with being a rockstar’s wife. She even stepped between my band and the crooked agent that wanted to ruin us. And now, she’s making my dreams come true by carrying my child. It seems there’s nothing she can’t handle, nothing she’s not up for, nothing she wouldn’t do for me. But it’s her time now. Time for her to let go of what’s best for me and my band and let me be the one to do everything for her… Whether she likes it or not.",
