  "description": "The renowned contemporary Arab historian of Islam, Dr. Ali Muhammad as-Sallâbi has written a fascinating biography of a man who looms larger than life throughout history, yet who remains largely unknown to people outside the Arab world. Dr. as-Sallâbi’s meticulous research has effectively filled that gap in our knowledge. His work is more than just biography, as the reader will see.Volume One of Salâh ad-Deen al-Ayubi sets the stage for the advent of the Ayubids as Dr. as-Sallâbi describes vividly (and with his characteristic candour) the geopolitical scene upon which the first Crusades were acted out and their effects on the Muslim world in the twelfth century CE. The author discusses the events and introduces the many interesting personalities that played important parts in this real-life drama. Volume Two discusses the establishment of the Ayubid state, mentioning the origins of Salâh ad-Deen’s family, his birth and childhood; Dr. as-Sallâbi describes the character and ethics of Salâh ad-Deen: how he put an end to the Fatimid opposition and reorganised administrative affairs in Egypt; his efforts to revive the Sunnah in Egypt; his jihad against the Crusaders; his use of his literary skills in the service of Islam; and his keenness to unite the Muslim world. The author discusses the events and introduces the many other interesting personalities that played important parts in this crucial period in world history. Volume Three discusses the influencing factors and the ramifications of three crucial events in which Salâh ad-Deen played the leading role. Dr. as-Sallâbi also describes the many other interesting personalities that played important parts in this turbulent period in world history. In the words of Dr. as-Sallâbi, \"The beauty of Islam became apparent to westerners from the conduct of Salâh ad-Deen in peace and in war, his respect for freedom of opinion and belief, and his adherence to lofty, humane values and the sublime teachings of Islam.\"This three-volume work has been made more useful to the reader in this English edition through the addition of a map, a timeline, a list of the dynasties of the period, and a comprehensive glossary.",
