  "description": "A DARK EROTIC ROMANCE True Beginnings is the second book in a series that includes two alternative endings. See for yourself why fans are saying this makes all the other dark romances look like greyed out shades of fairytales. MORE OR ENOUGHMax is all about being in control. It's the only way he knows how to be. There’s never been a question in his mind about what he wants. Lucy may accept all that he demands, but his true nature could get in the way of their happy-ever-after.GIVE OR TAKELucy is head-over-heels in love, but she’s starting to figure out that this relationship may demand more than just the surrender of her heart to make it work. With a man as dominant as Max, nothing less than her absolute submission will suffice. She may not be ready for True Beginnings.NOTE: All the books in this series are available for purchase/download now, so you won’t be left wanting or waiting. This series involves a combination of Domestic Discipline, D/s, and SmNow available in paperback too!Excerpts: Max has been more attentive than any other guy I've dated. He notices everything, keeps an eye on me at all times when we're together, and always does little things to show me how special I am to him. But his attentiveness also means he has a lot of these pet-peeves. A long list of things he does or doesn't want me to do. I don't have to guess how to make him happy. He tells, shows me. And I have surprised myself with how much I like it this way. He's in control. I've wanted to please him from the beginning. I've wanted to follow his little rules and old-fashion-ness to show him how much he means to me. I've been proud of being able to do every little thing he's asked. Since he slapped me, though, there's also been this element of fear of not pleasing him. And the depth of my response to that has been the hardest for me to understand. Just looking at the darkened look he still wears now... I know that I can give into these feelings…that I’m safe...to be turned on by his anger, his control. ..... I put my hand in her hair, give a slight tug, but mostly rub her softness. She's so small, so soft, so yielding. \"I like hurting you, Lucy.\" She rubs her head against my hand, the obedient puppy. \"I like that you give yourself to me completely. That I can cause you pain and fear...I can make you my good girl again with my belt or my hand...\" I lower my hand to her butt. Still a little warm, the pinkness not quite faded. I pinch her lower cheek, not hard, but it's still tender enough to squeeze the breath out of her. \"That's what punishment does...it makes you my good girl again. You want that, don't you?\" \"Yes, Sir!\" Her whole body answers, trying to sway closer to me, but not moving from her spot, arms still held tight against her back.",
