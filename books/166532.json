  "title": "Cornbread Voodoo: A Novel",
  "description": "In this coming of age novel, William McCarter introduces Billy McCauley, who thinks his one challenge in life is to avoid the “cornbread voodoo” Gram uses to make sure he isn’t getting into too much trouble.  Growing up in Piankashaw County with his grandparents in rural Missouri means swimming holes, \"scoring tongue\" at the skating rink and baseball—until his “Big Daddy\" gets sick and the easy going childhood seems to go by the wayside.  Harkening a simpler time that really wasn’t too simple to begin with, McCarter presents a poignant tale in which Billy wonders if life is a game that no one ever wins and not even Gram's cornbread voodoo could change that.",
