  "description": "I can’t give him what he wants.He wants me to be like them—the subs that submit to his punishments. He wants me to take the whip, to wince in pain, to have a safe word in case I need to make it stop. He wants me to join him in his underworld—at Ruin. I give my answer and refuse to change it—even if that makes him walk away.But he stays. He accepts my refusal with palpable disappointment and promises to try to do things my way—only vanilla. It’s a testament to his love for me, because he could find a woman just as beautiful who’s eager to fulfill his darkness, but he chooses to remain committed to me. It makes me fall harder…when I should still be angry that he lied.But the bliss quickly wears off as the doubt creeps in. Calloway has specific fantasies for a reason, and what happens when those fantasies aren’t met? Will he leave me when he can’t take it anymore?Will he replace me with someone else?Pick up the next installment of this bdsm romance now by clicking the BUY NOW button at the top of this page.
