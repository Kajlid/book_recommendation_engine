  "description": "Against all odds, Emma has taken up the position of Governor of New Zealand but it was a decision make against her better judgement. Emma should be happy; it is a position that many others would kill for, a mark of prestige and trust that might finally prove that her mostly New Zealand-sourced family is Australian above all else.\tBeing back in the Territory that she once called home, however, brings back painful memories. Emma must learn to let go of her past if she is to build the Territory a future worth the name, and she must do it amid a cyclone of different agendas, everyone pushing and pulling in different directions.\tWith enemies on every side, it’s Emma against the world. But she’s not a little kid anymore; she knows how the world works and what happens if you trust anybody, even your own blood. More than that: she knows what the Resistors truly do to the Territory, and she will not be fooled again.",
