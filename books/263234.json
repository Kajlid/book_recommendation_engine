  "title": "The Eternal Soldier: The True Story of How a Dog Became a Civil War Hero",
  "description": "This is the untold story of Sallie, a dog whose life as a soldier began in a basket and ended as a Civil War hero.The pup barked and nearly tumbled out of the basket. We laughed, and immediately we knew--she was one of us already.Brindle fur with streaks of brown and black swirled all over her like a patchwork quilt. She was as pretty as an apple tree in full bloom. We called her Sallie.During the Civil War, Sallie came to the 11th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry as a gift from a townsperson, but she quickly became a favorite among her men. She marched with them from battle to battle, always guarding the unit's colors, and even met President Lincoln. And over three long days at the battle of Gettysburg, Sallie stayed with the dead, guarded their bodies, and nearly died herself from hunger and thirst as the conflict raged on. Though she fell in battle, her loyalty was rewarded years later when her men met again on the battlefield at Gettysburg to erect her likeness in bronze so that she might eternally guard them. This beautiful story about a dog's dedication and loyalty shows that bravery comes in all shapes and forms!",
