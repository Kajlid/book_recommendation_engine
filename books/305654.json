  "description": "Returning to the subject of her first highly acclaimed novel on Richard III, Rhoda Edwards in Fortune's Wheel has brilliantly captured the adolescent Richard-loyal, loving, and a victim of the Wars of the Roses.His conflict is tragic. As Duke of Gloucester he is torn between loyalty to his brothers, King Edward IV, and gratitude to the man who raised him, the Earl of Warwick, whose daughter Anne Neville captures his heart. This love-slowly at first and then totally and passionately-overcomes the awesome political forces of the Plantagenet King Henry VI and the machinations of the King of France, Louis XI.In Fortune's Wheel Rhoda Edwards' novelistic skill is once again matched by her extensive knowledge of English history. These figures of a courtly yet brutal past relive the fortunes of their lives in moving and sympathetic detail. Ultimately it is a testament to the power of a young man's love against all adversity.",
