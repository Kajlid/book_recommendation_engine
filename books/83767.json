  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00B8ED3B0Julian Luceanu was rich, powerful...and tired of the kind of women who only wanted him for his money. Nor was he alone in that, there was his cousin to consider. He, they, wanted something more, much more. It would take a special woman, if they could find her. Internet dating seemed a little far-fetched, but nothing else had worked. At least he'd be more or less anonymous. But although paranormals were becoming more accepted, Julian had a secret that would put all their lives at risk.",
