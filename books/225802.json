  "description": "Who pays the price when there's hell to pay?Angharad 'Harry' Russo's life has been turned upside down, but with the Mariposa defeated it looks like Harry is finally getting a break. Things are returning to normal â€“ or at least as normal as they can be for a half-vampire witch with the gift of necromancy. Of course things aren't always what they seem.  There's a new club in town and a mystery man peddling promises too good to be true while normally mild-mannered citizens are turning homicidal. Even the ghosts are bringing portents of doom.  Can Harry put all the pieces together and solve the mystery before it's too late? Or will she be left holding the bill?  While this is a standalone adventure, it continues the adventures of Harry and her friends from the previous three books. Your experience will be greatly enhanced by starting the series from the beginning:  Dead and Kicking, vol. 1 Tooth and Claw, vol. 2 Deadlocked, vol. 3",
