  "description": "From international bestselling author comes this impressive work of madness and mayhem that may turn out to be R WK Clark’s greatest literary achievement. In The Depths the first volume in the DeSai Trilogy, introduces readers to Cyril DeSai a centuries-old vampire.In the present day, the dashing, mysterious DeSai begins to wreak havoc in search of new blood. When he sets his sights on Rasia, will the victor become the victim?In the Depths is “classic R WK Clark—full of twists and turns and mounting suspense.”Author Commentary‘In The Depths’ is the first installment of the ‘DeSai Trilogy.’ It is also the first vampire book I wrote, and to be honest, one of the most detailed and fun books I have written. I believe that this ongoing saga is deep, engaging, and entertaining.Having vampires run the show is pretty much representative of the governments that rule over us. This is one thing that differs in this vampire story when it is compared to others.Cyril DeSai is a centuries-old vampire who has been wreaking havoc and causing terror in the hearts of men all over the world. While DeSai is nothing more than a black-hearted spawn of Satan. I wanted him to be loaded with such sex appeal and confidence that even his most morbid behaviors became easy to overlook. This was a bit difficult, because realistically, Cyril DeSai is a murderous vampire. But once Rasia comes onto the scene, this daunting task lightened a bit. Will the ‘victor’ become the victim? Now, the reader is able to sympathize with him on a different level, which honestly sets the tone for both of the next two books.Is this trilogy far-fetched? Of course! It’s a vampire story!",
