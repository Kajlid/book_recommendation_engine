  "description": "SOME SECRETS ARE TOO GREAT TO BE REVEALED. SOME LIES ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO BE DISCOVERED\nAsked to help assess the contents of a lavish English estate, museum conservator Angela Lewis is surprised to discover an unopened crate full of sealed pottery jars. But what she discovers, within one of the jars shocks her; a parchment with writing by a noted first-century Jewish scholar that describes the life and times of Jesus of Nazareth.For Anglea, the find is a miracle: the first written reference to Jesus outside the New Testament. But her discovery draws her into a centuries-old-race for the truth, with a field of competitors driven by both ruthless avarice and fanatical devotion. And if Angela survives, the truth may prove to be more than she can bear.(Description from back cover of mass market paperback edition)",
