As if that wasn’t strange enough, it turns out that she’s prophesied to be queen and her parents only took her to the human world to protect her from those who want her dead. But now she’s at Lughnasadh Elite Academy and face to face with her four potential… kings?It doesn’t help that all four princes are sexy and hot and make her insides squirm when she catches sight of them. There is Bane, the werewolf prince, all broody and with hair sticking up like he just got out of bed. Kit, the incubus prince, whose wicked smile melts anyone’s unmentionables. Rune, the dragon prince, protective and with muscles like he’s a moving mountain. And last, but definitely not least, Finn, the fae prince, quiet but intense, with eyes like a summer forest.According to the prophecy, Litha will marry the true ruler of the four kingdoms. But having grown up human, in the human world, she has no idea where to start making sense of all of it, and the four princes pursuing her really don’t help with trying to figure it all out.",
