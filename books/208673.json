As a member of the Brotherhood, Rosalind's dedicated herself to protecting the world from dark magic. Someone's got to stop the supernatural bloodlust--plus, hunting's a hell of a lot more exciting than her computer science classes.Everything's going to plan until she meets Caine, a mage in league with the demons. He's scary as hell and just as sexy. Worse, he's brought her a warning: rumors are spreading that Rosalind is a mage, too.Now, the Hunters have chosen their next target--and it's her.While she works to prove her innocence, Rosalind must form an uneasy alliance with Caine. But the Brotherhood are closing in. If she can't figure out who to trust, and fast, she'll be exiled to the realm of the very demons she once hunted.",
