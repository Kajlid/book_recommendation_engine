  "description": "\"My name is Rylee, and I am a Tracker.\"But this isn't Rylee's story. \nIt's mine. Before I lost my ability to think like an adult. Before my body became stuck between wolf and human. Before I knew the supernatural and Rylee even existed. This is the last of what I remember before becoming a werewolf. . . .this is the last of what's important to me. And the moments I fought so hard to hang on to. \nMy name is Alex, and this is my story. \n**14k Word Stand alone short story** Haven't read any of the Rylee Adamson books? This short stands alone and is a great intro to the characters.",
