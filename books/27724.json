  "title": "Catie the Copycat",
  "description": "A child's search to find herSELF . . . Poor Catie! She so wants to fit in with her friends that she copies what they do. This makes her look very silly and feel very sad. One night when Catie falls asleep, she has a surprising dream that changes everything, and she learns just what it means to live in her own skin. From that point forward, instead of ''Catie the Copycat,'' she becomes just plain (wonderful) Catie! This whimsical, humorous story is a universal tale of transformation, written for the child in all. Read the rhyming lines and ask for a dream--there may be a surprise waiting for you too!",
