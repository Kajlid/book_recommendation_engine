  "description": "For Darlene Coopersmith, life with Uprising hasn’t been the easiest. The food leaves much to be desired, the rules make her feel like an accident-prone toddler, and the lack of available pirate biographies saddens her every time she enters the library. Worst of all, she despises Lisa Bani, Uprising’s leader and one of the main reasons Darlene’s family is dead. Darlene would do anything to make Lisa pay for the blood she’s shed. For months, Darlene has fought and faked her way into Lisa’s inner circle. After a daring mission in Maine, Darlene cements her place amongst Uprising’s privileged. Then the hard work begins: she’s got to uncover information damning enough to topple Lisa. Luckily, Darlene doesn’t have to wait long. Armed with a horrifying secret, and with the help from an unsuspecting ally, Darlene sets out to destroy Lisa and everything she stands for.",
