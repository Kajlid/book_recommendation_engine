  "description": "What are you willing to risk, to become who you really are?When Georgina Kemm’s life goes into freefall, her best friend invites her to a healing center deep in the Peruvian Amazon. There, Georgina naively enters into the mysterious world of ayahuasca — a potent visionary plant medicine also known as the “vine of the soul.” Under the influence of the herbs, she sinks into the shadow world, where she meets her demons and discovers how far from her true self she has strayed.But just as she begins to reconnect with the Divine, Georgina meets with an unexpected twist of fate when the healing center’s shaman casts a powerful enchantment on her. In order to unbind herself from him, Georgina must face her past and strip away an imprisonment that is not only hers but one shared by women world-wide.The Spell is book one of The Shaman’s Lover Trilogy, a mesmerizing memoir about healing the Wounded Feminine and embodying the Divine Feminine. This personal account will inspire women to free themselves from the patriarchal program of shame, guilt, and low self-worth and awaken to their power, radiance, and beauty. Join Georgina on her journey of unforgettable encounters, magic and, paradoxically, what it means to be ordinarily human.",
