  "description": "This cowboy is looking for more than just an eight-second ride...Mustang Jackson does two things well--ride bulls and love women. So the injury that takes him out of the arena leaves him only one way to make a living. Unfortunately, getting paid to be a stud in front of the camera isn't as fun as private conquests. When he catches sight of little Sage Beckett, minus the glasses, braces and pigtails he remembers, doing time in his hometown suddenly gets a lot more interesting. Sage had a crush on Michael long before he started using that ridiculous nickname \"Mustang\". Though from what she's overheard about his string of buckle bunnies, the man more than lives up to it. In the past he always looked right through her. Now that he's home again, she's determined to capture and tame this wild stallion, no matter what it takes. She intends to satisfy her curiosity and move on, but with every touch she's less sure she'll ever purge him from her system. Once corralled in her arms, Mustang finds himself thinking that domestication may not be so bad after all. Except, once she finds out about his side job, she may not stick for the next go-round.",
