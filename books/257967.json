  "description": "Two blue lines. That means not pregnant, right? Right? Oh, sh*t.Five years ago, Colm Frost asked me to marry him and I ran. I ran from my painful past too raw and fresh to escape. He was the only one who looked at me like I wasn’t broken and made me believe it. He made me feel it.Now, he’s the hot, angry, hockey player on the mend. I’m the physiotherapist who’s supposed to get him back on his feet. I don’t think our night together was what his doctor prescribed, but that doesn’t mean I haven’t dreamt of him every time I close my eyes. I woke up beside him with my body still singing from the way he fanned the flames of my desire, but I couldn’t stay.His lips on my neck. His hands wrapped around my waist. His impressive...ahem, touch leaving me breathless.One moment of wild inhibition and it’s come back to bite me in the butt. Kind of like he did that night.But a baby? Our night was supposed to be a one time thing, closing a door on the future I couldn’t handle. Will this new bump in the road be everything we needed to find our forever?  Heartless King is a standalone friends to enemies to lovers, accidental pregnancy romance that brings all the laugh out loud, angsty feels!",
