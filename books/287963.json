  "description": "Number one rule of ride sharing as a female driver? Don’t fall for the mysterious man riding in the backseat.\nLenoraI came across crazy people on the daily giving rides to strangers for a living. I carried pepper spray and I wasn’t afraid to use it. But one gorgeous male in a fake mustache and a story he wasn’t willing to share, and I was ready to climb in the backseat to peel his layers. He’s a distraction I don’t need as I graduate online college and try to get my first professional job so I can move out of my parents’ house before I’m thirty. I’m so close to realizing my dreams I can taste it.JaydenI should have never hit on my driver. Even if she was the hottest thing I’d seen in cutoff jean shorts in maybe forever. I wasn’t in Auburn Hill for personal reasons and getting involved with the locals came ill-advised as I set up my new business. I probably shouldn’t know she curses like a sailor in bed considering I wind up interviewing her for a position in my company. Now I’m thinking of all kinds of positions I can put her in. Maybe she’ll settle for being an employee with benefits…But none of that matters now. Because I fired her. In front of the whole town. On her first day.Pretty sure there’s no coming back from that.",
