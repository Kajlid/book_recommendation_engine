Briggen and Quinhelm rush home as the powerful Xandoth and their allies surge across the galaxy, killing and laying waste to everything they encounter. As Briggen confronts the evil Sorceress of Endih, squabbling nobles and an assassin on his home planet, the great dragon Ephereon abducts the good sorceress, Telana, instructing her in the ways of magic. To her astonishment, Telana learns that she is the Chosen One, the one foretold by the ancients to lead the people of Mantasi to a stunning victory. Telana joins forces with Briggen as they battle the Xandoth for supremacy over the planet, and magic and courage triumph over the powerful forces of evil.",
