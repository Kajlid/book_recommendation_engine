  "description": "Someone is killing redheads in Madison, California, and Matthew Blake wants to know who. As a vampire, he’s not supposed to get involved with human problems, but his customers at the diner where he works are upset, and when he uses his ability to access one of them, he suspects it isn’t something natural that’s hunting in his town.Rory Coltraine steps in to manage the diner when his uncle’s illness draws him back to Madison. He feels an immediate attraction to the abrupt, borderline rude night cook. But wolves don’t mix with humans, or not sexually, anyway. That doesn’t mean he can’t make an exception.But Matthew’s not human, and neither is Rory, and the redheads who are dying are Rory’s Clan. When they do finally give in to their mutual attraction, it changes things for both of them.Between trying to hunt a hunter, dealing with vampires, and the burdens of their places in the world on top of it, can two very different men find time for love? Of course they can.",
