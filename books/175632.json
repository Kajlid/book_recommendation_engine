  "description": "\"Truly Eye Opening\" \"A Wonderful and Powerfully Honest Look at Bipolar\" \"Can't Like it Enough\" \"Pure Excellence\" \"An Engaging and Insightful Look Into What It's Like to Live with Bipolar Disorder\" \"Have Hope and Read\"  This book gives you a first-hand account of living with Bipolar 1 Disorder as well as treatments and self help therapies that will help you or a loved one not only survive this serious and devastating illness but thrive. Things you can do beyond the psychotropic drugs a psychiatrist will prescribe, or in addition to taking these medications which will help them be more effective and less debilitating. It is written with heart and style, by someone who understands the dynamics intimately - not just another book by a licensed medical professional who has never lived with the disorder. You will learn how to potentially lessen the severity of its devastating highs and lows. A few chapters in the book are:  * What Bipolar Illness is Really Like * Understanding Mania and Hypomania * When Lithium Therapy Does Not Work * Relapse, Suicide Risk and Times Past * Bipolar Disorder vs Drug Addiction * The Difference Between Bipolar 1 Disorder and Bipolar 2 Disorder * Major Depression is Hell * Hospitalizations and Paths to Wellness * Social Life and Relationships * Bipolar Onset and Contributing Factors * 10 Treatments That May Help You or a Loved One * Discrimination a Sufferer May Face  There is quoted material from trusted sources (medical research, psychiatric journals, mental health websites, etc.) included throughout the book, with active links for you to click on to read more about the subject.",
