  "description": "It started with a one-night stand…Within just a few hours of meeting, Silo Kettering and Shelly Palmer were in bed together. It was a special night, an amazing evening of shared passion between the socialite and the Hellion biker. But it was supposed to have been just an enjoyable one-off since Shelly had to get back to Albuquerque and extradite both herself and her sister, Lulu, from the mess their father had made.And a promise to call if help was needed.Silo had made Shelly vow to call him if she encountered any trouble, never realizing that just ten short months later, his would be the only phone number she remembered when she was hurt and broken. But it’s hard, if not impossible, to help and provide safety when you have no idea who or what you’re fighting besides your own heart and feelings. And as Silo discovers, the only thing preventing him from falling head over heels is the little spit-fire’s opinion of both him and herself.From the author of ‘Hiding in Plain Sight’, ‘The Possibility of Trey’, ‘Reinventing Mel’ and ‘Taking a Dare’ comes Book 4 in the Hellion Motorcycle Series, exploring Silo’s story and his reconnecting with the irrepressible Shelly.Often you have to get out of your own way−in order to let love in.**Intended for mature audiences only (18+) due to strong language and sexual situations**",
