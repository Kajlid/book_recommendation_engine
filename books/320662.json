Grand gestures? Happily ever after? Yes, please!Weddings put hope in my hopelessly romantic heart. They remind me to wake up every morning believing that today could be the day I meet my soulmate.Unfortunately, today would not be that day, because I was stuck babysitting the best man from hell: Isaac Lawson. He’s a playboy real estate mogul, my best friend’s best man, and perpetual pain in my ass.One too many glasses of champagne later, and I’m more than willing to make a deal with the devil if it means getting out of my dry spell.
