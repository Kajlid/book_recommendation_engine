  "description": "Climate change and environmental issues form the backdrop of this sci-fi story about a teenage boy who discovers he is here, along with his senator father, on a time travel mission to help save our world from environmental disaster. The September 2019 worldwide student demonstrations by the FridaysForFuture movement and Greta Thunburg proved the premise that when the combined power of the masses demand change then politicians take notice. This is the message of Aaden BlueStar Awakening, that if enough people unite for a common cause then we create positive change in our world.In comparison with other books in this genre, one reviewer described this story as “an imaginative, extremely creative story”, while another reviewer said, “the plot was unique - I’ve never read a book about a boy who got powers from a lightning strike, and it was a really cool concept ... also interesting is that it revolves around today’s environmental issues and shows some ways that might help fix them”. Readers who enjoyed the Harry Potter series would find this an easy and absorbing read, although the `wizard` in this story is an ET and the action is more of a blend of Star Wars and Indiana Jones in a modern day climate crisis setting.",
