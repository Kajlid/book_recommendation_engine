  "description": "Long before the United States could truly be considered a \"melting pot\", the city of New Orleans had already been, for many generations, a place where many diverse cultures came together, and new ones born. The unique natural and cultural richness of the city came with a cost, a disease known as Yellow Fever spread like wildfire, leaving a wake of unimaginable suffering and death.In 1853, a young Louisiana French Creole lady-to-be fell victim to that awful fever, but her heart would not go quietly. When her body succumbed, her spirit found itself in the porcelain body of her favorite doll. Now she searches the city for her love, hoping with all her heart that he will hear her call.I have only seen it on iBooks at http://bit.ly/RnR332__________Each volume of this series is packed with gorgeous photographs taken by the author, over the course of 30 years, in and around New Orleans. In addition to several stories of the spirit's journey, volumes will also contain articles that further explore the history of the city and it's sights, the making of the project, and children and people who fought the terrible plague that was, and is, Yellow Fever.This series is dedicated to bringing the short lives of these children, and their suffering, to the world, so that that may be remembered, and so that we might prevent this from happening again.The author began this project 30 years ago, and the majority of these photographs were taken prior to the devastation of Hurricane Katrina, making this a window into the past on two, distinct levels. See New Orleans, from it's lush neighborhoods to it's stunning cemeteries, as they were.This series features Tavyn, the most photographed doll on location in the world.",
