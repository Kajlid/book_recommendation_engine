  "description": "Fortune favors…the DEAD!  Some secrets are too horrific to ever be forgiven, and some people should never be trusted. Tortured, starved, and on the run, Nina thinks she’s faced the worst that mankind has to offer, but she’s wrong. She may have survived this long, but she hasn’t come out of it unscathed, and there’s worse to come.  Nina’s trusty Doc Martens are showing signs of the zombie apocalypse, and she isn’t faring much better. With her snarky attitude guaranteed to get her in trouble, Nina needs to forgive the past, to live once more in the present, and learn that sometimes she needs to place her trust in other people.  Because when people are faced with the end of times, they’ll do anything to survive.",
