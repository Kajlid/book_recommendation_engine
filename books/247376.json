But when privileged daddy’s girl Ryan Mahony finds herself living on an urban estate they control, she can’t help feeling he’s not that bad at all…Ryan and Ash were never meant to cross paths: she’s always been sheltered by her successful barrister father. But when he’s unexpectedly sent to prison, she’s forced to move in with estranged relatives in the city, where a chance encounter with Ash sends sparks flying. He’s the one man she’s been warned to avoid, but fate seems determined to bring them together…While her head warns of danger, her heart tells her to be reckless for the first time in her life. She knows there’s more to Ash than his gangland reputation. But when he starts to rethink his future and attracts the wrong kind of attention, Ryan has to ask herself: is her life going off the rails—or has she finally found the right track?",
