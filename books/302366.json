  "description": "A year before her mother's death, Karen is startled to discover that what she calls her mother's \"moods and states\" are actually eight distinct alter personalities. Then six years later a DNA test result reveals another shock â€“ there is an extra biological father in their family of four siblings. Karen's immediate response is to declare two first, their \"real Mom\" did not know about the extra biological father because of the many personalities; and second, like Janis, she must have the different biological father too, because there is no way they are not full sisters. In this absorbing, deeply personal story, Karen pieces together fragmented memories to unravel a mystery that began more than eighty years ago as she reflects on how these realities have impacted her understanding of herself and life. In doing so, she inspires us to take off our masks to be more present to ourselves and one another, and to intentionally connect to the powers of love and creativity deep within every one of us.",
