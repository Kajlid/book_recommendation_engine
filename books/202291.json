  "description": "An alien fantasy brought to life...  It should have been a simple volunteer job. Keep the events for the Romancing the Capital convention running smooth. But from the moment Brigitte lays eyes on the male model dipped in purple, hired for the galactic party, she is thrown into a tizzy — mostly because of his stolen kiss.  Imagine her shock once she realizes he’s not an actor. This purple alien is for real!  And Phyr didn’t come to RTC alone. He brought a bunch of his mercenary friends to help him abduct all the single ladies. These readers are about to go on a galactic adventure wilder than anything they’ve ever read in a book — and hotter than anything they could have imagined.",
