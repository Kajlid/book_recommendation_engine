  "description": "Experience a dual perspective YA novel, following the aftermath of a high profile kidnapping case. It's been five years since the event, and Cassie Waterson has become a household name. She didn't do anything important. In fact, she literally did nothing. She just stood there, watching as a stranger stuffed her baby sister into a station wagon. She should have been punished for not acting. Instead, she was splashed across TV screens as the sole witness to Sophie's abduction. While everyone knows Cassie, no one really does. They know the girl from the talk show interviews - strong, confident, and certain that her sister will come home. The real Cassie is none of those things, and the one person who knows it is the one person she should avoid. Meanwhile, Alexis Aldridge is a name you probably haven't heard before. Her parents raised her entirely indoors, blaming the infinite number of rebels lurking the streets for her imprisonment. Though Alexis and Cassie lead opposite lives, they're both desperate for one thing - normalcy.",
