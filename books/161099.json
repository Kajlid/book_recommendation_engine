  "description": "There are a few things that Laurie Baker has yet to figure out. Like, what the hell do you call it when you realise that the man you’ve been with for the last five years, kind of makes you want to go back in time to the moment you met him and punch your younger self in the face? Or, what do you call it when you’re no longer a teenager but not quite an adult?She calls it, Almosthood.Join Laurie as she turns twenty five and has to decide whether normalcy is worth her sanity, and whether happiness is more important than habit.It’s not going to be easy, it definitely won’t be rational and there’s no hope that she’ll she do it sensibly. Everyone is told what it’s like to be a teenager.Everyone is told how to prepare to be an adult.But no one said there was anything else.No one said anything about Almosthood.",
