  "title": "Timeless Nights: Poetry for the Soul",
  "description": "As the words of twilight fade, the shades of night dropped down softly. This is a book of poetry meant to touch the heart and soul. From feelings of fear and panic to the joys of freedom and love. Two styles as different as night and day come together to create Timeless Nights: Poetry for the Soul. This book contains poems that represent different paths of the soul: the light side, where we are playful and caring, and the dark side, where we find ourselves in despair or chaos. The words within the covers of this book find a way to inspire and relate the different sides of man and his constant struggle with life and love. As once was said by Robert Frost, poetry has a way of taking life by the throat. That is what we aspired to do: take emotions by the throat and set it to words that all can relate to.",
