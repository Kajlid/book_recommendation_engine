  "description": "Where do you go when you've saved the world but given up everything and everyone you love in the process?The home of the blues, of course! Quincy Harker has retreated to Memphis to lick his wounds and get started on building a new life for himself. He's determined to be a normal guy (almost) living a (mostly) normal life working as a bouncer in a (not even a little bit) normal bar. But it all goes sideways when someone asks for his help with a little demon problem.Harker knows there's no such thing as a little demon problem. He's right, of course, because his demon problem includes hellhounds, dragons, djinn, angels, artifacts, secret government agencies, and a high school prom. This could absolutely be Quincy Harker's most dangerous outing yet, and that's before we even mention the explosions!",
