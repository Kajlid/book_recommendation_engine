  "description": "Switch off your phone, cure that hangover with a short read! Louise, otherwise known as a red-haired Kardashian decides she wants to settle down. She dreams of a sugar daddy and is willing to sacrifice good looks and great sex for Mr. Sensible. Is this really what Louise wants? Can she put her lover, liar and diva life behind her and fall in love with the older man Gerhard? Will this May to December date change her life forever? Or will Louise's sexual appetite make things difficult for her? Question - What is the first line of the book? Answer - Yesterday, I had God-like sex with a man juicier than sirloin steak. This laugh out loud short story is a quick read for the beach, train or plane. This is a very short story, not a novel or a novella. It has been heavily adapted from one chapter of the book Blind Dates, Big Love & Six Tinder Weeks",
