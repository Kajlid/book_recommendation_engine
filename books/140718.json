  "description": "Asterion, the MinotaurA neo-Gothic hybrid of modern paranormal fantasy and contemporary middle-class realism; a book of suspicion, resentment, confusion, regret, poor memory, and conversation; novel as riddle. The narrator, inexplicably lost in the Labyrinth, is confronted by Asterion, the Minotaur. At the same time, the narrator and his wife are vacationing on a Greek island when hotel guests begin to disappear. A discredited police inspector arrives to unravel the mystery, but his reliance on phrenology may be a greater hindrance than help. The opening riddle is resolved in the ending.",
