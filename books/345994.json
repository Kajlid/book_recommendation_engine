  "description": "When millionaire HARRY TRUMBOLL turns up dead in the glitzy city of LA--all are sure it was from natural causes. But things begin to get hazy when his wife FRANNIE winds up with a dead body in her arms, revealing HARRY was murdered too! Bribing HARRY'S secretary into helping her ferret out the murderer; the two sleuths find themselves planets apart. FRANNIE flamboyant and flighty uses wild imagination and useless intuitive flashes to do her snooping; DAWN mousy and meticulous swears that sound, intelligent reasoning is the only way to catch a murderer--but for all her talk DAWN gets emotionally distracted along the way by a hunky cop named ZAK. Nothing is what it seems as the two partners uncover clues on their zany adventure, discovering each mourner at HARRY'S funeral had a reason to wish him dead. A trusting friendship blossoms between FRANNE and DAWN as they find themselves out on the skinny branches of life, forcing them to come face-to-face with a cold-blooded killer!",
