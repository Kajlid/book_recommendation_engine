  "title": "Rose's Will",
  "description": "Acid-tongued matriarch, Rose D'Orsi, manages to snag the unconditional love of a wise, compassionate millionaire from the senior center. Eli's love, however, doesn't reduce Rose's need for complete submission to her will, or at least a damn convincing facade, as evidenced by Ricky, her 40-year-old people-pleasing son. Unlike her guilt-ridden resentful younger brother, authentic Brooklyn-born Glory D'Orsi believes that meaningful relationships are a two-way street, and that love means surmounting differences, not concealing them. Who's right? And does it really matter after Rose develops a terminal illness and there's so little time left? Ricky and Glory confront their own choices and each other when they grapple with the question: How much are we willing to disown in exchange for parental love and approval, and how do the consequences shape our lives?",
