But while the sexy leopard changeling makes her body ignite, his kisses molten and his touch addicting, she’s no pushover and she has a few demands of her own. This leopard has met his match…\"Please note that Whisper of Sin is a reissue. It was first published in the multi-author anthology, Burning Up.
