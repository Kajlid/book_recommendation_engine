  "description": "Love not only stings when you lose it, when it’s ripped away, but when it first sinks its teeth into you, it can cut just as raw and sting just as deep.Unfortunately, I had forgotten that.I was allegedly South Dakota's most famous Old Lady.Fifteen years ago I had survived my Old Man’s murder and swore to myself never again.Never again surrender my heart.Never again sacrifice to the Club.But that all changed in one night.I came home and crashed into him,and my past and present blew up in my face.Both of us lonely, running on empty, and unwilling to admit it.Until now.I feel things I'd forgotten about, want things I had cut out of my insides.Who holds the keys to betrayal? To suspicion? To trust?To brotherhood? To family?To a bleeding heart?Right now, I just might.I suppose some of us have to get really dirty before we can become truly clean.",
