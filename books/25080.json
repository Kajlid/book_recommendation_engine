  "description": "Nobel Prize winner Samuel Beckett is one of the most profoundly original writers of the twentieth-century. A tremendously influential poet and dramatist, Beckett spoke of his prose fiction as the \"important writing\", the medium in which his ideas were most powerfully distilled. Here, for the first time, his short prose is gathered in a definitive, complete volume, by leading Beckett scholar S.E. Gontarski.",
