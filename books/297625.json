A fresh start.But the pain followed.I'm certain the monsters did, too.I'm told it's paranoia. Trauma. PTSD.Nobody believes my truth.But they'll soon learn.We all will.Because as much as I want to forget the mantra from my nightmares, it hasn't stopped being true.The good guys never conquer. Evil always wins.",
