  "description": "Karlan Rixx is the epitome of the playboy rocker, sexy and gorgeous with the feral edge of a werewolf. And Trent Savage has been in love with him for years. The trouble is, K has a new woman in his bed every night, so he’s straight as they come. Unable to bear it anymore, Sav makes plans to leave the band even though it will break his heart in the process. But anything's better than seeing the man he loves — his mate — and not being able to touch. Ever. K loves being a Lyric Hound. The only time he truly feels alive is on stage, a guitar in his hand and the beat of Sav's drums flowing through his veins. He may be a womanizer, but it's the other wolf who makes his heart pound and his body ache. But before K can admit his feelings, Sav leaves the band, ripping his world apart.Enter Madame Eve. Can she find K's lost mate?",
