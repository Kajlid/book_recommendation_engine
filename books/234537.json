Though determined to please her doting relatives, there is one thing Caroline vows she will never do: marry. So at her society debut, she decides to use her keen intelligence to keep suitors at bay. Handsome, tall, and titled, Alexander Woodward, Duke of Woodborough, is the catch of the Season-but he doesn't want to be caught. He finds a kindred spirit in the witty Caroline and makes her a scandalous proposition: they will pretend to court to dissuade any overtures of marriage.

But with each minute spent with Alex, she finds herself increasingly enraptured by his charm, his kindness...his kisses. Caught up in a dizzying dance of desire, Caroline accepts another proposal from Alex-one that puts her in the most dangerous position of all...",
