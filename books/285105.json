  "description": "Love. Lust. It's my job to spread it around like a virus during cold season. But guess what? Life as a cupid isn't all chocolate hearts and pink arrows. Because even though love makes the realms go round, it seems cruel that cupids don't get to have any of their own. Which might be why I sometimes go on Love strikes and get in trouble with my supervisors. I get a little cranky.  But that all changes the day I get smacked down with some fae magic and go falling through the sky, crashing heart-first into a trio of hot genfins. Now if I can just get those orgasms that everyone says are so awesome, I'll be one happy girl.  I'm cupid one thousand fifty, and no one, not even a revenge-crazy prince, is going to stop me from getting my happy ending. Wink wink.  *This collection includes all four books in the complete Heart Hassle Series. It also includes extra bonus scenes after each book, including male POVs only available in this collection!  Signs of Cupidity Bonds of Cupidity Crimes of Cupidity For the Love of Cupidity  Author's Note: This is a reverse harem series intended for mature audiences only.",
