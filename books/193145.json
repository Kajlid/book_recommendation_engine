  "description": "The Bounty was the first book of poems Derek Walcott published after winning the 1992 Nobel Prize in Literature.Opening with the title poem, a memorable elegy to the poet's mother, the book features a haunting series of poems that evoke Walcott's native ground, the island of St. Lucia. \"For almost forty years his throbbing and relentless lines kept arriving in the English language like tidal waves,\" Walcott's great contemporary Joseph Brodsky once observed. \"He gives us more than himself or 'a world'; he gives us a sense of infinity embodied in the language.\"",
