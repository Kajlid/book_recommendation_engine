  "description": "Escape your creditors with suspended animation! Leave your money to your clone! Live in your favorite actress's head for just pennies a day! Nebula- and Sturgeon-nominated author Kenneth Schneyer explores the seams where humanity and technology, society and individuality intersect, in thirteen mind-bending, thought-provoking tales of near and far futures that will amuse, amaze, and unsettle. The law will change, and the heart will change, and the heart will change the law. These stories confront the question of just what makes and keeps us human. The collection includes four new, previously unpublished stories: \"Grapple with Thee\", \"Half a Degree\", \"Exceptionalism\", and \"The Orpheus Fountain\". \"The stories here are formally ingenious, even startling, and at the same time full of heart; the combination is brilliant and delightful. More please!\" -- Kim Stanley Robinson, author of 2312 and Shaman: A Novel of the Ice Age.",
