  "description": "Being around me caused the men in my life to want to choke, hit, or toss me to the floor. At fifty something, I took a writing class from Anne Heffron in San Jose, CA called Write Or Die, I chose to write. Writing about my upbringing has helped tremendously on my road to healthier, happier, me. You don't have to be a writer to benefit from narrative therapy, proof here in my pages. It worked for me, if it can work for just one or two others who happen upon this piece, yippee!",
