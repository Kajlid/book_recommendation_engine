  "description": "Billionaire businessman, Cal Sellers, knows how to get what he wants. And what he wants is Lucy Monroe. The problem? He had her once and lost her with one careless, arrogant act. And now she’s standing in his office demanding her old job back. Cal has no intention of rehiring her as the co-host of his home shopping TV show, Pleasure at Home. He has an altogether different position in mind for her—as his wife. If Lucy wasn’t so desperate she never would’ve stepped foot in Cal Sellers’s office, let alone the block his building stood on. Lucy’s a survivor who managed to break free of her ex’s terrible abuse, but now he’s back and more determined than ever. He wants their daughter, Poppy, and will stop at nothing to get his little girl back. Lucy will do anything to protect her daughter, including marrying Cal Sellers. Against her better judgment, she agrees to Cal’s proposal and finds herself married to a very different man than the one who broke her heart two years ago. As Lucy’s ex grows bolder and more violent, Cal and Lucy find themselves fighting not only for Poppy, but for a forever love that could be the one thing that will save them all.",
