  "description": "I am now many miles further to the North-East and am writing from a cave in a gaunt hillside. When Jackson and I sat down to rest we could see our footprints stretching back to the edge of the world. . . .Lost in the frozen polar wastes, an explorer huddles in his shelter, typing with freezing fingers the journal of his lonely, extraordinary exploits, preparing to send the story to the nephew he has never seen. With his only companion, the tortoise-like mutant Jackson, the Uncle has gone in search of his ambition and his destiny: the awesome and mysterious White Lion.Illustrated on every page with stunning, beautiful, eerie drawings, this edition has been completely re-originated form the original artwork. Reproduced here for the first time in full colour, Letters from a Lost Uncle is the triumphant product of a unique imagination and a distillation of all that is most powerful in the strange genius of Mervyn Peake.",
