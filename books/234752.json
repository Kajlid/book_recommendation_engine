  "description": "How does Alburet feel about Stacia suddenly becoming his Succubus? How will her family react to her sudden change? While trying to handle this sudden transition, Mindblown is also going to take the server down for maintenance. Alburet will have to deal with emotional turmoil, all while continuing to play the game he has been sentenced to play for life. What else is about to change in Alpha World? Mindblown announces the ability to form guilds. Alburet sees an opportunity to form a guild himself and takes it. This is a continuation of the Alpha World saga. It contains real life situations, including sensual scenes that donâ€™t get fully graphic but might make you uncomfortable. It also contains hunting monsters and gaining levels, but not at a break neck pace.  (There are a number of hugs and kisses, numerous fade to black scenes that hint at sex, and three times where oral sex is found but not graphically described. Please remember, there is a Succubus in this story, aka a SEX DEMON, as such sex is referenced frequently.)",
