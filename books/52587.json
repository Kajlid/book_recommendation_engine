  "description": "Packed with funny and at times zany encounters from his life journey, this first book by Tim Steed is a celebration of the imperfections in life. Through a series of lighthearted essays, Tim examines the big and small moments in life. From the godly cleaning lady, to the obnoxious traveler, to the little boy with a weak bladder, life is filled with the good, the bad, and the ugly. Seeing life as a road trip with bumps, detours, beautiful sunsets, and untimely bathroom breaks, Tim's message to readers is to enjoy the journey, experience mercy and grace, apply what you learn, and keep going.",
