  "title": "SOUL EPIPHANY",
  "description": "Soul Epiphany is the poignant tale of the human spirit that chronicles the life of Indian marathoner Ramesh Dhami as he morphs from an underprivileged mountain kid into an impossible derelict steeped in drugs and theft, and subsequently makes a life transformation into becoming one of the best marathon runners that the country has seen to starting his own NGO serving millions in society that have been marginalized and forgotten. Soul Epiphany is a reminder of the power of free will and the strength of the human spirit to withstand and overcome seemingly impossible challenges through sheer grit and gumption and the fine art of never giving up. Soul Epiphany is a tribute to the epiphany that the soul can have through the most trying times as it emerges into a clear understanding of its purpose and the role it has to fulfil in its lifetime within a human body. Dhami, the protagonist of this non-fiction work of literature, today is a successful social entrepreneur that runs GreenSole - an NGO that provides recycled footwear to millions of barefooted children and adults in India and other third world countries.",
