  "description": "[Menage Amour Erotic Alternative Paranormal Menage a Trois Romance, M/M/M, dragon shifters, public exhibition, voyeurism] Austin Lung was more than willing to lend a helping hand to his friend Gabriel, especially since it meant freeing abused men from a sex slave ring. When one man asks Austin to take him home, he can't help but agree. Garreck Hawes has known no other life—he barely remembers a time before he was a sex slave. Now, all he knows is that he wants to follow his handsome rescuer home. If that means Dante comes too, so be it. As a sex slave, Dante Hammerstone has done things he wishes he could forget. The only thing that has made it worthwhile was knowing he was protecting Garreck when he could, even if it meant taking his place. After a rash of unexpected complications and broken promises, will they run from each other—or will they take the chance that love could be behind the walls they've built? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
