  "title": "Almost Lover",
  "description": "An unexpected encounter. A second chance. A volatile past. You can't hide deep enough or run far enough from yourself. Bailey Moore busts her ass as personal assistant to her best friend, up and coming super model Alexis Gerard. Their arrangement suits them both just fine—Alexis gets all the attention and Bailey makes certain her friend’s successful career keeps rolling forward, preferring to remain as far away from the spotlight as possible. All that changes after a chance encounter with gorgeous, famous and oh so sexy Liam Lincoln leaves Bailey reeling, her body and heart suddenly awake with long smothered desire. Confused by her own emotions and afraid to trust his motives, Baileys erratic behavior threatens to crush their blossoming relationship and expose the past she’s been desperately trying to bury. This book is intended for mature readers.",
