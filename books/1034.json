  "description": "Movie star Tessa Flanagan has retired from the Hollywood grind with a string of popular and critical successes behind her. Now her days revolve around spending time with her daughter Laya and launching a new career in philanthropy. She doesn't expect a brief encounter with Eleanor Chapin, Laya's new kindergarten teacher, to make a lasting impression.As the end of the school year nears, however, Tessa realizes that her daughter's beloved Miss Chapin may be the perfect nanny for the summer. Natural and direct, Eleanor already understands Laya's need for life out of the public eye. Even though it means inviting a stranger into their household, Tessa is certain her own carefully guarded secrets will not be at risk.For Eleanor, L.A. is merely a stop between Boston and a long-awaited Ph.D. program. But the job offer from Tessa Flanagan is so lucrative she is tempted to put her plans on hold. The idea of working closely with Tessa is equally enticing, but the job is about Laya. There's no reason not to take it--after all, she'll be leaving L.A. soon.Kate Christie explores the distance from Chicago's South Side to the Hollywood Hills, from bucolic New England to lush Kauai through the passionate connection between two women looking for home.",
