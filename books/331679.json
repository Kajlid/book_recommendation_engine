  "description": "Is it a gesture of good will or a sinister trap that lures Rupert St. Vincent and his family to magnificent estate? How desperate is Joyce Lambert, a destitute young widow whose only recourse is to marry a man she despises? What unexpected circumstance stirs old loyalties in Theodora Darrell, and unfaithful wife about to run away with her lover? In this collection of short stories, the answers are as unexpected as they are satisfying. The Queen of Crime takes bizarre romantic entanglements, supernatural visitations, and classic murder to inventive new heights.Contents:The Listerdale MysteryThe Girl in the TrainThe Manhood of Edward RobinsonJane in Search of a JobA Fruitful SundayThe Golden BallThe Rajah's EmeraldSwan SongThe Hound of DeathThe GypsyThe LampThe Strange Case of Sir Arthur CarmichaelThe Call of WingsMagnolia BlossomNext to a Dog",
