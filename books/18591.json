  "title": "The Collected Speeches of Margaret Thatcher",
  "description": "By the time she stepped down in 1990, Margaret Thatcher had become one of her generation's outstanding political leaders, and perhaps the most powerful woman in the world. Possessing an iron will, she matched words with action in confronting the crises of the day in economic affairs, in the Falklands War, in Northern Ireland, in the great twilight struggle of the Cold War and finally in Europe. Under her leadership, Britain broke out of its decline and self-doubt to emerge once more as a major player on the international stage. Margaret Thatcher put intense effort into her major speeches. As a result, they are uniquely revealing of how she developed that clear vision which would transform Britain and help shape international politics in the late 20th century. They begin with the speeches she made as part of her campaign to mold the ideas of the Conservative Party in Opposition. They continue with the famous addresses in which she expressed her convictions as prime minister and include recent lectures in which she gives her current, and controversial, thoughts about the world today. This book of speeches is an essential companion volume to the two books of Margaret Thatcher's memoirs, as well as a masterly study of one of the great political figures of our time.",
