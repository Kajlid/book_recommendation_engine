Ancient jinn Jared endures heavy guilt and wants nothing to do with the human girl. Tripling is necessary to keep immortals alive, but his hunger for Micki is far beyond normal. Though warrior angel Bradley completes their threesome, he despises Jared for his tainted reputation. He vows the jinn won't hurt the gorgeous human and has no problem fighting him to prove it. But when the threesome comes together, they share more than an exchange of energy, they share an unshakable bond that generates astounding power. Their enemies seek to destroy their perfect triad, which could unsettle the balance of power between angels and demons. Will the threesome be able to stand strong together - in trust and love - to defeat the relentless evil? \"Over lunch with an author friend, I shared an idea I'd been considering for a book.
