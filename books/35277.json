  "description": "The war is raging through Italy in 1943, and a young Canadian soldier struggles to stay alive. But nothing can dampen his sense of humour—not hunger or horror or the shellfire that doesn’t always miss. Not month after month in the thick of the fight. Tommy is irrepressible.It doesn’t sound like much fun? Well, it is...the way Tommy tells it. Make no mistake. Tommy’s not fiction. He was a real soldier, and these things happened to him—all of them.",
