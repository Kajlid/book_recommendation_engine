  "title": "Jillian Cade: (Fake) Paranormal Investigator",
  "description": "Ally Carter’s megabestselling Gallagher Girls series meets Veronica Mars with a paranormal twist when Jillian Cade’s (fake!) private eye service unearths far more than she bargained for. Jillian Cade doesn’t believe in the paranormal, unlike her famous father, a professor and expert on the occult. Ever since he abandoned her to travel the world for “research,” she’s milked his reputation—and all the suckers who believe in the stuff—by taking over his private investigation firm. After all, a high school junior has to take care of herself, especially when she’s on her own. Ironically, it’s when she takes on a case that might involve a totally non-paranormal missing person that things get strange. Particularly when Sky Ramsey—a new boy at school who insists on becoming her partner—won’t shut up about succubi, of all things. As they investigate, Jillian is surprised by her feelings for Sky, which threaten to derail the investigation. But that surprise is no match for the shock of learning that there may be something to Sky’s succubi obsession after all.",
