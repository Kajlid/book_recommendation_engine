Maybe it's the way he flies through the fat lane without losing his cool or without missing a meal! You'll marvel as GARFIELD finds new ways to evade exercise and beat boredom. But it's nothing that a few airborne sardines can't cure, and feeding Odie a jar of sticky peanut butter is a sure way to a slobbering good time. So join GARFIELD and his friends before the food is gone and the fun slows down!",
