  "description": "Susan Diane Jones is a problem. At least that’s what people tell her. Handed off from one guardian to another 3 years ago she was pretty sure those people told the truth. Even now she still caused more problems, she was still just a problem.. Then she meets Erik. A stranger that feels like home. An actual person that treats her like everybody else. Desperately she tries to keep him away from the truth as long as she can. Away from her demons. Even if they seem to appear everywhere. Erik Flores is finally returning to his normal life. He has gotten a hold on his past enough to be able to go back working. Back to being deployed after being out of the game for almost two years. Meeting her he is intrigued by the French mystery. Even if he leaves every time with more questions than answers about her. Susan is a mystery, one that pulls him deeper with every smile. One that makes him regret reenlisting for another tour. Because he isn’t sure they will survive the time apart. He isn’t sure their demons will leave anything behind. *This book has a couple of trigger warnings and for this reason, some parts of the story might be sensitive for some readers.",
