  "description": "Understand airway health to unlock your child's full potential.Did you know that the way a child breathes will impact every aspect of their development including their sleep quality, learning, behaviour, jaw and facial development, speech, and future health?Common issues children experience such as snoring, disturbed sleep, poor attention and concentration, ADHD-symptoms, difficulties with emotional regulation, recurrent ear infections, speech or feeding concerns, teeth grinding, crooked teeth, and more, can often be symptoms of a bigger, underlying problem. These are all symptoms of dysfunctional breathing and unrestorative sleep.Many health care professionals are not taught to ask about a child’s breathing or sleep quality, and this knowledge deficit leads to the dismissal of a child's problems. We're told \"they will grow out of it,\" but in the case of poor breathing and sleep left untreated, children often grow into different problems, falling short of their full potential all the way into adulthood.Dr Shereen Lim was one of Australia’s first dentists to obtain a qualification in dental sleep medicine. She has a decade of experience in managing snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea and is calling for a reformed approach towards airway health from infancy instead of managing dysfunctional breathing and symptoms.Breathe, Sleep, Thrive will connect the dots to help you identify the important developmental milestones for good airway health development and breathing, the red flags that indicate things are off track, and what can be done about it to help your child not just survive, but thrive.",
