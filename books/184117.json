  "description": "Accused of murder, Caleb flees with his son Warren to begin a new life far from Earth. But when his ship crashes on an unknown world, Warren is injured, condemning the child to a slow death before his twentieth birthday.  Telai is the first of her sword-wielding race to meet these strangers from the sky. Her loyalty to her people demands caution, yet she cannot ignore the plea in Caleb’s voice, or the desperate longing in Warren’s eyes. A connection takes hold, a bond even her clairvoyant powers cannot explain. Should she trust her instincts? Should she trust her heart?  Caleb embraces the unhurried lifestyle of their noble cities, and swears an oath to protect Telai’s people. Determined to save his son, he discovers a passage in their archives about an ancient talisman that could cure any disease--but was so powerful it sent an entire race to the brink of destruction.  Now he faces a terrible choice: Pursue this faint hope, betraying his oath and his growing love for Telai ... or watch his son wither away until he dies.  Rite of Exile is the first book in The Silent Tempest trilogy.",
