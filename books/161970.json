  "description": "**From New York Times bestseller Lexi Ryan, ALL OR NOTHING is a short, sexy new adult romance previously published in the ALL I EVER WANTED anthology.** Winterfest is heating up in Abbott Springs...  As the townâ€™s yearly festival kicks off, cold days turn into steamy nights, new flames will be ignited, and old romances will be rekindled.  After years of placing the wrong bets, all Aubree Baxter ever wanted was someone to take a chance on her. More specifically, she wants golden boy Kennedy Hale, her good friend and unrequited crush. After a seduction attempt gone terribly wrong, she knows pursuing anything more than friendship with Kennedy means sure heartbreak, but the chemistry between them has sizzled for years and won't be denied. Sometimes in love, it has to be ALL OR NOTHING.",
