  "description": "Nicole Xao has dreamed about superheroes since she was a girl; now she's a grown-up hacker, trying to turn her talents to the greater good in the New Cloud capital of Maui City. Citrine represented everything that Nicole hates - greed, violence, corruption... Self-tasked with taking it down, the Marvelous Kea Girl took to the streets to fight injustice. Yet when Citrine CEO Lana Latham appeared asking for her help, Nicole found herself entranced - and surprised at how much their own goals were the same. Agreeing to help Lana reform Citrine into a force for good, or burn it to the ground trying, the pair become partners - professional at work, deeply in love at home.Whether she likes it or not, those around her don't feel as good about her move into Citrine's web of lies - and when a mysterious hacker begins testing Citrine's defences, it's Nicole's own friends who find themselves asking if it's even worth trying to stop him.Don't Freak Out is a queer novella for young adult (and up!) audiences and second in the 'The Marvelous Kea Girl' New Cloud Heroes sub-series.",
