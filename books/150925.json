  "title": "Martin Magnus, Planet Rover",
  "description": "Martin Magnus is a hardened troubleshooter who might be driving a six-wheeled buggy over rugged Moon terrain in chapter two, strolling the ocean floor in chapter four and flying to Venus by chapter seven. He's competent, confident, wilful, allergic to bureacracy and interference from his 'betters', and intolerant of pompous, self-important twits.",
