  "description": "It was supposed to be a simple job. Bodyguard duty for a wealthy businessman's daughter. But the Paranormal Protection Agency don't do simple so shadow-dragons Baron and his brother Duke find themselves going undercover as human of all things. Their mission: to protect Miss Croft and dig up some dirt on her father to tie him to the illegal trade in paranormal slaves rife in the city. Dissent and rumors amongst the staff at the Croft house make them wary, but neither expect redcaps and trolls to attack in the middle of the night, or for the most startling revelation of all: Honor Croft is Baron's mate. When a crazed warlock steals her away, will Baron be willing to make the ultimate sacrifice to save her?",
