  "title": "Murder Most Steampunk: or the Case of the Calamari Conundrum",
  "description": "Miss Eustacia Louisa Stout is most distressed to find a headless corpse on her doorstep, without so much as a calling card! She flies to the terribly decorated flat of the painfully inept detective Hemlock Scones, and volunteers to accompany him on his equally inept inquiries. Along with Presto the Magician, Bongo the Clown, a mongoose with an elaborate backstory, Dashing Man (who always seems conveniently absent), and their troop of semi-competent Victorian superheroes, they begin cleaning up Londonâ€™s streets. Will the nefarious schemes of Doctor Cephalopod prove too much for them? Will aethyric London fall? Or at least not turn into a raging automaton? Forget all you know about steampunk superhero detective parodies and prepare for the silliness!",
