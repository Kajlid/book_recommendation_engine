  "description": "When the banished Erdlings were brought from their imprisonment below ground and finally reunited with the Kindar it seemed the times of love and joy that the founders of the Green-Sky had promised would at last arrive. But unforeseen problems arose and the result was turmoil, mind pain, unjoyfulness, and a constant fear. Only Raamo held hope for the future. He was proved right, although the path to rejoining lay through surprising sacrifice. Originally published by Atheneum in 1980, Until Celebration, a Junior Literary Guild selection, is the final book of the Green-Sky Trilogy.",
