  "description": "My whole life, I wanted one thing: to be the perfect son.Growing up, I did everything my father required. Straight A’s in school. Perfect manners. I forced myself to live up to his standards--standards that pushed the Chadwick family name to the highest rungs of society.Over the years, we climbed so high that my father hoped we’d never fall.If only he’d been right. With each successful year, the Chadwick family skeletons grew bolder and darker. Every lie threatened to undo us.The secret Avery Jackson and I shared was the worst one of all.She was the one person I shouldn’t love--the one person I couldn’t love. But I did. I loved Avery Jackson. I wanted her, even though a romance with her threatened everything.It all felt so natural.And that was exactly the problem.",
