He’s a vampire working with paranormal allies to protect a world that doesn’t know the dangers that prowl the shadows.

Can they help Sorren fight a deathless foe from centuries past, or will they see everything they love go down in flames?Vendetta is an action-packed thrill ride full of magic, restless ghosts, infernal creatures, haunted places, found family, cursed paintings, old Norse magic, demigods, vampire politics, fallen angels, loyal friends, secret history, and plenty of adventure!",
