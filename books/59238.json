  "title": "The Rhetoric of Fiction",
  "description": "The first edition of The Rhetoric of Fiction transformed the criticism of fiction and soon became a classic in the field. One of the most widely used texts in fiction courses, it is a standard reference point in advanced discussions of how fictional form works, how authors make novels accessible, and how readers recreate texts, and its concepts and terms—such as \"the implied author,\" \"the postulated reader,\" and \"the unreliable narrator\"—have become part of the standard critical lexicon.",
