  "description": "Avalon is missing home like she never thought possible, acid burns through her bloodstream at her situation of being stuck in the city away from her outback station home and her family. She realises that it’s not all doom and gloom in the city, she has forged new friendships, learnt life lessons, experienced unforgettable times and given new hope to others. Her wild heart and inner fire has captured the interest of two rivals. She allows herself to develop a deeper friendship with one only for him to turn on her. Betrayed and angry, Avalon reverts to what she knows, people that understand her and horses; finally finding a horse that she hopes will partner her in her quest to ride in the Olympics. Will the betrayal chill her heart forever? And what happens if a heart like Avalon’s grows cold? What will he have to do to win her back?",
