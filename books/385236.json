  "description": "Stand under the mistletoe until midnight, naked, bound and blindfolded. Submit to any dominant who wants a piece of you. At the junior doms regular poker night, anything can, and frequently does, happen. Add in crackers that contain dares instead of jokes and two men s lives might never be the same again.When Carl applied to join the best leather club in the city, he had no doubt about his preference for dominance. It was only when he set eyes on Sloan that he began to wonder if submission might be far more fun than he originally thought.With no time for club politics and little interest in rising through the ranks, ever since experienced dom Sloan moved to the city and joined the club, he s been quite content to bide his time among the junior dominants and keep a brotherly eye on a young man who is obviously out of his depth amongst his more sadistic contemporaries.One man has to do the dare. The only question now, is which man will it be, and are either of the friends ready for the way their relationship might change after a night of Mistletoe and Submission?\"",
