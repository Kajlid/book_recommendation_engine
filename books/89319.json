  "description": "People come into our lives. Some stay, and many go. Some build us up, while most tear us down. They become our friends, our enemies, our lovers, our tormentors. Christian Davison came into mine, and I knew I'd never be the same. To Elizabeth Ayers, New York City had always been a dream. She's worked her entire young life to make it here. Groomed to one day take over his father's law firm, attending Columbia University was Christian Davison's only option. Neither wanted anything more until they sat across from each other at a cafe table after being paired as study partners. Christian wants her, but Elizabeth knows better than to give into their intense attraction. Yet there is little she can do to stay away. Lost to You, the prequel to the bestselling romance, Take This Regret. A New Adult novella, recommended for readers 17+. It's unnecessary to have read Take This Regret to enjoy Lost to You.",
