  "description": "Poet and Amy's story...Patrick Gallagher’s future was mapped out—and it didn’t include Amy Henderson or the IRA.She was everything he’d never wanted. Too young. Too naïve.Unfortunately, he couldn’t help but be fascinated by the girl who took refuge in his old bedroom, staying with his mum more often than not.She looked like a Renaissance painting and argued like a solicitor. He couldn’t resist her, and before long, he didn’t even want to.Instead, he loved her unreservedly… then he married her.But he couldn’t have prepared for what happened after.Actions, no matter how large or how small, have consequences—and when the IRA comes knocking, he’s sucked into a life that he’d never anticipated.Choices were made.Hearts were broken.Trust was shattered.Lives were lost.Through it all, he loved her.It was a love that spanned decades.Epic.Intense.Unquestionable.Unbreakable.",
