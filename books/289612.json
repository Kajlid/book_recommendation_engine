  "description": "“The Sinner” Reyes.  I’ve been called every name in the book by my long list of haters: cocky, hard-headed, impulsive, arrogant. But there’s another name I like to go by—the best MMA fighter in the world. You’ve never heard of me, but one day you’ll know my name.  I was broken when I met her, mending mental and physical wounds, and that’s when Harper approached me, wanting to tell my story to the world. There was only one problem—she was the hottest woman I’d ever seen in my life. Why was that a problem? She wanted a profile for her blog, and all I wanted was to see her naked. It was doomed to never work out. But then one night I asked her to go to dinner with me, and everything changed between us.  I though it would be smooth sailing, but then her unknown past stepped between us, threatening not only the two of us, but standing in the way of my personal dreams. If I can overcome my obstacles, then I know I’m destined for greatness. There are only three things I want now—Harper by my side, a contract with the UFC, and for everyone in the world to know that I’m the most Savage Sinner in the world.",
