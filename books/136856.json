  "description": "After six years in a cage, teenage Crissa’s life is running short. If she can even call it a life. Kept as a caged display in a traveling circus, Crissa endures the stares, taunts, and whispers of those who call her ugly and strange. But one remark haunts her above all others – how much she resembles the brutish Humans who died long ago. But Crissa can do what no other can. She can sing!  In a ‘what-if’ world where prehistoric Humans fell extinct and others not quite Human inherited the earth, Crissa is like no other. Imprisoned by the brutal Tal-Bern, who murdered her mother and hauled her away, Crissa serves the glory of his circus. Every night she faces hostile crowds who marvel at her disturbing strangeness. And every night she stuns them with passionate singing before returning to a dank cage. If not bad enough, her circumstances grow darker. She is marked for death, sold by Tal-Bern to the highest bidder for sacrifice during the bloodthirsty Rite of Long Moon – which is fast approaching!  Though all seems lost, the shuttered window to her future opens when one evening she spies a young man in shadows beyond the crowd – with a face like hers! The incident sets in motion a chain of events that leaves her running for her life. Crissa’s headlong flight carries her toward the mysteries of a murky past, her Human face, and the wonderment of love and belonging. If only Tal-Bern doesn’t destroy her first!  Crissa’s observant narrative drives a story that explores the burden of exclusion, the power of kindness, and what it means to be human.",
