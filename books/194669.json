  "title": "Saving Honor",
  "description": "Saving Honor is the first book in its series, followed by \"Death and I.\" Honor was just a regular teenager until everything changed in a few swift moments of truth. Honor discovers that she has abilities beyond what she could have imagined; abilities that she never thought could have existed outside of her little brother's comic books. What is also discovered are tales of her dark origins; origins deep and unlike most others. Although she tries to deny her strange new life, she soon realizes that she must face what she has become. Will she be able to keep her unique identity a secret from those around her, including those she loves the most? Is Honor a hero in the making or will she turn her back on the responsibility she never asked to carry? An eccentrically funny book that is equally dramatic.",
