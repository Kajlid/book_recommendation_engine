  "description": "Being a 1000-year-old vampire doesn't suck. Fabulously wealthy, Al Farkus lived the high life until he lost his fortune in the stock market crash of 1987. Suddenly, he faces the indignity of having to work for a living. But what kind of job would be appropriate for a vampire? Driving a taxicab, at night, of course Al had found the perfect job, but then the job fell through, and he finds himself stranded in Madison, Wisconsin. Desperate, he applies at a worker-owned-and-operated cooperative cab company then must face the greatest horror of all, a job interview. But how is Al to deal with co-workers whom he views as inferiors? And although Al has renounced violence, what does he do when a murderer is on the loose? Follow Al's adventures as he tries to cope with cranky passengers, psychotic murderers and the odd things people do at baseball games.",
