  "description": "He could feel it. The flutter of butterfly wings that would herald a brighter, better world. He looked out to the flat, calm ocean, the moonless night. Beyond the ship's illumination the dark waters rose up so that he felt as if he and the ship lay at the centre of a vast opaque bowl. Then at a distance, under the starlight's dim flicker, he saw it. First, a jagged edge, then two irregular peaks, riding black against the black night sky.Conspiracies linking events as disparate as the sinking of the Titanic and the assassination of J.F.K., have played themselves out in dark and unforeseen ways.The Cold War between Greater Germany and Imperial Japan is drawing to a close.America, divided and scarred, will be the final battleground in a world distinctly different, yet disturbingly familiar to our own.Six people have the means to avert the apocalypse.Welcome to the secret history of the 20th Century.",
