  "description": "Mild-mannered Myriam is diagnosed with macular degeneration in her right eye, but that doesn’t explain the strange things she’s been children in bright red helmets dancing on the doctor’s ceiling, exotic vines growing from her television set, and thousands of colored castles forming patterns on her kitchen walls. Her husband Fred is certain that Myriam’s visions are a bunch of nonsense, and her family dismisses her odd observations as the results of old age and an addled mind. So when Myriam begins to notice something “off” about the house next door, she has only her own instincts to can she tell the difference between a trick of the eyes and a real crime? The surreal lives side by side with the everyday in this graphic novel about life with Charles Bonnet syndrome, a condition in which a person with partial or severe blindness has complex, often bizarre hallucinations. Gareth Brookes’s rich, artistic crayon drawings pull the reader into Myriam’s vibrant and unnerving world, showing the frustration and fear that arise as a result of this unique condition―and the moments of unexpected beauty.",
