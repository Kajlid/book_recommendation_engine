Crazy, desperate, and all things people are when they agree to do something insane. She held a contract outlining one night of submission to a stranger! Submission so complete, his requirements for preparation before presentation of herself to him made her blush while her womb tightened in anticipation.She would do anything to escape the dreams. Would this work? God, she hoped so. Wrenching dreams that came almost every night. The man in them never varied, his control of her body and its responses drove her to the edge of sanity. She'd wake up screaming for release, finding nothing but wet sheets and an empty house.Tall, dark and dominate, he'd long since accepted being alone for this lifetime. He'd met his lady, lover and submissive, but only in the dreams. Dream Walking is a door to the past or future, but never the present.She entered the suite and the unimaginable reality of his woman alive in this time exploded across his brain. She assumed the required stance. Now, spread naked before him stood everything he'd never dared hope for",
