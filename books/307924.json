  "description": "From USA Today Bestselling Author K Webster comes an emotional, young adult gay romance! The pain is overwhelming. My life means nothing anymore. Black. Lonely. A void. I have an expiration date and the final hour is here. Until a boy bounces into my dark world. Too short. Too young looking. Too smiley. Too much hair. I want to look away because he’s too much. Too much everything. Bright and bustling with energy. A train wreck of color. His name is Kit Strong. Loud, adorably dorky, and absolutely my type. In another life, I could love someone like him. It’s too late, though. I’m ready to leave. I’ve already made my decision. But he wants me to stay. ***This is a MM emotional romance that touches on sensitive topics like death and suicide but ends happily. This story was formerly in an anthology.***",
