  "title": "Always",
  "description": "Written in the second person point of view, 'Always' is a creepy, contemporary answer to Nikos Kavvadias' 'A Knife'. It is you who finds the cursed knife, but, unlike the protagonist in Kavvadias' poem, no one is there to warn you about taking it home. At only 1300 words, 'Always' is an easy read for the time-poor.",
