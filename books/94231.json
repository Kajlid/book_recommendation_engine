  "description": "More Than Everything is a gripping memoir of resilience and liberation. The author's compelling story takes us on a frantic journey (from Texas to Alaska) as she is forced to flee from the FBI after her husband's drug lab is raided. After a series of misguided decisions, they find themselves stranded and destitute in the far north. Will they be saved by Moses, a kind-hearted man with a cattle ranch looking for seasonal help, or will the law catch up with them thousands of miles from home? This is the true story of how an everyday miracle gives a desperate young woman the strength and courage to face her fears and do the right thing.",
