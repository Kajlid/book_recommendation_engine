  "title": "The Role of Women in Society in the 20th Century",
  "description": "Written in 1901 by an Italian lawyer and sociologist, this concise, fascinating book predicts the role women will have, the changes society will undergo, and the part the new movement called ‘feminism’ will play in the upcoming century. It is translated into English here for the first time. Ferrazzani was a man ahead of his time. In a period in Italy when no need was seen to educate young girls, and a married woman was completely under the authority of her husband, he examines the social, legal and moral plight of women and argues for and predicts the inevitability of changes that have ultimately come to pass in progressive societies: equality in education, full access to employment, legal rights in the event of divorce or abandonment, and more. His arguments are still echoed today and the insights and predictions he makes, given the prevailing social values of the time, are nothing short of remarkable.",
