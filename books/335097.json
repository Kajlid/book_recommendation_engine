  "description": "A heart-warming family drama spanning three generations, with an unforgettable love story at its heart. When the telegram arrives on a bright sunny day in 1942, Nancy feels sick with dread. But instead of wartime bad news it's from the legendary Jackie Cochran, asking Nancy to fly for Great Britain. For Nancy, a girl with flying in her blood, it's an opportunity she simply can't turn down. But that fateful decision is to trigger a series of events, with consequences that will reverberate through the generations. In summer 2006, Sarah is at a crossroads in her life when her adored grandmother Nancy asks her to help lay the ghosts of her past to rest. Sarah agrees, little suspecting the long-buried and shocking secrets that will be dragged to the surface. From the tension of World War Two right up to the present day, this is a sweeping family story that is both moving and unforgettable.",
