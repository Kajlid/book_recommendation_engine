  "description": "**This novella previously appeared in the On the Growl anthology.**  What’s a gal to do when a dog bite isn’t a dog bite and her boss makes her want to howl at the moon?  When her ex dumps her, the only thing Brenna Davis can think to do is drown her sorrows in a margarita—or ten. So she does, and all that got her was a serious headache and some weird bite on her arm. For some reason, she isn’t convinced it came from a dog…  Alpha of the Swan Mountain werewolf pack, Declan Ross, has two things on his to-do list:  1. Kill the damned rogue wolf in his territory.  2. Find the damned rogue’s newest victim before it chews its way through half the mountain.  Of course, when he finally finds the tempting, deliciously curved, blue-eyed woman he adds a third item to his list: keep Brenna Davis all to himself…forever.",
