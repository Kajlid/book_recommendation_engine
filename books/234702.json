  "description": "All Tahlia wanted was to give her mom and new step dad an extended honeymoon. That's the only reason she agreed to join her estranged archeologist father in Italy for the summer. She expected dust and heat and boredom. She expected to spend the summer getting to know the dad she hadn't seen in six years. She expected to spend most of her time carefully reassembling broken pieces of ancient artifacts. That's not what happened. Not even close. And now her life will never be the same.",
