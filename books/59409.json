  "title": "Five Little Pumpkins",
  "description": "The favorite finger rhyme told in schools, libraries, and play groups every Halloween is presented here in wonderfully humorous and endearing illustrations. Five not-so-little pumpkins start out \"sitting on a gate.\" But before long a wild evening is afoot. They roll along a country lane to join some trick-or-treaters--a ghost, two witches, a clown, and a devil. As the lights go out and a magical wind swirls by, all converge on a big, old Victorian house--where every window has a spooky scene, and a skeleton comes to open the door! Full of the Halloween spirit from beginning to end, this playful and inviting book will prove a delight all year long.",
