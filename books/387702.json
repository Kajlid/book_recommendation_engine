  "title": "The Evolution of Inanimate Objects: The Life and Collected Works of Thomas Darwin",
  "description": "In the archives of Ontario's London Asylum, psychiatrist Harry Karlinsky comes across a familiar surname in the register. Could Thomas Darwin, involuntarily admitted to the Asylum as a \"danger to others,\" be a relative of the great Charles Darwin? And what might have brought him to this place, where he died alone, a world away from home?Â  In this stunning factitious biography Karlinsky gives us a Nabokovian tale of Darwinian theory gone wrong. Although decisively a work of fiction, The Evolution of Inanimate Objects invites sustained uncertainty as to whether Thomas is a character of pure invention or simply a heretofore little known figure.",
