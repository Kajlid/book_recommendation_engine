  "description": "In the swinging sixties, Las vegas rookie cop Wayne Norton was a straight arrow - though not exactly the sharpest one in the quiver. Then his girlfriend's mafioso father threw him into an experimental cryogenic sleep chamber - and forgot to leave a wake-up call. Wayne is revived 300 years later, in a world where nothing is as it seems, everyone treats him like an incompetent dolt, and he's very, very confused. All in all, not much has changed.Now, drafted into the elite organization GalactiCop, Norton is sent into the middle of a ruthless war for dominion over the galaxy's most prozed vacation hot spot - and its babe-filled beaches. His weapons are a complete mystery to him. His training is terribly minimal. And his mission...Well, he hasn't quite figured that one out yet....",
