  "description": "The snow is falling, the bells are ringing, and Krew is ready to celebrate the holidays with all his friends by throwing the most fabulous Krewmas party of the century!  There will be… -thirty sprigs of mistletoe (Ireland will be there, need I say more?); -a tree full of sexy mermen (No explanations required.); -a promiscuous Elf on the Shelf (Max can’t wrap his head around this one.); -an atrocious casserole (Thanks, Adrian.); -creatively remastered Christmas carols (to help Krew get in the spirit); -a bottle of aged whiskey (for Max… See above.); -eight deliciously festive tubes of Chapstick (Um… I’ll let Krew explain.); -baby Godzilla, aka Scarlett (Did you think Finn and Aven would miss this?); -unicorn horns, magnum-sized condoms, ugly sweaters, a baby Jesus (who probably should not have been invited), snow diving, and much, much more.  Oh, and if Krew can work a miracle, Santa might even…come.  Krewmas will be one for the record books. So many shenanigans even Krew himself may not be able to keep up.  **This is a 50k Christmas novel full of fun and shenanigans**",
