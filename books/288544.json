And for a single sinfully hot night, they’re about to indulge in the one thing they’re not allowed…each other.Fashion executive Riley Gold knows that appearances are everything. And New Year’s Eve in Milan is no exception. If Riley’s going to have a reputation for being an “ice princess,” then she’s going to be flawless, glacier-cold perfection. Especially when Chaz Warren is here, looking too damn good, too damn sexy…and every inch the enemy.Not only are their families fashion archrivals, but social media mogul Chaz Warren is a player—and the world knows it. But for one X-rated night, Riley will give in to the electric lust that’s always been crackling between them. All it takes is a searing kiss to turn the heat from simmering to full-on passion…Riley thought one night with Chaz would be enough. But it’s not enough, not nearly. Now Riley and Chaz are having a private—and completely naughty—affair, and hiding the scandalizing truth from both the tabloids and their feuding families. But keeping her deliciously hot enemy close won’t just melt the ice around Riley’s heart…he could incinerate it completely.Harlequin DARE publishes sexy romances featuring powerful alpha heroes and bold, fearless heroines exploring their deepest fantasies.Four new Harlequin DARE titles are available each month, wherever ebooks are sold!",
