  "title": "The Forbidden Heights",
  "description": "The Forbidden Heights is a collection of parables that have no reference to a specific time, place or person. They simply point to mystical and spiritual notions that resonate across cultures, regardless of dogma, creed or tradition. Those who appreciate the wisdom of the Sufis and the writings of Khalil Gibran are sure to enjoy this work. These parables arise from the same place, geographically and spiritually. They were written in English and translated into Arabic for this unique dual-language publication.",
