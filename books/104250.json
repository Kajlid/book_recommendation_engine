  "description": "Cree arrives late for her babysitting job to find the mother gone, the older child in a daze, and the baby missing without a trace. The police, the neighborhood searchers, even the Fbi can find no clues. At school, Cree makes a new friend, a girl with troubles of her own. Maddie has just escaped from an obsessed and violent boyfriend who continues to stalk her. Her handsome brother Ben, who has Asperger's syndrome, is accused of the same kind of behavior, although in his case it was unintentional. Cree and Maddie team up to find some answers. But there are those who don't want the answers found. As things come to a head, Cree finds an odd connection between the two cases. If she can live to tell about it.",
