  "description": "We weren’t meant to be together, but now we’ve been given a second chance . . .There’s an unwritten rule about your best friend’s boyfriend, and I broke it when I kissed Joshua after Chelsea’s tragic death. I’ve stayed away from Williamsport ever since.Until now. After a recent assault, the town I couldn’t leave fast enough seven years ago has become my refuge.Except I don’t get a warm welcome. Joshua’s anger over the way I left radiates from his eyes like cut emeralds. That’s why I’m surprised when he insists I stay with him to keep me safe.Now he’s a sexy billionaire in charge of a real estate empire, and I discover our old friendship remains. As well as the secret feelings I kept to myself for so long.Acting on those feelings would still be a betrayal, and it’s clear to me that Joshua is reluctant to let another woman into his heart.But when danger comes looking for me again, and I see how far Joshua is willing to go to protect me, will we finally have the courage to admit our feelings and move on from the past?",
