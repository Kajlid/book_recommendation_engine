  "description": "Ben McCabe has only one thing on his mind when he’s released from the Yuma Territorial Prison for a crime he didn’t commit: Revenge. Four years of his life gone, spent in a torturous hellhole. He wants the man responsible brought to justice, regardless of the cost. When Wisteria Bush finds an unconscious man next to the Colorado River, she knows she has to help him, no matter how dangerous he may be. She nurses him back to health to find he is a threat to her, but not in a way she’d ever imagined. When her brother takes up cattle rustling and intends to marry her to his boss, the handsome stranger has other ideas.",
