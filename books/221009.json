  "description": "Astra was done traveling, or so she thought. Benched for physical rehab and retraining, she’s in LA dating movie stars (not as fun as you might think) when the Department of Superhuman Affairs asks for help catching a superhuman serial killer. When what should be a simple job develops…complications, she finds herself catapulted into another reality—one with its own history and superheroes! As her teammates scramble to find out where she’s gone and what’s become of her, Astra embarks on a cross-world journey in search of a way home. It’s going to be a long trip.  Team-Ups and Crossovers follows Astra and her teammates through multiple stories on multiple worlds, and includes a story co-written with David Barrack (writer/artist of Grrl Power), an original story by K.F. Lim, and the graciously permitted use of Velveteen and friends by Seanan McGuire.",
