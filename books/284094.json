  "description": "My world was perfect until he came along.  Spiralling from the recent loss of my grandmother I find myself witness to a kidnapping and in the spiders clutches as he tries to stop it happening again. It’s a race against time to stop the men behind this, secrets shrouding them at every turn...but when we are forced to work together sparks fly cracking his cold exterior. What will I find underneath? What if when I see the real him, what if he never lets me go? What if I don’t care?  My world was perfect until she came along.  I stop the evil in this world before most even knows it exists but when the woman I find myself unable to walk away from lands herself in the middle of my latest hunt I have no choice but to work with her. Only it is harder than expected, she forces me to feel things I didn’t know existed… When she gets to close, will I let her walk away or will she be trapped in my spidersweb? Mine forever. Neither of us wanted the other but life has other plans...as long as we can stay alive long enough.",
