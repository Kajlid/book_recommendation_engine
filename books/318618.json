  "title": "Lupinia: The Selected Poems of Polly Drinkwater, 2007–2015",
  "description": "Lupinia is a collection of Polly Drinkwater’s darkest and most intimate experiences as a lycanthrope, captured in poems of loss, love, lust, longing, and loquacity. Seeking an elevated understanding of her condition, she finds she is at war with her body, her identity, even her soul. The duality of the human condition through the lens of lycanthropy offers insight into the liminal animality of herself as a living thing. The story of one woman’s struggle to define herself through her own paranormality, Lupinia offers a voice in the wilderness across fecund fields of feral ferocity, through the mind-fire of her ongoing affliction.A WOLFSHADOW BOOK",
