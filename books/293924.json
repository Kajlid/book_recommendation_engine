  "description": "I promised her that I'd live my best life once I was free.It was that promise that led me to Voyeur — to Daniel. What better place to conquer my fear of intimacy than a club that allows you to watch? Who better to help me than the owner himself?On night one, my past comes roaring back, urging me to run like I always had before.This time I ran into his arms. With my fear still clinging to my skin, he brushed it away and made his own promise. \"I'll teach you.\"His promise turns to friendship. A friendship turns to passion. We didn’t know what to do with that passion — between the not-so-broken girl and the man who promised to never love again. Daniel and I started because of a promise, and I hoped that we wouldn’t end because of one too.Teacher is Daniel and Hanna's steamy, tension-filled, friends-to-lovers standalone romance. The last book in the bestselling Voyeur series. Are you ready to watch?",
