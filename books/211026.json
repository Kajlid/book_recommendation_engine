  "description": "Race Traitor brings together voices ranging from tenured university professors to skinheads and prison inmates to discuss the \"white question\" in America.Working from the premise that the white race has been socially constructed, \nRace Traitor\n is a call for the disruption of white conformity and the formation of a New Abolitionism to dissolve it.In a time when white supremicist thinking seems to be gaining momentum, \nRace Traitor\n brings together voices ranging from tenured university professors to skinheads and prison inmates to discuss the \"white question\" in America. Through popular culture, current events, history and personal life stories, the essays analyze the forces that hold the white race together--and those that promise to tear it apart. When a critical mass of people come together who, though they look white, have ceased to act white, the white race will undergo fission and former whites will be able to take part in building a new human community.",
