  "description": "No time like the present.No time in the present.No time left.From the moment the Hourglass group violated the rules of the space time continuum to rescue a murdered loved one, time has been in flux. People from other centuries slide into our time, intruding into our space, threatening our world.Frantically seeking a way to turn back this tide, the Hourglass begins a search for the legendary Infinityglass, tracking it to the city of New Orleans, a place where the past rests easily with the present.Quiet, reliable Dune, the group's favourite geek, is selected to travel to the Crescent City and somehow retrieve the renowned object.But there's a problem.Because the Infinityglass is not an object, it's a person.A beautiful, headstrong dancer named Hallie, a girl so enticing Dune can't take his eyes off her.And time is not on her side.",
