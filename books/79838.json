Eventually deciding for his sister he is now set against his father who is of an older generation with strongly held religious views. Originally written in 1978 it is of that time when Saudi Arabia had recently become a united country but a country of contrasts, between the more and less religious elements, between the rich and the poor, between a desire to modernise and a desire to maintain the discipline of the old. This forms the background to the novel and highlights the challenges facing the young couple.The end leaves the reader to make up their own mind as to rights and wrongs of the tale.",
