So why does her husband think she's not as happy as she could be? Jonas knows that Sabrina should love her life, but as the stress of \"having it all\" wears on her, he knows he has to do something. Surprising her with a trip to Elysium, a kinkster's paradise, for their fifth anniversary seems like the perfect thing. From the beginning, this trip seems doomed. First she rejects the gift. When he finally gets her there and she agrees to spend five days as his complete submissive, he thinks he can finally show her how she can truly have it all. At first Sabrina enjoys submitting to the man she loves, but when it becomes too much and she shuts down, Jonas must use everything in his arsenal to break through to the woman who holds the keys to his heart. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
