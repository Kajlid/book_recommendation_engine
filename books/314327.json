She shops. He hikes. She drinks pink ladies. He drinks beer. She’s a city girl. He’s a mountain guy.Obviously, this means they have a blowout fight upon meeting. Their second encounter doesn’t go a lot better.Judge is loving the challenge. Chloe is everything he doesn’t want in a woman, but he can’t stop finding ways to spend time with her. He knows she’s dealing with loss and change.He just doesn’t know how deep that goes. Or how ingrained it is for Chloe to care for those who have a place in her heart, how hard it will be to trust anyone to look after her…And how much harder it is when it’s his turn.",
