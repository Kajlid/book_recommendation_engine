  "title": "Dog Days: Dispatches from Bedlam Farm",
  "description": "In Dog Days , Jon Katz, the squire of Bedlam Farm, allows us to live our dreams of leaving the city for the country, and shares the unpredictable adventure of farm life. The border collies, the sheep, the chickens, the cat, the ram, and one surprisingly sociable steer named Elvis all contribute to the hum (and occasional roar) of Bedlam. On timeless summer days and in punishing winter storms, Katz continues his meditation on what animals can selflessly teach us–and what we in turn owe to them. With good neighbors, a beautiful landscape, and tales of true love thrown in, Dog Days gives us not only marvelous animal stories but a rich portrait of the harmonious world that is Bedlam Farm.Praise for Dog Days :“Anyone who has ever loved an animal, who owns a farm or even dreams of it, will read Dog Days with appreciation and a cathartic lump in his or her throat.”–The Washington Post“Katz proves himself a Thoreau for modern times as he ponders the relationships between man and animals, humanity and nature, and the particularly smelly qualities of manure.”–Fort Worth Star-Telegram“Katz constructs the perfect blend between self-revelation and his subtle brand of humor.”–The Star-Ledger“City-dweller-turned-farmer Katz . . . returns with further adventures from his animal-filled upstate New York sheep farm. Charming.”–People“The perfect summer book . . . You will not be disappointed.”–The Philadelphia Inquirer“A new twist on the American dream.”–The Christian Science Monitor“Thoroughly enchanting.”–The Dallas Morning NewsFrom the Trade Paperback edition.",
