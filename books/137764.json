  "description": "A neo-Gothic novel of revenge, opiate addiction, lust, deception, and betrayal; harsh realism in the service of psychological disaster and fantasy; romance derailed.  When Karl Marx entered the University of Berlin, he thought of himself as a poet and dramatist. He soon recognized that he was neither, but not before he left behind a novel, a handful of love poems and one act of a play, OULANEM (the cryptic title that Marx gave to his fragment). That fragment is here incorporated into a Gothic novel that reveals the all-consuming, obsessive demands of revenge.",
