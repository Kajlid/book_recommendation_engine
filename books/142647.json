  "description": "Katherine Bianchi had everything her daddy’s money could buy. Dresses, shoes, a fancy apartment, everything…except for Dylan Berkeley. Apparently being the spoiled princess of Upper East Side was not appealing enough to keep the sexy, Forbes billionaire, and owner of BKY Enterprises.After running from Berkeley and his Ben & Jerry’s lifestyle (lots of options, exciting flavors and never repeating a scoop), Katherine discovered she may need what she never thought she could want. What if she ran away from the only man who could save her from her cat lady destiny?More cursing, more fashion, more Blue Eyes and even more Kev’s speeches. Can the bitch get the guy?Warning: 18+ Contains sex scenes and lots of unnecessary profanities.",
