  "description": "The Countess Ashby de la Zouch would not be every parent's choice of chaperone for a beautiful teenager, still fewer would entrust her with finding the girl a husband. But the second Mrs. Alderman Franklyn-Green is willing to go to any lengths to get rid of her unwanted stepdaughter Virginia. The promise of 100 guineas and a sojourn in France is sufficient to secure the Countess's services, even if the girl is a complete shrew. Sadly, the exiled English Court at St Germain does not live up to their expectations. Worse, any hopes of enjoying fine French cuisine are dashed when a fellow guest is poisoned. Once more the Countess and Alpiew are plunged into a dangerous investigation, unraveling plots against three kings and negotiating the culinary eccentricities of the Court of Versailles.",
