  "description": "She believes in myths . . . can she believe in destiny?Denali Heat, Book 1Unlike her adventurous sister, Ruby is perfectly content to let her mind be the wanderlust while her body stays safely in Chicago. Melanie wouldn't be out of touch this long without a damned good reason, though. Which means it's time for a giant step outside her comfort zone.While Denali National Park is like another planet, the myths and legends that saturate this wild land are right up her alley. The wilderness guide waiting for her-naked in her bed-looks about as safe as a polar bear.Carson's people are kin to the great beast, right down to the white hair. Before Ruby ever set foot in Alaska, his inner bear knew that Melanie's little sister was his mate. He's doing his level best not to let his primal needs scare her, but everything about her sends his urge to possess her into overdrive.To his surprise, revealing he's a shifter only stimulates her innate curiosity. Warming her with the perfect fire of their lovemaking, easy. Convincing her that real love isn't a myth-and making her want to stay in his home, his bed, his heart-now, that's a problem . . . Warning: cozy flannel PJs, a naked shifter, incredible food and some fireside sex hot enough to melt the polar ice caps . . .",
