Wild Pets is an instant set text of the emerging canon of millennial fiction.'Guardian'A wickedly funny and emotionally complex novel.'Jenny Offill, author of Weather and Dept. of Speculation'An impresive, cumulatively powerful first outing.'Daily Mail'A ripe and excellent debut... funny and smart and human and true.'Andrew O'Hagan, author of MayfliesWild Pets follows Iris, Ezra and Nance in the years after university. They fall in and out of bed with each other, reread The Art of War , grieve the closing of Fabric and write book proposals on the history of salt, while submerging their nights in drink and drugs. Confronting adulthood with high wit and low behaviour against contemporary political and social turmoil, these young men and women seem to have everything going for them. So why are they still swimming desperately against the tide?A bold, honest novel, Wild Pets is about the fragility of mental health, power imbalances in friendship and sex, and creative ambition fused with destruction - and the lingering power of first loves.",
