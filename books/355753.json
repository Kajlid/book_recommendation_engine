  "description": "A child watches her mother and father as they work with their hands, and she knows she wants to build and sew and garden and paint just like them. When they give her a special place to work, lots of good materials, and plenty of encouragement, she makes the most wonderful things! “It’s a work that looks simple, but encompasses at least as many grand notions as Ehlert’s first book, Growing Vegetable Soup .”-- Kirkus Reviews",
