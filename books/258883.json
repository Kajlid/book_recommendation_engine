  "description": "Poor Little Miss helpful. She loves to help out, but she can be a little clumsy sometimes!The Mr Men and Little Miss have been delighting children for generations with their charming and funny antics. Bold illustrations and funny stories make Mr Men and Little Miss the perfect story time experience for children aged two up. Have you met them all?It all started with a tickle. Roger Hargreavesâ€™ son Adam asked him what a tickle looked like. In response, Roger drew a small orange man with extraordinarily long arms that could reach anywhere and tickle anyone. Mr Tickle, the first of the Mr Men, was born. Mr Tickle was soon joined by Mr. Greedy, Mr. Happy, Mr. Nosey, Mr Sneeze and Mr Bump. When the first Mr Men books were published they became an instant hit. Roger went on to create many more Mr Men and Little Miss characters. What Roger really wanted was to make children laugh, which is probably why his own favourite character is Mr Silly.",
