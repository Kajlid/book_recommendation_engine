  "description": "The wisdom from Sun Tzu's world-famous book, The Art of War, has been widely applied by many top-class CEOs to drive their businesses to success. One of the quotes from his book reads, “ If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” That translates to business as, “If you know yourself, your customers, and your competitors, you need not fear about your business anymore.” But how can entrepreneurs and business owners do that? The answer is market research.Market research is the magic elixir that can give you that extra edge you always wanted over your competitors. It can help entrepreneurs in launching successful startups within their limited resources; it can even help small business owners from getting their businesses taken over by giant corporations.
