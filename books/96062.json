  "description": "In ReDeus: Divine Tales, the gods returned to us.All of them. Now, in ReDeus: Beyond Borders, see just what that means for the nations of the world—and the people living in them.Everything has not necessarily turned out for the best, especially in some lands. Nor is it all bad. But with so many gods vying for worship, there’s some interesting jockeying going on, for lands and for people. It’s a vastly different world the gods have returned to, and their efforts to re-assert themselves have forced mortals into a complicated, ever-changing struggle to live and provide for their families.Returning to ReDeus alongside series creators Robert Greenberger, Paul Kupperberg, and Aaron Rosenberg are Phil Giunta, William Leisner, Scott Pearson, Lawrence M. Schoen, and Steven H. Wilson. Joining us for the first time are Lorraine Anderson, Kelly Meding, Steve Lyons, David McDonald, and Janna Silverstein. All told, there are thirteen brand-new tales of what happens when the gods go . . . beyond borders.",
