  "description": "The key to surviving seventh grade, Alice figures, is fitting in -- getting her ears pierced like everyone else, dressing like everyone else, joining clubs like everyone else. Suddenly, Alice finds herself part of the \"in\" a member of the All-Stars Fan Club and the earring club, and one of the Famous Eight. The trouble is, some of the stuff the \"in\" crowd does seems pretty dumb to Alice. And some of it seems downright boring. Can Alice be herself and still be one of the crowd?",
