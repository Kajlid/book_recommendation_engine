  "title": "Reign of Malice",
  "description": "The first book in the Malice trilogy. Trama, a human warrior forged in pain, strives to bring the blood price to those who wrong him. Sometimes to those who just cross his path as well. He is not noble; he is not a good person. He is a killer in a world run by the wicked. The days of knights of honor are gone. The days of freedom are gone. The wicked rules with an iron fist but even the wicked find something worse at times. Trama is something worse. The five kingdoms of man have fallen. The ogre are slaves to the orc masters. The dwarf scattered to small roaming tribes, their mighty fortresses laid waste. The elf hide in their forest kingdom trying to ride out the tide of darkness slowly encroaching on their world. The tribes of the wastes fear to leave their desert world. Only darkness moves across the land stripping hope and strangling lives in its wake. Even darkness can find something darker at times. Even the wicked can find something to fear while spreading fear. Trama is not reluctant, he is angry. Trama is not looking for peace, he is looking for blood. Someone more noble might find a reason to rise up and commit murder. Trama does not need a reason, just an opportunity. He is broken. Only another broken soul hiding in the forest of the elf stands between the light and the darkness of his soul. Only another broken soul determines if he brings hope or despair to those his path crosses.",
