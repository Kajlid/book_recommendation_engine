  "description": "All Marine Sergeant Tucker West wants is to be left alone! He’s no Hero, despite what his extensive family and the residents of Carson Creek, Texas seem to think. Injured on his last tour and discharged from the only place he’s ever thrived, he returns to his small-town roots and buys his grandparents falling apart ranch, intent on living out his days in solitude.  Just as it should be. It’s more than he deserves, but he’ll take what he can get.  But life has other plans.  Instead of leaving him to his nightmares, Fate throws a coffee drinking stray Calico Cat into his kitchen one morning, and his desperate desire for peace turns on its head.  Callista Sundance is not your ordinary Shifter. She works for the non-profit, Anonymous Heroes, a group of Veterans that have decided to use their extraordinary abilities to pose as Service Animals. They help those suffering through the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress deal with the real world until they can get their feet back on solid ground.  Her new assignment: the grumpy, stubborn as a Texas Longhorn, former Marine Tucker West. Her goal is to help him find a new life…and if she’s lucky, happiness.  But just as Fate and a broken down truck throw them together, Tucker’s past comes back to haunt him. In more ways than one…  Is Calli strong enough to save Tucker? Or will Tucker be the one doing the saving and get the 2nd Chance he truly deserves…  Find out for yourself in first book of The 2nd Chance Shifters Series…",
