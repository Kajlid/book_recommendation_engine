  "title": "Why Christmas Trees Aren't Perfect",
  "description": "Long, long ago, in a land far away, lived a perfect little tree named Small Pine. Small Pine hoped to maintain its perfect form and be selected by the Queen as her Christmas tree. But as the warm-hearted little tree gave shelter to birds, rabbits, and deer in the forest, its branches became damaged. Fortunately, the Queen had a different idea of perfection... Young readers will want to read and reread the story of how Small Pine's love and charity for its friends helps make it the most \"perfect\" Christmas Tree of all. This magnificently illustrated story of a warm-hearted Christmas tree will surely become one of the most beloved classics of future generations. Schneider's storytelling will enthrall children and adults alike.",
