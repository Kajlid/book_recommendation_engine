  "description": "Stranded alone with an injured alien...When the alien ship holding me malfunctions, I'm thrown into a shuttle and expelled from the ship. I awaken to find myself on what looks like a toxic waste dump--miles of inhospitable, eerie land where the ground smokes, the hills are black and barren, and it's unpleasantly cold.Soon I discover I'm not alone. There's an alien on the awful island. A familiar alien.He's the one who bought me from my captors. He's the one who paid extra because I'm a virgin. And he's the one who put me aboard the shuttle and saved my life when the ship went down.I have a decision to make. Should I kill him as he lies injured and delirious, or should I nurse him back to health and hope he can save us both?When I begin to soften toward him, and worse, my body begins to respond to his, I can't help but wonder--can a human woman fall in love with her alien abductor?-This steamy romantic fantasy series is for you if you like strong women, fierce alien men, and fated romance with nonstop action.",
