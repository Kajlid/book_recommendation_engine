  "description": "This book is part of a dark kinky fiction trilogy and may disturb some readers. The full warning is at the bottom. This is not a standalone read.What happens when the victim becomes the killer?Killing isn’t right, but it's better than the wrong people being dead.That’s what Zorie tells herself, until the day she makes a mistake and the hunter becomes the hunted.Maybe love is possible, even with men who can control minds. Maybe it’s time to stop running from Grimm and Mavros. Though ordinary men cannot arouse her, these two are far from ordinary.A risky plan delivers Zorie to the door of her biggest threat yet. There might be a chance of survival, if Mavros can figure out the meaning of true love and Grimm can remember how to be human.Good people die as easily as bad.WARNINGThis Dark Hearts trilogy explores horror and thriller territory. You’ll find some very graphic scenes oozing from the pages. In the first book you won’t find anything more than hints of romance, as the romance is on drip-feed speed. The main man, the antihero, may not even end up being who most readers expect him to be.",
