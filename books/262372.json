Club Aegee has luxurious accommodations, unlimited free cocktails and a gorgeous cosmopolitan staff who'll cater to your every need.Bride-to-be Rachel Buckley wanted one last adventure before tying the knot, and who better to do it with than her two best friends, acid-tongued divorcee Carrie Ann and commitmentphobe model Yaslyn? A week with the girls would also help Rachel forget about her future mother-in-law, who was already controlling her life. Her friends, the beach, the hot waiters...the perfect vacation, right?But when a week in the same room with her two best friends -- and all their baggage -- exposes more than dirty underwear, Rachel starts to wonder if by gaining a husband she'll be losing two friends....Seven Sunny Days is the story of three friends awaiting their future, but stuck in their past. Funny and oh-so-familiar, it's for anyone who's spent time under the sun with friends.",
