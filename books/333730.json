  "description": "“Demons, or no Demons, I will get Tanner and Baker together.”Jimmy is a brand-new agent assigned to the most difficult case the Lovers Angels Corporation, a supernatural matchmaking service, has seen in centuries: the Tanner-Baker case. Jesse Tanner and Danni Baker have been neighbors for years. Getting them together should be a walk in the park, and every tactic Jimmy employs should work—in theory. However assaults of suspected Demonic mischief ultimately tangle the situation so badly it will take a small miracle to organize a happy ending for Tanner and Baker.When the exploits of the supposedly non-existent Demons bring up the ghosts of the past, Jimmy’s odds of success seem to diminish. With so much opposition of the Demonic kind, is it possible for Jesse and Danni to be together, especially when romance may not be the only thing the Demons are prepared to kill?",
