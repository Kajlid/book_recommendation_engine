  "title": "Spoilt Rotten: The Toxic Cult of Sentimentality",
  "description": "Alternate cover edition can be found here. Drawing on his long experience of working with thousands of criminals and the mentally disturbed, Theodore Dalrymple writes about the hidden sentimentality that he feels is suffocating public life. Under the multiple guises of raising children well, caring for the underprivileged, assisting the less able and doing good generally, we are achieving quite the opposite for the single purpose of feeling good about ourselves. Dalrymple tackles the subject through social, political, popular and literary issues and shows the perverse results when we abandon logic in favour of the cult of feeling.",
