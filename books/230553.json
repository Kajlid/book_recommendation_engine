  "description": "How often do you daydream?For most, it is many times a day.We stare out the window instead of the task in front of us.We fantasize about where we wouldmuch rather be,the significant other we long for, our ideal job, the body we hope to see in the mirror, a healthier mindset, pure happiness in our lives and the lives of others, peace in this chaotic world.However, how many of us daydreamers believe these pleasant thoughts will truly turn into our reality?Daydreams are more than just short bursts of happiness that only our minds can see.I know I am more than a daydream; and you are, too.",
