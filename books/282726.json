  "title": "It's okay not to have kids: We are more than our parental status",
  "description": "There are numerous reasons why people don’t have kids and the most common is NOT because they are selfish. In today’s society, many of us understand that it’s not appropriate to make comment on another person's weight, ethnicity, religion or sexual persuasion. So why do we still feel it’s appropriate to not only comment, but have an often-uneducated opinion on whether a person has a child or not? In It’s okay not to have kids , Michelle Cox shares her experiences about not only surviving cancer and losing the ability to have something she always wanted – children – but then having to navigate societal pressures placed upon her and other people’s opinions on how she lives her life. This is a book about resilience. It’s about leading the life that you want and that’s right for you. But mostly it’s a book about understanding and appreciation for other ways. Everyone’s life path is not the same and that’s perfectly fine.",
