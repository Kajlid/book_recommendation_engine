  "description": "Brigid Manderson had the blues. She wanted to go to medical school but she couldn't afford it. When her mother, an ex prostitute, invited her to work for her escort business she didn't want to but circumstances forced her hand. Her most recent customer was the wealthy record producer, Thomas Kellier. He wanted her and he was willing to pay for the privilege of having her. Would Brigid succumb to his wealth and charm, or would she choose the harder path of love with Dr. Nick Benedict, a Christian guy who had no idea who she really was?",
