  "description": "This is the sequel to Lifeblood, The Last Vampires of Hollywood. It picks up at the end of the first book with Dragan, the head vampire back again in France. There are two stories here moving from the present time back to the French Revolution when Dragan's eternal life was in grave danger. He and others of his kind have roamed the earth for six hundred years. They survive by draining the life blood from their victims and then evolving into being that person as well as all the others they have consumed in the past. This thing known as The Change as well as their age gives them great power and strength. In this book Edmond Poulain, the chief inspector of Paris joins forces with Greg Delacroix the Hollywood detective who has come to know the vampire in pursuit of this fiend. It also follows Dragan's flight during the bloody Revolution. As in the first book, this one is replete with all kinds of characters, madmen and monsters.",
