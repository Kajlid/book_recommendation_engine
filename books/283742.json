  "description": "What would you do if you were a teacher that wanted to get fired? How would you respond to emails from parents? How would you deal with rude students? And what would you say during staff meetings if your goal was to be terminated? Now imagine a school with eight teachers competing to get fired and the hilarity that would ensue. Scott Miles is a snarky, peculiar and witty chemistry teacher in Plymouth, Michigan who teaches with seven close friends. One of his friends, Josh, proposes an idea called The No Teacher Left Behind Club where they all chip in to purchase lottery tickets for the group. During that meeting, the teachers jokingly agree to give a double share of any large winnings to the first of them that can be fired. But with a growing teaching shortage in Michigan, what will it actually take for someone to get fired?",
