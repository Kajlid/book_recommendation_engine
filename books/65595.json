  "description": "Humanity has managed to avoid detection by the Violet Civilization and has only lost nine planets in the Milky Way to their war fleet. Now they were faced with a decision; do they keep a low profile and hide or join the war against the civilization killing Violet Ships. To attack the 300,000 ships going to attack Andromeda with only twelve hundred main battleships was suicidal. But to wait was just as dangerous. Whichever path they chose, everyone needed to take time to pray for the prey.",
