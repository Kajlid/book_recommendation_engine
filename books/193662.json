But who gets to choose what it looks like?After two violent years spent scavenging for food and territory while struggling to survive, an easy life in Sickness-free England has a certain appeal to Donna. Only one thing—one person—could make her want to return to the ruined chaos of New York City. And she thought he was dead.Jefferson dreamed of starting over—uniting all the warring teens and creating a Utopia. Instead, the discovery of the Cure fuels a massive power struggle in the city, and it turns out, the whole world wants a piece of the pie.With some of their own tribe in trouble, a deranged madman on the loose, and an unspeakable threat looming large, Donna and Jefferson must save not only themselves but what’s left of their world in this conclusion to The Young World trilogy. Because what good is living if everything you care about is gone?",
