  "description": "I’m a goat shifter with a checkered past and sticky fingers. I like my new life. I’ve got good friends, cheap booze, and weekly karaoke. Sure, I live in an apartment with more deadbolts than functioning windows. And yeah, I earn just enough tips as a mediocre bartender to buy name brand ramen noodles. But I can be as flamboyant and fun as I want—as long as I keep my hands clean.When a mysterious stranger strolls into my bar with tales of a magical dagger so rare it’s guaranteed to start a bidding war, that old itch is back. One last job…for old times’ sake. At least, that’s what I tell myself.With an uptight alpha werewolf breathing down my neck and a demon hot on my tail, this job could be my downfall. One wrong move, and the pack of werewolves I ran from eight years ago will come looking for payback. Only this time, they won’t leave me breathing. Hopefully, my survival skills are better than my bartending.Demon Relic Hunter is the first book in the Riley Cruz series. If you like fun, fast-paced urban fantasy with quirky characters and a dose of slow-burn romance, this is the book for you.",
