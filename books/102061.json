Between him and the only woman he’s ever loved: a handful of rebelling death dealers, the deity Karma and the Dark One’s mate, a human-turned-demon who holds his soul in the palm of her hand. Time is running out, and Gabriel has one chance to make things right, even if it means letting go of the last part of him that’s human.",
