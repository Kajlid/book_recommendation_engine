Dan and his friends face their challenges assuming the tactics of their tormentors, with fists flying. With their backs to the wall, they pull a strategic retreat into the wilderness where things are seen more clearly. Realizing a more rational plan, redemption begins to unfold.Join Dan on his journey down this fractured road as he overcomes obstacles, finds love and compassion, and discovers himself with the help of a phenomenon the world has apparently forgotten about.Are there answers or just a strong wind?",
