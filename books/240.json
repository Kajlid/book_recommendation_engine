  "title": "Experimental Evolution: Loss-of-Function Mutations, and \"the First Rule of Adaptive Evolution\"",
  "description": "Dr. Behe explains in his new peer-reviewed scientific paper in Quarterly Review of Biology why most examples of evolution in bacteria and viruses entail loss or modification of function rather than gain of a new function at the molecular level. In Behe's view, this could pose a challenge to Darwinian explanations of molecular evolution.",
