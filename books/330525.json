  "description": "After surviving an ambush in which his lover was killed, cameraman Brendan Leary numbly returns to combat, flying night operations over the mountains of Laos.Leary is later discharged but remains in Thailand. He is ordained as a Buddhist monk and embarks on a pilgrimage through the wastelands of Laos, haunted by what Thais call pii tai hong―the restless, unhappy ghosts of his doomed crewmates.This story of healing and redemption honors three groups missing from accounts of the Vietnam War―the air commandos who risked death flying nightly over the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the active-duty airmen who risked prison by joining the GI antiwar movement, and the people of neutral Laos, whose lives and country were devastated.",
