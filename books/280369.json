  "description": "Quinn has been working on the promotion of her dreams for years. As a project manager, she’s pulled extra hours going above and beyond. Just when it seems like she’s almost there, she nearly has a nervous break-down from the stress. She has to figure out a way to blow off steam, or everything she’s worked for will unravel.  Quinn starts to wonder how her beautiful co-worker Estelle deals with the same work stress and simultaneously keeps it all together. The answer surprises Quinn, and she soon finds herself in the lifestyle of bondage and submission.  As one of Mistress Jade’s subs, she realizes that handing the reins of power over to someone else for a change feels amazing! With each session, Quinn’s iron walls start to crumble. She’s handling work better. She’s entertaining ideas of relationships she would never have thought possible. She’s finally allowing herself to have a good balance between her personal and work life.  Then Quinn is faced with the dilemma of choosing between love and life, or her career. It will be the hardest decision she’s ever had to make, and if she doesn’t choose right, it could cost her everything she’s built up for herself, including her beloved Mistress Jade.  ***This book contains bondage and submission, and intimate scenes between women who identify as bisexual or lesbian.
