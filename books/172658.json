  "description": "George and his little sister, Esme, believe that two aliens are being held prisoner by the military authorities in an underground nuclear bunker. The aliens made contact with George through an internet chat room and claim that they are being subjected to horribly painful experiments. But is this true? Naturally, George is dead-set on rescuing them, but Esme has misgivings. Nevertheless, she goes along with him for fear of being left out of the adventure. The two kids are in for a terrible shock. Things are not what they thought they were and Grandad’s warnings are proved right. They’re in mortal danger and their only hope is that Remiel, the skywhale from Iceland, will save the day. But how can they make contact with him? Skywhales are wild creatures of the air and not like pet dogs that come when you whistle.‘Evil Aliens Stole My Grandad’ is the sequel to ‘The Skywhale’. Over the course of several days, we learn more about the mysterious powers of skywhales and celebrate their long-held secret relationship with humans. It is a cautionary tale that warns kids about the potential danger of meeting strangers they have made contact with in online chat rooms.",
