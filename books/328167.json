  "description": "Can a relationship based on incredibly passionate and raw sexual fulfillment disguise itself as true love? Or is true love just a name given to sexual fulfillment? Such was the question faced by Tom Clifden, a clever street hustler who found himself sexually glued to Hank Carter, a struggling would-be actor in New York City. Their physical and sexual appetites for each other knew no boundaries. Night after night they revelled in passionate and uninhibited sexual episodes. But the question comes up much later. Tom is 53 years old and (without Hank) has used his good looks and street smarts to good advantage. He owns a string of bars across the country and is comfortably settled in Key West. His quietude ends abruptly when a letter arrives from Eunice, a woman who 25 years earlier was Hank's first love-and the woman whom Hank had abandoned for Tom's unbelievable sexual powers and pleasures. \"Hank is dead.\" The letter was short and to the point. More letters follow and more are exchanged. The correspondence evolves into a steamy, explicit tale about Hank's true character and identity-a Hank that for so many long years Tom had not even known. This is the story of two handsome young men who try to build a relationship during the sexually explosive and carefree years of the late 60s. The tale of their love unfolds, revealing the challenges of the ever-growing temptations of INFIDELITY.",
