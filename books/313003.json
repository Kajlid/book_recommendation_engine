  "description": "\"This romantic tragedy in graphic novel and musical form was created by one of the worldÆs most renowned DJs, Kid Koala. Inspired as much by silent films as by comic books, this unique blend of stirring images and music tells the story of an untalented robot who tries to woo a workaholic girl with his love songs. Adventure, action, drama, and romance are combined in beautifully shaded illustrations. Included is an original CD soundtrack, which acts as a ôfilm score,ö with 10 exclusive tracks composed and performed by Kid Koala. This delightfully eccentric concept is sure to appeal to Kid Koala fans, comic-book fans, and music lovers.\"",
