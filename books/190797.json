  "description": "Book #1 in The Unexpected Love Series but each book can be read as a standalone. Recommended for ages 18 and up.  I am finally free.  This is my chance for a fresh start. My chance to live the way I want to. Boston is my destination.  Just when I think things are going to get better from here, I meet him.  Malcolm Davis.  He is the image of masculinity, with rough edges I would love to soften. Although I wonder what it would be like to be with a man like him, I know it would never work. But, I do know two things, ever since I met him, I’m happy and he makes me feel safe. Both of those things lured me into taking a chance. I mean what’s life without taking any chances? It’s not much of a life without the risk of getting your heart broken.  I imagine that for Malcolm Davis, falling in love with someone would be akin to a hurricane; anything that stands in the path of what he wants; gets demolished.  Well, I guess my theory will be put to the test.",
