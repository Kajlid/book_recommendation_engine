  "title": "Yes, We Can Meme: A Progressive-Left Playbook for Winning the Internet Meme Culture War",
  "description": "A Left Wing guide on how to defeat troublesome trolls and 'memelords' who stand against everything progressive. This book will show you how to fight fire with fire and defeat 'Kekistan' once and for all. This is a lesson in 'meming' for all right minded thinkers. No longer will we have to listen to mockery about how weak our memes are.This book is satirical and is meant as a joke. There are eight words on the first page, a fake quote on the last and a bunch of 'keks' in between. It is intended as a gift for humourless, regressive leftists from sensible people who understand internet culture on even the most basic level.",
