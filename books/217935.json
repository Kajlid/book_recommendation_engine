Your child doesn't have to become a statistic. Your child can become an adult who loves the Lord the same way you do but this will likely require a radical parenting reset on your part.Todd Friel has witnessed to hundreds of university students, most of whom are Bible-belt backsliders. Reset for Parents gets to the heart of the issue and presents a solid, biblical roadmap for parents to avoid the pain and heartache of raising a prodigal.",
