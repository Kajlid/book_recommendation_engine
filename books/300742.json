  "description": "I can't believe I'm in the wrong body—again! Apparently, this freaky phenomenon of stepping into someone's life—and their body—has a Temp Lifer. And when my dead grandmother heaped on the praise for a job well done last time, I sort of let it happen again. (Grrr... thanks, Grammy.) So now I'm hungover and gazing in the mirror at . . . my boyfriend's older sister, who is getting ready to go wild on spring break—while being pursued by a psycho stalker and a Dark Lifer. Help! From the author ofTHE SEERseriesPraise for the Dead Girl series \"Amber is truly a teen heroine readers will identify with, who brings new meaning to the word ‘dead.' A must-have for fans of the supernatural and the occult.\" —School Library Journal",
