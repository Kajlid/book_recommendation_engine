  "description": "Haruka Kotoura has a secret: she can read minds. She sees her ability as a curse rather than a gift, and has built a wall around her heart. Kotoura's lonely school life is turned upside down when she meets Manabe, first class pervert with a heart of gold (?), and the members of the school's ESP Research Club--all of whom are beyond thrilled to know a psychic. But will the rest of their classmates be so willing to accept her? And will Kotoura herself ever be able to open up her heart again?",
