  "description": "Costumed crimefighter Empowered is briefly overjoyed to find herself in the running for one of the superhero community's annual Caped Justice Awards (or \"Capeys\") - only to discover that her nomination was merely a cruel joke by her obnoxious superpeers. But when the masked masses face a cataclysmic reckoning for such previous heartless hoaxes, can our perpetually struggling heroine overcome her resentment and save the day? And can she cope with the further problems posed by crossdressing vigilantes, dying wishes from preteen wannabe supervillains, telepathic \"booty calls,\" a deeply depressed ninja, bedroom \"cosplay\" conflicts with her boyfriend, and even . . . Hummer? fu? Each volume comes shrinkwrapped with an 18+ advisory sticker.",
