  "description": "Victoria Ballard, a New York financial executive, is one woman who considers men to be an unnecessary bother and annoyance. With her career on track, she focuses on the adoption of four beautiful orphans, a crowning completion of her well-designed life-plan. But, life is a nasty trickster, and it's about to spring one on her. Unknown to Victoria, PRINCE RASHID DAVAR has just completed a marriage contract with her father. However, what the Prince does not realize is that it is easier to marry a woman than it is to control one. She may be his wife, but it will take a kidnapping, a battle of wills, and some desert heat of his own before he can claim her love.",
