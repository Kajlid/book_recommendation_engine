Trying against all odds that he will find a way to clear his name and thereby lift his sentence. Then he sees Hope and realizes he has an opportunity to correct a mistake he made years ago by letting her walk away. He would follow her anywhere even if it means leaving the protection of the only home he has known for centuries. However in order to be with her, this woman who has occupied his every waking thought and dreams, he will have put her directly into the cross hairs of his tribe eliminating not only himself but Hope as well. Can they survive the secret the tribe will kill to protect?",
