  "title": "Celtic Devotional: Daily Prayers and Blessings",
  "description": "Mirroring the ancient formulaic prayers to the elements found in the Celtic tradition, along with the wondrous invocations and declarations of the bards of the Scottish, Irish and Welsh traditions, Celtic Devotional provides a mystical doorway through which the modern person can re-invest their life with meaning within the twilight times of dusk and dawn.Celtic spirituality emphasizes the appreciation of nature and all forms of life -- a popular and universally appealing philosophy that, along with other related pagan traditions, is having a renaissance. Beautifully illustrated and designed, this book will appeal to readers searching for ways to practice spirituality, offering blessings, prayers and devotions.",
