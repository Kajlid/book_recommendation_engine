  "description": "Besmium has been reduced to rubble, and sinister Camelot reigns supreme. Abandoned by Minseo, brother of the fallen king, widowed Charlotte's path is perilous. New to life beyond her walls, she's forced to face the winter and motherhood alone, while being hunted by a soldier whose life's goal depends on her capture. When whispers reach Minseo that Queen Charlotte survived, he decides to leave his drunken shame behind and seek his lost love. He knows finding her won't be terribly difficult but protecting both her and daughter Morgana is a different errand—one requiring more than time's power to heal. Beyond the landscape of lies and treachery, Charlotte will need to navigate her feelings wisely. Can Minseo be trusted with the ultimate secret? Wherever young Morgana goes, a trail of ash is left behind, in consequence of something sought by sorcerers and mortal fiends...united, closing in. Two fates present in seeking redemption: win her love or lose his soul. One must emerge.",
