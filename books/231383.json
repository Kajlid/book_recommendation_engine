  "description": "What’s weirder than planning a wedding for a man without a fiance? Agreeing to be his fiance.Right when I need a bank-sized bailout, Benton Spencer strides into my life – hiring me to plan a wedding that lacks a bride. He’s handsome. He’s ripped. He’s occasionally charming (but mostly not). More importantly, he’s offering me every penny I need…if I’ll marry him. Two years of putting up with his partying, chauvinistic, rich boy ways and my money problems are solved. If that’s not weird enough for you, get this: I’m actually starting to fall for him. God help me, those pale blue eyes have got me cornered. I know I can make it for two years; but I can’t say the same for my heart.",
