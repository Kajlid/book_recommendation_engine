When her parents decided to move to Alaska in the summer of 1952 they left many comforts behind, as well as their extended family and a cherished doll.There were adventures ahead, and many new and wonderful things to learn and explore. Living without the luxuries of California, the family relied on hard work to make it in Alaska.They hauled water and ice for washing,cooking and drinking. They shared the hard work of a commercial fishing boat and enjoyed the animals and natural surroundings, including a squirrel who visited through a trap door and kittens that could swim.",
