  "description": "Heroes, Like Swords, Are Forged In Blood! From the steaming jungles of Southeast Asia, to the neon-lit streets of Miami, SUPER NINJA is a saga fifty years in the making, yet, its roots reach back billions of years. This first volume, THE SWORD OF HEAVEN, fuses the lives of two young boys with boundless imaginations, a heroic Vietnam vet lost in his pain, a beautiful thief searching for meaning with her skills, and the quest for a mystical sword forged from the stars that binds them all.A race against time unfolds in a bloody tapestry woven with a master ninja assassin; a genius billionaire determined to redeem his family’s honor; the psychopath who controls the seedy Miami underworld with a iron fist; a relentless detective trying to keep his city from exploding; and the birth of an AI entity that seeks to make itself a god.Part fantasy, part speculative science-fiction, Award-Winning Writer/Director Kely McClung’s SUPER NINJA is an electrifying origin-story that defies convention with a heart-stopping blend of action, emotion, the exploration of faith, and what it means to truly be a hero.Experience the Adventure Today!",
