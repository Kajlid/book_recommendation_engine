  "description": "\"The Elements of Moral Philosophy\", 2/e, offers an introduction to the major philosophical theories of morality, explaining why each theory has been accepted by some thinkers but rejected by others. To illustrate the theories, and to reveal their implications, important issues such as abortion, euthanasia, the treatment of non-human animals and famine relief are discussed in depth. With the second edition comes a new chapter on virtue ethics, a section on the Prisoner's Dilemma in the chapter on social contrast theory, and an updated case study on Baby Jane Doe.",
