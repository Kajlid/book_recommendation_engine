  "description": "Beware: this very short erotic story is graphic and may be confronting - it is fantasy only and the author does not condone the actions described herein.Charlotte wakes up one night and is unable to get back to sleep. She tosses and turns until she thinks of a favorite sexual fantasy...maybe a good orgasm will help her sleep? When she is interrupted by a loud noise from the living room she immediately thinks it's an intruder and goes to investigate. Who (and what) she finds waiting for her on the living room sofa and the feelings unleashed in her will make any sexual fantasy she ever had pale into insignificance.In the second short story of his Sleep Sex Tales series, Robert Bedstock gives us a refreshing twist on the sleep sex fantasy and shows that women aren't always victims.For Adults Only: This erotic short story (approx 3500 words) contains hot, hardcore and forced sex. All characters are represented as 18 or older.",
