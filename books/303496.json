  "description": "All hail the assassin queen.Becoming the depraved king’s consort was never the plan–neither was being tossed in the turbulent waters of the Crown’s court–but Tempest was trained to roll with the punches. Even if it means getting her hands dirty and betraying what her heart wants the most.But being the king’s betrothed is no protection. One wrong move, she finds herself in more danger than she ever imagined. Surrounded by too many corrupt enemies and not sure whom to trust, Tempest turns to the only person who is more devious than Destin – the Jester.With war looming on the horizon, Tempest is thrust into his seductive Dark Court once. The time for indecision is over. She must set aside her prejudice and pick a side before the king destroys all that she holds dear – including her wily kitsune.Falling for the enemy is always dangerous. But living without your mate is even worse.",
