  "description": "Amanda is a beautiful young witch who moves to the small town of Ferrisberg hoping to finish out her high school life in peace and maybe make a few new friends, but wherever she goes, trouble follows. A coven of vampires has come to the town, in search of an ancient treasure, the Amber Heart. They're dangerous and aggressive, and a classmate of hers, Sam Greg, is drawn into the conflict. Together can they discover the vampire's secret, and save the world along with her heart?Or that's about how Amanda thinks of it, but Sam Greg don't give a redacted. Vampires, werewolves and witches oh my, they all respond about the same to having their heads bashed in. He's a questioning young man, and he's not gonna take being a side character lying down.Why should Amanda get to be the narrator when he's so much wittier? If she fancies herself in love with him, why not go along as far as it suits him? If a vampire tries to capture him, why shouldn't he lock her in the basment? If a werewolf bites him, why should he turn into one? Why should any of it be the way it's supposed to be when he could make it all so much better? Caught in the crossfire between hungry vampires, duplicitous witches, and rabid werewolves, Sam clings to one simple truth; ambition is a virtue, and he is a virtuous young man.",
