Dashing Philippe de Beauvois took Jillian Blake's breath away from that first moment when she met him down by the sandy edge of the water. Has she fallen in love with a madman? Philippe claimed to be one of Jean Lafitte's captains preparing for the battle of New Orleans. In Jillian's world it is 1942 and her whole community fears the presence of enemy submarines in the nearby Gulf of Mexico. Sent on a whirlwind through time, the lovers fight to survive and stay together through the chaos caused by a scientific experiment gone wrong.",
