  "description": "Dragons aren't real, or at least that's what Yukio thought until she met one who placed an enchanted bracelet on her that could only be removed in another world, Kineta. The dragon dropped Yukio off outside the gates of Lumene, a city of smiles and lies. She is forced to lie about her identity since no one believes her when she says she's never heard of Kineta. During her stay in the city, she finds herself learning secrets about the Prince of Lumene who is trying to reclaim his throne from the usurper, the Leader of the Lumenian Faction. The usurper so happens to be the only person in the city Yukio feels comfortable with to tell the truth and maybe even love. She is told that her arrival marks the return of the Esau, the great beasts of Lumene that were banished in the empire. Everyone expects her to do something great. How does skin turning into scales sound? Yukio is changing into something she's not sure of what she will become. She needs to take the bracelet off, but if she slips into the middle of the night, will she start a war within the city walls?",
