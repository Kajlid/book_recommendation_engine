  "description": "There WILL be a royal wedding. The only question--who will be my groom?An arranged marriage isn’t the worst fate for a princess like me. Especially because I’ve been in love with my intended groom since we were children.But when my prince shows up with an American girlfriend instead of an engagement ring, all arrangements are off.The clock is nearing midnight--I won’t turn into a pumpkin, but if I’m not wed by summer’s end, I’ll forfeit my kingdom.Just your typical royal dilemma.Out of sheer desperation, I make a deal with a devilish duke. Rafe de Silva is the prince’s rival and has a plan so ridiculous it just might work.One moment, Rafe seems to relish making the prince jealous.And the next… he’s making me question everything with his words, his touch, and his ability to melt my Ice Princess persona.I’m not always given the luxury of choice, but now I have a huge one to make. I only hope I don't lose my crown, my heart, or myself in the process…Royally Rearranged is a sizzling, swoony, closed-door romantic comedy.",
