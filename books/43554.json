Maybe sparks are all you’re ever going to make.”He snarled, “Or maybe you just need to be a better teacher and give me more.” Before I could reply, he grabbed my hand, twisted and pulled me into a restraining lock. Body pressed against my back, he held me in a chokehold. I struggled. Kicked. Fought. Pain knifed me as I tried to free myself. He spoke and his breath was hot in my ear. “Now, fire goddess let’s see if I can make more than sparks.” Rising panic choked me, with it came rage. And with rage, came fire. Keahi felt it. He laughed as I strained against him.
