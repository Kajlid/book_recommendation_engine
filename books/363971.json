  "title": "John Randolph of Roanoke",
  "description": "John Randolph of Roanoke is unique in American political history. For most of his public career Randolph was a leader of the opposition—to both Jeffersonians and Federalists. Only twenty-six when first elected to Congress in 1799, he readily became the most forceful figure at the Capitol. For most of his public career Randolph was a leader of the opposition—to both Jeffersonians and Federalists. He was, writes Russell Kirk, “devoted to state rights, the agricultural interest, economy in government, and freedom from foreign entanglements.” Above all things Randolph cherished liberty, and he famously declared, “I love liberty; I hate equality.” Russell Kirk (1918–1994) was the author of some thirty books, including The Conservative Mind , and was one of the seminal political thinkers of the twentieth century.",
