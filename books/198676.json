  "description": "A fun, flirty crossover novel from bestselling authors Jennifer Bernard (the Love Between the Bases series) and Erin Nicholas (the Sapphire Falls series)  Caitlyn Murray has never let on that she's had fantasies about her brother's friend Eli Anderson for years. She'd do anything for the sexy, baseball star who's given it all up to stay in Sapphire Falls and take care of his family, but she and Eli are friends. Just friends.  So when her brother hatches a plan to get Eli to the pro baseball try-out for the Kilby Catfish that he has dreamed of and deserves, Caitlyn is all in. After all, what's a little kidnapping among friends?  A spot on the pitcher's mound for the Catfish isn't the only tempting thing about the spontaneous road trip. Eli already knows that Caitlyn is as sweet as the candies she makes for the Sapphire Falls bakery, but alone with her overnight in the tiny motel room in Kansas, it's impossible to resist the urge to take a little taste.  But when that taste leads to falling for the girl next door just as his front door is moving hundreds of miles away, can Eli really have it all? Or do they have too many strikes against them?",
