  "description": "The name's Drood. Eddie Drood. Of the great and powerful Droods - the clan that's been watching mankind's back since we all first dropped out of trees - the group of hard-fighting, devilishly handsome arse kickers who take on the monsters of the world so you lot can go about your happy lives.During World War II, the Droods made a pact with some nasty buggers from another dimension. We needed the Loathly Ones to fight some other nasty buggers the Nazis were using. But once the war was over, they decided that they liked this world to much to leave. We Droods are the only thing standing between them and you. Unfortunately, I'm not keen on trusting some of my own kin - and if I choose the wrong horse to back, everything we know is going bye-bye.",
