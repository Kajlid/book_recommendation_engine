  "description": "1928. The book begins: Between the town of Innsbruck and the Monastery of Wilten a large open piece of level ground was covered with tents and flagpoles; wooden galleries had been erected, and a kind of arena staked out for jousting and other chivalrous sports. There was accommodation for thousands of spectators and all was ready for their comfort and amusement. But these tents had covered the level fields of Wilten for nearly two years, waiting for the great and magnificent wedding-feast which Heinrich, Duke of Carinthia, Count of Tyrol, and King of Bohemia wished to celebrate. The brothers of the Monastery saw to it that the wind did not damage the tents, that the tilting-ground was not overgrown, and that the galleries did not fall to pieces. But still the festival was postponed; the second matrimonial project seemed to be as great a failure as the first. The citizens of Innsbruck and the monks of Wilten sniggered; the mountains looked down with indifference. The housewives of Innsbruck strolled down the fine gay canvas alleys, their children played tag over the benches, and lovers used the tents as convenient hiding-places.",
