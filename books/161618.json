But when her boyfriend bails on their romantic trip for two, she finds herself stranded in the city on Christmas Eve, with only a holiday-hating smooth-talking, utterly sexy stranger for company…  Rock-star Austin Kelly is fed up with Christmas – he’s more interested in who’s going to be cozying up under the mistletoe. But when his little black book comes up empty, he finds himself on a whirlwind tour of the city with the most unlikely partner in festive fun…  The snow is falling, but things are definitely heating up inside. And by the time the clock strikes midnight on New Year’s Eve, there will be plenty to celebrate with old friends and familiar faces back in Beachwood Bay.",
