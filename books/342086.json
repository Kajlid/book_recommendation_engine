  "description": "Briony Stevens and Christopher Clayton had fallen immediately and wildly in love --- but it was not all as simple as that, and Christopher's forceful brother Daniel soon put a stop to it. Christopher, it appeared, was morally bound elsewhere --- and in her unhappiness Briony agreed to Daniel's suggestion that she marry him instead.It was to be merely a marriage of convenience, to suit Daniel's ambition and Briony's financial needs. Would her career as a dancer be enough to make up for the complete lack of love in her life? Especially when Daniel's old love Deidre Morrison, came on the scene again to ensure that there was no chance now of Briony's marriage succeeding.",
