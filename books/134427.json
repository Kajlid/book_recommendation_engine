  "description": "[284 Pages in Printed Book]Winner of the Bram Stoker Award for Best First Novel from the Horror Writers Association!Exclusive Introduction for The Overlook Connection Press edition by Lucy Taylor.\"Lucy Taylor's The Safety of Unknown Cities is one of the most impressive debut novels centered around relationship-driven fiction catalyzed by horrific events mostly realistic, sometimes supernatural. The Safety of Unknown Cities is very much a supernatural horror novel. Indeed its sexual, its graphically written, but its also an affecting and powerful novel about heartbreak and the untimely destruction of childhood. If reading the book strikes familiar chords, the resonances might be with either Clive Barker for an unflinching approach to highly charged subject matter, or with Poppy Z. Brite for sheer candor...an adventurous novel of a quality that absolutely demands an audience.\" -- Edward Bryant, Locus Magazine",
