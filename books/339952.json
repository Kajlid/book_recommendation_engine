  "title": "The Woman Who Would Be Pharaoh",
  "description": "Ranging from the flood plains of the Nile to the snow-covered passes of the Taurus Mountains, this historical novel is set in the tumultuous period of the waning 18th Egyptian Dynasty, and follows Ankhesenamun, the newly widowed wife of the murdered Tutankhamun. She rules over a court rife with intrigues, assassins and daring sexual liaisons. Facing a forced marriage to her own grandfather—who covets the throne for himself—Ankhesenamun desperately turns to her dear friend, the warrior and scholar Menkhara, for help. She sends him on an impossible mission to the land of the Hittites, and the court of the most feared ruler of the ancient world. His task is to bring one of the sons of this sworn enemy of Egypt to be Ankhesenamun's husband, thus saving her throne. This saga is at once a portrait of a remarkable queen willing to embrace in marriage her country’s ancient foe to save her crown, and a heartbreaking love story that weaves history, mystery, regicide, incest and a terrifying conclusion into a compelling tale.",
