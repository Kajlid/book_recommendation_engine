  "description": "The great king Red Dynan has been slain in battle, leaving two of his blood to dispute the future of his leaderless realm: a ruthless illegitimate son determined to wear the crown—and Anghara Kir Hama, the rightful queen…a nine-year-old-girl.The life Anghara knows has ended; everyone she loved is dead or doomed. And now she must flee far from her home or die at the hands of her half-brother Sif. A defenseless child is adrift in an unfamiliar world, pursued by the minions of a false king whose brutality knows no bounds. But Anghara has a great destiny that reaches beyond the borders of the troubled realm she must one day rule—and a miraculous gift to be awakened in secret and fortified in a distant desert land at once beautiful, mysterious, and perilous: an awesome and frightening power called Sight.",
