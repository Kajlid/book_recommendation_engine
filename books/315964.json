  "description": "BEYOND DESIRE is a thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, disarmed by self-discovery and loss of innocence. It's about the choices you have to make with the flow of fate. It's about the darkness that all of us have but keep under control. It's about dreams and the questions we ask ourselves, the answers we seek deep in the night but forget as soon as we awake. Abbas explores a young girl's mind and tells her story in a unique way. He holds your attention while enticing the reader to relax and have fun, trying to figure out who the real villain is.",
