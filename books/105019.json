  "description": "The time is the mid Nineteen-Eighties. In a foolish hope of silencing The Scream, he had turned to the whisky bottle and a never-ending supply of cannabis. His efforts to stifle The Scream, and dispel the pain that he felt, served only to postpone its hideous call until the ‘morrow. After a time, he cared for little more than the next joint or the next drink, as he searched for an oblivion that never came. He little knew that The Scream was not his alone, for it has pervaded the history of all Mankind. He little knew that The Scream is the very keystone of our life. There is no pleasure without its pain. There can be no hope without its despair. Great or small, we all carry The Scream within us. Its intensity shapes our persona. It defines our fate. Our one ambition is to diminish its voice. Only the truly saintly, the truly evil or the foolish are deaf to its call. Here is an oft-times hilarious account of one man’s journey through a world of drug taking, drug trafficking and violence. It tells of the descent into drug-fuelled apathy by one careless of an inevitable fate, all thought of caution drowned and deafened by The Scream.",
