  "description": "The warding has failed, and a powerful ancient magic is disturbed -- the Everoot. Thealos Quickfellow, a Shae from the kingdom of Avisahn, has left his homeland to learn first hand of the threat of the Bandit Rebellion. His life is forever changed when he meets the mysterious Sleepwalker known as Jaerod. For Thealos himself is one of the keys that can open a door to a Silvan artifact which can tame the forbidden side of the Everoot. As the valley of the kingdoms of Dos-Aralon and Avisahn grows weaker and weaker, the cruel Bandit Rebellion prepares to claim a stronghold in the south. There they will launch a new war by using the Everoot and its power to heal or destroy. Thealos and Jaerod must defy the powers of men, Shae, and other foes to reach the place where the conflict will begin - and where the dangerous Everoot is being harvested. A fortress called Landmoor.",
