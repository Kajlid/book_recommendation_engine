  "description": "Midlife is definitely a journey. The road has massive potholes.And the crisis… it’s the gift that keeps on giving. Being forty is supposed to be freaking fabulous not fatal. Taking on a daunting new job minus the description isn’t the smartest move I’ve ever made, even if it was to save a friend. Hopefully, it doesn’t turn out to be the stupidest… or deadliest. Why can’t things stay the way they were? I love my old job. Supergluing ghosts back together and solving their issues is its own reward. Not to mention, I’m seriously good at it. Although, I must say, I’m ridiculously excited for the new Death Counselor’s arrival in nine months... Adding to my problems, there are four new angels in town who are riding my butt and judging every move I make. Literally. Who knew destroying one Immortal could cause me so much trouble? If I’m found guilty, I’ll be pushing up daisies. Luckily, my nutty friends have my back and the Grim Reaper has my heart. What could possibly go wrong? Nothing is impossible. I am living proof. Let’s just hope I live to prove it.",
