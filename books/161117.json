  "description": "Corporate analyst, Ivy Bishop, intends spending Christmas holed up in an isolated Montana ranch house with only an abandoned puppy for company. When the festive season ends her broken heart might just have had just enough time to heal.  Ex-rodeo rider, Rhett Dixon, has put his playing days behind him. He has something to prove. Despite being the first son in three generations of ranchers, he is determined to succeed in ranching on his own merits.  But when Rhett’s new neighbor proves to be far-too-pretty and far-too-compassionate, his single-minded focus deserts him. And the more time Ivy spends with the workaholic, blue-eyed cowboy next door the more she realizes her heart isn’t actually broken – yet.  Montana Born Christmas Book 1: Blame the Mistletoe by Dani Collins Book 2: Mistletoe Wedding by Melissa McClone Book 3: Her Mistletoe Cowboy by Alissa Callen Book 4: Cowboy, It's Cold Outside by Katherine Garbera",
