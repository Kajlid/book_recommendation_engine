  "description": "Demons are real.They say never enter into a deal with them, but what if I had no choice?What if they are three of the most gorgeous men I’ve seen my entire life?And what if my lesson to learn here is that no matter how attracted I am to them, how much I yearn to kiss them, I’m in danger.But my life’s never been the easiest. I’ve bounced from house to house, living in foster care, with no true place to call home. And there’s an ancient darkness that follows me around where I go.They may be demons, but I’m no angel, and this darkness craves the Hell they give.Or maybe I’ve just been damned from the start.",
