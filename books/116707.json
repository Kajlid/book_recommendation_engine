  "description": "Sunset in Sylvan Park is a story that takes place in an actual community in West Nashville, Tennessee. The street names are real, the locations are real, but the characters are not.Upon graduating from college, the main character, whose name remains a mystery because the story is told in first person, ventures to the city of Nashville to write a novel.Struggling to find his “writer's voice,” the main character spends half his time touring the city with his neighbor Hollis, an alcoholic songwriter who is seldom in any shape to drive himself, and the other half with Casey, a college student who lives in the neighborhood.",
