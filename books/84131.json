  "description": "From the author:\n \nI've had several inquiries on my website about Lightning Bay because Amazon incorrectly shows it is as published on Sept 1 but as \"Out of print / limited quantities\". It is definitely limited quantities since I haven't written it. Hehe. In its place, I wrote Joe Travis' story, Brown-Eyed Girl, which will be published by St. Martin's Press early next year. I do appreciate the interest in Lightning Bay, but for now I'm busy writing a 4 book historical series for Avon. I love that people are wanting another Friday Harbor book, but right now I can't say when or if there will ever be one, but I never (or rarely) say \"never.\" Thanks so very much!\nAfter the turmoil of a broken engagement, all Neva Landry wants is to make a success of her Friday Harbor alpaca farm. But when her ex-fiance Zachary Logan is injured in a lightning strike, she offers to take care of him while he recuperates. Soon Neva discovers that Zach has become an enigmatic stranger who now poses a greater threat to her heart than ever before. Is Zach really the same man, or is there somehow a chance that he could be an angel in disguise?",
