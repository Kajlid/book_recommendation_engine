She promised to Mounika that she would see not only that her parents be together all the time but they love and like each other always and the three of them spend a happy future forever. To keep her promise, what Jasmine did, what difficulties she faced whether she became successful or not is the main theme of this novel ‘Rose Garden’. But this ‘Rose Garden’ is not just that.
