Isolated and wounded, he crawls to safety, managing to survive the frigid nights in the wild. Foraging for supplies, he discovers an unusual horse, who he names Dirt and a mule named Red. Saving a local Reverend and his wife in a chance encounter, the man slowly becomes a local legend, offering medical assistance, as well as brute-force solutions to the problems caused by bushwhackers and scalawags. Join \"Dr. McCollum Self\" as he fights murderers, rapists, and his own demons, in a desperate quest to survive a country torn in two and discover who he really is.",
