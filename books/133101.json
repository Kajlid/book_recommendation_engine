  "description": "In the tumultuous world of ancient Israel, Ahinoam--a fierce and unconventional Kenite woman--flees her family farm with her dagger-wielding father to join the ragtag band of misfits led by the shepherd-turned-warrior David ben Jesse. As King Saul's treasonous accusations echo through the land, Ahinoam's conviction that David's anointing makes him Yahweh's chosen king propels her on a perilous journey to Moab, only to encounter hardship and betrayal. Amid the unforgiving Judean wilderness, Ahinoam forges an unexpected bond with David's sister, Zeruiah. Through her Kenite metalworking heritage, Ahinoam gains respect among David's army, and the soldiers' wives offer friendship. However, scarred by painful past relationships, Ahinoam isolates to avoid new friendships and refuses to acknowledge her growing feelings for the renegade king. As Ahinoam's heart grapples for footing, King Saul's army closes in, and Ahinoam must confront the true meaning of love, loyalty, and courage. Is she brave enough to love Israel's next king?Bestselling author Mesu Andrews presents a gripping biblical-era series, weaving a narrative of resilience and the transformative power of faith.",
