  "description": "Jeollanam Province was a sleepy little corner of South Korea where the foreign English teachers mostly partied, traveled, and dreamed of home. Felix and Jolie are young and in love, but they just began the longest night of their lives. Soon they're on the run from a shambling horde that traps them in the foreigner's bar for the night. But who or what are the infected up to, and why would they want to eat the living? Meanwhile, a film-maker and anthropologist is holed up with a small contingent of the United States Army. He's been examining artifacts for a documentary, and it turns out that he unwittingly may have unleashed a terror from beyond our limits of knowledge. Safehouses, abandoned churches, army outposts with mad commanders â€“ who will survive the terror of The MZD, and what awaits on the other side of the madness?Combining traditional zombie terror with international settings and supernatural horror, The MZD is something new in the sea of zombie books. Sometimes dark, sometimes hilarious, always entertaining, with a climax you probably won't see coming, The MZD may be the find of your year.",
