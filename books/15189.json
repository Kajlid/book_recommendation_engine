  "description": "Lacey never thought working at Slice by Slice would be anything more than a stepping stone on the road out of town. Instead, it tests bonds of friendship she thought were indestructible and thrusts her into two relationships: one with Max, the resident bad boy and one with Brian, the ex-football star. Neither are what they seem, but both change her irrevocably.",
