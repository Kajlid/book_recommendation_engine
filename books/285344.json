Out of time and options, I make a devil's bargain with the Phoenix group that ensures my family will be provided for once I'm gone. So, I pack up what’s left of my life and sign it over to them. I have a month left to live, 43200 fleeting minutes. Yet, it’s long enough for everything to change. Long enough to dream big, to love hard, and inexplicably begin to heal. But the thing about a devil's bargain is that there is inevitably a price to pay. Always one step ahead, The Phoenix group observe, test, and wait for someone special to come along. Someone like me. Now, to avoid spending the rest of my life in a cage, The girl who was once ready to die will burn the world to ashes for a chance to live.",
