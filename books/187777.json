  "description": "Thanan, the youngest prince of Panajin, was all too happy wielding his wooden sword against imaginary foe and running innocently down the cobblestone streets of his beloved capital, but even in a world of unsurpassed goodness and beauty, darkness had crept in. Thanan is destined to be a great politician and leader like his older brothers, but balancing a busy schedule of unauthorized excursions, the responsibility of school and being a young emissary proves difficult for the prince when he unwittingly stumbles upon a dark plot to overthrow his family’s kingdom and destroy everything he holds most dear. Far too young and unequipped to handle such things, and not knowing if the threat is real or just his youthful imagination run amok, Thanan takes it upon himself, with the help of a new found friend, Jesifaye, to subvert the evil plot and he himself becomes the target of the one they call “Master.” Sensing a great power welling inside Thanan, the Master uses all the subtlety of lies and treachery to seduce the young prince to use his power for darkness and thus join forces and overthrow the kingdom and take it for himself. The struggle between light and darkness has never been more compelling.  The temptation is great...and the adventure even greater. Enter the life of Thanan of Jin. This is only the beginning.",
