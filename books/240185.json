  "description": "I knew falling for him was wrong. I did it anyway, his half smiles and blue eyes pulling me deeper. Blue eyes that made me soar. He wasn’t mine to keep, though. And like all good and rare things, it came to an end. Then he strolls into my life, armed with dimples and gray eyes. Gray eyes that ground me. He smashes through my defenses, stealing what is left of my heart. Now my heart is a war zone, past and present battling for my forever. They say lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice. I call bullshit on that theory..",
