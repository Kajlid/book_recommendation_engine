And her brother, Soren Vidar, fights to free the worlds from his oppression.Escorted by her brother’s oldest friend, Jakob Väsen, Erin is welcomed into the home of the fiercest warriors in Soren’s rebellion. There, she joins the males in their crusade to rid their lives of the tyranny that they have long been accustomed to, and in turn, they vow to keep her from becoming yet another weapon in her father’s never-ending arsenal of magic wielders.With an increasingly desperate need to avenge her father’s wicked deeds, and an overwhelming attraction to Jakob, Erin soon finds herself immersed in a destiny unlike anything she could have ever imagined.
