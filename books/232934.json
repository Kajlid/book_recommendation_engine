  "description": "Jackson was off limits.  He was the mysterious stranger that my fiancé had invited to live with us only three months before our wedding. From the moment I tried to (accidentally) kill him, I knew I was in big trouble.  Just because his very presence aroused terrifying emotions within me, did not mean anything. I was engaged to get married. I was well on my way to being a happy wife and living a happy life.  Did I think that things would get out of hand? Absolutely not. It was just a little crush. Anyone would crush on that man. It was my own little secret that I kept hidden from everyone.  A harmless little crush never hurt anyone....right?",
