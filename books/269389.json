  "description": "Lola’s seventeenth birthday party was a complete fail.She lost her boyfriend and her best friend at once, and became a target for terrible gossips. Not knowing how to deal with all that, she simply wished to disappear. However, Lola couldn’t even imagine that her wish would be so quickly fulfilled. The next day at school, it turned out that no one could hear and see her anymore—she became invisible to others.So now she can listen to other people’s conversations, and read their smartphone messages, and attend parties uninvited, and do everything she likes not worrying what others may think of her, because no one notices her … or almost no one, except for one guy who has disappeared just like her and says that they were both transferred from reality to the strange place he calls ‘Limbo’, but he promises to help her return.However, is it worth believing him? He obviously has secrets he isn’t about to share, and Limbo has some dark secrets too, the main of which is if it’s possible to return at all. Being here isn’t so safe as Lola thought in the beginning. And the longer she is absent from the real world the faster others forget her. What will happen when she gets completely forgotten?",
