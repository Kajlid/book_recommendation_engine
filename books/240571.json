  "description": "The werewolf apocalypse begins ... When a wave of vicious attacks sweeps across London, there are reports of a Beast on the loose. There are fears of a Ripper stalking the streets. But the truth is more terrifying than anyone wants to admit. Werewolves are prowling the city. Hunting and killing. Lycanthropy, a disease as old as humanity, now threatens to destroy civilization. With no cure, no vaccine, and millions of potential victims, it's spreading through the capital at exponential rates. And every werewolf bite has just two possible outcomes – death or infection. Only a tiny number of people have the insight to realize what is happening. But what will a young police woman, a group of teenagers and a computer nerd have to sacrifice in order to survive? The werewolf apocalypse is here. And it's only just beginning … WOLF BLOOD is the first in the LYCANTHROPIC post-apocalyptic werewolf series. If you enjoy the zombie apocalypse, dystopian science fiction, horror, grimdark, dark fantasy, or multi-protagonist sagas, don't miss out on the next big trend in apocalyptic fiction.",
