  "description": "Nothing could be more horrifying than being stuck in a thrift shop trying on wedding dresses for your mother, except possibly being attacked and nearly abducted by a creature whose eyes flash yellow-green in the dark.Sixteen-year-old Ellie Brown inadvertently stirs up the interest of a secret society of goblins living underneath her small, mining town when she rescues not a wild crow, like she thinks, but the future goblin king.Now, because of her relationship with the bird, the goblin community is out to get her and it doesn’t seem to matter if she’s dead or alive. The only person trying to protect her is a blue-eyed childhood friend named Sky, who, in spite of not having seen him in eleven years, seems unnaturally familiar to Ellie. But it’s his polar opposite brother, one whose intentions aren’t quite as honorable, that threatens to steal her heart.",
