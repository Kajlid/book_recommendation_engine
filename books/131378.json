  "description": "Sometimes destiny is written. Hers was concealed.When Cate travels from Oregon to university in England, she expects her gravest dilemma to be finding coffee instead of tea, but she’s got bigger problems—much bigger. At Staton University, nothing is quite what it seems.Even her own identity.Unbeknownst to Cate, a prophecy deems her as destined to defeat a ruthless enemy in a magical land, placing a target squarely on her back. Now, someone on campus is stalking her, and a narrow escape sends her through a mysterious portal, assisted by two irresistible boys.Yet the fantastical new world is even more treacherous with rival kingdoms and imminent war.Falling in love wasn’t part of the plan, but what’s a girl to do? A fresh start was all she wanted—a few new friends in the dorms with a trusty latte in hand—not war, an estranged biological father who is king, or a star-crossed love straight out of Romeo and Juliet (hopefully without the dying part).As the battle looms, Cate must solve the mystery of the prophecy and decide who in her circle is trustworthy before the place she now calls home is destroyed.<>Don't miss this new Young Adult Romantic Fantasy from debut author SK Horton about first love in a fantastical new world. Featuring swoon-worthy romance, court intrigue, backstabbing villains and so much more, it's perfect for fans of Melissa Albert's The Hazel Wood, Lauren Roberts' Powerless, and lovers of all things romantasy!",
