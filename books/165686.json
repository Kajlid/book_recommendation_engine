  "description": "Ginny Walters always knew her weakness for bad boys would get her into trouble. Her one-night stand with Black Halo’s lead guitarist, Ash Gore, was only supposed to be a fun, not the prelude to the sort of relationship that’d scorch holes in her heart as well as her bed sheets. She’d be the happiest woman in the world if Ash wasn’t so determined to keep their connection off radar. Ash knows girlfriends are bad news for bands, which is why he’s resolved to keep his attachment to Ginny a secret. He and the guys have enough on their stages as they try to piece themselves back together after the band’s split. But when new drummer, Iain Willows, starts taking an active interest in Ginny, tensions quickly mount. Soon, Ash is not only at risk of losing Ginny, but everything he holds dearest, including life itself. All Fired Up is the second book in a trilogy about Ash Gore, set in the world of goth rockers Black Halo. Turn up the volume, grab a cold drink, and climb aboard the Black Halo hard rocking, dirty, sexy, crazy train.",
