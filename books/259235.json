  "description": "When Vincent sold himself to a vampire, he did not expect to become the slave of Maddox Caine. Now struggling to accept the feelings of passion he’s grown toward his master, he’s agreed to follow Maddox into a war he never knew existed. This is what he's been waiting for: to fight, to avenge, and to win. But what happens when another vampire threatens to put Vincent's heart, not just his loyalties, to the test? Emory Hudson was never meant to live past childhood. His uncle managed to save his life at every turn, but now Emory finds himself alone, on the desert, with an enemy claiming to be his ally. They both seek the one thing that can be fatal to a First Born vampire. Paired with this unexpected accomplice, Emory scours the Wastelands in search of the poisonous flower. No matter what the sacrifice, he will kill the Governor of Sanctuary Hope and save his uncle. It's the least he can do. In this depraved and desolate world, can Vincent learn to see that there is more to vampires than an insatiable desire for blood? And will Emory free his uncle before the war divides them forever?",
