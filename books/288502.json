  "description": "Ida and Engen's 13-year-old friendship is altered when the death of their friend comes between them. Engen, guilt-ridden over Janelle's passing, has become violent. Ida, in her grief, attempts to fill the loss with a one-night stand, which leaves her pregnant. As punishment, their parents force them to join a program called Youth of America Help a Nation, and they are sent to Africa on work assignments. Enter Lev Rosen, Ida's irresistible boss at the orphanage where sheâ€™s been appointed. Lev has his own connection with Ida, although she doesn't know it yet. Engen hoped the time away would give him the courage to finally tell Ida his true feelings for her, but how can he do that now that she is getting closer to Lev?",
