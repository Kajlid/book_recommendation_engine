  "title": "Reason with Piety: Garrigou-Lagrange in the Service of Catholic Thought",
  "description": "With his characteristic insight, clarity, and charity, Aidan Nichols surveys the major writings and theological intuitions of his Dominican confrere Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange (1877-1964), to whom we owe a major twentieth-century appropriation of the Thomist commentators. Originally delivered as lectures at Oxford University, the study traces Garrigou's systematic thought, from the Trinity to eschatology. Nichols attends as well to Garrigouâ€™s understanding of the nature of theology, of metaphysics, of mystical theology, and of the relation of all human acts to man's supernatural end. Demolishing the stereotypical portrait of mid-twentieth century controversies, Nichols shows that \"what post-conciliar students can learn from Garrigou is how to 'reason with piety.'\"",
