  "description": "A Science Fiction Adventure. Aggie Kellor of the Abenaki Nation, becomes a host for an entity from another world - a non physical world. It has fused and become part of her. Together they go on a quest to protect the planet from alien and viral invaders. The \"Whisp\" must return to its own world and only this maiden has the knowledge and the power to do it. This story will really get you thinking. DNA contains more than just the blueprint, codes and building blocks of the physical...other things are also inherited. A delightful read for the Sci-Fi and fantasy fan.Warning - This book contains humor, pathos, mystery, scientific content, religious discourse, American First Nation issues, medical procedures, adventure, travel, romance, suspense, Vincent van Gogh and some serious and profound nonsense. All this, from the twisted and convoluted mind of author Tony Lourensen. Don't read this book in front of a mirror or on the lavatory.",
