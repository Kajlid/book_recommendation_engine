  "description": "It's not every day that Willa receives distress calls for sick horses owned by dead people. As one of two veterinarians in the rural area of Washington State, she responds to the summons for two reasons; she's worried for the unknown animal, and sheer curiosity over the alleged revenant. While on this mission, Willa crosses paths with Dax, a rough around the edges U.S. Marshal tasked with caring for her fallen father's farm. Dax is a woman of few words, but Willa can see beyond the silence into the rich soul that she aches to learn more about. Tangled with uncertainty, Willa's desires urge her into Dax's personal space, and what unfolds between the lavender fields brings both women something unexpected.",
