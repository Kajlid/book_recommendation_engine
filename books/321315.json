  "description": "What is Poetry and Why Poetry?Before answering the question why should someone read poetry, we should better understand what the poetry is at first.Poetry is neither saying whatever crosses your mind, nor juxtaposing some fancy words in a line.Poetry is distilling your soul into a meaningful rhyme.And why Poetry?I suppose the best answer for this core question can be given with a poetry itself.Poetry bridges heartsIt is the queen of all artsIt gives you wings to flyfor see everything with a bird's eyePoetry makes you more humanby making you a thinking personSometimes it provides you with new glassesto show you things from different anglesPoetry helps pollination of love among heartsThus, incites thrival of all fine artsEach poem bears at least a condensed storythat would bring you joy, wonder or mysteryPoetry may not do your wallet thickerBut, it does your soul richer, for sure.",
