  "description": "I don't know how this happened One day I'm snug in my loner existence at Carnegie Mansion School, and the next I'm tramping through the Scottish wilderness looking for my dad. Who's been kidnapped. Because of a feud that started in medieval times. Or something. Suffice it to say, I never paid too much attention because I thought the whole thing was some twisted figment of my dad's imagination. Now my only company is a wannabe cop who just might be my superhero dream girl. And if I don't deliver some piece of mysterious \"proof\" to the kidnappers, my dad is toast. I've got my fair share of issues with my dad, but I don't really want to see him burned to a crisp. Anyway, you in? This is not the first time I've been wrong about something.",
