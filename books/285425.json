  "description": "Please Note: It is recommended to read this series in order. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHades\nThey call me Hades for one reason, and one reason only. I’m the one who sovereigns rule around here. I sit on a chair made up of skulls in the depths of Hell, ready to add more to my extravagant throne if they deserve it.My life was filled with nothing but pain until I met her. In a split second I realized the pain has only just begun. Could this woman who captured my soul be the one destined to control Satan himself? She doesn’t know the power she holds over me and I doubt she ever will. We went through a barbarous experience beside one another, somehow coming out the other side of it. My question is this: can she survive the searing flames beside me?Love is agonizing as it is grand. For she will be my queen and I will stand behind her as her king. While I’ve never been certain of much in my life, I’m certain of this - together we’ll conquer everything that stands in our way, or we’ll allow it to consume us both.",
