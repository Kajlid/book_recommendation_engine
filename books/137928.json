  "description": "[Hornsby s] writing is angry, nihilistic, and sad. But it might also be brilliant, and may prove to be the future of angry, nihilistic, and sad literature as we know it. Tom Abrams, author of A Bad Piece of Luck It s the end of the world, 1999, and as millennium celebrations are planned and the heavens are scanned for signs of the Apocalypse, professional nobody Ross Orringer is coming to grips with the fact that at some point, his life has taken a wrong turn. He is twenty-six years old and still attends the same meaningless parties, peddles the same sleazy horror movies with his best friend and business partner, and dates the same two-timing girlfriend while engaging in an affair of his own with one of her closest friends.And then there are the flashes of cameras and glances from strangers lurking around every corner.Ross s paranoia mounts when his friends and family begin acting more and more suspiciously as the New Year approaches. In the last minutes before the clock strikes midnight, Ross realizes that the end may be more ominous than anyone could have decisions have been made, the crews have set up their lights and equipment, and the gray make-up has been applied.Because in the next millennium, time will lose all meaning, and the dead will walk the earth.In Every Sigh, The End, author and self-proclaimed zombie fanatic Jason S. Hornsby has recreated a specific moment in time and turned it on its head. With graceful ease, Hornsby moves between tongue-in-cheek horror, subversive humor, and grisly tragedy, all at a breakneck pace. Every Sigh, The End is meticulously researched, stylishly crafted, and utterly terrifying.",
