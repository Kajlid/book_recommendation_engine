  "title": "The Declaration of Interdependence: A Pledge to Planet Earth",
  "description": "The \"Declaration of Interdependence,\" composed at the 1992 Rio Summit, is both an enlightening creed and a passionate call to action. This compelling statement of environmental principles progresses through three \"This We Know,\" \"This We Believe,\" and \"This We Resolve.\" In this exquisitely designed edition of the Declaration — produced to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the David Suzuki Foundation — artist Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas brings this powerful creed to life with imagery from cultures around the world, interpreted through his dynamic Haida Manga style. The Declaration is followed by an inspiring essay by David Suzuki. Then, an epilogue by Tara Cullis, president and cofounder of the David Suzuki Foundation, reveals the history and achievements of the foundation, one of North America's most active and successful environmental organizations.",
