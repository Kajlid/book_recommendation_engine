  "description": "Welcome to The Dials: Trust no one. Step carefully. Live while you can. Katherine Whittemore, a girl who has just discovered seemingly horrifying secrets about herself, has fled her home and the man who loves her, Dr. James Blair. She now turns alone to Seven Dials, the slums of Victorian London, where those with nothing go to try to survive. The Dials welcomes her as it does any other: with the slap of pain, suffering, and violence that has been known to kill its inhabitants. Kat summons the strength to face these obstacles alongside some friends she encounters along the way, but many don’t outlive the treacherous Dials.     Meanwhile, James suffers in the wake of Kat’s absence, questioning his role as a doctor of the mad at Victorian London's asylum Bethlem Royal Hospital, until he receives an unexpected arrival from his past. Elizabeth, whom he was destined to marry as a young man, appears in the midst of his grief, bringing with her the joy and comfort he’d felt while young. Torn between searching for Kat and rekindling an old flame, James must now choose between the love of his life and the love of his youth.     Set against the perilous backdrop of both Seven Dials and Bethlem Royal Hospital, Infirmity addresses the power of love, including loving oneself, in the midst of all difficulties and realities. Join Kat on her journey of discovering if she has the power to love all parts of her life, including those she has run from in Infirmity, the harrowing sequel to Disorder in the Bedlam Series.",
