  "description": "Two imprisoned men must open their hearts to survive.Ever since Cambridge-bound Colin Lancaster spied on stable master Patrick Callahan mastering another man, he’s longed for Patrick to do the same to him. When Patrick is caught and threatened with death for his crime, Colin speaks up in his defense and confesses his own forbidden nature. They’re banished to the faraway prison colony of Australia.Patrick never asked for Colin’s help, and now he’s stuck with the pampered fool. While it’s true that being transported to Australia is a far cry from the luxury Colin is accustomed to, he’s determined to make the best of it and prove himself. Patrick learned long ago that love is a fairy tale, but he’s inexorably drawn to sweet, innocent, optimistic Colin despite himself.From the miserable depths of a prison ship to the vast, untamed Australian outback, Colin and Patrick must rely on each other. Danger lurks everywhere, and when they unexpectedly get the chance to escape to a new life as cowboys, they’ll need each other more than ever.The Station by Keira Andrews is a historical gay romance featuring an age gap, grumpy/sunshine, first times, opposites attracting, hurt/comfort, and of course a happy ending.",
