  "description": "Vladia Robespierre has always had a past to hide. Raised by the aristocracy instead of the State Rearing Facilities, her half-brother is all she's ever admired, respected, and counted on. But with war on the horizon and a rising body count, is he really who she thinks he is? And if her brother is the enemy, what does that make her?Set in the not too distant future, The Valkyrie Profiles is the first in a trilogy that examines the technological and governmental influences on the degeneration of human relations and the elitism of class division. Although Earth is militaristically strong, its social and cultural collapse has become a disease that now threatens to take down the entire solar system.",
