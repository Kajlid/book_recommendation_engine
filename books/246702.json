  "description": "Billie Holiday was really fun! It was a 49 page graphic novel and a pretty quick read. It contained images from Billie's life, mostly about being a black woman in a racist country and her drug addiction. She often finds herself abused by sadistic whites. Meanwhile modern day Sinner (Sampayo/Munoz' main protagonist detective) reminisces about the few times that he actually met this legendary jazz singer. It's an good narrative, but the art really makes it awesome! Check out these pages of her time making movies in Hollywood. I always loved the look of Munoz’s art. It’s wild and messy while at the same time very strong and firm. He can draw faces that look like they belong in a 1930’s Felix the Cat cartoon and yet fit into this gritty realistic world. He really knows how to compose a picture and his backgrounds are often awesome while keeping his main characters pretty loose and expressive. I’ve seen many really great comic artists since my introduction to Munoz but I still find his work some of the most exciting comics ever made",
