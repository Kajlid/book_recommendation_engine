Nathaniel Myer is a restless suburbanite whose world is shattered after a chance encounter with an angel-faced sociopath and his crew. After heartbreaking horror, Nate battles back through frailty, grief, guilt, and ultimately rage when time after time, his family's killers skip ahead of the police then out of reach. Finding them becomes an obsession that destroys what little Nate has left.A vagrant on the street, owning nothing but the clothes on his back and a crumpled wad of papers he got off a crooked PI, more than ever Nate cares for little beyond his crusade. Fate has other plans, however, because when a band of oddball misfits need saving from themselves, Nate is somehow always in the right place at the right time.But playing reluctant hero lands him squarely in reach of the very animals he’s hunting and, most of all, their elusive leader. But now things aren't so simple, and when Nate’s life takes another series of blinding turns, the justice he’s sought so long is on the line. How can he risk letting a habitual killer smile and slip away again? Or must he, Nate, become the ultimate bait and sacrifice?",
