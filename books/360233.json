  "title": "The Secret Science Behind Miracles, unveiling the huna Tradition of the Ancient Polynesians",
  "description": "This book deals with the discovery of an ancient and secret system of workable magic, which, if we can learn to use it as did the native Polynesians and North Africans, bids fair to change the world. The Huna (\"secret\")science used by the Polynesians for healing, controlling of winds and weather, and other \"miracles\" was strictly prohibited to outsiders until Max Freedom Long arrived in 1917. “I arrived in Hawaii in 1917, and took a teaching position that placed me near the volcano, Kileauea, which was very active at the time. The school was one of three rooms and stood in a lonely valley between a great sugar plantation and a ranch. The two teachers under me were both Hawaiian, and it was only natural that I soon began to know more about their Hawaiian friends. From there I began to hear guarded references to native magicians, the ‘kahunas,’ or ‘Keepers of the Secret.’ With background in psychology, my curiosity became aroused and I began to ask questions. To my surpriseI found that questions were not welcomed.” – MAX FREEDOM LONG",
