Gordon Barland, retired Chief of the Research Division, Department of Defense Polygraph Institute, called this book a \"must read.\" Barland said of the author, \"He offers insights into why people lie, later confess, and yet sometimes recant.\" He characterized Wygant's writing as reflecting, \"...the heart of a poet and soul of a philosopher.\" What happens to us when accused, rightly or wrongly? How do we defend ourselves? Here is the human side of the news, the deeper story that the media never reaches.",
