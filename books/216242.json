  "description": "Once upon a glitch in the West. . . .Deep inside the sim-prison of the Westin Cog, all hell is about to break loose. It’s there that Will Fielding, an erstwhile hunter of outlaws known as speedrunners, finds himself once again on a journey for blood and justice—and with none other than a young speedrunning woman as his unlikely partner. Together, he and this willful Catt Crawford must brave a frontier gone virtual, where outlaws glitch as well they shoot, the backcountry teems with software bugs, and bloodthirsty constructs known as “Engine” stalk the long night. Just who is so important that a feller would face all that? Why the leader of a thriving rebellion, that’s who, a man with his own journey of blood and justice in mind: to bring down the simulation once and for all.",
