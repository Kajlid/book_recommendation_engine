  "description": "Experienced sub Alec is back at the Shibari Auction House to sell two more years of his time after his master of ten years turns him in for a \"newer model.\" Novice Top Benj can't believe anyone would throw the lovely Alec away or complain that he's too old and snaps Alec up for twice the asking price.Could it be both men are looking for more than a sale and some fun, and is it possible they'll find it together?",
