  "description": "Kayzon of Twenty-Six is beastly.  Small offspring cry at the sight of his hulking frame and the vicious scar that bisects the right side of his face. Banished from his home world and deemed unworthy of a Bride—his mere presence strikes fear into the hearts of most beings.  Except for one fierce, tiny female. She alone is unafraid.  Kia is astonished when a sexy Xylan Warrior strides through the crowded marketplace of New Earth. When she attempts to speak to him, he replies in a deep, husky voice, “Leave human. Nothing good will come from this.”  But when Hurlian soldiers start dropping from the sky, ready to snatch unsuspecting humans, Kayzon rescues her. And when his bare hand clutches hers, a bolt of awareness strikes them both.  Then he’s kissing her, claiming her and telling her with hoarse emotion that she is his Bride. Wow, her life is unfolding like something out of a romance vid…until Kia discovers her new husband was never meant to have a Bride. In fact, their mating is in review and she has one planetary rotation to formalize or reject their tenuous marriage.  Oh hell, what’s a girl to do?",
