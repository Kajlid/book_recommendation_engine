  "title": "Loving the Present: Sufism, Mindfulness, and Recovery from Addiction and Mental Illness",
  "description": "The crisis of addiction in the world is severe, being declared a Public Health Emergency in 2017 and increasing in severity so that the United States witnessed the number of deaths from overdoses exceeding one hundred thousand in a twelve-month period for the first time between April 2020 and April 2021. Loving the Present is one womanâ€™s story of how she overcame mental illness and addiction, and includes helpful tips, spiritual tools, and personal and professional insights designed to make the path to recovery easier for those seeking freedom. Combining insights on Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, and other world religions with the practical spirituality of the Twelve Steps, she describes how to navigate the dual disorders of mental illness and addiction and focuses on mindfulness as a primary tool in the journey of recovery. Offered in the hopes of helping people to combat the terrible effects of dual disorders, Loving the Present is a timely addition to the recovery literature available to the public.",
