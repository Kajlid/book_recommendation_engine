  "description": "Teenagers Dane Grissinger and Kit Eisley never meant for things to go so far when they snuck into the Coulbourne cemetery on Halloween night. Dane's idea of a seance to contact the wife and son that Silas Coulbourne had murdered seemed like a scary, but thrilling prospect for the night. When Dane disappeared during the ceremony, nobody believed Kit's story that a ghost took him. Now, 10 years later, Kit is visited by an apparition claiming to be Dane. Kit must bring herself to deal with her ghosts from the past and find the truth about what happened to Dane on that fateful night. Some secrets, however, do not want to be unburied.",
