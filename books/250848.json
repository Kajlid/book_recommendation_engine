But when she comes home to find her house halfway packed for yet another mysterious move, her hopes are crushed.

There, she discovers an unbelievable family heritage of witchcraft and magic, and meets three friends with dark secrets all their own. As deadly horrors straight out of myth and folklore threaten her new life, Jenny becomes the only one who stands a chance of stopping the growing evil. But embracing her heritage will attract the attention of an even greater evil—the same un-killable creature her parents died to protect her from.★★★★★ This is a gnarly urban (no really, rural) fantasy tale of a contemporary witch, with a strong Appalachian flavor. - D.

Some of the monsters happen to be people. - John Olsen, author of Crystal King",
