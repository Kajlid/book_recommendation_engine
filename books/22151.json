  "description": "More than 900 favorite recipes from quilters across North America! From Ham Loaf to Peach Stuffed Chicken Breasts, from Sourdough Dinner Rolls to Raisin Bran Muffins, from Cranberry Coffee Cake to Oatmeal Brownies, from Beef and Lentil Salad to Baked Onion Soup, and from Pineapple Bread Pudding to Fudge Pie, this wonderful collection mirrors the lives of quilters far and wide. Many quilters are devoted homemakers who enjoy cooking almost as much as quilting. Many other quilters develop recipes and invent shortcuts to decrease food preparation time, freeing themselves to spend more time by their quilt frames and sewing machines. This easy-to-use cookbook is packed with their simple and elegant recipes. Also includes more than 100 anecdotes about cooking and quilting from the lives of these remarkable women and men. \"More than 900 homestyle recipes plus some reminiscing here and there makes this cookbook seem like a round-robin exchange with old friends.\" â€”Quilters Newsletter Magazine.",
