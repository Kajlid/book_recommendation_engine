  "description": "Written by leading Cotswold ghost hunter Bob Meredith listing true ghost stories in town and village order throughout the Cotswolds. As Bob says \"there still lingers in those pockets of the mind where shadows are turned into demons and where things go bump in the night, a flutter of the heart when the clock strikes twelve and a yearning for the firelit hearths where children listen to ghost stories on long, cold winter nights\". The ghost story is not just a part of history. It is history!. A publication by REARDON PUBLISHING the Cotswold Publisher a family run publishing house based in the Cotswolds using local authors and having the books printed in the Gloucestershire Cotswolds, Reardon Publishing are also able to offer a whole range of Cotswold books along with maps and videos mostly in the specialised subjects of Walking, Cycling, Driving, and tourism in both the Cotswolds and associated Counties.",
