  "title": "The Gospel of Adam",
  "description": "The Bible’s story of creation in Genesis names Adam as the first human in history. His story with Eve in the Garden of Eden is widely known—but what if he actually played a larger part in the story of humanity?In The Gospel of Adam, David L. Bishop takes well-known stories and characters from history and presents them through the eyes of Adam, as though he were living throughout all time on a mission to restore fallen humanity to a place worthy of returning to perfection.Following Adam through his profound interactions with Noah, King David, Jesus of Nazareth, and even Adolf Hitler, this book shows how Adam struggles not only with his mission to help humanity but also his own internal doubts as a man of faith.In the vein of works like The Da Vinci Code and The Last Templar, Bishop’s The Gospel of Adam weaves history, philosophy, religion, and politics throughout a thought-provoking first-person narrative that both challenges and inspires the reader to consider what it really means to be human.",
