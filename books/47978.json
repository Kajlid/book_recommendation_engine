  "description": "14-year-old kleptomaniac, North, gets a chance to use his compulsion to steal to save the life of his sister, India, when a mysterious accident leaves her hospitalised in a coma. With the help of the eccentric, Dr. Tan, North is transported in and out of dark fairy tale worlds, through a portal in a magical amber room in a hospital. Guided by a feisty fairy, Rosie Boots, they journey through the sinister pages of Charles Perrault's classic fairy tales - The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood, Little Red Riding Hood and Blue Beard. Inside these bleak, unforgiving, worlds, North must steal a series of amber treasures with ancient healing properties that can wake India from her coma. When Indiaâ€™s condition does not improve, North realises that all is not as it seems in the twisted reality of the Amber Room, but knows that he must unravel the dark secrets within its walls if he is to save his sister and escape with his life.",
