  "description": "Sylvie lives in Burley Point, a fishing village south of the Coorong on Australia's wild southern coast. She tries to make sense of her mother's brooding, and her father's violent moods. She worships her big brother, Dunc, but when he goes missing, she's terrified it's her fault. The bush and the birds and the endless beach are her only salvation, apart from her teacher, Miss Taylor. Sylvie is a charming narrator with a big heart and a sharp eye for the comic moment. In the tradition of Anne Tyler, The Lost Child is a beautifully written story about family and identity and growing up. It's about what happens when the the world can never be the same again. 'An assured and bittersweet coming-of-age tale.' Books+Publishing",
