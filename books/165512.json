  "description": "\"[A] richly imagined novel...A big, bold Biblical saga to fire the Christian imagination!\"--- Kirkus ReviewsOn the fateful road to Calvary, his part was cruelty; hers was compassion. The Lance and the Veil tells the story of Veronica, a princess of Rome, and Longinus, a career soldier. Each, alone in a violent world, comes to a holy land during a time of miracles. Veronica wiped the face of her Lord moments before His death. Longinus pierced his captive’s side, then declared, “Truly, this man was the Son of God.”The Lance and the Veil imagines how these two witnesses to salvation came to their moment in history. Kevin Rush weaves imperial history, Holy Scripture and forgotten Christian folklore into a fast-paced, romantic adventure that uplifts, educates, edifies and entertains. Kevin Rush has mastered a seemingly forgotten art...the ability to write engaging, faith-infused historical fiction in the tradition of Taylor Caldwell.” - Cary Solomon & Chuck Konzelman, screenwriters for God’s Not Dead“There is much to be said for literary what-ifs and what-abouts concerning the small roles and players in history's major dramas, and Kevin Rush does a masterful job in The Lance and The Veil, an exquisite literary exploration of some key players, big and small, in history's greatest drama. Profound but mysterious, these figures of our religious culture are brought to life, are given real depth and character, in this very welcome and very gripping and very beautiful work of fiction. The Lance and The Veil should launch a genre, or at least be the first in a great many such works by a writer with a unique talent, happily shared in this wonderful and intelligent book.”- Jack Fowler, Publisher, National Review",
