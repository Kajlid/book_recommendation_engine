  "description": "Sometimes we need a reminder that life was never all sunshine and roses for fairy-tale princesses. Before the true love s kisses and happily ever afters, there were poisoned apples, spindle pricks, and impossible tasks. Speaking to the princesses of our Heavenly King, President Dieter F. Uchtdorf compares our challenges to those faced by famous fairy-tale heroines. Recounting Belle s captivity, Cinderella s servitude, and the miller s daughter s sacrifices, President Uchtdorf emphasizes that each princess had to overcome adversity before she reached her happily ever after. Beautifully designed and illustrated, Your Happily Ever After is an inspiring and uplifting message that will encourage latter-day daughters of God to focus on His plan, to find happiness in service, and to fully embrace the blessings of the gospel.",
