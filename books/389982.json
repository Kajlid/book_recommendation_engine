  "description": "This timely collection of short stories leaves nothing in popular culture unscathedâ€”from meetings with Somali pirates and a theory that Paypal is a criminal enterprise to an eerie reimagining of the 9/11 events and a visitor from Atlantis's search for a burger and fries. Additional stories include faux FAQs originally written for Britain's Science magazine and a seductive fantasy piece for Playboy . Opening with a harrowing, high-speed ride through the Upper South and ending with a desperate quest to find Darwin's doomsday machine in New Orleans, readers will delight in these clever stories that present current issues in a fresh new light.",
