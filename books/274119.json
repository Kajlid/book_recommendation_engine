  "description": "From birth, Josh Gunderson was doing everything wrong. From a self-proclaimed tumor baby to questionable fashion choices, it was clear that he was going about life in all the wrong ways. You’d think he’d have gotten better at it as he got older, but you would be incorrect. It would turn out that creating his own path was the best thing for him to do, though not always the easiest. Josh details his journey from small-town California to globe-trotting professional speaker and everything in between offering up the lessons he has learned from a life gone wrong. In the brutally honest and painfully humorous You’re Doing It Wrong, Josh offers up the good, the bad, and the downright dirty of doing things his own way. From family and friends, mental health, sexual orientation to life after tragedy, You're Doing It Wrong is a fun, poignant, no-holds-barred look at a the little life lessons that no one really wants to talk about. Josh lets loose, saying all the things we’ve all just dared to think in the darkest corners of our minds.",
