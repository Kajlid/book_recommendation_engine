  "description": "Deadman Lake. Pristine and picturesque, nestled in the Cariboo Mountains of Northern British Columbia. Radiant and warm in the summertime, cold and unforgiving in the winter. For the few year-round residents living on the shores of the lake, this is the norm. They have become accustomed to the changing seasons and have learned to adapt. But this year an unseasonably early blizzard dumps two feet of snow overnight, cutting the small group off from any form of civilization. And with the snow comes a terrifying danger none of them could ever have imagined.A plane hurtles out of the dark sky and crashes into the forest. From the wreckage emerges one of the most powerful killers to ever walk the planet. An eight-hundred-pound nightmare of perfect fury that is ruled by a single unnatural instinct: an unrelenting hatred of MAN. Driven through the snowbound trees by a need for vengeance that can never be satisfied, it will continue to hunt and devour until all that walk on two legs have been destroyed.There is a judgement coming for the people of Deadman, and, young or old, guilty or innocent, all will be punished.",
