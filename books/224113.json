  "description": "\"How about bunking the next class and rushing to the cricket field and while you are at it, planting a bomb in the toilet?\" Wait, what the hell am I asking you to do with deadlines to catch on!? But allow me to take you down the forgotten memory lanes and remind you of the times when... You had a fit of breathlessness in front of your crush, When FLAMES said marriage, you couldn't help but blush. Blank calls played Morse codes, Two meant - you missed her loads. You were clumsy as shit, because her presence was sublime, But after your break-up, crying became your favorite pastime. You bunked the classes and said - 'Let the studies rot!' But you never missed Kiran ma'am's class, 'coz she was pretty hot!;) Cricket brought you glory, And planting a bomb in school changed your story. Life screwed you over and killed your spirit, But you're glad that you anyway did it. Told from the eyes of an Indian middle-class teenager, this story will make you wonder what you would have done if you were named Ghanshyam and were born a pessimistic nerd, while your optimistic best friend believed in unicorns and utopia! And to add to your woes, what if you fell in love with the most beautiful girl of your school? Wouldn't you then wait for a miracle to happen?Well, what if that miracle happened?",
