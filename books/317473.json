  "title": "Letting God's Word Speak: Lessons on Deepening Your Faith",
  "description": "Grace is a gift God gives freely, but should our response to God’s grace end when we accept Jesus as Lord and Savior? Is there more? Letting God’s Word Speak is a collection of topics built on solid scriptural references through which we can deepen our relationship with the triune God. The philosophy “know what you believe and why you believe it” is reinforced throughout the pages of this book. It will open up new revelations to familiar texts and simultaneously challenge you to further hear, explore, and understand God’s Word. It will encourage you to “work out your own salvation” by surrendering your will to Him and striving daily to be more like Christ while savoring the trust you have in God’s love. This book uses the World English Bible translation.",
