  "description": "Romney March is the setting for Mrs. Edwards's new story. Tamzin and Rissa, by now old friends to many readers, plan to camp in the Merrows' farm for part of their summer holidays. Disaster, however, threatens to intervene when they learn that there is foot-and-mouth disease in the district and the farmer is determined on complete isolation. Undaunted, Tamzin, Rissa and their friends arrive at the farm having first discovered a way of disinfecting themselves, and they are allowed to and when an accident occurs to Mr. Merrow, all the friends are involved in a full-time job running the farm and patrolling its boundaries. Incidents abound and the reader is kept thoroughly involved and excited by all that goes on. No Entry is right up to the high standard Mrs. Edwards has already set herself, and it is confidently recommended to those who enjoy first-class storytelling and really life-like characters.",
