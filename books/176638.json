She has collected the wisdom she gleaned from years of therapy, research, and most of all pure life experience recovering from her depression into this volume.With honesty and humour, Elliott outlines transformational tools for self-love and stress relief in plain language – no self-help jargon here! She sees the potential for personal growth in everyone, and brings that relentless optimism to Confessions of an Ex Hot Mess, challenging readers to “choose now over later” to find love, happiness, and balance.",
