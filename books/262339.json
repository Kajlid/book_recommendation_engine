Once she escaped him she created a new life for herself, vowing never to be dominated by any man. Now she runs a successful corporation and is known in business circles as a ball-buster, the woman with brass ovaries. And in her secret life as a Dominatrix, she's known as Mistress. But when Ty, King of Clubs, spirits Awai away to a magical world, the sexy muscle-bound rogue of a man literally has her tied in knots. Awai finds that being the King's submissive definitely has its advantages, but she doesn't think she can let go of her past long enough to embrace a future with a Dominant man. King Ty is determined to show Awai that she belongs with him, and he will do whatever it takes to make her his Queen of Clubs.",
