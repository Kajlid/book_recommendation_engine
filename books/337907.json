  "description": "Velikovsky equated the 2800 year old mythological Greek king with Pharaoh Akhnaton of Egypt and in his book he shows us why. He constructs the story like a detective novel, putting pieces of clues together to form the whole puzzle and he makes an incredibly exciting job of it. He writes for the lay reader but he is far from condescening. His language is a joy to read. I agree with BlairBurton that the book is wildly entertaining but I resented his reference to the author as 'the premier theorist of crackpot science.' Velikovsy's 'crackpot' theories are yet to be disproved and his predictions have the uncanny habit of being proved right so that the world of the scientific community is as shaky as the description of the earth in \"Worlds In Collision!\" Readers will find great rewards in reading all of his works and judging for themselves. While \"Oedipus and Akhnaton\" is the least 'scientific' of his works it is no less fascinating and eminently readable.",
