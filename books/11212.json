  "description": "All Aden Callen wants is a life that means something. And she almost has it, until an unexpected letter arrives, forcing her to face her troubled past and leave her hard-won happiness at camp for the sleepy northern logging town of Holden.The new girl in a small town, Aden soon becomes the reluctant center of attention for the local young, restless, and bored. Among them is bumbling and awkward Derek, who's not as clueless as he seems; Cory, cocky, charming, and entirely ruthless; the mysterious and beautiful Tory; and Jason, intense and eager for the bright spark in a dead-end town.Struggling to reconcile the painful relationship she has with her family amidst a shattered heart, Aden soon finds herself giving in to the sway of distraction the local scene holds. Yet when her new-found notoriety swirls into dangerous consequences, Aden must fight to keep from losing herself - and the future she wants more than anything - before Holden swallows her whole.HOLIDAY CHICK is an absorbing tale of the lure of misspent youth, freedom and futures, and that ferocious time in life when anything can happen.",
