  "description": "ABOUT THIS BOOK...YOU BETTER WATCH OUT… KRAMPUS IS COMING TO TOWN.Ancient folklore warns of a mythical counterpart to Santa Claus, who punishes naughty children every Christmas… his name is KRAMPUS. Michael Dougherty presents the official graphic novel based on his festive horror comedy , which expands the mythology of this iconic terror with an anthology of three deliciously twisted morality tales that will leave you praying you are not on the naughty list.At the most wonderful time of the year, a drunken mall Santa comes under siege from some very mischievous Christmas spirits, a dysfunctional cop becomes trapped with the man who ruined his life and the wealthy town “scrooge” must face the shadows from his past as his home comes under invasion from the homeless. This Christmas, Krampus will make sure they all get what they deserve.Michael Dougherty, the writer/director behind cult horror hit Trick ‘r Treat , is joined by a fantastic team of creators, uniting Krampus co-screenwriters Zach Shields and Todd Casey and artists Fiona Staples ( Saga ), Christian Dibari ( Hoax Hunters ), Maan House ( Witchblade ), and Stuart Sayger ( Bram Stoker’s Death Ship ) to deliver a twisted gift for the holiday season.",
