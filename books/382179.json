  "description": "The son of a brewer, Thomas Cromwell rose from obscurity to become the confidant of the King and one of the most influ ential men in British history. Cromwell drafted the law that allowed Henry VIII to divorce his first wife and marry Anne Boleyn, setting into motion the brutal Pro testant Reformation. Over the course of his career, Cromwell amassed a fortune through bribery and theft, and created many enemies along the way. His fall was spectacularâ€”beheaded out side the Tower of London, his boiled head was placed on a spike above the London Bridge.Rich in incident and colorful detail, this is narrative history at its finest.",
