  "description": "Nine werewolves were to dance with Tyler, the alpha male of a small pack. He needed to choose a mate so he could expand his pack. Natalie was forced to be one of those nine women, and she was not happy about it, especially when she was chosen. She wanted to marry for love. This wasn’t how Natalie wanted her life to be like at all. She didn’t want to be selected like an ornament off the shelf. She couldn’t escape the wedding. She had to go through with it, but no way was she going to spend her whole life with this man. So she did the only thing she could do, she ran away. \tBut running away wasn’t as easy as she believed it would be. Even when she thought she had found the light at the end of the tunnel, things got very complicated. That’s what men do; they complicate everything.",
