  "description": "Author and spiritual teacher Mark Amaru Pinkham presents a history of the Knights Templar and the legendary Holy Grail like none ever before. For nearly one thousand years the Knights Templar have been rightly regarded to be the eternal guardians of the Holy Grail, but what the Holy Grail actually is has never been accurately revealed - until now. Guardians of the Holy Grail proves that the Grail existed many thousands of years before Christ, and that it is as old as the Garden of Eden itself.",
