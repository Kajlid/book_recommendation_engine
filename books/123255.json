  "description": "Sticks and stones may break our bones…\n Hockey is my life. After Wren Davis puts my dreams of the NHL in jeopardy, I vow to make her life hell if she ever comes near me again. But she’s my best friend’s foster sister, and even though they don’t live together anymore, their bond is still tight, which makes avoiding each other extra difficult. Especially when I show up at Shadow Valley University and learn my new room comes with an unwelcome addition: Wren Davis. As much as I try to make her life hell, she gives it right back, until she’s not just under my skin but constantly on my mind. But some things can’t be forgiven, and fraternizing with the enemy is the last thing either of us want.",
