  "description": "I had her and loved the taste of her.But she’s too young, too sweet and good.I’ll keep her safe, and I want her happy.Even if my own heart tells me I’m a fool for not making her mine.Our few nights were electric. She left her mark and burned her goodness into my heart.There’s no room left for anyone else, only her.I can’t chase her. I have to let her go.Sure, she’s a club girl and I could have her under me whenever I want, but I can’t do that to her. I refuse to pull her any deeper into the Diamond MC.When that decision is taken out of my hands and she’s dragged into the darkness, all I see is rage and bloodshed.I’ll make them pay. Every single one of them who thought they could steal her away, take her from me.She’s everything.And once I have her back, I’ll make sure I never let go.She’s light and goodness.Maybe she’s too good for me, but maybe she’s just what I need to balance my world.I’ll give her everything and make her mine.And just maybe she’ll make me hers too.Warning: this book contains violence, offensive language, and very mature topics. Recommended for age 18 years and up.Note: Book #1 in the Diamond MC series, though these characters have been seen in the mm Polished P &P series, you don't have to read them first to read Country.",
