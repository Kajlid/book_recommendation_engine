  "description": "The heart wants what it wants and mine has never stopped wanting her.London Canterbury and I were never meant to be. Her family was rich. She was cheer captain. The most popular girl in our school while I was the opposite. Poor, nerdy, and invisible. Eight years ago, I kissed the hell out of her, knowing I was never going to see her again. Or so I thought. Because here I am, rescuing none other than London who crashed her car into a tree in the middle of a blizzard. Right before Christmas. Now she’s stuck in my house. In my head. Back in my heart before I ever have a chance to stop it.As the storm intensifies outside so does the fire between us. Despite all that, I know this is too good to last. That eventually, the storm will end, and she’ll leave. But losing her is no longer an option. I’m hoping that sometimes all it takes to fall in love is just one kiss…Just One Kiss is a fun and steamy, holiday, second chance romance! It is a complete standalone.",
