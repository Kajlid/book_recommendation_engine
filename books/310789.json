  "description": "Arching Stems shares a bit of my own personal lament as well as offers uplifting words for the reader. I write to tell them who I am and more importantly who they are. It’s an intimate conversation between two friends in the trenches together. It’s uplifting and it’s meant to make the world feel a little less lonely to whoever decides to take a peak. It serves as guidance and it serves as tangible hope.",
