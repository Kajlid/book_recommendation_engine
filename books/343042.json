  "description": "It’s not enough. All the clothes and jewelry they give. Presents grand enough to drown out their guilt, But not important enough to overcome their desire. Every present they give is a double-edged diamond, Meant to make me fall in line without question. I’ve been forced into this pretty gilded cage, Lavish and filled to the brim with comfort. But it’ll never be enough. These pretty little things can’t give me what I need. They lack the freedom I desperately desire. But I’ll take it back, That liberty that’s been hidden from me. I’ll find it and never let it go. Then I’ll take more. I’ll take everything from these men, Exactly like they did to me. They’ll crave my every touch, And beg me to be gentle. They’ll crave salvation, But that’ll be mine, too. *This is a dark contemporary standalone centered around the sin greed.",
