  "description": "A Job Search System Passing the Toughest Real-World TestsTess was a graduate of Wellesley College, and the University of Chicago’s MBA program, and she had been out of work for 19 months after 59 straight job interviewing rejections. Her answers to interview questions were articulate and well thought out, as you would expect. But the problem was a more powerful form of speech that jobseekers tend to overlook: non-verbal behaviors. Her facial expression, tone of voice and body language all said the same thing: I’m nervous, anxious, and scared. And this was the message that interviewers heard. It led them to look for someone other than Tess.But her story has a happy ending. The job search system in The Path to Job Search Success enabled Tess to gain control of her non-verbal voice in less than one week. Then, on her 60th interview, she got an offer from a large, respected company, and not just any offer. The salary was $20,000 more than her last job, the one she held 19 months before.When we are happy we don’t have to think about smiling. This is because non-verbal behaviors are a subconscious expression of how we feel. So, how do we control something that is subconscious? The Path to Job Search Success will share seven techniques, one of which made all of the difference for Tess.Jobseekers tend to follow this advice: Use stories. Stories are powerful, except when they are bad, and most are. This book dedicates three chapters to show you how to get them right.It also uses the findings of communication and neuroscience researchers to align our job search practices to work with human nature, namely, the way we perceive, process information, make decisions, and so on. And this is the path to job search success.",
