Nexess was once a young woman named Elizabeth, but on one fateful night, the beauty was turned into a beast. Now she's the sex slave and assassin for seductive, dangerous Nuove Leve gang leader Antonio Bianchi. Night after night, Antonio sends her out to do his bidding, and when she returns, she must bow to his every smoldering desire. When a chance encounter at a turf war introduces her to one of her own kind, Nexess must fight the fascination she feels for this strange vampire to protect the man to whom she's pledged her loyalty. But fascination gives way to passion, and tangled in a deadly love triangle, she must decide if she'll go with the vampire who may be her salvation, or stay with the man who may be her damnation. Blood Lust is the first book in the electrifying Lust Trilogy by Jessica L. Degarmo.",
