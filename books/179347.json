  "description": "The wilds of San Francisco are a long way from the rural-Utah beat of Deputy Joe Peterson.Kabe’s former Dom, the man who protected him in prison, dies and Kabe, along with Jack’s other boys, returns to The City to pay their respects. Joe wonders where he fits in after seeing Kabe at home, with the family and friends he left behind. When he agrees to help track down one of the missing boys he can’t understand Kabe’s aversion to his getting involved. The emotions dredged up by the search, and Kabe’s slipping back into his old out-of-control life style, pitch them along like the rough surf Kabe has so missed riding. If they can find the balance between love, respect and their lifestyle, they may just be able to discover a place Joe thought was closed to him forever.",
