  "description": "These past fifty years have seen incredible advances in mankind's scientific knowledge. We can now replace knees, hips, and other joints inside the human body, and we use robots to do critical parts of the surgeries. We are using retroviruses to actually rewrite the DNA within living patients, in order to make their bodies more effective in fighting diseases. We have seen subatomic particles, during their brief appearances, in our supercollider. We have captured images of the moment when two hydrogen nuclei fuse into one helium nucleus. We can speak to anyone in the world if they are in possession of a handheld cell phone. We have orbiting observatories that allow us to see galaxies that are over 13 billion lightyears away, and we have sent probes to other planets even landing one on a comet. With all this new knowledge, and much more, it's time to ask, has any of this information helped us to answer those age-old questions about the purpose of life, the existence of God, the origins of the universe, and our role within it all? In this book, the author emphatically answers yes! We now have enough scientific facts to answer most of those questions. And in a clear and easily readable way, he explains what we now know and how each of us can use these new insights, in order to improve our lives tremendously. This work in intended to improve your life. In fact, I am sure it will.",
