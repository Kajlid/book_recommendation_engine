  "description": "Excerpt from Life in Ancient Egypt and Assyria This will not be an unbroken history of the ancient Oriental dynasties and nations: the order of events, the lines of the kings, the movements and invasions of the peoples may be found fully related in my Ancient History, or in its abridged edition by Van den Berg. I only wish to give the readers of this book some impression of life under its various phases amongst - the two most civilised nations which flourished upon our earth before the Greeks. I have chosen for each of them the epoch we know the best, and of which we possess the greatest number of monuments: for Egypt, that of Rameses II. (fourteenth century B.C.); for Assyria, that of Assurbqnipnl (seventh century]. I have acted like those conscientious travellers who do not like to enter a new country without some preparation, who study its customs and language before they start; then I journeyed - or at least I believed so - two or three thousand years back, away from our present era. Once there, I looked round and endeavoured to see as well and as much as possible.",
