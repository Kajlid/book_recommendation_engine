  "description": "Hope Anderson loves her life. She has a great business that’s thriving, the best friends a girl could ever have, and a coven she can count on. Oh, and she’s been single for over fifteen years and likes it that way… until the love of her life, Lucas King, walks back into town and throws everything she thought she knew about herself into chaos.  If that wasn’t enough, now her mother is in town to warn her about a curse that happens to all the Anderson women when they turn forty-six, and she isn’t talking about hot flashes or mood swings. When her mother moves in and Grace’s business is suddenly on the rocks, it’s going to take all of her magic to get her life back on track. The question is, will Lucas prove he deserves to be traveling that line with her, or will she walk away the same way she did fifteen years ago?",
