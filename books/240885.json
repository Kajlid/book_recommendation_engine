Together they braved the dangers of both their times, only to find themselves drawn to a future beyond even N'Doch's own--to a devastated America where the dragon Fire reigned in all his terrifying magnificience, with his dragon guide Paia transformed into his high priestess, her true destiny concealed from her.Yet it was not Fire who had summoned his brother and sister dragons. the Call had come from another, and the reason for the summons was all too clear. Fire had chosen to become a god instead of a guardian. And the dragon Air was nowhere to be found.Could Earth and Water with Erde and N'Doch force Fire and Paia back on the path they were fated to follow? Could they find and rescue Air? Or would Fire's rebellion doom both the dragons and the world they guarded?Description from back cover",
