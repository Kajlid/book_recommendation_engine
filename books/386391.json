  "description": "A year has passed since that fateful night in Daemon Hall's house of horrors. Bestselling macabre author Ian Tremblin decides to hold another writer's contest but this time in the safety of his own home. Tremblin is excited to share with contestants a very old book he has recently acquired that once belonged to Rudolph Daemon, the millionaire builder of Daemon Hall who later went mad and killed his family. But the book, like the mansion, is powerfully evil and soon transports the group to the burned out shell of the haunted mansion. Flesh eaters, voodoo, a proficient sociopath, and the root of the house's malevolence are all part of the mix. Who will get out alive?",
