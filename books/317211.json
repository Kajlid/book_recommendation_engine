Sustain is a fantastical tale that follows the lives of the most influential Kastelian family of that age. Cole, the eldest of three handsome sons, was a strong, arrogant man born into privilege, power and hatred. Raised by his merciless father—a self-proclaimed king—Cole and his brothers were key players in his father's plan to annihilate their adversaries. The family’s loyalty is tested when Cole brings a mysterious stranger named Arna into their lives. With this new addition to their world—danger follows her—as secrets unfurl around them. Can Cole learn to distinguish between good and evil, despite his upbringing? Will he defend or destroy the ones he cares about the most? At its core, Sustain is a story of growth, courage, sacrifice and extraordinary love.",
