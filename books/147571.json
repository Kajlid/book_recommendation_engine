  "description": "Continue the Hell Yeah! Series with book 14...The first time Bowie Travis Malone laid eyes on Cassie Cartwright, she knocked him for a loop. He was as drawn to her side as a moth to a flame. A green eyed angel with golden hair, she made his heart hammer in his chest and his body ache to hold her close. But the moment he asks her to dance, the truth of her condition almost brings him to his knees – Cassie is in a wheelchair. Cassie is used to men passing her by, they can’t see beyond the handicap that defines her boundaries. When she sees Bowie walking across the room toward her, she thinks he is the sexiest man in the world and once they talk, she realizes he is as kind and smart as he is handsome. She dreads the moment when he asks her to dance and she has to tell him she can’t. Their first meeting seals their fate. Both are drawn to each other by threads that fate wove long ago. Bowie realizes he wants Cassie above all others, and thinks she is perfect – just the way she is. Cassie is afraid to dream that he might be able to see something in her that no one else ever has. Love, desire, and affection draw them together but reality may shatter their dreams. The tragic accident that put Cassie in a wheelchair will come back to haunt them. And when Bowie realizes he was the one responsible – nothing will ever be the same. He will begin a quest to build a world where Cassie will feel cherished and welcome – if only she will be able to forgive.**Intended for readers 18+",
