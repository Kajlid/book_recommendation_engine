  "description": "Teacher Robert Korenic’s hedonistic lifestyle is threatened by his attraction to colleague Julie Simpson. He likes drinking and womanizing and resents her web of entrapment. So why can’t he get her out of his head, and his bed?  Julie, a single parent, knows she has found her man, but fears she is in over her head. She’s never sure of what he will do next, for his actions and moods are so unpredictable.  Arsonist David Pierce has discovered Julie. She looks so much like his former the one who became his lover - and then rejected him. The fires he sets are not enough. She’s back. It’s his second chance - and he’s not a kid any more.  When David’s advances are rejected, Robert plays a deadly game of cat and mouse in a frantic effort to save Julie and a classroom full of children who are unwittingly caught in the middle.  A LESSON IN A SUSPENSE THAT MORPHS INTO A PAGE TURNING THRILLER.",
