  "description": "The women of Troy are threads spinning on a single loom. Can they reweave the tapestry of fate? Horses of Fire isan epic retelling of the Trojan War in which Troy’s strong yet misunderstood women take center stage. Andromache is cast as the doting wife of Prince Hector, yet her Amazonian name means “battler of men.” She must gather a band of outcasts and become the military commander she was born to be. Rhea is a war refugee and a horse whisperer who finally earns a place and sense of belonging in Hector’s stables. She must become an unlikely spy while facing a forbidden love that will test all her loyalties. Helen is blamed by all for starting the Trojan War, but no one knows her real story. To escape her abusive husband and foil a plot to undermine Hector, Helen must risk everything and reveal her true face to the one who despises her most. Horses of Fire is a sweeping yet intricate story of an ancient, violent era, compelling women who navigate their circumstances to win the day, and an utterly immersive sense of time and place. This historically realistic Troy, set in the wider landscape of the late Bronze Age collapse, is a perilous battleground for soldiers and politicians alike, not a playground where the fate of men and women make sport for gods and goddesses. It’s a harrowing novel of ambition, the transcendent bond of female friendship, and the everyday bravery of civilians in war.",
