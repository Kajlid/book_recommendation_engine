  "title": "One of Your Own: The Life and Death of Myra Hindley",
  "description": "On 15 November 2002, Myra Hindley died in prison, one of the few women in the UK whose crimes were deemed so indefensible that 'life' really did mean 'life'. Without a doubt Britain's most notorious murderess, her death has done nothing to diminish the shadow she casts across our collective consciousness. This book presents a study of Hindley.",
