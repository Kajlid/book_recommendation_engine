  "description": "Louise and Jean travel to Old Bridge to spend the weekend with their friend, Carol Humfrey. The girls stumble upon a mystery when the bell inside the Webster College chapel rings mysteriously at night. They visit the chapel, only to be warned away by gossipy Miss Weatherspoon. Miss Weatherspoon claims that the bell tower is haunted by the ghost of a young child who died of starvation while locked inside the bell tower. She also hints that the ivy covering the church hides a great secret.  The girls are intrigued, especially after they learn from Mr. Humfrey that the chapel reputedly holds a clue to a hidden treasure intended for the perpetual upkeep of the chapel. Louise and Jean feel certain that the recent mysterious events mean that someone is searching for the treasure and resolve to find it before that person is successful.",
