  "description": "In Caithe, magic is considered to be a gift from the devil, that should be rejected - by giving away your life when the first signs of 'magic madness' appear. However, the same magic gift is considered a blessing, when used by Caithe's king. But the situation is problematic, when Athaya, the king's daughter starts showing the signs of the magic. She runs to a nearby kingdom that embraces magic, but will that be enough to protect her?",
