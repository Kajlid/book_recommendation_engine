  "title": "My New American Life",
  "description": "Francine Prose captures contemporary America at its most hilarious and dreadful in My New American Life, a darkly humorous novel of mismatched aspirations, Albanian gangsters, and the ever-elusive American dream. Following her New York Times bestselling novels BlueAngel and A Changed Man, Prose delivers the darkly humorous story of Lula, a twenty-something Albanian immigrant trying to find stability and comfort in New York City in the charged aftermath of 9/11. Set at the frontlines of a cultural war between idealism and cynicism, inalienable rights and implacable Homeland Security measures, My New American Life is a moving and sardonic journey alongside a cast of characters exploring what it means to be American.",
