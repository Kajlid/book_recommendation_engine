  "description": "In words only a reindeer can express, Rudy the RNR riffs on the holiday season. He likes mistletoe and Christmas parties, and is a very good kisser. He's busy around the 24th & 25th of December, but other than that, he has a lot of free time, so, he looks forward to hearing from you. This book would be a nice gift even if you haven't got antlers. It's really tough to type with hoofs.",
