She came to Sin City to find her missing friend and accidentally got swept up in a police raid. Even worse, she's being bailed out by the last man she wants to see right now: the irresistibly sexy, infuriatingly cocky Alpha op who rescued her a year ago. What are the odds?Logan Callahan is six-and-a-half feet of solid muscle and Texas charm, a hard-fighting ex-Marine with a soft spot for Rachel.

With targets on their backs and killers on their tails, it's one high-risk game they're playing. And it's not just their hearts that are on the line . . .***Don't miss the rest of the Alpha Security series:Book 1 - Heated Pursuit (Rafe and Penny)Book 2 - Holding Fire (Trey and Elle)Book 3 - Hard Justice (Vince and Charlie)",
