  "description": "From the notorious Internet troublemaker who brought the world the explosively popular Next Time I'll Spend the Money on Drugs Instead , in which he attempted to pay his chiropractor with a picture he drew of a spider; \"Please Design a Logo for Me. With Pie Charts. For Free,\" which has been described as one of the most passed-on viral e-mails of all time; and, most recently, the staggeringly popular \"Missing Missy\", which has appeared everywhere from The Guardian to Jezebel to Andrew Sullivan's The Daily Dish , comes this profoundly funny collection of irreverent Internet mischief and comedy.Featuring all of Thorne's viral success, including \"Missing Missy\", The Internet Is a Playground culls together every article and e- mail from Thorne's wildly popular website 27bslash6.com, as well as enough new material, available only in these pages, to keep you laughing-and, indeed, crying-until Thorne's next stroke-of-genius prank. Or hilarious hoax. Or well-publicized almost-stint in jail (really).\"There is usually a fine line between genius and insanity, but in this case it has become very blurred. Some of the funniest and most clever writing I have read in years.\"--Terrance Fielding, WIRED magazine\"I laughed so hard and uncontrollably I could hardly breathe. Reading this on public transport is not a good idea.\"-- Penthouse magazine\"Brilliantly funny.\"--Jezebel.com",
