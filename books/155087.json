  "description": "Seven Conversations is a thought experiment on life and existence. The characters might be fictitious but their questions are not. What happens when we choose happiness over convenience? For Meera Sachdev, choosing a divorce at an early age of thirty over a comfortable and convenient life was a leap of faith. Leaving her successful career and friends behind in the United States, she returns to India where she is now reduced to ‘a failed woman who could not save her marriage’. As self-doubts and the realisation of the suffering she has caused her loved ones overwhelm her, she begins to crumble. Her call for help is answered by none other than The Lord who is all-attractive. Her odyssey will take her through the temples of Vrindavan, the mythical City of Justice, a deserted barn and the Himalayas as she unearths her deep spiritual roots and the divine truth. In seven pivotal conversations with Krsna, friends, father, teacher and herself, she rediscovers life, love and her own identity. Beware, after reading the book, you might dare to choose happiness yourself. Are you prepared?",
