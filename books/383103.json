  "description": "Could my life be any crazier? Wait, don't answer that. I'm sure it could. When you grow up with vampire hunter parents, crazy kind of comes with the territory. Thank goodness I moved completely across the country to New York for college. My roommate and best friend, Maria, was able to get me a job at this posh restaurant where all the wait staff perform on stage, I'm so excited. Oh, and the owner is, how do I say this, H-O-T. This is going to be great! New school, new job, there's no way this can get screwed up. Right? Wait, don't answer that.New York is my city. I do what I can to protect her. I know I can never redeem myself, never be forgiven for what I have become, but night after night, I try. It was an existence I had become accustomed to. I didn't need to have anyone come waltzing into my life and turn it upside down, but we can't always plan for fate. Sometimes it just happens. Sarah happened to me. In a matter of weeks, she changed everything I wanted, everything I needed. She can't know what I am, or what I used to be. She can never find out. I will protect her, even if it means protecting her from me.",
