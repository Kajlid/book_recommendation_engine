  "description": "Olivia de Havilland planted her standard on the Left Bank of the River Seine in late October of 1953, and it has been fluttering on both Left and Right Banks with considerable joy and gaiety from that moment on. She married a Frenchman, took on all his compatriots, and has been the heroine of a love affair ever since. Her skirmishes with French traffic, French maids, French salesladies, French holidays, French law, French doctors, above all, the French language, are here set forth in a delightful and amusing record. Paraphrasing Caesar, Miss de Havilland says, \"I came, I saw, I was conquered.\"",
