  "title": "Hollow Bones",
  "description": "While Hollow Bones is one of the most fascinating works of fiction ever written, the story, woven around a factual Native American prophecy (the results of which can be seen and felt daily around our planet), takes the reader on an astonishing adventure; through the incredible story and to the depths of soul simultaneously--through an exploration of the very core of our spiritual being. Masterful storyteller Stephen Paul's newest work is in a category all its own, crossing the boundaries of fiction and non-fiction, self-help, spirituality and Native American studies all at the same time. Hollow Bones uses clearly documented predictions made by Native American spiritual leaders as the basis of the story, and the amazing tale will keep you enthralled and unable to put it down. Each and every spiritual seeker and conscious and concerned adult on planet earth should add this marvelous book to their \"read now\" list, and read it with an open mind and heart.",
