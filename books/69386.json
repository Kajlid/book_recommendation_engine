  "description": "A blank page looks completely different depending on where you are in life when that page appears in front of you. For Jillian Francis who prefers to quietly and privately mourn the loss of the father of her unborn child, her blank page becomes filled with \"Everything Baby\" and \"Everything Christmas\".Believing herself to be in one of those spaces between life, when life isn't really happening, she soon discovers that there is no such space, that life is always happening. Through the help of her would have been in-laws, her childhood friend, an intrusive neighbor, and her own tendency toward wit and sarcasm, Jillian finds her way back to a life she never expected to live, and never expected to love.",
