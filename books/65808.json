  "description": "Zane's erotic writing has captivated a legion of fans. Her previous short story collection, The Sex Chronicles: Shattering the Myth, not only became a bestseller but also delivered fully on its promise—exploding the myth that men are more sexual in nature than women and that African American women are particularly inhibited. Now, this second volume of Sex Chronicles, Gettin' Buck Wild, is Zane's hottest collection yet. Smart, witty, and extremely sexy, with all-new characters and settings, these stories are tailored to women—but perfect for lovers to share.Scenarios run the gamut from committed, monogamous couples looking to experiment to wild, single sisters who form a very unconventional sorority. You'll meet a highly paid, multitasking career woman who gets her groove back in \"When Opposites Attract.\" You'll take a ride with an adventurous couple that tries something new in \"The Subway—A Quickie.\" You'll discover a new way of celebrating Christmas in \"The Santa Claus.\" Spicing up real-life scenarios with over-the-top sexual fantasy, Zane gives readers the best time they've ever had between the pages of a book.",
