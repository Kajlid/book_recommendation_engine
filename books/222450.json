Adela Macleod has been kidnapped, held hostage, (Lady's Choice) and on the eve of her wedding, watches her ancient husband, Ardelve, collapse during their wedding feast. Seeking escape from all her would-be comforters in the pitch-blackness of a fog-shrouded night, she meets a stranger with a soothing voice who will not even tell her his name.Sir Robert Logan is a serving knight who has long since left his family. No sooner does Rob meet the sorrowful but determined Lady Adela than he finds himself forced to take up his family duties again. Rob inherits his father's title and estates as the third baron Lestalric. But with rumours flying that the two of them clearly conspired to murder the second baron and his heir, as well as Ardelve, Rob and Adela become partners in the fight against common enemies. And as they work together to discover the truth, Rob and Adela realize that sometimes the best relationships aren't about luck. Sometimes it's about love.",
