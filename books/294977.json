  "description": "He wants a hooker for one night only. She needs money fast for her grandad's operation. Will it be a crashing success or a fizzled-out candle? By allowing others to arrange the finer details of the rendezvous it could be either!Yorkshire lass born and bred needs money for her Grandad Thomas who is in pain and the cost of an operation on his bad knee is way beyond the family’s means. Leah tries everything to earn the fee – but in the end, and like so many before her, she turns to the world’s oldest profession. Madame Butterfly’s exclusive escort agency in London is a different world to where Leah comes from. In Whitby, the sea air is sweet, and legends of Dracula jostle with jet-mining and whaling history; it’s a place where dog lovers meet and tourists come to marvel at the views. Leah may be out of her comfort zone, but one daring, brief encounter will bring many surprises in this memorable romantic comedy full of pithy Yorkshire humour. *Top 10, Amazon/Kindle/General Humour, Feb 2020* Gracie Bond is an award-winning writer, she won the Film Maker's International Screen Play award for Best Comedy in 2016 with this story.",
