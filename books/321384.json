Focused.Those are the qualities that helped me win multiple Olympic medals, and when fate ended my swimming career early, those same qualities led me to run a thriving Manhattan restaurant business.

And for the first time ever, I want more than just one night with a woman.SavannahI came to New York for a fresh start and to prove that I could make it on my own. So far, so good.
