  "description": "“[Acevedo] manages to update vampire lore in clever and imaginative ways.”— El Paso Times   If you haven’t yet encountered Gulf War veteran-turned-vampire private eye Felix Gomez, then now is the time! Jailbait Zombie —the fourth in author Mario Acevedo’s outrageously original dark fantasy p.i. series—pits the undead against the living dead, as vampires meet zombies for a no-holds-barred beatdown. As dark, sexy, funny, and endearingly strange as Acevedo’s previous vampiric excursions— Nymphos of Rocky Flats, X-Rated Bloodsuckers, and Undead Kama Sutra — Jailhouse Zombie is more of the top-shelf bloody madness that inspired Tim “ Nuclear Jellyfish ” Dorsey to comment that Mario Acevedo “is a very disturbed man—and I mean that in the absolute finest sense of the term.”",
