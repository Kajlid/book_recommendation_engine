  "description": "Available now in Kindle, Paperback and Audible.When the war between the magical races ended with their near annihilation, the power behind magic was lost so thoroughly, that people today don't even believe it ever truly existed.The few remaining survivors of the war were driven underground and the world became dominated by man.Those descendants who have learned to live among men are hardly distinguishable from their mundane brethren and can barely muster enough energy to do simple psychic tricks.The only hope for magic is that one day, a child of the clans will come and rediscover the source of its power, and that day has arrived.",
