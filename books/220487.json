  "description": "He was my brother’s best friend. He was seven years older than me. He was a pig when it came to casual sex; indulging in one night stands like they were going out of style. So why did I want to tear his clothes off every time we got within five feet of each other?  She was only eighteen years old when we met for the first time. She was a good girl who avoided bad boys like me, but that didn’t stop me from picturing all the things I wanted to do to her--to do with her. She was too young though and my best friend’s baby sister. I couldn’t let things go where I wanted. I couldn’t corrupt her--taint her with my darkness. I knew it could never happen. It would never happen… But it did.  This book is a standalone with crossover characters from QUAKE and QUIVER (QUAKE Book 2)",
