  "title": "The Hospital at the End of the World",
  "description": "There are 2,600 hospitals in Asia, Africa and South America which could be classified as \"Mission Hospitals\" - far off the beaten path, providing basic medical service to the poorest people of the world. The Hospital at the End of the World tells the story of a nurse from the USA and his first experience as a teaching nurse in Nepal.  Joe Niemczura brings to life the day-to-day realities of life in a rural teaching hospital, literally at the \"end of the road.\" The harsh realities of a lack of modern medical equipment when mixed with the humanness of endurances demonstrates that above all, it is the individual who matters; both patient and caregiver. All else pales in comparison. The strength of this story is in relationships with students, physicians, other nurses, patients, families and most importantly with Nepal itself. There is a sense of community connectedness which the author brings alive as the reader becomes one with the story. The heartbreak and grief of death to the celebrations of life will elicit those same emotions. The thread through it all is the author's own journey as he discovers himself and renews his spirituality. The reader is immediately pulled into the drama and nakedness, and the beauty and mystery of this incredible part of the world. Ellen L. Bridge, RN, BS, MTS, Public Health Nursing Consultant",
