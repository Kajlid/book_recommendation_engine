  "description": "At 2:01 AM on Labor Day Monday, the first gunshots ring out inside Liberty gay dance club in Jacksonville, Florida. The next few hours find August Brees and Corey Ross, both eighteen and coming off the most transformative and romantic summer of their lives, fighting against all odds to forge something everlasting out of two ephemeral lives. During a time when the crime of living your truest life can get you shamed, condemned, or banished from public life altogether, Liberty is about the battle to love and survive in a world that may not always love you back.Graphic content - reader discretion advised",
