While in deep mourning at the death of her third husband, in a Khanaspur cemetery, Balzeeb meets Haroon. Latif and Haroon simultaneously grow closer and apart as they share their pursuit of “The Princess,” as she is known. The spools of mystery surrounding Balzeeb are woven majestically around the myth of the serpent, tragically unaware of her true nature.Romance Quartet is a weaver's dream, exploring its depths ranging from paranormal to metaphysical and unfolding during the War of Independence which split the continent of Hind into India and Pakistan. Transcending all religions and impaling the heart, this story’s message is eternal, endearing and not one you will soon forget.",
