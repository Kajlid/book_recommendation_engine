  "description": "Recently retired Navy SEAL Luke Paulson feels strangely comfortable in a war zone—it’s adjusting to the real world and all its challenges where he falls short. When his sister becomes ill and his mother’s Alzheimer’s care lands solely on his shoulders, Luke needs cash. Protecting an international law student who is as intelligent as she is beautiful seems the perfect fit.  In Washington, D.C., Chief Justice Thornhill is being threatened by a domestic terrorist group, and his granddaughter Charlotte is their target. Initially she seems none-too-pleased with her new bodyguard shadowing her every move, but a night on the town with a few too many cocktails quickly changes the way she views the sexy SEAL.  But when Luke deceives her to get the upper hand, he realizes too late he’s risked losing it all, including the girl who has turned his life upside down by stealing his heart. His toughest mission yet may be convincing her to trust him again.",
