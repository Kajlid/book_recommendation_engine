  "description": "Age of Vice is an epic, action-packed story propelled by the wealth,corruption, and bloodthirsty violence of the Wadia family—loved by some, loathed by others, feared by all.In the shadow of lavish farmhouses, drug-filled parties, rapacious business deals and predatory political play, three lives become dangerously intertwined: Ajay is the watchful servant, born into poverty, who rises through the family’s ranks. Sunny is the dilettante heir who dreams of outshining his father but doesn’t have his ruthlessness to succeed. And Neda is the curious journalist caught between morality and desire.Transporting readers from the dusty and violent towns of Uttar Pradesh to the corrosive, glittering energy of New Delhi, Age of Vice is the great novel about power, corruption, and the ways it works in India today. This is binge-worthy entertainment at its literary best.",
