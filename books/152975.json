  "description": "Back in the early 70's, twelve-year-old Judy's life was one of pure survival. Outside her own private cave of secrets, our Vietnam War vets were returning home amidst insults and accusations of being \"baby killers\" and rock-n'roll music was being blasted all over America. But the biggest news for Judy wasn't around the partying scene at Woodstock-it was at the military base where she lived. For the next thirty years, Judy struggled with feelings of insignificance and guilt, all from a lifetime of tainted choices. As she says, \"The Lord has constantly wooed my heart back to Him,\" and, \"Freedom meant grasping onto the only peace that truly lasts-the peace that comes from surrendering and trusting in my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.\"Judy's heart was set free, and the unique, youthful, optimistic, hippie chick that had been hiding inside that cave all those years finally emerged when Judy became \"made new.\"",
