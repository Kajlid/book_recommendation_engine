  "description": "He’s controlling, manipulative, dangerous… and I’m in love with him. Rich and powerful, Richard is used to getting whatever he wants… and he wants me. This isn’t a romance. It’s a dark and twisted obsession. A game of ever-increasingly depraved acts. Every time I fight it, he just pulls me deeper into his deception. The slightest disobedience to his rules brings swift punishment. My life as I knew it is gone. He now controls everything. I’m caught in his web, the harder I struggle, the more entangled I become.I no longer know my own mind. He owns my body, making me crave his painful touch. But the worst deception of all? He’s made me love him. If I don’t break free soon, there will be no escape for me.",
