  "description": "The figure of Muhammad, a humble man from the Mecca who initiated a religion accessible to all, is still the subject of ongoing controversies in the Western world. Karen Armstrong narrates the beginnings of Islam a word which means submission and peace , and of the theological and political disputes that soon affected the lives of families living in the Mecca or Medina. Muhammad is described as a complex and passionate man, politically wise and true to what he understood to be a personal and transcendental mission. This book, which includes a prologue written after the September 11th attacks, is a defense against the prejudice directed toward a religion that is practiced by many believers worldwide.",
