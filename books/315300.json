  "description": "Aiza has always dreamt of becoming a Knight. It's the highest military honor in the once-great Bayt-Sajji Empire, and as a member of the subjugated Ornu people, Knighthood is her only path to full citizenship. Ravaged by famine and mounting tensions, Bayt-Sajji finds itself on the brink of war once again, so Aiza can finally enlist in the competitive Squire training program.It's not how she imagined it, though. Aiza must navigate new friendships, rivalries, and rigorous training under the unyielding General Hende, all while hiding her Ornu background. As the pressure mounts, Aiza realizes that the \"greater good\" that Bayt-Sajji's military promises might not include her, and that the recruits might be in greater danger than she ever imagined.Aiza will have to choose, once and for all: loyalty to her heart and heritage, or loyalty to the Empire.",
