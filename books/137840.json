  "title": "The World of Odysseus",
  "description": "The World of Odysseus is a concise and penetrating account of the society that gave birth to the Iliad and the Odyssey --a book that provides a vivid picture of the Greek Dark Ages, its men and women, works and days, morals and values. Long celebrated as a pathbreaking achievement in the social history of the ancient world, M.I. Finley's brilliant study remains, as classicist Bernard Knox notes in his introduction to this new edition, \"as indispensable to the professional as it is accessible to the general reader\"--a fundamental companion for students of Homer and Homeric Greece.",
