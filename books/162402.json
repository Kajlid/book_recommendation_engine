  "description": "Ex nihilo nihil fit: From nothing, nothing comes.Enter the world of Edda-Earth, in which Rome never fell, science and magic coexist, all the gods are real . . . and war is comingEveryone must serve. Everyone must sacrifice.The god-born: Sigrun Caetia, valkyrie of Tyr, born in Nova Germania, across the seaThe summoner: Trennus Matrugena, son of a petty king, native of CaledoniaThe archmage: Kanmi Eshmunazar, a former wharf-rat of Tyre, CarthageThe godslayer: Adam ben Maor, special forces, of JudeaThe prophetess: Sophia, Pythia of DelphiThe truthsayer: Minori Sasaki, scientist and sorcerer, native of HokkaidoAnd the man who brings them together in Rome's service: Propraetor Antonius Valerius Livorus.Together, they pursue a great mystery: Some believe that the world is about to end. Certainly, prophecy indicates so. Some of the gods are making provisions for that day, including reviving the long-prohibited custom of human sacrifice.How do they stop this, and how deep does the mystery go? Why does a dying man taunt Livorus, asking him if he knows where his gods are? And why does prophecy suggest that Sigrun will be the sole survivor of Ragnarok?This is alternate history that goes beyond merely filing the serial numbers off world events. A wholly-re-imagined world awaits, blending fantasy, science-fiction, history, and other genres at will._______________\"More than a mere adventure, the story succeeds in tapping into deeper ideas of religious tolerance and pluralism. Though some may find themselves lost in the vast sea of gods, rituals, violence, and beliefs, readers excited by a tour of this highly imaginative world will thoroughly enjoy the ride.\" --Kirkus Reviews https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-re...",
