For Surla, being a magical kitty definitely has its perks during times like these, and blending in with the French culture of 1730 may not be as hard as it seems. Now, if only she could get a prince to fall in love with a peasant, then the Morreau Kingdom could be saved from black magic threatening the throne.",
