  "description": "Michael tells us the story of his dysfunctional family and promises to reveal why he killed his girlfriend, Kelly. He also blames himself for the suffering of his younger sister, Kim, whose life is spinning out of control. As the story develops, we begin to discover more about the extraordinary psychological connection between Michael and Kim and the reasons for Kim’s agony. Will Michael’s attempts to ‘help’ his sister finally succeed in destroying her and how exactly has he been punished for his crime? Fans of 'The Catcher In The Rye' may recognise its echoes in this even darker and more surreal, British re-telling.",
