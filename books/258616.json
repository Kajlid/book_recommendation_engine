  "description": "The stockings are hung, the lights are aglow, and the mistletoe is ready for kisses to be stolen beneath it. There’s just one problem…none of those decorations are in James and my apartment. We just started our happily ever after – we’re newly engaged, in a new city, with new friends. We’ve both given up a lot to make this relationship work, but I never thought I might have to give up my love for Christmas. How did I not know that my fiancé was a total Christmas grouch? Don’t get me wrong, I love James Hunter and I always will. But for years, he’s been celebrating anti-Christmas with his friends. He's lost the Christmas spirit that he had when he was a child. And he doesn't seem to want to thaw his frozen heart.So I’ve decided that it’s my new mission to make him believe again. And with a little sprinkle of Christmas magic, it just might be possible.",
