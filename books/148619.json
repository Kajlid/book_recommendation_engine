  "title": "Angelina and Men, A Heroine's Journey",
  "description": "Executive by day, lover by night, Angelina hunts for men and business in hope of finding love and success. Convinced that she is more than a daughter, a lover or a corporate executive, she leaves the conventions behind to find new ways to live. Questioning everything, pope, prince charming, mad men and material girls, she travels from Canada, Europe and America to measure her worth. Monks, artists, musicians and magicians, all have something to teach her to be free and serene. Told with humor and sensuality, the story captures a girl-to-womanâ€™s evolution from the eighties to the new millennium. Demystifying God, sex and commerce, when plastic cards, careers and lovers have come and go, she climbs the mountain and becomes one with it.",
