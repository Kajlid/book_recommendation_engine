  "title": "The Weight of Shadows: A Memoir of Immigration & Displacement",
  "description": "Tracing his story of becoming a US citizen, Jose Orduna's memoir explores the complex issues of immigration and assimilation.In July of 2011 Jose Orduna was naturalized as an American citizen, a decision made, he admits, in bad faith and purely out of self-interest. Though grateful to his parents for their many sacrifices, which resulted in his citizenship, he feels anger and resentment towards a punitive and racist government. With a searingly original voice, Orduna reflects on the complicated and contradictory experience of morphing into a legal young, brown immigrant. He describes the absurd feeling of being given a piece of paper his naturalization certificate handed to him by a robed judge to certify something he has always known: he has a right to be here and is, at least in theory, equal under the law. A trenchant exploration of race, class, and identity, \"The Weight of Shadows\" chronicles the process of becoming a North American citizen in a post-9/11 United States.\"",
