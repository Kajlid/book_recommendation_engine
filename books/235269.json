  "description": "Under threat of alien invasion, humanity’s only hope is Project Swarm, a clone army bred to fight for them. To die for them.When Alpha Nine awakens in his pod, he believes it’s his mission to join the war and defend humanity. But first he must pass the phases. Each stage is designed to test a clone’s strength, wit, and courage; those who fail, are recycled. It’s a necessary evil.But as he watches more and more of them die, Alpha Nine is struck with the impossible thought that maybe, maybe the phases aren’t actually meant to test them—but to exterminate them.The clones must band together to escape the facility, but what they discover when they reach the surface of Sydney city, is much more than any of them could have expected. Project Swarm may have been bred to die, but now they have a new directive.",
