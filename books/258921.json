  "description": "As an assassin of the Lifeless League, there are two rules I live by:  1. Never kill another hunter.  2. Obey orders.  When I find that my newest set of targets are branded with the Mark of the Hunter, I don’t know who I can trust anymore. I can’t take their lives without knowing why these mysterious men turned their backs on the League.  A choice will have to be made eventually. Even if they refuse to make anything easy for me. The four brooding ex-assassins give me trials, training, and tests to study my unusual powers and prove myself as one of them. A deadly plan is now in place but they’ve all made one grave mistake: Underestimating me. Because I’m adding a third and final rule to my list:  3. Survive.  This is a Reverse Harem Series, recommended for readers 18 and over.",
