  "description": "When my parents died in an accident, they left me like a piece of furniture to a grandfather I never knew existed. In Ireland. As if moving halfway around the world wasn't bad enough, I soon learned my mother had left behind some unresolved drama - dark secrets that were screaming to be uncovered. And then there are the things I can't explain. Strange things keep happening around me. Happening to me. Is it because of Sebastian, the golden-haired stranger who showed up in town at the same time as I did? Or Ethan, the kid locals whisper plays with dark magic?  Maybe both. Maybe neither. But someone is definitely out to get me, and I need to figure out why, and fast... because I'm discovering powers of my own. Powers that I can't contain. And no matter what I do or who is to blame, if I don't discover the real reason my mother fled Ireland, more people are going to die.  MERMAIDS ARE REAL. And they're going to kill us all. This is of the first FULL book of the Ocean Depths series; it includes parts One and Two and is almost 140,000 words long.  Shearwater is a young adult mermaid novel that will appeal to lovers of paranormal romance, urban fantasy, witches, Irish mythology, supernatural folklore and, of course, mermaids.",
