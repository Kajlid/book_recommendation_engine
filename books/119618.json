  "description": "Set in the not-too-distant future, Baxter Auriga is set with the task of collecting a live specimen dragon for sending to a private zoo. That, believe it or not, was the easy part.Escaping from the police patrolling the restricted zones is a little more tricky. Fighting off pirates isn't a walk in the park either.Getting dropped onto a penal colony at the back of beyond, forced into the dragon fights and trying to stay alive ... well ... it goes without saying. But when the dragon Bax caught refuses to fight and wants to be taken home, now it's just got really hard.A satirical look at the future of space travel, technology and genetic engineering, this laugh-out-loud adventure sees cutthroat battles with salvage pirates, incredible action in the dragon arena, and the opening salvo to interplanetary war.",
