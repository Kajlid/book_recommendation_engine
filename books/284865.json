  "description": "You might be wondering how you’ll know when your playboy ways are coming to an end. For some it might be an unexpected pregnancy (ahem… you know who), for others it might be finally landing the one woman you’ve always wanted (cough… I won’t mention any names). For me, it was the death of my mentor and the subsequent reading of their will.The signs were there, they always are. But I didn’t notice them until it was too late, and my demise was complete.Demise Sign #1 – You find yourself thrust into the land of responsibility and you don’t immediately hightail it out of town.Demise Sign #2 – Despite being stuck with the world’s biggest Jekyll & Hyde, some sadistic part of you actually enjoys spending time with her.Demise Sign #3 – Your family suddenly stops wanting to weigh in on every decision in your life.Demise Sign #4 – Somehow you end up being the voice of reason in your tumultuous partnership.Demise Sign #5 – You start thinking of other people before yourself.Demise Sign #6 – You agree to put yourself in the middle of an Alaskan reality TV show that has both of you sleeping in the same tent.Demise Complete.",
