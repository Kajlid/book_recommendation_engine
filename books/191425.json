  "title": "Cities",
  "description": "A magisterial study of the city from its beginnings to the mega-conurbations of today.Cities is a fascinating exploration of the nature of the city and city life, of its structures, development and inhabitants.From the ruins of the earliest cities to the present, John Reader explores how cities coalesce, develop and thrive, how they can decline and die, how they remake themselves. He investigates their parasitic relationship with the countryside around them, the webs of trade and immigration they rely upon to survive, how they feed and water themselves and dispose of their wastes. The book is a sweeping exploration of what the city is and has been, fit to stand alongside Lewis Mumfordâ€™s 1962 classic The City in History .",
