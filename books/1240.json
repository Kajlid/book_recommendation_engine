  "title": "Property and Freedom",
  "description": "\"A superb book about a topic that should be front and center in the American political debate\" ( National Review ), from the acclaimed Harvard scholar and historian of the Russian RevolutionAn exploration of a wide range of national and political systems to demonstrate persuasively that private ownership has served over the centuries to limit the power of the state and enable democratic institutions to evolve and thrive in the Western world.Beginning with Greece and Rome, where the concept of private property as we understand it first developed, Richard Pipes then shows us how, in the late medieval period, the idea matured with the expansion of commerce and the rise of cities. He contrasts England, a country where property rights and parliamentary government advanced hand-in-hand, with Russia, where restrictions on ownership have for centuries consistently abetted authoritarian regimes; finally he provides reflections on current and future trends in the United States.Property and Freedom is a brilliant contribution to political thought and an essential work on a subject of vital importance.",
