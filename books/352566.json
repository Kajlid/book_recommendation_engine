  "description": "Genevieve is like my little sister. Our rock star parents are all best friends, and we basically grew up together. She’s a girl I want to protect from the dangerous things in the world, not one of the groupies that gather outside the stage door now that I’m a rock star, too.Genny isn’t a one-night stand kind of girl. She’s too serious and intense for that. And she feels things way too deeply.Even more importantly, on the night of our first kiss five years ago, she was only seventeen.But now she’s all grown up. And so am I.And the holidays are made for magic and second chances…right?",
