  "description": "***Warning: The DC Chili Cook-off has nothing on this red-hot erotic romance**** Already burned once by love, DC metro firefighter Seth Ripley thought he'd learned his lesson--women who break the rules are against the rules. When a hot blonde catches his eye at the annual fireman's ball, he's interested. But she's breaking the buddy rules and that makes her against his rules. So why does he want to burn the rule book? Trauma surgeon Eden Thomas has never experienced anything like the inferno raging inside after one kiss from the new firefighter. Despite her best friend's warnings to take care, self-preservation is the last thing on Eden's mind as she starts to play with fire. The problem is that when you play with fire, you might just get hurt.",
