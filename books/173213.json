  "title": "Gibbous House",
  "description": "Moffat is an indiscriminate killer and verbose criminal thriving in the underbelly of 19th-century London. When he unexpectedly inherits Gibbous House, an expansive estate in Northumbria, he heads north on a journey that raises questions about his own identity and quickly leads to issues of morality, addiction and murder. Gibbous House, Moffat discovers, already plays home to a motley cast of the beautiful and seductive Ellen Pardoner, the conniving attaché Maccabi and the arrogant scientist Enoch—manager of the mansion’s esoteric \"collection.\" Moffat’s greed-fuelled pursuit of his inheritance takes him deep into a crazed, conspiratorial plot and a series of tense, psychological showdowns. Gibbous House is a dark, Victorian thriller told with modern wit and brimming with historical detail. Rich with atmosphere and intense psychological drama, it brings modern irony to the rich texture of the classic gothic novel.",
