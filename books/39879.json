  "title": "Hermes the Olympian",
  "description": "Long before words could be written, the stories of the brave Olympians were songs sung and poems told at special gatherings and on feast days. The best of these tales always seemed to include the deeds of our faithful messenger Hermes but somehow he never seemed to get the glory or the credit for it, even when he saved the day. This is a tale of toil, tragedy and temptation, love with a triangular twist. It is filled with a freak show of mutated monsters, glorious gadgets and awesome artifacts. This is our chance to see for ourselves how Hermes was the real hero of the Olympians. Let him mesmerise you with his music, Charm you with his caduceus, and carry you invisibly with him as he flies against the odds in his epic struggle against the evil Hades. Can Hermes find a way to save the tree of life? You had better hope he can, your afterlife depends on it!",
