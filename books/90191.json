  "description": "James Robinson, a world-renowned expert in exotic diseases, is sent to contain a mysterious viral outbreak at an American military base deep in the Yorkshire Wolds. But it soon becomes apparent to the hard-drinking Robinson that something far more sinister is afoot. As Robinson battles to get to the bottom of events he finds himself up against both a wall of silence surrounding the true function of the Black Crags facility, and a “disaster-relief” team with a deadly end game. But then Robinson is not what he seems either. Whilst paying lip-service to the strict orders issued by his paymasters his real agenda instead revolves around the fallout from events at a remote research station down in the Antarctic barely a year ago. Driven by revenge rather than a sense of duty, Robinson will stop at nothing in order to accomplish his personal mission at Black Crags …Black Crags is a dry, droll, slow-burning, slightly “old-school” thriller with a twist in the tail and a central character whose loyalties and motives remain decidedly murky right through to the end.",
