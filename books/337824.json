  "title": "Stepbrother Daddy",
  "description": "I want to be a good man, to put prison and everything that preceded it behind me. But my first day out all I can see is what’s standing directly in front of me. Her…my new stepsister. I know I’m not supposed to have fantasies about the daughter of my dad’s new wife, but I can’t help myself. I haven’t seen a woman in years, and I’ve never seen a woman quite like her…maybe because she doesn’t exactly seem like a woman. She’s eighteen but she’s more like a little girl, and one that never really had the father figure she needed. I’ll be the man she needs all right, her daddy…and a whole lot more. Because once I get a taste of her she becomes my everything…no matter what anyone thinks. This is a standalone, steamy, instalove romance with a guaranteed HEA. No other woman drama. No dubcon. No cliffhanger. It’s also “stepbrother-lite” consisting of light role playing, but no hardcore DDLG things such as diapers, pacifiers, etc. The characters are not blood related and everyone in the story is of legal age (18).",
