  "description": "Sassy, classy, and in no need of a man. That's me.At least, until now.My mouth has been known to get me into trouble, and now is a perfect example. I've been asked to tutor the star of the football team, Zach Knight. To top it off, no one can know, and I have to pretend to be his girlfriend as a cover story.And heâ€™s insufferable, thinking with this other head. But the more I sass him, the more he wants me. The more I say no, a word the Big Man on Campus rarely hears, the more he chases me. But his alpha attitude is doing crazy things to me.Every snarl I make sounds more like a purr. Every bratty pout looks more like a naughty invitation.And as the line between real and pretend blurs, I suddenly find myself wanting Zach to take everything from me.My body, my virginity, and maybe even my heart.",
