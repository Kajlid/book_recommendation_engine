  "title": "The Step Child: A True Story of a Broken Childhood",
  "description": "Abused by her stepmother between the ages of five and eleven, Donna Ford was labeled 'the bastard', the 'little witch,' and 'the evil one.' She was beaten, isolated, and afraid to even look at her own reflection by physical and mental abuse that eventually progressed to the most appalling sexual attacks. Despite an horrendous early life, Donna is now a successful artist and mother of three with an enormous enthusiasm and an optimism which completely belies her experiences. In 2003, Donna watched as her stepmother was found guilty of 'procuring a minor' for sexual abuse and sentenced to two years in prison.",
