  "title": "When a Gargoyle Pretends to be Santa Claus",
  "description": "Snowballs it’s Christmas!  It’s been a busy few months for the newly awakened gargoyles. Still hidden from humans and unused to celebrating the holidays, the gargoyles are forgetting their troubles to enjoy their first Christmas as a clan.  But when the gargoyle Brom is mistaken for Santa Claus by Daphne - a six-year-old human - he plays along to make sure she keeps his existence a secret. However, it isn’t long before he finds himself drawn to her mother, Joely, and the only thing that seems to matter is spending time with them.  This novella takes place after the third book in the series and is approximately 20,000 words in length. Caution is advised as this is intended for mature readers only - it contains sexy times between a gruff gargoyle and a human.",
