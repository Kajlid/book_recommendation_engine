The only daughter of ridiculously wealthy parents, she parties hard, she drinks a lot, and she has a tabloid reputation for being a wild child. Unfortunately, that image also makes her a target for every greedy lowlife on the planet.Nickolas, Levi, and Zeek Brockman are trying to live a quiet life. When they find a young woman suffering a drug overdose and dumped in the middle of the forest, they risk exposing their existence to save her. Yet saving her has a side effect—it makes her one of them—so discovering that she is mate to all three brothers is almost a welcome surprise.But a quiet life and massive media interest in Ruby’s disappearance simply don’t mix. And it sure doesn’t help that whoever tried to kill her wants to finish the job. There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings.
