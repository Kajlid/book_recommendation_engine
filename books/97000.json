But there are a lot of secrets hidden under a Texas sky. . .\"Katie always knew she'd marry Cole one day-until he broke her dreams and her heart. But now that Katie's father is sick, she's back home, older, wiser and nowhere near the love-sick fool she once was.Cole knows Katie doesn't want anything to do with him. But after so many years, he can't pretend she's no more than a neighbor. Not when thinking about her cherry lip gloss and hell-for-leather passion is keeping him up all night. Holding his ground was hard enough when she was seventeen. Now that she's her own woman, Cole's heart doesn't stand a chance. . .",
