  "description": "This book turns away from the highways and byways of middle America for a fast, exhilarating ride along the Route 66 of American language and popular culture.Exploding much of America's self-created self-image, Bryson de-mythologises his native land - explaining how a dusty desert hamlet with neither woods nor holly became Hollywood, how the Wild West wasn't won, why Americans say \"lootenant\" and \"Toosday\", how Americans were eating junk food long before the word itself was cooked up - as well as exposing the true origins of the G-string, the original $64,000 question and Dr Kellogg of cornflakes fame.",
