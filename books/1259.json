  "title": "You Are Free",
  "description": "From the bestselling author of Caucasia, riveting, unexpected stories about identity under the influence of appearances, attachments, and longing. Look out for Danzy Senna's latest book, New People, on sale in August! Each of these eight remarkable stories by Danzy Senna tightrope-walks tantalizingly, sometimes frighteningly, between defined states: life with and without mates and children, the familiar if constraining reference points provided by race, class, and gender. Tensions arise between a biracial couple when their son is admitted to the private school where they'd applied on a lark. A new mother hosts an old friend, still single, and discovers how each of them pities-and envies- the other. A young woman responds to an adoptee in search of her birth mother, knowing it is not she.",
