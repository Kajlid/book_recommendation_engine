Recent Book RADIO INTERVIEW: http://goo.gl/lCck9F \"As the author, I had to do a lot of soul searching as I wrote this book, deciding how many of the stories describing my faults and challenges I wanted the world to know. There's a difference between sharing a single story in front of hundreds in the audiences where I appear, but so many intimate details was something else. I concluded that I had to share my hurts, my fears and my not so wise decisions so others know that they are not alone as I teach them how to eliminate fear from their lives by raising their vibration and moving forward.\" Blessings, LeeZa Donatella",
