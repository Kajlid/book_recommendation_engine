  "description": "In the spring of 2009, Nigel Tomm and his merry band headed into the woods of rural Europe to write a book. A low-budget book its young producers called Remix Culture roared across internet and changed the velocity of abstract literature forever. Today, its ferocious ingenuity, relentless shocks and gore-gushing abstractness remain an absolute standard of modern abstract novel. WARNING: The present abstract novel contains no words. It's abstract - very abstract. Preview it at Tomm's blog http://tinyurl.com/cawvds",
