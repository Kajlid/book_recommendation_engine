  "description": "To celebrate DAW Books's 30 years of publishing in the sf and fantasy genres, Wollheim and Gilbert have assembled these volumes that feature authors who have published under the DAW banner and whose works have made significant contributions to the field of imaginative literature. An essay by the editors (repeated in both volumes) relates the history of DAW and its founders, Donald and Elsie Wollheim, while individual author or editor commentaries introduce many of the stories. The fantasy collection includes a variety of stories, including Mercedes Lackey's expression of an author's worst nightmare (\"After Midnight\") and Christopher Stasheff's melancholy parable of a wizard's journey of bitter self-discovery (\"Coronach of the Bell\"). Contributions by other notable fantasy writers such as Tanith Lee, Melanie Rawn, and Lynn Abbey round out this collection of 18 tales. The sf anthology collects a stellar group of stories, including Brian Aldiss's cautionary tale of a space-faring warship whose passage results in the death of civilizations (\"Aboard the Beatitude\") and Tad Williams's wry recounting of the chat room at the end of the world (\"Not with a Whimper, Either\"). Stories by authors including Frederik Pohl, Timothy Zahn, and Kate Elliott are also among the 19 selections in this well-balanced volume. Together or separately, both books are recommended for most libraries.",
