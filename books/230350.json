So far, the flat Florida landscape and alligator-infested swamps have failed to impress Ella Dessa, and thoughts of Indian problems strike fear deep in her heart. She longs for the beautiful mountains of Georgia, a treasure her small family left behind. But the decision has been made, and tragedy leaves Ella Dessa and her children at the mercy of a runaway slave and Seminole Indians. Then the shelter of a deserted log cabin and the return of one of her husband's brothers wraps her in a blanket of hope. But can they make their way back to the mountains?",
