  "title": "The Gatekeeper",
  "description": "Watching the sun rise on the midsummer solstice at Stonehenge, Jenny's holiday takes a terrifying turn when a chance combination of time, location and ancient Druid magic sweeps her back to the year 1347. The ancient Gatekeeper, who should have prevented this, intends to hide Jenny in the safety of her cave until the next time warp, but fate is against them. Jenny has to live in the squalid conditions of a peasant village. While hiding in the forest she saves a Lady from thieves and is taken to live in her castle but she is not much better off there after she uncovers the younger son's murderous plot to depose the old Lord, his father. Matters are made worse by the greed of a powerful neighbour and the evil magician that controls him. Can Jenny's ingenuity save the day? And more importantly, can it get her back to her own century?",
