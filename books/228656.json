  "description": "Who says you need a man to be happy?After her divorce, Ruth Roth finds the love of her life: herself. And she's in a comfortable place until a silver-tongued Prince Charming fronts up in his shiny Merc and tickles her discarded, little-girl fantasies. He tells her she is The One; their love is written in the stars.It must be a misprint. He’s got the goods and then some, but a romance with this particular PC is not so PC! Still …Ruth’s life plays out more like ancient myth than fairy tale. And what hot-blooded woman can resist forbidden fruit?With her mama squawking about the taboo-ness of such a liaison, and a horrid, 'armed and dangerous' neighbour weighing in, Ruth decides it's time to live life in the fast lane again. She takes up with the hottie and takes on the harpies.Tensions mount, though, and even her man can't protect her from the voices in her head. It looks like he can't muzzle his own either.When an earth-shattering revelation causes him to give her grief-and makes her feel like she's dating her mother-it leaves Ruth wondering if their love can survive. More to the point, does she want it to?Book 2 in the Ruth Roth Series(Book 1: Amazon #1 Bestseller, Odyssey in a Teacup)",
