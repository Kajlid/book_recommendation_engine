  "title": "The Mysterious Mr. Quin",
  "description": "Harley Quin is an enigma. Even his friend Mr. Satterthwaite is unable to understand how the man seems to appear and disappear almost like a trick of the light - and when he does appear it's usually in the sparkle of sunshine, or surrounded by a spectrum of coloured light pouring through a stained glass window.Indeed, he is Harlequin. The only consistent thing about the mysterious Mr. Quin is that his presence is always a harbinger of love .. or death.Quin and Satterthwaite appear in a string of short stories by the incomparable Agatha Christie. She often said that some of them are among her personal favourites. They'll be yours too.Librarian's note #1: the stories are: 1 The Coming of Mr. Quin; 2 The Shadow on the Glass; 3 At the 'Bells and Motley,' 4 The Sign in the Sky; 5 The Soul of the Croupier; 6 The Man from the Sea; 7 The Voice in the Dark; 8 The Face of Helen; 9 The Dead Harlequin; 10 The Bird with the Broken Wing; 11 The World's End; and, 12 Harlequin's Lane.Librarian's note #2: besides those in this collection, there are two more Mr. Quin stories found in other collections: The Love Detectives, and The Harlequin Tea Set. Mr. Satterthwaite also appears in Three Act Tragedy and Dead Man's Mirror. All by Agatha Christie, of course!Librarian's note #3: this is the entry for the collection of 12 short stories, 'The Mysterious Mr. Quin.'
