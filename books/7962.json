  "title": "The Original Hitchhiker Radio Scripts",
  "description": "The legendary BBC series did indeed push back the barriers of radio comedy, and in so doing so spawned records, books, a stage production, a TV series, a computer adventure game, even a towel, and attracted a deluge of letters from curious audiences throughout the world.To satisfy this curiosity, here are the twelve original radio scripts â€“ Hitch-Hiker as it was originally written, and exactly as it was broadcast on Radio 4 for the very first time. They include amendments and additions made during recordings, bits which were reluctantly cut for reasons of time, and notes on the writing and producing of the series by Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins.For those who have always longed to know why, who, how, when, where, and what its all about, these scripts are essential reading.",
