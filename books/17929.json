  "title": "The CoolKids: An Emotional Hardcore Odyssey",
  "description": "The CoolKids is the story of the last week of high school for instantly iconic idealist Bartholomew Moriarty. Bart is no ordinary teenager; he’s that one kid in every class, whose superior worldview and punk rock shoot-from-the-hip style make him a thorn in everyone’s side. He’s the product of a scene now 30 years in the making, leaning on words like “integrity” and “credibility” to bridge any gap in logic, and he advocates with fire and brimstone from one of the most extreme teenage points of Hardcore Straight Edge Vegan. The suburban tranquility that surrounds him is in marked contrast to his music and its militant call to rebellion as well as his obsession with the brands that define his identity and the superiority that adherence to his own strict code creates. Bart is caught up in the struggle of the metalheads against jocks, jocks against crombies, crombies against muggles, muggles against metalheads, and everyone against that fringe group of Hardcore Straight Edge Vegans. It’s a heated battle, the coveted title of The Coolkids has been at stake for many years, but that is all coming to an end next week, that crown being laid to rest at a ceremony called graduation. As leader of his cutting edge clique, his gang’s idealism starts to change as the forces of graduation push them to make choices about their future; rumors of friends going off to college and getting jobs push Bart to a state of paranoia as his social movement seems to be coming to an abrupt end. If he can stop graduation, convince his friends not to go to college, or prove their superiority to the other cliques and take his movement to a wider audience, just maybe he’ll be able to save everything he’s fought so hard to establish.",
