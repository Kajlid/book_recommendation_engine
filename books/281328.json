  "title": "The Unseen Hand: An Introduction to the Conspiratorial View of History",
  "description": "It is the contention of the author that the major events of the past, the wars, the depressions and the revolutions, have been planned years in advance by an international conspiracy. This view is called the Conspiratorial View of History, and is definitely not the view held by the majority of historians today. The more traditional view is called The Accidental View of History, and it holds that no one really knows why events happen--they just do.Ralph Epperson started researching this book 20 years before it was published even though he didn't realize it at the time. He graduated from the University of Arizona.",
