  "description": "Five sisters born beneath the stars Neither bound by blood nor kin Must unify the warring clans And rid the land of sin  Their lives they are beholden A curse atop their heads Broken only by a love divided Betwixt three allied men...  Accacia remains cursed, just like the three vampires she has grown to love, just like the people of Ever Vale and just like the four fated clan daughters of the prophecy. Alongside her vampire knights, Accacia must play her part in breaking the curse or remain under the Queens rule forevermore. Yet, how can she do that when Devin is losing his soul to the darkness, to a fate far worse than death? If Accacia cannot save his soul, then the battle is over before it’s even truly begun. The stakes are high in this final installment of Accacia’s journey as she heads into the queen's castle with her vampire knights. Sacrifices will be made, friendships forged, and alliances sought. This book will conclude Accacia’s journey, but not the Sisters of Hex series. The fate of the clans and the people of Ever Vale will continue with the next ‘sister’, Fern and her angels.  Look out for these books, coming 2018:  #4 Fern’s Decision #5 Fern’s Wings #6 Fern’s Flight  These are reverse harem books and for 18+ readers.",
