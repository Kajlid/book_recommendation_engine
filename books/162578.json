  "description": "Shamus Bead and Jeptha Lawton, chief investigators for the Royal Epidemiological Society, are investigating a potential epidemic in Spitalfields.. Local doctors believe the illnesses to be unrelated episodes of madness, but Bead recognizes one ailment that is neurological in nature. The only question is whether the epidemic is viral, bacterial, or the more complex result of Victorian Londonâ€™s ongoing industrial pollution problem. The investigation turns in an unexpected direction as Shamus must prove that any substance powerful enough to improve health is also potent enough to kill someone. And Shamus and Jeptha's relationship grows deeper and even more complex.",
