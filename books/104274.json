  "description": "Lucy Black must protect the young and vulnerable...but can she protect herself? Late December. A sixteen-year-old girl is found dead on a train line. Detective Sergeant Lucy Black is called to identify the body. The only clues to the dead teenager's last movements are stored in her mobile phone and on social media - and it soon becomes clear that her 'friends' were not as trustworthy as she thought. Lucy is no stranger to death: she is still haunted by the memory of child she failed to save, and the killer she failed to put behind bars. And with a new boss scrutinizing her every move, she is determined that - this time - she will leave no margin for error. Hurt is a tense crime thriller about how, in the hands of a predator, trust can turn into terror. Praise for Little Girl Lost: \"Effortlessly blending Black's personal woes into her professional life, McGilloway weaves a taut police procedural in an unadorned style that belies the stories complexity.\" (Irish Times). \"Cleverly constructed, packed with vibrant and believable characters...It confirms him as one of the most original voices in the notably expanding field of Irish crime fiction .\" (Irish Independent). \"Assured and grittily realistic tale from an author who is being compared to James Lee Burke and Ian Rankin.\" (Sunday Business Post).",
