  "description": "The universe winds down to its end, but all is far from silent. Around Murder, one of the last stars, sisters of divine birth wage a pitiless war. Few can escape the all-consuming conflict that fills the very sky with fire. But this is not the only struggle of mortals and the divine. Above all known realities, two immortal heroes embark across the cosmic Lattice on a desperate quest to save a fading world. On the fabled Seven Worlds, a man made, not born, searches for his birth and his death. Amid the endless world of the Shell, a lone voice seeks to question her fate. And in places that once were the dreams of machines, a lost spirit is reborn.",
