  "description": "I never thought I’d see her again. Never dared to hope. But against all odds, Abigail’s back. Unfortunately she’s as sweet as ever and even more beautiful. And I’m in serious trouble. I’ve learned to hate her in the time she’s been away, but the blazing attraction between us is still there. And now, having her close enough to touch—close enough to taste—I’m in a literal battle for my life. Because my Bloodbound oath still holds, and the punishment for breaking it is still death. The last thing I want is “alone time” with her, but that’s exactly what I get when the queen sends me on a mission, and the only way to keep Abbi alive is to take her with me. In this third book of the Crimson Accord series, the rift between humans and vampires widens, the menace of the Crimson Court intensifies, and the temptation for Reece and Abigail grows to a fever pitch. Will they give in to it? Or will the dangerous secrets that stand between them destroy their chance of love and any hope of living in peace?",
