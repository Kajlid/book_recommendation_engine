He has demons of his own, but together they can get through it all. Obviously.For a while, she's been suspecting that something is wrong with her brother Kyle and her parents. After finding out her life wasn't as perfect as she believed, everything changes. Her brother, her parents, even her best friend had been lying to her.Sometimes forever isn't as long as we'd hoped and when it ends, it comes crashing down, destroying everything in its path. And it hurts like hell.",
