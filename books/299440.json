  "title": "The Woman I Met Everywhere",
  "description": "Sometimes you meet special people in the commonplace. And sometimes you find the same thought, same struggle, same life, same woman - in all the circumstances of an extraordinary life. That is what this book is about. Divided in 5 themes of LOVE, WORK, EMOTIONS, SOCIETY, and WOMEN, this collection of poetry does not contain a heroine. But it contains everyone’s struggles, and everyone’s story, and everyone’s life as I see, as a woman who ruminates and reflects everywhere.",
