  "description": "When I was a girl, my father forced me to swallow a magical crystal. The Dragon’s Tear turned my bones fragile as glass. I was no Ionger strong enough dance or learn to fight… or take any lover until my wedding day. I was destined to wed the King of the Dragons, and only he could restore my health.  Now it is time to fulfill the prophecy. To become King Aurekdel’s bride.  I don’t want him. I want the dashing young head of my guard, Oszin, who has been my best friend and secret crush since I was fifteen.  But Oszin can’t heal me. Only Aurekdel can. I already hate him and his tall, fierce warrior champion Lord Seron.  I really had no idea what I was in for.  Aurekdel is charming and clever and he wants to give me everything I ever wanted and then some. The love of three protective men, a magical garden, a blessed sword, and the role of a great queen. But there is one thing he cannot give me after all: a cure.  The prophecy was a lie. I am still broken and no one knows went wrong. I’m determined to learn to fight for everything I hold dear, but the truth of the prophecy will shatter the kingdom Aurekdel has built...and gain the attention of the dark dragon who will change our destiny.  Glass Princess is an 85,000 word fast-burn reverse harem novel. Warning: cliffhanger ahoy!",
