Two people.Yasmin Ghorami has a lot to be grateful for: a loving family, a fledgling career in medicine and a charming, handsome fianc√©, fellow doctor Joe Sangster.But as the wedding day draws closer and Yasmin's parents get to know Joe's firebrand feminist mother, both families must confront the unravelling of long-held secrets, lies and betrayals.While Yasmin dismantles her own assumptions about the people she holds most dear, she's also forced to ask herself what she really wants in a relationship and what a 'love marriage' actually means.Love Marriage is a story about who we are and how we love today - with all the complications and contradictions of life, desire, marriage and family. What starts as a captivating social comedy develops into a heartbreaking and gripping story of two cultures, two families and two people trying to understand one another.",
