  "description": "It all started with an ad.\"House sitter needed for the summer, free room and board.\"Guess I missed the part about the cocky basketball player sleeping down the hall...Finn Richards is hot, cruel, broken beyond repair. Oh, and did I mention hell-bent on making me quit?Whatever. It's not like his charms work on me, anyway. I'm immune to his cold, hazel eyes, and I'm not even a little bit curious about what really happened that night.Who cares that I let him take my first kiss?Who cares that I'd give him all of my firsts if he just asked?It's just two months. I can definitely go two months without giving him my heart, too...Right?",
