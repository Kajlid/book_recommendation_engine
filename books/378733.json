  "description": "Stephen Stanson hated it all--the world, himself, and his entire life. Only four years ago, everything was perfect. He had his dream job, a perfect girlfriend, a healthy mom. But that was before he was got fired, Valerie dumped him, and Tory died from a massive coronary. Not even music was the same these days. Nothing was. Just the unending pain. Things change drastically for him the night he hears a song from 1997 … a song that meant something to him at the highlight of his life. Suddenly, everything changes--even Stephen. Somehow, someway, he’s magically able to go back in time when he hears the song. Now he has a goal--to repair every wrong into a right. To make his present the way it should have been. To get everything and everyone back again. But that’s way easier said than done. Only a few select songs can take him back, and he can only go back for the duration of each song. Additionally, each song only has transcendental abilities to a certain point. After he gets used to the vibes, they become useless. Despite this grand ability, it won’t last forever. And every time he fixes one thing, something else goes horribly wrong … until it becomes worse than it had been in the beginning. Stephen must find the right path to repair his broken past. Can he do it? Is it possible? If it is, he’d better hurry. Even time travelers don’t have all the time in the world.",
