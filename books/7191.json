  "description": "Jim Crow Guide documents the system of legally imposed American apartheid that prevailed during what Stetson Kennedy calls \"the long century from Emancipation to the Overcoming.\" The mock guidebook covers every area of activity where the tentacles of Jim Crow reached. From the texts of state statutes, municipal ordinances, federal regulations, and judicial rulings, Kennedy exhumes the legalistic skeleton of Jim Crow in a work of permanent value for scholars and of exceptional appeal for general readers.",
