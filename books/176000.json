  "description": "Safe. Affordable. Good schools. Great neighbors. Homogenized. Sterile. Aimless boredom bordering on apathy. Anxiety. Alcoholism. Abuse of legal and illegal drugs. Garages full of everything but vehicles. Backyard BBQs gone bad. Cable lines cut burying Fluffy. Lions and tigers and…if only.The rumors are all true. Especially the one about a modern-day Robinson Crusoe lost in the bosom and banality of a cookie-cutter neighborhood at the edge of Any City, U.S.A. Given a long commute, too much cockamamie news and an ancient manual typewriter somehow hooked up to the internet, the creature feared and cursed and lovingly called Monster in the Suburbs has discovered a purpose in to toss the force-fed fairy tales right back at Mom, Dad, Gramps and civic leaders alike. Then again, he might just go back to tunneling his way right the f*** out and head to Ibiza after all. We’ll have to see.",
