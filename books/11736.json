  "title": "Buffalito Contingency",
  "description": "Publishers Weekly: \"Fans of old-fashioned SF will love this fast-paced, chaotic, and good-natured adventure full of semi-farcical humor and pleasantly believable aliens.\" Conroy has left Earth far behind and taken his hypnosis act beyond Human Space. It should be show business as usual, except for the energy being the size of a hundred suns that wants to study him, a plot to smuggle liquid gravity, a troupe of alien sex wrestlers, a hypnotized ghost, and Reggie his buffalito stuck in a saurian toilet... BUFFALITO CONTINGENCY is the exciting sequel to the popular BUFFALITO DESTINY.",
