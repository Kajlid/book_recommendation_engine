  "description": "Kids can open this kit, add a dash of imagination, and board the ship captained by the swashbuckling pirate, Jack Blackthorn. They start their adventure-filled voyage with this box of pirate’s booty. It includes a captain’s hat, a hook, an eye patch, pirate’s coins, washable tattoos, a treasure map, a plastic pirate’s dagger, a miniature spy glass, and a tiny model of a ship in a bottle. Packed with these items is the 32-page hardcover book, The Pirate Captain’s The Darkest Secrets of Captain Blackthorn. The color-illustrated book introduces young readers to a typical crew on a pirate ship, instructs on tying sailors’ knots, describes life aboard a pirate ship, talks about navigating on the high seas, and advises on storming a ship, ambush techniques, and locating places for burying captured treasure. Here’s an imaginative voyage of pure fun for boys and girls.",
