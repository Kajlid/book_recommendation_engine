  "description": "All is not as it seems in Memphis in the spring just before the Cotton Carnival and International Barbeque Contest. It seems that Aires Saxon,the Patriarch of the aristocratic Delta BarBQ Saxon clan and father of the newly-crowned Maid of Cotton has gotten himself bumped off with extreme prejudice. On the previous night, some members of the Bones Family street gang had paused in their deconstruction of an ATM machine to deconstruct a seemingly innocent tourist. Somehow, these events seem to be connected with the load of rotten pork shoulders en route to Memphis.  It's going to be up to Memphis homicide detective J.W. Ragsdale and his partner Tyrone Walker to untangle this mess.Or die trying.",
