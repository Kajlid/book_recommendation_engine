But as Darby stumbles her way into a job at the town's run-down amusement park, Holly Jolly Land, her summer quickly goes from merry to miserable: the boy of Christmas present is absent, a boy of Christmas past is her supervisor, and the town seems to be losing its cheer as it strives to become more commercial. As she tries to sort out her love life, Darby grows positively Scroogey until she gets wrapped up in reinventing Holly Jolly Land—and the town—as the wonderlands they once were.",
