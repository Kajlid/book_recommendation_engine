  "description": "Sometimes love needs a little push in the right direction.Or a good and proper shove.At least that’s what Dianna Trowl believes, profously, or else she’d never have done what she did.It would have been foolish, it would have been a scandal, if…it hadn’t of worked.But it did, and sometimes the price to pay for a gentleman’s attention is worth every penny. And convincing Lord Southridge to believe in love at first sight? Priceless.",
