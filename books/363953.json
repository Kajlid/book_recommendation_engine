The popularity of Harry 'Breaker' Morant survives still, in this play written by Kenneth Ross.

Originally performed by the Melbourne Theatre Company at the Athenaeum Theatre on 2 February 1978. The script of the film Breaker Morant, produced by the S.A. Film Corporation was adapted from Kenneth Ross's play.",
