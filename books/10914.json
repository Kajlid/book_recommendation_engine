  "description": "Horton Hears a Who! Horton the Elephant hears a cry for help from a speck of dust and tries to protect the tiny creatures who live on it from the other animals. When his friends accuse him of imagining things Horton persuades the Whos to make as much noise as possible to prove they do indeed exist. Academy AwardÂ®-winner Dustin Hoffman's masterful narration, along with original music and sound effects, brings to life the heartwarming tale of Horton the elephant.Horton Hatches the Egg Horton is persuaded to sit on an egg whiles its mother, Maysie, takes a break. What Horton doesn't know is that Maysie is setting off for a permanent vacation in Palm Springs. He waits, and waits some more, through a freezing winter and a spring filled with insults from his friends. When the egg finally hatches everyone is in for a surprise.Thidwick, The Big-Hearted Moose This classic Seuss take features Thidwick, a happy-looking moose from Lake Winna-Bango with incredible antlers and a kind heart. Everyone takes advantage of his generosity and soon he has most of the other animals nesting on the top of his head. Will anyone take pity on him, or will he be able to cross the lake to rejoin the herd before winter?",
