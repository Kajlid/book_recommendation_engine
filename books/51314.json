  "description": "A Song of the Heart, the second in a trilogy of novels based on the LAW OF ATTRACTION, is a touching story of overcoming fear, learning to love again, and living in the moment. As Dayna watches her sister, Rachael, living her dreams, she is encouraged to follow her example. Music becomes the catalyst that draws her not only to her connection with Source, but to a friendship that holds the potential for so much more-if only she can listen to her heart. The author again works her magic as she weaves the teachings of Law of Attraction into a story that will captivate and delight readers.",
