  "description": "Kirby Steinberg is having a bit of trouble fitting into her new school. Sure, there's the usual interest/antagonism associated with being from \"somewhere else,\" but this time the new kid also happens to be the guardian for three talking monkeys. Chuck, the professorial orangutan. Knobby the love-stricken spider monkey. Go-Go, the befuddled golden gorilla. These monkeys have learned to speak thanks to the scientific processes of Kirby's father. Or have they? What's their real story? That's what Nickels—Kirby's new best friend and unfortunately dedicated school reporter—would like to discover. Can Kirby find time to develop a relationship with Martin, the dashing nerd? Steer clear of Skye, the high school's # 1 pocket of arrogance? Keep the three simians from causing untold catastrophes? And, above all, will Kirby be able to hide the real origin of these three monkeys from Nickels? Oh, probably not.",
