  "description": "Eric Carrington, a young drug dealer in his city during the early 1980s, is wholly unapologetic about the way he chose to make his fortune. Those who Eric surrounds himself with are much the same, whether it be Bishop, his surrogate brother and mentor, or King who controls all the narcotics that flow through the city. Eric, the middle child of three and raised in a home of a neglectful aunt, has gone through many experiences that have shaped him, and when he sees his younger sister in the company of a powerful dealer named Shock, he is challenged to get over the one thing he is scared of. Then there is Rachel who totally infatuates him; little does he know that her past and present may have the ability to blow down the house of cards his existence rests on. With an unabashed look at race, class and spirituality, Afterward They Turned is not easily forgotten.",
