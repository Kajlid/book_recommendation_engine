  "description": "Alvin was a weirdo. He claimed to be able to remember the future... but couldn't see ahead into his past. He led a dazed, happy life as a manual laborer in a crew of apes. But then he felt strange awakenings in his mind - and his body. He suddenly knew that somewhere there were three other boys exactly like him, clones grown from a single ovum in an illicit laboratory experiment. And Alvin knew he had to find them (and the beautiful girl he kept having disturbingly erotic fantasies about). His quest plunged him into the middle of the insane urban chaos of 2072.",
