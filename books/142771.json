  "description": "Connor loves teaching. He loves working with kids, he loves feeling like he’s making a difference. And the kids—and parents—seem to love him. Until the afternoon he makes a small error in judgment, and an angry father’s thoughtless comments start the kind of rumor that destroys careers. And lives. Everything Connor thought he knew about himself and his world is now in doubt. But sometimes help comes from the most unexpected direction.",
