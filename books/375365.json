  "description": "In Mindy Nettifee's second book, Rise of the Trust Fall , her poems possess a magic that can only come from a seasoned writer willing to share more on the page than she's comfortable with.  Whether exploring the strange alchemy of healing, the perils of self-actualization, or the contemporary experience of womanhood, the poems in this daring collection are gorgeous and vibrant, bitingly funny, and unflinchingly honest. Rise of the Trust Fall challenges more than our understanding of ourselves. It calls us to connect to our humanity, to celebrate its flaws, and then to demand more of it, in every well crafted line.Praise\"Rise of the Trust Fall by Mindy Nettifee is the linguistic orgasm we've all been waiting for, no clit-stims necessary.\"- BUST Magazine\"Mindy Nettifee is destined to be the next Dorothy Parker.\"- Poetic Diversity\"When award-winning poet Mindy Nettifee speaks...you're powerless–you have no choice but to raise your wine glass high over your osmosis head and join her pledge of allegiance to graphic truth. Her poems have the grace of cursive letters and the guts of a truck driver.\"- District Weekly",
