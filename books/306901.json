  "description": "“A winner is just a loser who tried one more time.” -George M. Moore Jr.Mark Daniels has made some mistakes. Some would say he spent most of his life a failure. Mark would tell you, they’re not wrong. He was ten when he first got drunk. By seventeen, he’d bought a motorcycle and spent most of his time traveling from job to job and bar to bar across the U.S. He partied, abused every drug available, drank himself useless, and spent each night with a different woman. That was all before he turned twenty. Then things got worse…This is the story of how Mark found himself at the bottom of a deep pit of guilt and despair, more than once, and how he pulled himself back out. A man’s life is full of struggles and bad decisions, and Mark’s has been both gut-wrenching and spiritually challenging. Don’t give up on him. By the end, you’ll discover that in the harshness of life, sometimes all a man has to do is get back up...just one more time.“Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently.” -Henry Ford",
