  "description": "In this newest addition to the Kate Stanton Hollywood Mystery Series…Thanks to the huge success of the year’s blockbuster civil war epic, The Crossing at Blaisdell Park, there’s been a resurgence of interest in the former sixties musical duo, the Paisleys, and its only surviving member, Kate Stanton, who had recorded an interactive version of the duo’s first hit single for the movie. With an initial worldwide gross of just under a billion dollars and a sequel already in production, it looks like the The Crossing – as it’s been dubbed by the press – is going to go down in history as one of Hollywood’s most successful film franchises – until tragedy strikes, that is. Just as Kate is about to unveil the Paisleys’ long-awaited star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a stolen cargo van jumps the curb a few feet from where everyone is gathered, killing a woman dressed as Charlotte Valcour, the heroine in The Crossing. The tragedy follows a series of disastrous events which have overshadowed shooting of the sequel, fueling rumors that the shoot is being haunted by the ghost of the movie’s dead heroine. Things become even more complicated when the director of the movie suddenly disappears during shooting of a pivotal battle scene. Kate soon realizes that Charlotte’s ghost may not be the only thing they need to contend with as she finds herself dodging a killer intent on exposing the truth behind The Crossing at Blaisdell Park.",
