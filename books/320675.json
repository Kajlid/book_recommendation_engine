But uncovering the truth turns perilous. Reid finds there is much more at stake than just a time machine, and flushing out his quarry may get them all killed – and rip the timeline apart.Catapulted across history, Reid, Sara, and their allies must survive alternate dimensions, Nazis, Vikings, and a psychopath willing to destroy anyone and anything, even the timeline itself, if it prevents him from his prize. A prize that offers power more seductive than just time travel. For a deadly price.",
