  "description": "**This is a NOVELLA.**Evil Dead MC, Book 6The boys of the Evil Dead MC are out on business—the shady kind that happens in the dark of night miles from nowhere—when Red Dog gets a call from one of his club brothers. Seems Red Dog’s ol’ lady has picked tonight to take off and go drinking fifty miles from home.  The fact that she waits until he’s six hours away—doing an arms deal on the California-Oregon border—to pull this stunt, doesn’t amuse him.  Just wait until he gets his hands on her.  Only problem is—that may be easier said than done.  What ensues is a game of hide-and-seek with the boys all helping their MC brother track down his ol’ lady.  Along the way, Red Dog remembers why he fell in love with his little China Doll in the first place.  And he’ll be damned if he’s going to let anything or anyone keep them apart again, not even her.",
