Joy Bermin's sweet crush on Quince Castille went sour when he got involved with a psychotic feline who nearly destroyed the pride. That bastard is dead, but now Quince is trying to convince her he had nothing to do with it.She's been doing her best to ignore him, but the stubborn panther is always underfoot. When he tricks her into seeing how good things could really be between them, she's stuck between dismay and desire.Just when Quince was ready to prove his love for Joy, that mess with the pride shot his credibility all to hell. Trickery is the only way to break her resistance and show her the truth. And holy hell, that woman could melt steel with her heat.Between trying to pin her down and dealing with upstart cats out to destroy what he's worked so hard to rebuild, Quince is through playing by the rules. Whatever it takes to make Joy his mate, it's on the table. And God help anyone who gets in his way.  The Miami heat may induce passion, trickery, feline sunbathing, stubborn brothers bossing around temperamental sisters, and a cat smackdown of epic proportions.",
