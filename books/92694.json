  "description": "Sacrificial virgins are so sixteenth century, but unless Isabelle finds a man to take her innocence, she may be next.For Isabelle Andersen, being a virgin in a dragon-plagued Scottish village is a dangerous position. Potentially the next dragon sacrifice, Isabelle’s only way out is to lose her innocence, and fast. Men are more plentiful than ale at her father’s tavern, but unfortunately for Isabelle, they seem to prefer the charms of sheep over her. All she needs is one handsome stranger she can coax into bed, but Lochmore Cott doesn’t get much in the way of visitors.Jonarrion Swiftwind has sworn off virgins. The last time he took one to his bed, his family paid the price for his lust at the hands of her demon-possessed father. Since that night, he’s made it his mission to destroy demons and keep his bed virgin-free. Jon’s hunt brings him to Lochmore Cott, hard on the trail of a demon-in-dragon’s-clothing. Nothing distracts him from killing the demon until lovely Isabelle offers him a mug of tea. And her virginity.It takes just one night of passion for Jon to realize he doesn’t ever want to let the independent beauty go. But will Isabelle accept him when she discovers the only real dragon in her village… is him?",
