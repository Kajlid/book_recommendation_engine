  "description": "Hannah’s Ghosts are cold to the touch. Being tied up isn’t much fun. And danger is a sure-fire prescription for amazing sex!When Hannah Campbell attends a memorial service for the neurosurgeon who once saved her life, the last thing she expects is a lightning strike that knocks her out cold and blasts her lungs full of the departed’s ashes. Things only get weirder when she wakes up to find the deceased standing over her hospital bed, insisting she help him track down the terrorists who blew up his plane.Professor Takeshi Shimodo doesn’t know what to believe when smart-mouthed Hannah appears on his doorstep, claiming to be haunted by the ghost of his best friend. Yet she exhibits some extraordinary psychic abilities. And her determination to find justice for the crash victims, in spite of her fragile health, touches his heart.Takeshi’s acupressure techniques are meant to calm Hannah’s erratic heartbeat, but the longer they are together, the more his magic fingers have the opposite effect. Soon, their passion flares hotter than any lightning strike.But now the terrorist they seek is hunting them. And the FBI is suspicious Hannah knows just a little too much.Without some “spiritual” help, they haven’t a ghost of a chance.",
