  "description": "When someone makes a killing in the country music business, it's time to call in Debbie Sue and Edwina—the Domestic Equalizers—whose motto is, \"Don't get mad, get evidence.\"The career of former Queen of Country Music, Darla Denman, ain't what it used to be. No more big arenas—she's lucky to fill a barroom—and now she's forced to tour (by bus!) with the detestable Roxie Jo, current wife of Darla's manager/ex-husband. So when her rattletrap tour bus gives up the ghost outside tiny Salt Lick, Texas, the faded Nashville star's thrilled to find loyal fans (and sympathetic ears) in Debbie Sue Overstreet and Edwina Perkins-Martin.But when her nemesis and upstart backup singer Roxie Jo turns up dead in her dressing room—which bears an uncanny resemblance to a cleaning-supply closet—Darla finds herself in more trouble than a Dixie Chick in merry old England. Luckily Debbie Sue and Edwina are not only the proud owners of Salt Lick's best beauty parlor but they also moonlight as private detectives! And if the Domestic Equalizers can't get to the bottom of a murderous musical mess, then no one can!",
