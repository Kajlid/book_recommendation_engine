  "title": "Seeking the Heart of God: Reflections on Prayer",
  "description": "In Seeking the Heart of God , two of the most renowned and inspirational spiritual leaders -- Mother Teresa and Brother Roger -- combine their wisdom and experience to offer a practical, joyful celebration of the power of prayer. Prayer, though central to all denominations, remains mysterious to many. Here, the distinct yet complementary voices of Mother Teresa and Brother Roger honor prayer as the wellspring of love and compassion and illuminate it as an integral part of everday life. \"In reality, there is only one true prayer, only one substantial Christ himself,\" writes Mother Teresa. \"There is only one voice of Christ. Prayer is oneness with Christ.\" Mother Teresa and Brother Roger first met in 1976 in Taize, France. Several months later, in Calcutta, they collaborated on what became the first of several joint appeals for Christian reconciliation. Their mutual agenda is clear -- a passionate commitment to the alleviation of human suffering and the use of prayer as a source of comfort, strength and communion with God. In their work and travels, both Mother Teresa and Brother Roger perceived a great hunger for guidance in prayer. The result is this inspirational text of short commentaries on how to use prayer in daily life. Comprised of 12 chapters, each written half by Brother Roger, Seeking the Heart of God &nbsp is their wise and lyrical offering to those whose hunger is that of the spirit.",
