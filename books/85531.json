  "description": "They say first class is the only way to fly.First class is great and all, but in my world – FREE is really the only way to fly!Once you’ve had a chance to fly for free, I’m sure you’ll agree.My friends often ask me how it is that I am able to travel abroad so frequently. I hear from them all the time ‘You’re so lucky!’ or ‘I wish I could travel like you do, but I’ll never be able to afford it!’Eventually when I began letting folks in on my little secret and started telling them that they could definitely afford it because I travel for free – they either didn’t believe me at all, or wanted to know everything I could tell them about how they could do the same.Finally after fielding one too many questions from people in the latter group, I decided to sit down and write a book detailing all my tricky little Travel Ninja Secrets, including step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow. I know what you’re thinking: “Sounds too good to be true, there’s gotta be a catch!”Actually there really is no special trick to this whatsoever. You don’t have to go out and crack your skull open trying to figure out how to use a pair of nunchucks in an attempt to become an actual Ninja before you can begin using these secret Travel Ninja tactics for your own travels.They’ve worked for me and I guarantee they’ll work for you just the same!Recently I booked a first class flight from New York to Bangkok and the best part of it is – it was absolutely free! If you’re the type who still thinks first class is ‘the only way to fly’ I encourage you to give this book a try, become a Travel Ninja in your own right, and give me a chance to prove you wrong, because lets face it the only thing better than cheap airline tickets is free airline tickets!",
