  "description": "I have two choices: submit to the mob boss… or suffer the consequences.  Enzo Marino. A man of dark desires and unlimited power. A mob boss. A killer.  And now… my newest client.  He’s as handsome as my law firm warned me he was – and ten times as dangerous. He can have me executed with the snap of his fingers. But instead, he’s decided he wants me bent in his bed and begging for his touch.  What began as another day on the job turns into the biggest nightmare of my life. I’m drawn into a dark web of violence and betrayal in my office by day…  And into endless sessions of ecstasy in Enzo’s bed at night.  There’s no turning back now. I’m throwing everything I’ve ever known out the window. All because the bad boy pinned me by the throat and whispered four little words in my ear:  \n“You’re mine now, sweetheart.”\n  \nENZO is a dark, enemies-to-lovers mafia romance between Enzo Marino, the rich scion of the Marino crime family, and Madelyn, the curvy lawyer assigned to his case. The novel is a full-length standalone. It contains adult themes, language, and content, and is intended for readers 18+.",
