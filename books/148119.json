  "title": "Lost on the Trail",
  "description": "She had no name, no family, and no memory of her past.Raised by strangers on an isolated mountain since she was a young child, Weewona doesn’t know her real name or even her birthday. She’s never seen a horse or ridden in a carriage; but on one momentous day, she ventures down the mountain to where a tent revival meeting is being held. For the first time, Weewona hears the beautiful lyrics of a hymn that promise peace and glory with God. She’s not certain what those lyrics mean, but she yearns to hear them again. Weewona is determined to discover the purpose behind the hymn’s promises, even if it means she must leave her solitary mountain life and live in the strange and sometimes frightening civilized world. This unabridged edition of the 1911 classic Christian novel includes a biography of the author, group discussion questions, and additional bonus content.",
