  "description": "In therapy, they tell you to use your senses.List the things you know. Sermons recited with malice. A blood-soaked ritual. The sting of tears and gasping sobs of the dying. Rotting flesh. I grew up in a cage, tortured by the Lord Almighty's most twisted servant. Death and despair became my close companions as I watched years of slaughter at Pastor Michaels’ hand. Eighteen girls. Dead. Eighteen lives. Ended. Eighteen futures. Stolen. After years of captivity, I don't recognise the world I'm suddenly thrust into. The road in front of me is lined with corpses, demanding vengeance from beyond the grave. I escaped… but they didn’t.Now, I have to live for them. Sabre Security offers me a lifeline in the dark. They want to find the killer before another girl dies, but their protection comes with a price. My soul must be excavated, one sinful memory at a time. The Hunter will become the Hunted. Author Note: Corpse Roads (Sabre Security #1) is a contemporary reverse harem romance set in the same universe as Blackwood Institute, which is recommended to be read first but not compulsory.",
