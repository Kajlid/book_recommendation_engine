  "description": "Following a catastrophic chemical spill, the dead rises - they’re hungry and demand equal rights. In this collection, readers get to experience both Citizen Dead (The Harvest #1) and Dead Anarchy (The Harvest #2) In Citizen Dead, Twenty-two-year-old Roam Stephens and the prideful citizens of Moone Crest find themselves defending their small mountain town against a mob of the dead. The existing grudges, romances and ambitions of the living ones sow tension as they attempt to unite against a common enemy. The tale continues in Dead Anarchy, following up on a cliffhanger that leaves readers questioning the fate of one of the characters they got to know in Citizen Dead. We return to Moone Crest to find its citizens preparing for the much anticipated Sweet Potato Fest. While the Living are organizing a celebration, the Dead are mounting an uprising in light of a new zero tolerance policy enacted by a returning power to the small mountain town. “A new twist on the usual run-of-the-mill zombie/undead stories that are permeating the market these days.” – Amazon Reviewer",
