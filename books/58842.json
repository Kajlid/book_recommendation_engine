  "description": "With a mechanical arm, a furnace for a heart, and a hundred years of sleep behind him, Cole Blaquesmith is no ordinary man, and his quest is no ordinary adventure.Having traded his humanity to the treacherous Absinthe in exchange for a 'cure' for his lady love, Cole finds himself on the front lines of a revolution, trying to take down the man who used him, killed his beloved, and took over half the known world. With a ragtag band of stalwarts, Cole Blaquesmith takes the fight to Lord Absinthe's door, and beyond.This volume, collecting Steampunk issues 6-12, continues the madly original saga begun in the Cliffhanger book Steampunk: Manimatron, by the same brilliant creative team of Chris Bachalo and Joe Kelly. Love and war, life and death, truth and lies—nothing is as it seems in the darkly twisted world of Steampunk, and the unpredictable in the only certainty.Steampunk: Drama Obscura—come inside... but leave your expectations at the door.",
