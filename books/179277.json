  "description": "Imagine a computer game so powerful you can actually walk into the action, taking shots at evil robots as they chase you down the street. When Liam Chesney finds out he has a neighbour with a Pure Reality computer, he can’t wait to get started. But then a crazy ghost gets into the system, sending Liam and his friends into a dangerous retro adventure. Solving a series of clues, in the form of fourteen tarot cards, is the children’s only chance to get home to the world of reality.",
