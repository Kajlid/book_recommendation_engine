  "description": "Long Ago and far away.... At the end of the First Age, when gods still walked the earth, the dwarves stole the secrets of flame and steel from the god of fire. With it, they saw everything that was and would be and forged nine weapons- one to represent each mortal race of the earth, and the gods. Nine weapons they forged, and then buried their wisdom and the flame of the gods in the heart of the world... for some powers were never meant to be known by mortal men.... On Vondellius, continent founded by a thief, the stalemate in a generations-long war is about to be broken. Two mighty kingdoms strive for supremacy- one through conquest, the other through even more devious intrigues... And in the middle sets the kingdom of d'Haventh, a green jewel in a rusted iron setting. Destinies intertwined, beliefs and magics dancing on the edge of a silver knife... here, in Trollbreaker, begins a saga harkening back to the days of epic fantasy and high adventure- of kings and usurpers, rogues and heroes.",
