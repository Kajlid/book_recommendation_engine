  "description": "He came, He sawed, He ate… All that are left behind of the victims are their heads, placed together with the painted angels, rendered in the victim’s own blood. The acts, captured on video, are sent elsewhere… Now Zoe Beaupre, a hooker with an imaginary monkey and sister of the serial killer’s latest conquest, must band together with a mismatched posse of saviors in order to bring him down. Little does Zoe know, but the deeper into the madman’s world they trek, more and more is revealed about snuff films…and Gideon, the puppet master who will stop at nothing to see her dead.",
