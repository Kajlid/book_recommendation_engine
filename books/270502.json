  "description": "To protect his boy…  Brisbane is no stranger to hardship. At nineteen, he feels lucky to have a job and a roof over his head—at the same time. All his life he’s had to look out for himself. He’s never had anyone to guide and protect him until Malcolm.  Malcolm is an alpha tiger shifter dedicated to protecting the unique shifter community of Morningwood. He’s been tracking an elusive shifter hitman for months. But the slippery target travels freely in the normie world—no one ever suspects the golden retriever of brutal murder.  …there’s no threat he won’t face.  When the dog is taken in by the unknowing Brisbane, Malcolm has a choice to make. Determined not to let anything get in the way of his mission, Malcolm tries to ignore Brisbane’s jaded innocence and handsome smiles. But it’s clear the young man needs help even though as a normie, he’s off limits.  When danger arises, Malcolm whisks Brisbane away to safety, but when the hitman begins to sniff closer to home, Malcolm will have to decide what’s more important—his mission or the man he loves.  Sweet Meat is the third book in the Welcome to Morningwood Omegaverse Romance series. It can be read as a standalone.",
