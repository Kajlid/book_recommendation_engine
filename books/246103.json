  "description": "Mia's star desperately needs polishing. Can a fake relationship make her shine?Mia Black “aka” Black Sheep, is the slightly geeky, kind of smart, but otherwise lusterless middle daughter of a family full of shining stars. Literally, like, movie stars. Austin is the super cute, uber-popular, basketball phenom whose athletic career just took a nosedive when his failing grades landed him in academic probation. Basically Mia’s polar opposite.When Austin impulsively kisses Mia in the hallway in front of everyone, pretending he’s moved on from the girl who just dumped him, he begs Mia to play along and promises he’ll make it worth her while. Mia knows her reputation could use some help, and Austin is the perfect guy to elevate her from not to hot. All she has to do is help him get his grades up, and Austin will pretend to be madly in love with her. Sounds like a win-win for both of them, right?Fake it till you make it, the saying goes, and Mia and Austin soon realize that opposites do attract. But can their relationship, and their reputations, survive when the whole school finds out they were only faking? If you like fun and flirty teen contemporary romance books by authors such as Kelly Oram, Jessica Park, Amy Sparling, or Nicola Yoon, you'll love My Fake Valentine!",
