  "description": "Coming Nov 6th to Amazon and KU. She’s the matchmaker…he’s her sexy client. What could go wrong? L.A.-based matchmaker Fia Martin has a tough competition: Find the perfect woman for arrogant, handsome TV-host Dylan Chambers, before her rival, Connie Birnbaum, can do it––on national television. If Dylan declares her the winner, Fia’s business will skyrocket.Dylan is picky. He’s smug. He reminds Fia that he’s only doing this competition at all because he lost a bet to his TV co-host, and he doesn’t believe in true love. He’s polite on dates picked out by Connie, but the ones Fia sets up? Those seem to end in complete disaster. And every time she tells him to behave, he flirts with her shamelessly.A stolen kiss turns to a night of unbelievable passion, but Fia knows that Dylan’s not interested in anything more than a fling. How could it mean anything when he’s still going on dates for the TV challenge like nothing happened?When Dylan chooses Connie’s company for his final dream date in Hawaii, to a woman who looks perfect on paper, Fia figures she can pretty much kiss the trophy goodbye. The problem is, she won’t just be losing the competition. She’s about to lose her heart, too…to the one guy who’s completely unavailable.Perfect Match is a full length 75K word romance novel with a very high heat level, poetic prose, and some laugh out loud moments. Like all of my books, it has a wonderful HEA. This one has some mild kink...not a lot of pain, but a whole lot of pleasure!First published Sept 26th, 2017 inside the box set Hot and Sinful Nights - a box set which hit the USA Today Best Sellers List. It will come to Amazon and KU on Nov 6, 2017.",
