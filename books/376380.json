  "description": "It’s survival of the fittest in a terrible war of extinction! Created in the gene labs as super soldiers, the Highborn decided to replace the obsolete Homo sapiens. They pirated the Doom Stars and captured the Sun Works Ring around Mercury. Now, they rain asteroids, orbital fighters and nine-foot drop troops onto Earth in a relentless tide of conquest. Marten Kluge is on the receiving end. Hounded by Thought Police, he lives like an ant in a kilometer-deep city. The invasion frees him from a re-education camp but lands him in the military, fighting for the wrong side. STAR SOLDIER is the story of techno hell in a merciless war, with too many surprises for any grunt’s sanity.",
