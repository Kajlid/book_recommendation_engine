  "description": "Reaching the door the girl noticed a movement up in the tree and stopped to watch. A single leaf dangled about half-way up, twisting and thrashing like a prisoner trying desperately to escape her tethers. Lydi shivered as a gust of wind swept down the hill. The golden heart fluttered wildly, but the branch held on. In an instant, life can change, shattering hopes and dreams. Will Lydi and her family have the courage to withstand the painful journey ahead? Share in the trials and joys of the Andersson family. Will they find the courage to endure? Can they hold onto their promises? DeAnn Kruempel, author of the Promises to Keep series, grew up on a farm near De Smet, South Dakota and has lived in North Dakota and Iowa. For the last 28 years she has worked in schools or public libraries as a childrenâ€™s librarian. DeAnn enjoys gardening, orcharding and sewing. She lives on an acreage near Logan, Iowa with her cat, Elsa, 42,378 honeybees and 20 chickens, including Little Black Banty.",
