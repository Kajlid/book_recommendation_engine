What would you do if you woke one day zipped up in a body bag, your friends had left you for dead, and the zombie apocalypse was upon you? Well, meet Byron Marks, a frat-guy at a New Jersey college whose world just got turned upside down. After being attacked by a vagrant on his college campus Byron finds himself in a strange new world. Nothing makes sense anymore. Now, he needs to do whatever he can to save the few living friends he has left. Only, there's one little catch: Byron is one of the walking dead.Byron: A Zombie Tale is NOT your average zombie story.",
