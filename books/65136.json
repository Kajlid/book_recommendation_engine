  "description": "It's just another interminable day at the office for clerk Justin Myers. After a wild night at his favorite club, he's nursing a hangover and wishing he was home instead. All he wants is to get through the day unnoticed and hopes his pounding head will subside. When his co-worker Preston goes out of his way to help him, Justin realizes the nerdy engineer has a crush on him. They're polar opposites, and at first, Justin isn't sure what to do about Preston's gentle flirtation and friendship. But as Preston becomes a bigger part of Justin's life, he realizes that love has no boundaries after all.",
