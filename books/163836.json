  "description": "The Tale of Nottingswood (A novelette in verse)Somewhere between the twisted worlds of Tim Burton and the bouncing meters of Dr. Seuss, you'll find the upside-down town of Nottingswood. Having cast out the majestic Guardian who was once their protector, Nottingswood built the Great Wall to block out the sun. Now, holed up in their houses, Nottingsfolk are content to let their town decay into a colorless wasteland. Until one day...A curious cry from the center of town catches the attention of a pair of twins who guard the Great Nottings Gate. Lured from their hohumly home, this Brother and Sister stumble upon a Creature that has the power to change their lives forever. Follow this daring pair as they defy the shadowy Order of Voices, dodge the meddling Ms. Grouse, and face the austere hand of The Judge on an adventure that neither they nor you will ever forget.For more, including the Kirkus Review, visit www.Nottingswood.com.",
