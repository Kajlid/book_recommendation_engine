  "description": "Perry Hampton is a man who is used to the finer pleasures in life: wealth, power, a beautiful wife and mistress and two magnificent properties. His life should be perfect but it is not. He lives with the fear that he is haunted by the victims of his villainy; whilst, a few miles away, lives his most deadly nemesis. Her name is Eleanor and she possesses a secret file, which he truly believes will destroy him. Eleanor is driven by her quest to prove Perry’s evil: she has pledged to do everything she can, to protect and avenge those she loves. So when a trail of clues draws her towards uncovering Perry’s most covert secrets, she cannot resist following them - determined to prove his crimes, whilst aware, his spies are watching her every move. But Perry will not rest until he can overpower her community - a ruthless campaign where he enlists the help of old faces, including a senior planning officer and a former London gangster. Characters, good and evil are drawn into a concentrated battle over a piece of land; but this is just the start of a more sinister game. Perry knows how he can unhinge them - even if it means encouraging his only son, to immerse himself into the dark labyrinths of the criminal underground, thereby granting him a dangerous advantage. Eleanor’s son, Elijah, is finally drawn into their secrets; where the younger generation are growing up fast, inspired to launch their own fight against injustice. But it is the catalyst which sparks a war - one which bears deadly consequences and from where there can only be one winner. Pleasures can be read as a standalone thriller and is the 3rd book in the British series ‘Same Face Different Place.’",
