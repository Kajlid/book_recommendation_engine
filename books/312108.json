  "description": "Portals, bondmates, and a dragon world. I thought that my biggest problem was the unfinished bond between me and Ashe… but I was wrong. We've done the impossible and crossed through a portal into the world of dragons – the same place where my mother's been trapped for the past fifteen years. With this lavender sky, orange sun, and a freaking planet hanging above us, it's clear that we're no longer on Earth. Our biggest problem is finding our way back… right? WRONG. If my mother who was an expert couldn't find a way out of this place, who will we?",
