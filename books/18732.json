Adventure follows adventure as they seek to control the magic--but the magic has a will of its own and it is all they can do to keep up.Faced with sleeping princesses, magic rings, and moonlit gardens filled with enchantment, the children must use all their courage and ingenuity to control the magic and solve the mystery surrounding the Enchanted Castle.First published in 1907, The Enchanted Castle is a beloved classic filled with adventures both funny and frightening. E. Nesbit's spellbinding and wondrous tale combined with Paul Zelinsky's fabulous watercolor illustrations make The Enchanted Castle a treasure for all ages.",
