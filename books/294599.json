  "description": "As I walk across the parking lot, my mind on another day of teaching third-graders, I'm taken.\nAbducted by nonhumans. Aliens.\nMonsters, one might call them. I certainly do. \nWhen I'm taken again - from aliens by aliens--my dire circumstances are worsened by an immensely irritating male named Jax.\nHe is brutal, crude, arrogant, and obnoxious. Everything I dislike in a man.\nApparently, he is also quite broken, and he thinks I'm beautiful. Me. \nHow on earth am I supposed to resist him? I suppose on Earth, I could.\nBut we're not on Earth anymore, and all bets are off. \nThis is Jax and Alice's story.",
