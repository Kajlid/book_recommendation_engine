  "description": "NOTE FROM THE DOM, LOGAN THORNDIKE: Okay, it is ON. After a yummy breakfast and a day of tests for Addison, she and I go shopping to set the stage for our first scene, and we have some hot, hot fun playing in our new lifestyle. But, surprise, surprise, the little devil pops out, again and again, and Addison is in for it now. Big time. That's okay. I can just tie her up, spank her, or shove her to the floor or into my bed for my pleasure. Which I do. A lot.This volume contains plenty of pinkings, Shibari (decorative rope bondage so you won't have to Google it if you don't know), steamy hot tub action, strong language and other delightfully naughty situations that are just perfect for those looking for a good throb in the loins. Though there are no whips and chains--Oh wait. There is a dragontail whipping, just not for her. Hmm. Are there chains too? Oh, no, no, not in this novella. I bring those out in the NEXT one--please be at least 18 and aroused by life and love in the Kink. And be sure to ponder all the (dirty) whimsical fun you can have with ribbons and rope. :)* * * This 26,000-word novella is Book 4 in the 10-part Sorority Pledge Saga, a serialization that follows a rocky romance centered around the edgy bliss of Domination and submission. Contains explicit situations and language. 18+ please. * * *",
