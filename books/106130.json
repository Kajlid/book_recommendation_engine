Though he fears Celia may be Fey-marked, Dahleven can't resist the powerful attraction he feels for her. But is Celia in league with the enemy, or will she provide the key to saving his people? Alone and off-balance, Celia finds herself falling for Lord Dahleven. But dangerous forces are at work, and one of them is offering Celia a way home -- for a price.DANGEROUS TALENTS is Book 1 in the Vinlanders' Saga, a fantasy romance adventure series inspired by Norse mythology and featuring the descendants of Viking warriors.
