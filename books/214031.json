  "title": "The Longest Cocktail Party",
  "description": "When American teenager Richard DiLello wandered into the Beatles' Apple building in 1968, he was immediately appointed \"house hippie;\" he began making tea, rolling joints, and listening to dozens of demo tapes. By the time Apple crumbled a few years later he was director of public relations. Along the way he noted many of the stoned conversations he heard and the insane bits of business he witnessed: one-man bands auditioning in the reception, Hell's Angels taking over Savile Row, and The Beatles playing on the roof. Full of period detail, this is a fast-paced, witty, and immensely poignant account ofÂ the demise of the Fab Four and the death of the '60s dream.",
