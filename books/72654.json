  "description": "After her parents' deaths, Evelyn Banks endured a living hell for nearly two years at the hands of her godfather's son. She couldn't tell anyone...not her brother, and certainly not the godfather who took them in.Now she is twenty-fiveâ€”and still trapped in silence. After all the time, no one would believe her. And any revelation of her shame could halt her godfather's political aspirations. But what she can do is take her design firm to the next level with a project for her brother's best friend. Handsome, sexy hotelier Vincent Hawk.Vin has always had a thing for Evie, but kept his hands off out of respect for her brother. Now that they're traveling together, though, keeping his distance is tearing him apart. Except every move he makes to get close is met with not just mere resistance, but with a fear-whitened face and trembling body.Evie can't deny she's falling for Vin, but accepting their future means facing her past...a past that could destroy everyone she loves.",
