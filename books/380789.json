  "description": "Victor the virgin, Alexander the coward, Guinevere the lady, Aphrodite the slut and Keller the professor all have one thing in common. This Halloween weekend they are going to \"Mares Rest,\" the house that's cursed. To survive, they must depend upon Madam Rue, whose powers extend beyond the spread of the tarot cards; Ezera the mortician, with a secret to hide; and Max the ex-cop, who hates Keller. Love, broken hearts, growing up and walking out of the mansion the morning after are just the beginning of their problems. The author weaves his tapestry carefully for surprise after surprise. Become one of \"the three that protect the one in life, so the one may protect the four from Death!\"",
