'Because everyone around us makes it complicated,' I whispered back.\" London McElles has been figure skating ever since he was little and he’s hardly told a soul. After his disaster of coming out as gay, he doesn’t want to be pegged as your typical gay guy even more by revealing that he’s a figure skating genius. So what does London do?
