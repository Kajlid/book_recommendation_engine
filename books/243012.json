  "description": "There are things in the woods we don't know about... Dylan's father has always been a little unusual. When he joins a Sasquatch-hunting team led by a top bigfoot-researcher, Dylan feels he needs to keep an eye on his dad, so he teams up with an aging field biologist, Samuel Johnson, on the slops of Mount Saint Helens. But as the two of them track the Sasquatch-hunting party, Dylan might be in more trouble than he thought...Even as they follow his father's group, somebody is following Mr. Johnson. And on top of everything, Dylan is beginning to realize that his father may not be quite so wrong about bigfoot after all--maybe the Sasquatch  does  exist. And maybe it's closer than Dylan ever guessed.",
