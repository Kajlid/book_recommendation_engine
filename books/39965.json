  "description": "High tech war -- and how to avoid itThe answer is simple: you would have peace? Then prepare for war. This wisdom is as old as armies. Yet after a few generations, the peace that was paid for with soldiers' blood comes to seem the normal thing, the ordinary thing, and the guardians of peace come to be the symbol of it's opposite.That is the theme of the second volume in this series: in the future as in the past, you must _guard_ your peace, or there will be war.In times of danger, survival isn't easy. It takes intelligence, strategy-- and a certain ruthlessness on the part of leaders who know that public safety depends on public strength.Every society will have it's wars. Thus every society must have it's army -- or be prepared to surrender to one.",
