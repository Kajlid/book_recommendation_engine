  "description": "Who knew the heavenly could be devilish?After planning not one, but two, demonic weddings, all Faith Bettincourt—the youngest Crown Princess of Hell—wants is to spend some quality time with her angelic boyfriend, Matt. But when a girl from Matt’s past walks through Faith’s apartment door, her preoccupation with the weddings from Hell is all that’s keeping her from turning his ex, in all her devious angelic glory, into a down throw pillow.  Which is about when Matt’s zealous mother declares war on Faith’s family. But not all’s fair in love and war, and Matt’s having a hard time choosing sides. Alone or not, Faith must rescue one of the grooms and go up against an army of so-called do-gooders, so everything can go back to normal. Or as normal as it can be where the Devil's spawn is concerned. And with any luck, she might just be able to resuscitate her love life while she's at it.",
