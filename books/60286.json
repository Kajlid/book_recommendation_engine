  "description": "Good stories are where you find them. Sometimes they come from unlikely places. Sometimes from unknown sources. Editor Our Man in Abiko, the Abiko Free Press co-founder, received the most extraordinary unsolicited manuscript, which tells the story of a young Japanese-British woman's deadly quest to help an American father find his missing daughter in Japan.The events in her manuscript take place over three days during the Great East Japan Earthquake of March 11th, 2011. Hana Walker, an orphaned half-Japanese half-English ramen shop waitress, is hired by an American named Blackmore to help him get his 14-year-old daughter back from his estranged Japanese wife. As Hana and the American undertake the search for the daughter, Hana enlists the help of a trusted but unconventional shinto priest and runs afoul of both the police and the deadly yakuza. During the course of their search, Hana and Blackmore live through the March 11th earthquake and witness first-hand the destruction in Ishinomaki.Hana Walker’s Half Life 2:46 is a timely and gripping crime adventure. However, whether Ms. Walker’s manuscript is complete fiction, or is based fully or in part on actual events, the Abiko Free Press staff cannot confidently confirm nor deny. We simply don’t know.",
