  "description": "**This is the \nsecond book\n in the bestselling RockStar series. Lucy and Jesse continue... **You know how people say they woke up in Vegas married and you're like, how the hell could that possibly happen? Who does that? Well, us apparently -- and the press is having a field day... Let's not even get started on the topic of my mother. Then there's my grandpa wanting to meet my new husband -- that's not scary at all. On top of that, we're heading out on tour and I'm a nervous wreck -- factor in the fact that Jesse's newly changed marital status doesn't seem to be an issue for the groupies. Nothing deters them. Not even the fact that I'm standing right there when they proposition him. I can handle the press, my mom, and even my grandpa. But the women who are ruining my current mood of \"happy\", well, they've got another thing coming. It's time to put these women in their place because nobody messes with my happily ever after. Disclaimer: This is not a dark romance. There will be minimal angst or drama. There will be lots of laughs, frequent dropping of the F-bomb, and crazy monkey sex.Oh -- and check out the great playlists for this book (and others) - on the author's Spotify and Youtube sites. ENJOY!!",
