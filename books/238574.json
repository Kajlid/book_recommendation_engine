  "description": "'If you want a message to be heard, it has got to be sent out.' 'A Message in a Book' is a unique experience where you are the author and you are the reader. A love-lock, a message in a bottle, in a book. Read a message, write a message, share a message and find a message. Where will your message travel to and will it come back? As the buyer of the book you get the opportunity to dedicate the book to anybody of your choice. You will also have the option to write the 'Opening Message' in the book, or to give it to a friend or family member as a gift. The next step is to pass the book onto someone, so they can write the next message. In turn, they will pass the book on. The journey has begun, but where will it end? Will you find a book started by someone from the other end of the world? Will 'your' book find it's way back to you? A poem to help you on your way; It's time to write 'a Message in a Book' Maybe the 'first' or 'last' so take a look A love-locked poem, written in rhyme A memory that smiles, time after time A thought of something you want to do A something you did, a secret to you A person that has changed your life A Mother, Brother, Daughter or Wife A thank you, you never got to say A promise you'll keep, after today The book you hold is 'one of a kind' Words you wrote, someone must find Pass the book on and 'set it free' The message you wrote, lives forever, you see! A message from the author; 'I want you to share your messages with the world and feel comfort in the thought that others, have taken pleasure in reading them.' Lyv x",
