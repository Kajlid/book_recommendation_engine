She is with Lin Li in Australia, visiting family on her mothers side. It’s a swell vacation, then whamo! The best laid plans of travel writers and their friends often go kaboom! Time after time, Vic and Lin find the relevance in the saying, ‘It’s easy to get dead when you’re slow.’ Savage, unpredictable action! Guaranteed!",
