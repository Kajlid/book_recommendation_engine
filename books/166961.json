  "title": "Arnhem on the Horizon: The Story of WWII Glider Pilot Sgt Johnny Wetherall",
  "description": "In September 1944, around 1,300 men piloted military gliders from England to the Netherlands as part of Operation Market Garden. Among them was Sgt Johnny Wetherall, a 19 year old Glider Pilot from Oxford. During the battle which ensued Johnny was wounded and captured, taking him on a journey across war torn Europe. This true story follows his time training as a Glider Pilot, fighting in the Battle of Arnhem, lingering in prisoner of war camps and his eventual, unconventional journey home to England. It has been pieced together using letters and accounts from Johnny and fellow pilots from his Squadron, and is combined with an overview of wider events of the time to tell the real story of what these men went through.Review from The Eagle (Journal of the Glider Pilot Regimental Association): \"This is the first in a series of Arnhem linked books from the Author and he is off to a good start. If you are looking for a short personal story that helps you to navigate through the events of September 1944 then this is a great example. I enjoyed the intimate feel of the narrative and it has just the right balance of maps and photographs to help place the reader on the ground amid the chaos of the battle. Yes, thumbs up for a really enjoyable vignette of a Glider Pilot at Arnhem\" Arnhem on the Horizon is the first in the Airborne Memoirs Series.
