And that’s the way they like it. But there’s an undercurrent of sexual interest that has their mutual friends betting that it’s only a matter of time before they’re doing it the right way. But after a typical Friday night partying at the local campus pub, Hainsey takes is upon himself to teach Callie a much needed lesson about teasing the wrong guy. For her own good, of course. But tying her up while she’s passed out, he takes things a little too far. The next weekend Callie retaliates, getting even and giving Hainsey some overdue instruction of his own. The proverbial tit for tat. Can they bury the hatchet and call it even or have they effectively ruined an already precarious relationship with their raunchy one-upmanship?  warning: dubious consent",
