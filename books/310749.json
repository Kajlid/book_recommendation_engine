  "description": "Hunted. Hidden. Scattered.But the old bloodlines hold true.And now is the Time of the The Rising.It's been a hundred years since the Shade King orchestrated the Fall of the Graced; a century since he tipped the balance in his favour and brought those magically gifted warriors to their knees. But now a new power is rising and even the faintest ember, buried amongst ash and ruin, can reignite the flames of war.A mother with no memory. A general enslaved.An unwilling heir.And the two children who see it all.",
