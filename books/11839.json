  "description": "She's called the 'Scarlet Lady' - but only Zinnia Spring would rise above her shocking nickname by dressing defiantly in red. Ever since a false tabloid story ruined her reputation and her interior design business, this headstrong lady has made a living using her psychic abilities - a highly prized skill that sets her apart on the space colony of St. Helen's. But when she's hired by casino owner Nick Chastain, their meeting of the minds - and hearts - has her seeing stars....Nick Chastain craves what he doesn't have - respectability. He calls on Zinnia's powers to help find his father's journal, and to dig up answers to his own mysterious past. Zinnia doesn't have to be psychic to know what else Nick wants; together they're an explosive combination that may just blow St. Helen's sky-high with intrigue, danger, and a passion that's anything but predictable. But when a ruthless killer crosses their search, Zinnia must risk everything she's got - in a love affair where the winner takes all.",
