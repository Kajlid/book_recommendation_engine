  "title": "Robin Ince's Bad Book Club: One Man's Quest to Uncover the Books that Time Forgot",
  "description": "Is hideous prose and ghastly poetry more fabulous than great literature? Determined to find out, award-winning comedian Robin Ince has spent most of the 21st century rummaging through charity shops, jumble sales, and even the odd skip to compile the defining collection of the world's worst-inadvertently hilarious-books. Among the many genres it explores, the book will guide you through the hinterland of celebrity autobiography, unearthing underappreciated classics such as those by It Ain't Half Hot Mum's Don Estelle and the brother of a former PM (Major Major). It offers a detailed study of romance sub-genres, from the equine (Diamond Stud) to the gynaecological (Sign Of The Speculum). And it will prove invaluable to anyone who wants to know The Secrets Of Picking Up Sexy Girls. Above all, the Book Club is a manual-almost a life guide-training you up for membership of the Grand Order of Curators of Books That Should Never Have Been. Join the club.",
