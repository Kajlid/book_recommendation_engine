  "description": "2052. Longevity Law Enforcement detective Chris McGregor and his rookie partner Meg Dalton are hit with a new case: U.S. Congressman Dustin Meacher and 22 other people have been killed in a domestic terrorism attack in a D.C. restaurant. Chris and Meg are ordered to solve the case quickly – to find the ‘right kind’ of perpetrator - or risk fueling the protests that threaten to send the city up in flames. Again. Neither Chris nor Meg finds the murky official solution to their case acceptable. They stubbornly fight to change the game to one they have a chance of winning, even if it kills them. While The Third Curse is a prequel to the Longevity Law Enforcement 2107 Trilogy (Longevity, The Burning Rivers, The Dog on the Moon) it can easily be read as a stand-alone work of near future science fiction. For those who have read the trilogy, The Third Curse reveals how it all began for the two legendary detectives who virtually created LLE.\"Technological immortality is the prospect for much longer life spans made possible by scientific advances in a variety of fields: nanotechnology, emergency room procedures, genetics, biological engineering, regenerative medicine, microbiology, and others.\" - \"Immortality\" in Wikipedia",
