  "title": "Great Irish Tales of Horror: A Treasury of Fear",
  "description": "From legends retold around the peat fire to modern stories of psychological terror, the Irish have always had a fascination with fear. Drawn from 200 years of short story writing, this book includes 24 powerful Irish tales with more than enough material to set pulses racing: satanic figures, ghosts, and hapless victims fleeing from their inescapable dooms. Writers includes such giants of classic horror fiction as Bram Stoker, Sax Rohmer, and Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu; masters like George Bernard Shaw, John Millington Synge, and Dorothy Macardle; and such modern exponents of the genre as Brian Cleeve, Jack Higgins, and Neil Jordan.Contents9 • Introduction (Great Irish Tales of Horror) • essay by Peter Haining17 • The Morgan Score • short story by Jack Higgins31 • The Doomed Sisters • short story by Charles Maturin (variant of Leixlip Castle 1825) [as by Charles Robert Maturin]45 • The Child Who Loved a Grave • short story by Fitz-James O'Brien (variant of The Child That Loved a Grave 1861)51 • The Diplomatist's Story • (1955) • short fiction by Shane Leslie60 • The Portrait of Roisin Dhu • (1924) • short story by Dorothy Macardle69 • Danse Macabre • (1949) • short story by L.
