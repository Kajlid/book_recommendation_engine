  "description": "When twin teenage sisters go missing at the height of tourist season, Laurel, Maine Police Chief Tim Nichols’ summer of patrolling beaches and leading parades comes to an abrupt end. A desperate search for the girls takes him from seaside bars and abandoned farms to million dollar estates and cobbled-together shacks. As Nichols doggedly unearths scraps of information and deciphers a steady flow of half-truths, he finds a darkness coursing through Laurel’s sunny, tree-lined streets. He races to piece together the girls’ disappearance, knowing that doing so may tear the façade off his postcard-perfect town.",
