  "description": "What kind of danger does a gal have to be in for a Russian mobster to be her best bet of staying alive?  Selene might just be one of the best bounty hunters in the business, but today she’s in way over her head. The Bolivian cartel is out for her blood, and the only chance she has of staying alive is Markus Petrov, head of the Russian mafia. Selene is immediately attracted to his masculine presence and rugged good looks. Those wounded eyes and soft-spoken manners almost make Selene forget who she is dealing with. This man’s reputation is lethal. But he seems hell-bent on keeping Selene safe whether she wants his protection or not.  Selene has never buckled to any man before, but this time is different. Markus knows just what buttons to press to bring a woman to her knees. He’s a man who gets what he wants. And he wants Selene. So when the sexy starts to outweigh the scary, Selene knows she’s in real trouble.  It’s insane. She’s a bounty hunter. He’s a criminal. She shouldn’t even entertain the thought, but she knows what’s coming. Flying bullets, fiery explosions—that’s nothing. This bad boy’s bedroom is where the real fireworks are at.  AUTHOR’S NOTE: This 13500 word story is the second instalment of the Bounty series but can be read as a stand-alone story with a Happily Ever After. Bounty and the Beast is intended for 18+ readers only, containing mature themes, adult language, and very explicit scenes that are so hot, readers might well be advised to set aside time for a cold shower after reading.",
