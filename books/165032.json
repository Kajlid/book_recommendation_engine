  "description": "Darkness has a seductive power, a delicious energy that sinks its claws in deep. Once the devil has a hold of you, true malevolence is born.  Sheriff Brady James has sworn to protect the small town of Durham Heights, his current priority to ruthlessly hunt a sadistic killer on the loose. With lives at stake, his focus is split between two beautiful women - one dark, one light. The clock is ticking, the threat palpable; crawling closer at every turn. Once death has you in its sights, there is no escape.  Pain. Suffering. Lives shattered and broken. In the fight of good against evil, who will survive?  This is the first book in the Darkness series, a wishing evil upon others novel that can be read as a standalone.  Due to mature content and violent situations, this book is recommended for readers 18 years and up.",
