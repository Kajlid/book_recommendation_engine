  "description": "On Tartarus I was born…  Soaked in power and secrets—Tartarus is a city for rebels, exiles, and criminals. As a messenger, every shadow is my friend. I know all the secrets of this place. Or, at least, I thought I did. When my best friend, Kida, goes missing, I don’t waste any time assuming her identity to draw her or whoever took her, out of hiding.  On Tartarus I will die…  As I search for Kida’s whereabouts, Tartarus’ most dangerous gang—The Tanks—are slowly rising out of the chromework, growing more and more powerful. Every instinct in my body is screaming for me to run, to save myself, but I can’t—not without Kida. If I have to set the city ablaze just to get her attention, I will. And if the fire doesn’t kill me, the secrets I uncover just might.  ***THIS COPY CONTAINS BOOK 1 AND 1.5 OF THE SKY CITIES SERIES*** ***THIS IS A REVERSE HAREM TITLE***",
