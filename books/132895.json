  "title": "The Gods Were Astronauts: Evidence of the True Identities of the Old 'Gods'",
  "description": "Why do nearly all the world's major religions share such similar myths and legends? Erich Von Däniken, author of the runaway international bestseller Chariots of the Gods, believes he knows--and the answer is as wondrous and awe-inspiring as it is controversial: the winged angels populating the Bible, Koran, and other religious texts from cultures the world over were in reality extraterrestrials who visited the Earth in ages long past. Fully illustrated with compelling full-color and black-and-white photographs, the book takes us from the jungles of Myanmar, where ancient pagodas point heavenward in the unmistakable shape of spacecraft, to Portugal's mysterious legend of Fatima and on to the unexplained \"landing strips\" of Peru and Egypt, offering persuasive evidence that actual living beings inspired the legends that became the basis for many of our religious traditions. Intellectually challenging and provocative, these findings shake the foundations of both science and faith.",
