Unable to calm the civil war brewing on Venus, her only hope lies in the reclusive but powerful magistrate, Embrya, who sends Nadira and her friends on a dangerous mission to Earth in exchange for her help.  But as Nadira will learn, the lines between friends and enemies are easily blurred, and her own personal enemy may be closer than she thinks.  In the second book of the Venus Rising trilogy, friendships will shatter and new loves will form. And in the end, the cost of saving Venus will be far higher than any of them could ever imagine.  **Formally, THE SLAVE PLANET SERIES**",
