  "description": "Brad Holden, a psychopathic serial killer who had given Inspector John Broden and Special Agent Alex Darby a run for their money just a few years earlier, has escaped from the Northern Michigan prison he had been locked away in. There is little doubt amongst law enforcement that Holden will be making his way back to Branch County, in an attempt to settle a score with Kelly Jo Carter, the woman he... had victimized for many years. Holden is not their only problem though, as somebody is torching buildings around Coldwater, and the primary connection between all of the fires, is the significance each location holds in the past Kelly shared with her tormentor. Broden and Darby assume that the fires are the arsonist’s way of symbolically erasing the troubled past of the Carter woman and avenging the wrongs done to her. Kelly’s family and friends quickly become suspects, but there is a player they haven’t considered, with a motive they could never fathom. Time may be running out for the innocents, and this time, there are two monsters in their midst.\"Stand Out: Devil Seed\" is the second book in Reno's \"Stand\" Trilogy.",
