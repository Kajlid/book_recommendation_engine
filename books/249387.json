  "description": "When Prince John strikes a deal with a witch to save the love of his life, Isabelle, she curses him to live alone in his castle as a beast. He will feel nothing but hatred for the girl he once called his love, and he will kill her. But all hope is not lost, for if Isabelle falls in love with him within a month, the curse will be broken.  Isabelle arrives at the castle and the Beast is kind to her, providing her with food and a place to sleep. But once she informs him that she’s going to marry another man, anger consumes the Beast and he takes her as his prisoner.  What Isabelle doesn’t understand is that there’s a battle waging inside the Beast, with his animal and human sides fighting to reign supreme. As the days pass, an unlikely friendship forms between them and it’s not long before Isabelle no longer feels like his prisoner.  With the witch constantly trying to tear them apart, the Beast loses all hope of ever being a man again. Can Isabelle save him before it’s too late?",
