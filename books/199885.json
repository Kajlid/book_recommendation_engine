  "description": "A woman is caught in a gripping moral dilemma that resonates far beyond her place in time and history in #1  New York Times  bestseller Jodi Picoult's latest novel.A young woman and her husband, admitted to hospital to have a baby, request that their nurse be reassigned--they are white supremacists and don't want Ruth, who is black, to touch their baby. The hospital complies, but the baby later goes into cardiac distress when Ruth is on duty. She hesitates before rushing in to perform CPR. When her indecision ends in tragedy, Ruth finds herself on trial, represented by a white public defender who warns against bringing race into the courtroom. As the two come to develop a truer understanding of each other's lives, they begin to doubt the beliefs they each hold most dear.Praise for Small Great Things“I couldn’t put it down.
