However, Hannah's eldest sister Rosalyn runs away with an English boy and Hannah never sees Rosalyn ever again. When Hannah's youngest sister Jo dies, Hannah returns to England from Hong Kong to re-unite with Rosalyn who she hasn't seen for 20 years.

Then Hannah runs back to Rosie but again bumps into Julian at Rosie's place of work, which is a Charity for the elderly. Julian is keen to hold onto Hannah and not let her run away. He takes her on a weekend documentary research trip to York to locate the Charity's owner in order to save the Charity from being torn down by the local Council. Hannah helps him since she is a freelance journalist. During the trip, Hannah realizes she and Julian have always loved each other. Yet Hannah has to overcome her jealousy for Julian's best friend Elizabeth and her family values in order for Julian to finally wed her in a secretly planned wedding.",
