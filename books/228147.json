  "description": "The war in Europe is over and America is dancing to the Charleston and swigging bootleg champagne. Brought together again by their aged but still lovely grandmother Arab, the descendants of the famous McLeod daughters now gather in California, and are drawn to the movie capital of the world...JO, returning from Germany with her husband and her marriage in trouble. NORA, the servant's daughter trying to keep the whole family together. LIANE, part Asian and altogether beautiful, having to choose between her estranged rancher husband and a new love. DENISE, the flame-haired firebrand from Scotland, determined to become a flapper and a siren-starlet of the silents. But after the publicity shots with Valentino and the sophisticated parties, there's another darker side to the raucous Hollywood of the twenties, one that threatens all the Daughters of the Silver Screen",
