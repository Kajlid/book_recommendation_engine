  "description": "Nani Flores hasn't had an easy life, but she's an adaptable girl. Maybe too adaptable. But after she's spun into an immortal existence after getting kidnapped by a beautiful man that radiates danger and chased by daemons and assassins she realizes her old life really wasn't so bad after all. Now with help from a handsome stranger with electric blue eyes, she finds herself trying to accept who she's become while those around her want her dead, all because she's more than human. She is a de novo with a secret that even she doesn't know. Jackson's life has always been about self control and service to others. After all, he is a vampire and vampires are renowned for their cold calculated logic and mastery over their emotions. They are the only daemon's who can be trusted. For decades Jackson has worked for the Decretum, an organization that helps uphold the laws of the Concilium to make sure no Heteromorphic species has too much power, but he soon finds out that not everything is how it seems and Jackson fights to keep Nani alive to fulfill his duties. Unfortunately it seems that even the venerable Jacques Larouche cannot control himself when it comes to the beautiful enigmatic woman he is sworn to protect.",
