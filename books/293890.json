Self-assured. Sexy. And the most frustrating man I've ever laid eyes on.When we're forced to work together, sparks fly. But is the attraction enough to risk losing everything? Or should this truce be in name only?\nLuke\nThe moment Olivia walked through the door, I wanted her. That is, until she opened her mouth and ruined it with her 'I can do it better' attitude.When weâ€™re coerced into working together, I start to see Olivia in a different light. She's smart, vibrant, and gorgeous. Is that enough to let go of the past or will my demons turn our truce into a lie?",
