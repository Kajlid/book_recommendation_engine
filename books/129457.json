  "title": "The City of the Wild",
  "description": "This illustrated book for young children poetically describes a corner of the author's neighborhood; the author and her friends often visit this magical, peaceful place where nature and time are supreme masters. Using good versification and vivid imagery, the young writer depicts the rainbow of colors and the varied magical faces of nature, as they are displayed throughout the year, so far away, and yet so close, to the city.",
