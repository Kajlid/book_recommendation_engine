  "description": "Open to any page in CPR for Dummies and you just may read a line like He's a priest; of course he hesitated when he realized he was about to hit someone with a crucifix. OR I needed to believe someone higher than the government was in charge of things so I went to church. OR \"We are here to, like, honor your loins and everything,\" said Ruth. The world is creeping towards destruction--no, not theoretically--it's really happening. In these last hours will humanity come together to correct their collective wrongs? Or will there be rampant beatings and kinky sex? A group of strangers are brought together by synchronicity to answer the age-old you lookin' at me, punk? The answer entails the comeuppance of the rich, police brutality, aerobic instruction by the Messiah, sexual slavery, and mutating genes. (Is this sounding good? I hope so. It's not easy writing these. I'm just a corporate monkey trying to snag your hard-earned dollars but don't let that get in the way of buying this book. Did I mention SEX yet?) Author Mickey Z's experimental tour-de-force is a funny, challenging deconstruction of the concept of the \"novel\" as well as life in the United States of America.",
