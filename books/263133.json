  "title": "Cop Tales: An Anthology for a Cause",
  "description": "As authors, we are always trying to find ways to give back. Anthologies are a great way to unite indie and traditionally published authors for a worthy cause. In this anthology you will get a combination of rom-com, new adult contemporary romance, and even a little suspense short stories with law enforcement heroes and heroines.  Cop Tales is a limited release anthology to raise funds for the Officer Down Memorial Page (ODMP). We back the blue and thank you from the bottom of our hearts for support in this cause.",
