  "description": "Come along on a summer journey of two souls seeking release from their own perceptions of hell.From a medieval, seacoast realm, comes this haunting love story that hovers on the cusp of fantasy. 19-year-old Dugan is the troubled son of an evil man. He is beautiful, he is forbidden, and he has captured 16-year-old Collie's heart. But is the young man truly as dangerous as Collie's parents make him out to be?When two worlds collide, Collie and Dugan struggle with their own inner conflicts as they attempt to break the barriers that constrain them, hoping for the freedom to finally fulfill the love that keeps drawing them together. But the choices they make aren't always wise, and all good things must one day end. Sometimes, much too soon.A story of dramatic love and equally dramatic loss, seen through the eyes of two innocent, but defiant adolescents. Its simple medieval setting brings to light many of the societal issues of today, including domestic violence, child abuse, bigotry, class segregation, and religious intolerance.",
