  "description": "The secrets within the bloodlines of this family are deadly ...  Emma Sorrento went from a carefree, young woman one day, to the paid-for bride of a mafia boss the next. She had been groomed for this life and position, but she didn't even realize it until it was too late. Promised to a man she despised, and stuck in a world where her desires and happiness are of little importance, she quickly learned to keep quiet and stay pretty. That is how she survives, even when life deals her devastating blow after blow, determined to knock her down for good.  Until one day, a man with black eyes, a black soul, and a blacker heart wakes her up again. He's dangerous. He's all parts bad. He's also her husband's nephew, and she should know better.  Calisto Donati gives Emma every single reason to live.  And maybe die, too.  They were never star-crossed. They were always impossible.  Donati Bloodlines: The Complete Trilogy follows the story of Emma and Calisto through three full-length novels, to a final Happily Ever After. It also includes a 20k companion novella to the trilogy titled Behind the Bloodlines.",
