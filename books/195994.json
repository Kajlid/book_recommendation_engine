  "description": "What do you do when someone you trust threatens to sell you into slavery? Find the perfect place to hide out. Destitute and apathetic from the loss of her parents, Willow Demora is forced to accept any help thrown her way. Unfortunately, the only person willing to help is her cousin, a cousin who doesn't have a good bone in his body, and would do anything to stay out of the trouble he's in.Hawks MC enforcer, Trey “Dodge” Monroe is a renowned hard-arse, now living in Caroline Springs. There are only a few brothers he trusts with his life. The rest have to gain his respect while they learn not to screw with him, especially when he finds Willow and discovers he’s willing to do anything he can to save her.Even if it means he gives up his man-card, like the other love-sick members he's laughed at in the past, he’s ready to give it all.",
