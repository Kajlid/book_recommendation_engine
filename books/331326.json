But you know what they say about glass houses… When one night goes horribly wrong—with the whole world watching— she’s challenged to swap lives with the salty, albeit gorgeous, man she rear-ends with her car.For mechanic Evan Bailey, life is definitely not a party.

Now the only way for either of them to get what they want is to go for broke…",
