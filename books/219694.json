  "description": "When the thread of hope is split into two, which side will you take? After the capture of three book-bearers, Isaac, Xylia and Arundel are beckoned to return to Agalmath to meet the Dark One. Around the four corners of Elysium, Lucifer and his servants are gathering an army--uniting men, beast, Shadow and Nephilin to expand his kingdom. Hidden in the shadows and holding one of Lucifer's most faithful servants in captivity, the blood-drinkers continue to hunt down Isaac and the others, seeking to retrieve the Book of Letters. Isaac and Xylia's courage and willingness to fight is starting to wane as they now fear that the path they have taken will claim their lives.  \"When the stars blood drink. When the moon red turns. When the snow melts away. That's when Elysium will burn.\"",
