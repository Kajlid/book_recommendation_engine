  "description": "In the quiet Canadian town of Algonquin Bay, a frozen body has been found in an abandoned mine shaft. She is soon identified as Katie Pine, a teenager who had disappeared months ago.At the time, Detective John Cardinal insisted that Katie was no ordinary runaway. His relentless pursuit and refusal to give up on the case, and his lack of results, got him demoted from Homicide. Now the police force wants Cardinal back on the caseâ€”to work with a new partner, Lise Delorme. Unfortunately, as these two officers who don't trust each other slowly gather evidence of a serial murder spree, a pair of sociopaths is quickly moving in on the next victim.Librarian's note: there are six novels in the author's John Cardinal series.
