  "description": "Did he do the right thing? No one loves Darian like Tyler does. Not her friends. Not her fellow Shaedes. Not the Shaede king who wants her for himself. Tyler is the only one who sees beyond the swagger and swordplay that make her the most fearsome Shaede assassin in the world--the only one who recognizes her loyal heart and vulnerability. But her evolving powers and compulsion to finish every job no matter the stakes fills him with fear. For he knows it's only a matter of time before he loses her. When that moment nearly comes--and Tyler discovers a trail of deceit that prevented him from protecting Darian--he snaps. He breaks. And he leaves. Now he must learn to live without her, even as they remain bound to one another. And when a friend of Darian's faces an unknown threat, Tyler must find a way to enter the fray without crossing paths with Darian.",
