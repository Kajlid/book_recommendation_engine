  "description": "\"Two World Order\" is a fascinating geopolitical thriller set in the not too distant future. Global geography has been altered due to reckless Russian mining practices, which has caused major shifts in the tectonic plates resulting in massive earthquakes which reduced continental America into the American Islands. In this shattered world, oil-the lifeblood of our global existence-has practically evaporated from the planet, putting all of the now-existing nation states on the brink of war. Realizing that Earth can no longer sustain the human population, America has only one attempt to reach a newly discovered planet that would give humanity a second chance at survival. Can America succeed and escape the impending collapse of modern society?",
