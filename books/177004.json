Handsome princes may be worse. Never trust a gypsy: Anwen’s father has been saying this for years, but it isn’t until Anwen is robbed and deserted by Dimitri, a handsome gypsy prince, that she is forced to accept the wisdom of his words. Now Anwen must find Dimitri's troupe and take back her family’s greatest treasure--the changeling stone.The first place to search for Dimitri is in Lauramore, where the largest marriage tournament in over a decade is drawing in hundreds of traveling performers. While posing as a tambourine girl, Anwen meets Galinor, a melancholy prince who is having a rough month himself. After a little cajoling, Anwen convinces the prince to help her retrieve the changeling stone.Joined by a ragtag party of royals, they set out on a seemingly simple mission, but soon the pair face complications in the form of stolen horses, mischievous fairies, and a dark creature that stalks them through the forest. Despite the odds against them, the hardest task in front of Anwen may be tending Galinor's broken pride--and trying not to fall head over heels for him. Because gypsies are certainly trouble, but handsome princes may be worse...",
