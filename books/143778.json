  "title": "The Revolutionary John Adams",
  "description": "John Adams comes to vivid life for young readers in this addition to Harness's acclaimed presidential picture-biographies. Dynamic artwork and lively narrative create a warm, personable portrait of the stubborn man from Braintree, Massachusetts, whose passion for liberty spurred him on to extraordinary roles as a Founding Father, first Vice President, and second President of the United States. Through Adams's eyes, kids witness the tension-enflamed streets of Boston, the bickering Continental Congress, the complexities of waging the War for Independence, and the challenges of governing a new nation. Vivid quotes from both John and Abigail Adams provide great primary source material for school reports, and three illustrated maps show readers where key events took place.\"How wonderful now to see his story told for children in such an appealing fashion. Cheryl Harness's illustrations and text are first rate, appropriately full of life and understanding.\" —David McCullough, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of John AdamsNational Geographic supports K-12 educators with ELA Common Core Resources.Visit www.natgeoed.org/commoncore for more information.",
