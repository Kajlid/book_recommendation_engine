  "description": "In a world that experienced the genocide of the Great Elemental Dragons, human beings struggle to survive. The four breeds of dragons (Air, Earth, Water, and Fire) kept balance for both the land and the people. A lone Air and Fire dragon team return to the village. The High Priest watches them circle above, praying they come in peace. From his village, the Mad King instigated The Great Losing, an attack that obliterated many of the beasts. He holds his hands high as a sign of truce, hoping this communicates the villagers' desire for peace. As he watches them, fear grips him. Humans may have crossed the point of no return with the dragons. Were they here to seek revenge against the Mad King? If angered, what desolation could the dragons cause to his fragile village? Was there any hope?",
