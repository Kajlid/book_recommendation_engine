  "title": "Never Too Late",
  "description": "Maggie thinks her life is idling in neutral. The children now live and work in London, and her husband always seems to be away from home on business. A rescue dog helps her feel less lonely, but as her 43rd birthday approaches she cannot decide how she is to start a career without qualifications or experience. On the night of her party her life takes an entirely unexpected turn: her husband causes a car crash, and while he is in hospital Maggie is shocked as first personal then business secrets are revealed. The familyâ€™s future now pivots around the decisions she must make, about her marriage, about the business, and about the children, as it becomes evident that they, too, need to make some big changes in their lives if they are to find true happiness. And Maggie will never see life in quite the same way again.",
