  "description": "ASIN B01951K5V8 moved to this edition.INTRODUCTION Shanghai Nobody is book one of the fiction series, Master Shanghai. It is the story of one young Chinese man's adventure to find love and purposes in the 21st century Chinese metropolis. Written in humorous tone, author Vann Chow brought to you a satire of urban life in China. Her story explores cultural phenomenons such as China's gender imbalance, selfish generation, new rich, migrant workers, digital loneliness and Capitalist tyranny, reflecting on the glamorous and not-so-glamorous side of the rise of a modern nation through the eyes of one nobody of Shanghai. PREVIEW The problem is, there are simply way to many Chinese men on this side of the world. After years of killing off --- I am not going to spare your sensitivity because it is what it is --- baby girls and let live the baby boys in Mainland China by the ignorant bunch, there are officially way too many Chinese males in the country for each of us to have a fair chance of being in a heterosexual marriage. This means, I am stat out of a girlfriend, wife and a lifelong companion. The good news is that not having a girlfriend at the age of thirty, which is way above the average marriage age for Chinese men for the past five thousand years, has nothing to do with you, or me, per se. It is just all circumstances.",
