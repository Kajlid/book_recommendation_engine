  "description": "Fiercely protective of her heart, India Burke let down her defenses when Cris Ardmore went from another notch on her D/s playdate belt to everything she could never admit she wanted. But being disowned by your family and betrayed by your lover aren’t easy to get over, and India’s old fears of intimacy creep in against a backdrop of professional drama that forces her return to a place that never really felt like home. Though she proved her loyalty when it mattered most, love is about more than grand gestures and Cris wants all of her—which may be more than India is able to give. Can Cris and India navigate to a shared future or will they forever be off course? ** Please Note: Intimate Geography is Book 2 of The Compass Series and CANNOT be read as a stand-alone. Personal Geography, the beginning of Cris and India’s story, released on December 1st 2014.**",
