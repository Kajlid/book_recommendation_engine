  "title": "Norton's Philosophical Memoirs",
  "description": "Norton is probably one of the most well-travelled dogs in the world. He has chased down tennis balls in Central Park, checked out the fairer sex in Kensington Gardens and rescued a woman in distress on the Swedish island of Gotland. Norton and Håkan got to spend eleven years together. They shared many adventures and developed an enormously strong bond of love and friendship. In these memoirs, Norton the dog and the philosopher recounts his numerous travels, his best tips for enjoying life, and the many wisdoms he has amassed from living his life with the two-legged race called human beings. Composed with love, tenderness and subtle sense of humour, Norton's Philosophical Memoirs is Håkan Nesser's small, thoughtful and celebratory volume to his beloved dog Norton. A book that will suit both dog lovers as well as anyone who has ever wondered what human behaviour actually looks like to our four-legged friends.",
