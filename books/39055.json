Purveyors of the sickest, slickest sounds on the planet, they’ve more demons between them than Dante’s Inferno. Whatever their deadly sin, these prodigiously talented hellraisers have all come dangerously close to the edge. Tragically, not all of them have returned.Uncovering the crazed antics of each, Cemetery Gates is the ultimate tribute to the stoical survivors who dragged themselves back from the abyss — and the sainted icons who weren’t so lucky. Gifted with mind-blowing musical prowess, the likes of Dio and Dimebag may be gone. But this book — a riotous epitaph to men who’ve lived day as if it was their last — ensures they'll never be forgotten.",
