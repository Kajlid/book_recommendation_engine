  "description": "Five Cardinals have been found murdered all over the world with either the word sin, lust, deceiver, envy, or hypocrite carved into their skin in Latin. Full-bodied Eliza Black and her handler, Father Michael Bishop, discover a black mystery reaching deep into the Vatican and history itself. Pitted against vampires and an evil older than man, curvaceous Eliza must solve the supernatural world-shattering mystery hidden by the Holy See 100 years previously. In the end, she might earn back what her mother had to Asmodeus so many years ago; Eliza's soul.",
