They are coming.Three years ago, Olenka rejected her place of privilege among the clergy, carving out a new life for herself as a sirena of the Great Sea. But when she begins seeing bleak visions of a gruesome future, she is forced to reconsider the dogma of her youth.They are nearly here.Given his outlander heritage, Corinâ€™s only wish was to stay out of trouble. He grew up hearing the songs of Vallin, and the campfire rumors of unseen horrors stalking the plains, but they were never more than shallow words on superstitious tongues.But then one breached the city.In a city split by fear, and on a sea scarred by plague, Olenka and Corin must learn to listen to the mysterious voice whispering to their hearts and face an age of blight that is destined to be repeated.Repeated, because it never truly ended.Complex societies, different cultures, and deep friendships make this coming of age fantasy series perfect for fans of M.
