A few new faces have been added as well.These USA Today and International Bestsellers have collaborated once again to bring you brand new biker stories that’ve never been published before. A combination of full-length novels and novellas are within the pages of this edition.A couple of these authors have written about characters in their clubs you already adore, while others are launching a brand new series.Each story takes place in a separate club, but you can always count on copious amounts of danger, suspense, angst but most of all – chemistry.We ask you again: will these men and women put everything on the line for their brotherhood, or will they risk it all for love?This collection includes stories from Nicole James, Dani René, April Canavan, Elizabeth Knox, Addison Jane, Claire Marta & Nia Farrell, E.C. Land, Erin Osborne, Amy Davies, Kristine Allen, Chelle C. Craze & Eli Abbott, Claire Shaw, Rae. B Lake, & Scarlett Black",
