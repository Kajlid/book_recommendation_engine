  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Sylvie Meadows is less than thrilled when her college dormitory assignment turns out to be a 19th century converted mansion, nestled on secluded Cooper Lane in small-town Pennsylvania. But she certainly isn’t prepared for the mysteries that await her as she climbs the winding staircase to her third floor dorm room. Immediately bombarded by an array of cryptic messages, gifts, and visions that no one else can rationalize, Sylvie begins to question her sanity within days of her arrival at Caroline Hall.Corey Danberry is a popular frat boy, unprepared for his breath to be taken away by the petite red-head named Sylvie who arrives at his party and changes his life. But Sylvie needs his help and there is nothing he won’t do for her, even if it means believing in the phantom visions that appear to her in the basement lounge of the ancient Victorian house, or studying an obscure Shakespearean comedy that alludes to the answers she seeks.Trapped within the walls of 6 Cooper Lane, Oliver Towers has been solemnly waiting for his love to return to him and there is no one who can keep him from her. Since his demise in 1904 under suspicious circumstances, his spirit lingered. “I have been forced to exist without you between these empty, loathsome walls. Why do they insist on standing? I could not rest, my darling, until you were here once again, beside me. But you have returned, my Silver Sylvia! You are home. And this time I will never let you go.”",
