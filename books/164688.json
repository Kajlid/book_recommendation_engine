  "description": "When Sharona finds herself the target of an unpleasant man in a bar that the Black's Raiders MC is visiting, she learns that sometimes the guys with the tats are the only ones who will speak up for a lady. Okay, the handsome man with the black leathers didn't exactly speak up, but a solid sucker punch is just as good, right?  Is she more afraid of waiting around for the cops, led by the jerk from the bar's brother, or of getting on a hog behind a handsome stranger who could take her, well, just about anywhere...  EXCERPT:   \"You're pretty,\" he said quietly. \"I like your hair. Red's nice on you. Does the carpet match the drapes?\"  Sharona began to struggle out from underneath his arm, but he just squeezed her more tightly against his bulk.  This man may not have been enormous, but he was strong, and Sharona was a short and slender young woman. She dug her fingernails into his arm and he winced, but he held her as tightly as iron bars.",
