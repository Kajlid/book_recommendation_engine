  "description": "To kill without consequence: If you were given a chance at deadly retribution with a guarantee that the law could not touch you, would you take it?That’s the opportunity that Agent Graves provides, in the form of a special briefcase containing an untraceable gun and one hundred rounds of ammunition. To the damaged and downtrodden living on the fringes of society, the offer is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to even their scores. But beyond the dilemma of whether or not to pull the trigger lies a deeper and even more troubling concern: Just who is making these actions possible-and why?This third of five volumes reprinting all 100 issues of writer Brian Azzarello and artist Eduardo Risso’s 100 BULLETS collects issues #37-58 of their acclaimed Vertigo series, and includes never-before-seen character sketches by Risso for an unproduced 100 BULLETS video game.",
