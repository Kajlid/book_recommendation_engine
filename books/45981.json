  "description": "From the Author...I know I am a better human being because of illness. My life has more meaning and purpose, as I value the things that many take for granted.An adolescent love affair that turned into happily married with children is what my life story comprises. The added medical component serves only to fortify our foundation, and adjusts our priorities and perspectives.I hope you find a little bit of yourself within the words I've written. I'm sure that the frustrations of your challenges, and elation of your joys, are similar to feelings you've had in your own journey. If not, you'll benefit from immersing yourself in new and different experiences.I've written from my innermost sanctuary. I ask you to open your heart, open your mind, open your soul, and open the pages of this book.When my body said NO!, my mind and soul said SO! Please allow yourself to let go, encourage yourself to grow, and ultimately look to your mind and soul, then say \"So what? I might not have everything, but I do have something, therefore I can sew to repair, mend, create a new, and I can sow and spread and plant great things.\" We only travel this road once, so make it the adventure of a lifetime!My wish for you is to become inspired to fly higher, for you and yours...as I have for me and mine.",
