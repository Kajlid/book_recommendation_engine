  "description": "Originally published in the IMMORTAL anthology, edited by P.C. Cast.Living in West Texas is sort of like living in Hell, but without the favorable climate and charming people. Living in Morganville, Texas, is all that and a takeout bag of worse. I should know. My name is Shane Collins, and I was born here, left here, came back here—none of which I had much choice about.This story was first published in the BenBella Books anthology Immortal, edited by none other than P. C. Cast, so if you want to read some other killer YA vampire tales, go in search of it! You won’t be disappointed.I decided to do an action-oriented story from Shane’s point of view. There was a running joke at the time that I should throw some zombies into Morganville, and while I didn’t succumb to the temptation in the books, I veered into it here … in a way. We get to visit some great Morganville locations, fight some zombies, and find out where Michael has disappeared to … and what Shane’s father has been doing just beyond the town’s borders that might change everything.This story is set sometime after Michael’s transformation to full vampire, but not long after; Shane’s still getting used to the idea that his best not-a-vamp friend has switched sides. There’s a little bromance, and a lot of Frank Collins.I might have been thinking just a little bit about the iconic Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode ‘The Zeppo’ … but only in the undead football player sense. And yes, I quoted the eighties movie Buckaroo Banzai. Guilty as charged.",
