  "description": "Aksariel is a typical Angel of Death: brutally honest, jaded, and beautiful. But when his superior all but commands him to fall in love so he can better understand its bonding, Aksariel digs in with both heels. That is, until his alter ego meets Caroline Eppley, a woman who seems to have walked out of his fantasies and into his heart. Caroline doesn't think she has time for love since she's the sole caregiver to her dying mother. Time suddenly doesn't matter when moody, sexy hospice volunteer, Alec Krayle, comes to her rescue. Now Caroline can't seem to resist the forgotten pleasures she finds in his arms and he can't seem to resist the temptation falling in love with her poses.",
