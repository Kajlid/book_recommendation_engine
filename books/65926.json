  "description": "Sex + money shouldn't = love, but since when does the heart follow any laws but its own?Recent college graduate and mathematical genius Skye McCord is determined that this summer he's going to do something he's always wanted to try--living. And, as a scientist, he's not leaving anything to chance. He's got a new job in Las Vegas, a signing bonus burning a hole in his pocket, and what else does a brainy geek spend his money on but an education? But this time, it's one of a carnal variety.Liam Maddox isn't your ordinary gay male escort--he's actually gay, and he really loves his job. Especially when he meets his newest client. Skye's cute and awkward and sort of odd, and when he informs Liam that he wants to hire him to teach him everything about being gay, well...Liam's too intrigued to say \"no.\"Except what starts as lighthearted lessons in sex and seduction quickly becomes more as Liam taps into a submissive side of Skye the young man never knew he had. Also, Liam's never been this drawn to anyone before, and he's beginning to wonder if he can walk away when their time is up. Or does happily-ever-after exist for someone like Liam with someone like Skye?Genres: Gay / Contemporary / BDSM (Light) / Exhibitionism / Public Places",
