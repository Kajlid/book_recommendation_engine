  "description": "What Does \"Godly\" Look Like? A great treason is infiltrating the Christian world today. The gospel is meant to set people free, but instead it has been subtly tainted by the enemy. False teaching has slipped in virtually unnoticed, but its effects are deadly. To-do-lists, competition (even with spiritual disciplines) and extra rules have enslaved women to self-righteousness instead of leading them to Christ's righteousness. Disguised as \"helpful tips for women,\" this distortion robs Christian women of intimacy with each other and labels them as \"godly\" for what amounts to human effort and worldly success. Many people view this competition for godliness as striving for excellence. After all, what man doesn't want a woman who is zealous to be the best homemaker, mother, and wife? But if organization and domestic genius were prerequisites for godliness, then Martha Stewart would be one of the godliest women in the world. The truth is, when women spend more time trying to appear godly rather than actually being close to God, there can be no other motive than a desire for approval from people rather than from God himself. \"Grace Is Free\" unmasks this false gospel and the bondage to people's approval that comes with it. It attempts to realign perspectives and help women understand how to rest through faith in what has already been accomplished through Jesus Christ. The true gospel is received through faith, not activity. \"For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: 'The righteous will live by faith.'\" (Romans 1:17)",
