  "description": "He came for me with claws and flames, and dragged my soul to Hell.I never believed in the supernatural—until demon wolves hunted me down and dragged me into the violent embrace of the Infernal Court. The Court where I once ruled as their demon queen in a past life.A life I have no memory of.Now a prisoner in an opulent cage of blood and gold, I’m the plaything of a cruel king who claims I’m his wife. All others are forbidden to speak to me, look at me, and especially to touch me.Lucifer, the Hellish wolf who tore me from the only life I’ve ever known, insists we have a past together... and a future. He’s deadly, seductive, and full of a dark rage. His forbidden touch is worth risking everything—and ignites the long dormant demon of lust and craving within me.But if we dare to defy the king… we’ll pay for our sins in blood and hellfire.Hell Bound is the first book in a paranormal romance trilogy with a strong heroine, a darkly possessive anti-hero, scorching steam, and breathtaking action. This book ends on a cliffhanger and is NOT RH. For mature readers only.",
