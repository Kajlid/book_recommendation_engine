If only the brothers had normal parents, not a scientist mother and a father who experiments with travel in space and time. If only the twins had noticed the note on the door of their mother's lab: EXPERIMENT IN PROGRESS. PLEASE KEEP OUT.But it's too late for regrets. There's a strange--and very small--person approaching, with a miniature mammoth in tow.At last it's Sandy and Dennys's turn for an adventure--an adventure that becomes serious when they discover that \"many waters\" are coming to flood the desert. The twins must find a way back home soon or they will drown. But how will they get back to their own time? Can they?Cover illustration by Cliff Nielsen.",
