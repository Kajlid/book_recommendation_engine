These victims have been drained of blood and Lotus knows, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that they have been committed by a vampire. Her search will take her to Las Vegas, and that is where the true adventure will begin, when she finds out who has been searching for her.This is part I of Lotus's journey. Parts II & III are also available for download. Paperback is the entire series, all 3 parts in one. DAUGHTER OF DARKNESS LOTUSWATCHERGUARDIAN",
