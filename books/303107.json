  "description": "A Small Town Best Friends to Lovers Romantic Comedy \nHow do you tell your best friend you’re in love with her when she’s busy dating everyone but you?\nAmeliaI’ve been called a smart-mouthed, tattooed firecracker with a penchant for running straight into trouble. However, after coming off the worst break up in history, I’m focused on getting my life together. Having my best friend change the rules on me just isn’t in my plan. Especially when my ex comes back to town to wreak havoc.TitusI’ve never met anyone I couldn’t get along with. Which is how I found myself friend-zoned by Amelia way back in the sixth grade. I’ve always been there for her, but I’ve never told her how I really feel. Now that Amelia is single again, I’m determined to make my move. But Amelia has never gone down without a fight, and this will be no different. We could explore the possibility of love with a best friend…or Amelia could unfriend me forever.Author’s note: The sassiest heroine with a heart of gold takes off her blinders and sees the hero with new eyes. And Titus, good Lord, you're guaranteed to cheer—and swoon—for the nice guy to win. Plus there’s a peacock, a flamboyance of flamingos, an Elvis impersonator wedding in Vegas, and lots of small town craziness to steal your heart and guarantee laughter.",
