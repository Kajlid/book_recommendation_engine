  "description": "Ginger Knox thought she was living her best rom-com life. She had the job, the apartment in Notting Hill (adjacent), and an honest to God Hemsworth clone for a fiancé, but when she arrived home one surprisingly sunny February afternoon to catch her man with his tighty whitey’s around his ankles and his secretary *insert eye roll here* in their bed, the tenuous facade of her life dissolved in a split second.  It was time for Ginger to become the leading lady in her own love life.  And that’s just what she planned to do until her life is, once again, thrown into disarray when her flight home for Christmas was grounded. Suddenly she’s stranded in Istanbul, Turkey, with the man of her dreams. Of course, it’s the same man she had the near one-night stand with – and who knew he was one of the most famous men in Turkey!  Between Sydney, London and Istanbul, Ginger was resigned to the fact that she may never get her Happily Ever After, but what about her Happily Right Now?",
