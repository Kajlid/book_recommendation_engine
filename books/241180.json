With emotions already heightened, she discovers a long-ago cherished gift hidden under the chaos of her once organized drawers, invoking a secret memory of a college, a powwow, and Sam â€“ a young Mohawk, who made a single weekend last a lifetime. When Catherine acquires a commission to paint the cover of an author's new historical romance novel, she's drawn even deeper into the nostalgia of that captivating weekend. Will this new adventure keep her stuck in the past, or will it be a second chance at love?",
