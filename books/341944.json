But things get hairier than expected when Elise starts to choke on her popcorn mid-movie--and once the lights go up, she's dead . . .When tests reveal Elise's popcorn was poisoned, Detective Sam Holden eyes her husband as the guilty party. Charlene doesn't believe Darren would hurt his wife--even if his company's specialty seasoned salts were sprinkled on the fatal snack. But who else had a motive to do something so unsavory? With a little help from Jack, the handsome ghost who haunts her B&B, Charlene delves into the ill-fated couple's past. And the more she learns, the more Charlene wonders if this time, she's bitten off more than she can chew . . .",
