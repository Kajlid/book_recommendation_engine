  "title": "Leaving Mother Lake: A Childhood at the Edge of the World",
  "description": "The Tibetans refer to Moso country as 'The Country of Daughters' because of their unique matrilineal society. In Moso culture, daughters are favoured children. There is no word for father, marriage is considered a backward practice, and property is passed on from mother to daughter. LEAVING MOTHER LAKE is the haunting memoir of a girl growing up in a remarkable place. In her village, Namu was known as the girl whose mother tried to give her away three times because she would not stop crying. The strong-willed Namu clashes with her equally fierce mother, becoming alienated from village life. When Chinese officials come looking for talented singers, she seizes her chance and breaks the taboo that holds Moso culture together - she leaves her mother's house. Winning a place at the Shanghai Conservatory of Music as a special minority student, Namu becomes 'the Madonna of Tibet', singing on the soundtrack of The Joy Luck Club.",
