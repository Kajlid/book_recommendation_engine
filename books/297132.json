Whether the setting is a brief encounter in Persia or a wife-swapping party in the suburbs, a pre-war English tennis party or an Irish wedding. William Trevor reveals himself once more as a master of regret and betrayal: and a master of telling a story which is never false to the human heart.Contents: In Isfahan/The Distant Past/Angels at the Ritz/Mrs Silly/The Tennis Court/A Complicated Nature/Teresa's Wedding/Office Romances/Mr McNamara/Afternoon Dancing/Last Wishes/Mrs Acland's Ghost",
