  "title": "Take a Line for a Walk: A Creativity Journal",
  "description": "Every artist and designer, student or professional, needs a journal space to play in new ways, to think with a pencil in hand, by inventing, imagining, and thinking creatively. Unlike a blank journal, Take a line for a walk is a Creativity Journal--comprised of varied prompts, cuing people to respond to whatever creative action the prompt calls for--sketch/design/conceive/write. The author collaborated with esteemed designers, artists, architects, and experts in a variety of disciplines to deliberately vary prompts, which address numerous ways of thinking and creating. Designed by internationally acclaimed, Modern Dog Design Co., this imaginative, fascinating and playful journal entices all types of students, visual arts - and non-art majors alike, to supplement in-class projects or to stimulate thinking on a summer break or after graduation, to keep creativity flowing in this unique space.",
