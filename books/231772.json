  "description": "A cold case heats up . . . A dead man in Big Bay Creek, spring break, and a rogue FBI agent would be enough to drive Chief Callie Jean Morgan to drink . . . if she hadn't already quietly crawled inside a bottle of gin to drown her sorrows over a life ripped apart by too many losses.When her investigation into the strangerâ€™s death heats up an unsolved abduction case, Callie finds herself pitted against the town council, her son, the agent, and even the raucous college kids enjoying idyllic Edisto Beach.Amidst it all, Callie must find a way to reconcile her grief and her precious taste for gin before anyone else is killed.",
