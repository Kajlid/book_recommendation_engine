  "description": "Long, dark hair. Dewy, khol-rimmed eyes. Ripe young lips just made for kissing? Guys like that are dime a dozen. Wild Bill likes a little edge on his playmates, and Michael's got the whole package going on--plus a loaded gun in his leather jacket, and an unquenchable obsession with vampires. Michael's back, and he's got a few new tricks up his sleeve. Hopefully the latest addition to his arsenal doesn't include a wooden stake with Wild Bill's name on it. But anything can happen in the dark?",
