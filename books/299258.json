  "description": "Peace is fragile. Power is shifting. And something old is waking.After fifteen years of uneasy peace—won through the Mesiconian Empire’s annexation of the once-independent Luthandia—the realm begins to stir with the currents of change. Bandits stalk the roads. Beasts stir in ancient forests. And whispers of lost power echo across the land.In the province of Fallwood, Lord Alain—young ruler and son of a war hero—must rise to meet a storm no one fully understands. Among those at his side are Gareth, a seasoned ranger bound by duty to his lord; Lystra, a deadly Blademaster from a distant land, guided by a strict code of honor; Cid, a man haunted by visions he barely understands; and Bjorn, a steadfast warrior whose loyalty may be the only thing holding them together.Winds of Change is the first book in The Shaper Chronicles, an epic fantasy saga of shifting alliances, inherited legacies, and a magic system where reshaping the world comes at a terrible cost.When peace fails, who shapes what comes next?",
