  "description": "Sideshow at Honeycreek is a story of the desperate struggle for survival on the Texas frontier during the last bitter winter of the Civil War. It chronicles the efforts of the Ike Burns family and their friends in a grim fight against the elements, Union agitators, the Comanche, Confederate indifference, and sometimes each other on the very edge of western expansion in late 1864. The events are true and the main characters are based on the lives of real people. The author has done his job recreating the era and basing his story on original research and actual events.Show More Show Less",
