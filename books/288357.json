Now he’s gone, and Mom disregards her fifteen years of work in favor of a slick stranger who declares his intention to buy the store just minutes after meeting her. There’s no way Kaitlyn will let a handsome face in a ridiculous suit derail her plan, but she soon finds that Chris is full of intriguing surprises.From their first introduction, Chris can see there’s only one thing standing between him and his dream—entitled Kaitlyn Carris. He’s determined to kiss his soulless consulting life goodbye and settle in tiny Heron Cove as the owner of the small town’s grocery store, but as he works beside Kaitlyn every day his respect and attraction for her grows.Soon the inevitable competition begins to feel like a cruel trick—there’s no way for them both to get what they want, especially when each day makes it more clear that what they want is each other.",
