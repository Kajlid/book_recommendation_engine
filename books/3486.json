  "description": "The Mob is the saga of a crow family, the Kinaars, who are faced with troubled times. When the family converges for the annual Gathering, a mob mounts a revenge attack on a cat -- with disastrous consequences. The Gathering should be a time to rejoice. Instead, it becomes a time of fear, danger and uncertainty, when ancient laws and customs are tested. A tribunal passes judgment -- the instigator of the mob, the impulsive and charismatic Kyp, must be punished. Then, just when the Kinaars are divided over The Mob attack, an unexpected blizzard spells more trouble. They desperately need a safe roost. The family splits, leaving the Gathering Tree to seek shelter in forbidden worlds ?",
