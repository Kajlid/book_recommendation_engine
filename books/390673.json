  "title": "More Thoughts of Chairman Moore: Volume II: The Wit and Wisdom of Brian Moore Vol. II",
  "description": "Pitbull is back and angrier than ever, with another collection of hilariously well-observed and rambunctiously argued grievances about the mad world of sport and beyond. Following the success of The Thoughts of Chairman Moore, Volume I, you might have hoped that sport's powers that be would have sat up and taken notice of its many faults and flaws. But alas no, lunacy prevails and so Brian has taken it upon himself to put forward another collection of his unique insights and not-so-unique frustrations. Uproariously funny and spot-on in its every complaint, Volume II is required reading for anyone who can't live without sport but who also can't help but wonder at its unbridled idiocy!",
