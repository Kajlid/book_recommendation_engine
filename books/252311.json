As he is about to end his miserable existence, he encounters a mysterious beggar who claims to have been Gabriel Taylor, the CEO of the world's largest chemical company. The Beggar reveals to Sam that life has a formula, and nothing is a coincidence, or chance. The mysterious Beggar shows Sam, that each and every one of us, has a predetermined purpose to accomplish in this life. After spending hours talking to Sam about how to let life unfold and free his mind from worry about the future and regret and anger about the past, the beggar mysteriously disappears. This sends Sam on a search for the truth about Gabe, himself, life, and love.",
