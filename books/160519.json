If only she wasn’t a freak.She wouldn’t be hiding from the Rain, a secret organization intent on destroying all supernatural creatures. Neither would she have run from Clay, the object of her desire.

Learning that Clay was a threat to her survival, Evie had no choice but to flee.Now Clay’s back—battle-scarred and mysterious—and the attraction between them is undeniable.
