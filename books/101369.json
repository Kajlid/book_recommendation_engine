  "title": "Sea of Hooks",
  "description": "Sea of Hooks is a novel structured to reflect the interweaving of the two worlds inhabited by its main character, Christopher Westall. Christopher holds the spheres of ordinary days and weeks in precarious balance against the shifting field of images and voices that lies behind them. A series of traumas shatters this balance. The parallel narratives recount Christopher's youth in San Francisco, where he struggles within the icy Victorian household of his mother, and his subsequent journey to Bhutan for answers to questions that haunt him. Sea of Hooks is comprised of the shattered fragments of Christopher's world and is driven by the forces that compel him to reassemble it...at any cost.",
