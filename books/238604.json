  "description": "'Dazzling!' Kelly Link 'Fortmeyer's humor, sweetness and focus on sexual and medical consent are winning' The New York Times Morgan Stone was born with a hole in her middle. A perfectly smooth patch of nothing where a something should be. After seventeen years of fear and shame, doctors and nurses, 'peculiar' not 'perfect', she has had enough of hiding. One night, among a sea of bodies and lost in a moment of blissful abandon, she finally bares all. A few photos uploaded to social media is all it takes to create a media frenzy. Overnight, Morgan becomes #holegirl. And then she meets a boy who is literally her perfect match. They could be each other's cure. But can he truly make her 'whole'? Feisty, feminist and downright different, Hole in the Middle is the story of what happens when a girl who is anything but 'normal' confronts a world obsessed with body image and celebrity. 'Kendra Fortmeyer's debut is more heart than holes, creatively brilliant, wacky and wise. An author to watch!' Bonnie-Sue Hitchcock, author of the Carnegie Medal-shortlisted The Smell of Other People's Houses",
