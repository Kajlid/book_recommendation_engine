  "description": "*The first book in this series, Awakened, is Free!*   His entire life Ethan has been keeping his more violent urges a secret from his family. They all think he is just antisocial, what they don’t know is that every day he struggles not to give into his growing desire to kill. Looking to escape for just a little bit and hoping that a change of scenery will help him, he agrees to join Isabelle and Stefan in Bermuda.  What he doesn’t expect is for Emma to walk into his life and change it in ways that he’d never anticipated. Just when he finally begins to find some peace in his life, a dangerous threat from Emma’s past arrives. Ethan is willing to do anything to keep Emma safe, even if it means giving into the brutal nature he’s fought so hard to keep at bay. Giving in a little though, may mean giving in for forever, if he is unable to bring himself back from the darkness that has always enticed him.  *Due to content and graphic language this book is intended for readers 18+*",
