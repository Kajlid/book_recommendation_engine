  "title": "The Barry Island Murders",
  "description": "Retired Chief Superintendent Williams (the semi-legendary \"Williams Of The Yard\") has sold the serialisation rights to his memoirs, and is dictating them to a reporter from a leading national newspaper.In this first (and very possibly last) volume, he takes us back to the '60s and his days as a young detective in the Playground of the South Glamorgan Glitterati......Barry Island.In these three cases, bodies keep turning up in unusual locations. Will Williams' budding detective skills be equal to the task of catching any of the murderers? Will his current gin intake permit him to remember any of the details?Transcribed from the original interviews, the only changes made have been to names, places, dates and facts. Oh, and cutting out all the heavy swearing.",
