  "description": "I'm like any other woman you see everyday. I dress, I talk and smile like any normal person you encounter on a daily basis.I might seem \"normal\" on the outside but once I return home, this momentary bravado will all but disappear.They say evil could be taken in any shape or form. That they prey on the weakest link, the one with the gullible mind and a heart of gold. And once you've been baited into their domain, you've nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide. And trapped in miserable life full of fear, full of darkness.",
