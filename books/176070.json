She never wanted the attention, the pity or the heartbreak so she kept the secrets inside where no one will ever find them. Where she can lock them away and forget. Emily's life turns upside down just when it started to become bearable and the only upside is the one guy to catch her interest since the summer--Alex Payne. Fate brought them together and Emily is not passing it up. Even after something truly heartbreaking happens and she is left broken and alone, feeling worthless and scared. Love, family, friendship, secrets and loyalty are all put to the test in the first book of the Enough Trilogy. With a best friend who is hiding something major and people not seeming who they are, Emily must decide what to do next. Just how far is a girl willing to go when people she loves starts to get hurt? And how much can she take before breaking completely and not feeling like she's enough?WARNING: Due to heavy subject matter, involving rape, and other mature content, this book is recommended for ages 17+",
