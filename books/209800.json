  "description": "“…The divine are not immune to the affliction of love…”Avena, a blithe beauty with a palpable aura, has always much preferred romanticized adventures in the forest to the daunting obligations of Roman society. Her only chosen companion has ever been Ferveus—the dark and deeply passionate, often intimidating, rather talented son of Vulcan. When it’s clear the blushing buds of adolescence have bloomed into young adulthood, and a supernatural incident brings Ferveus out of the iron forge and into Avena’s constant company, a childhood friendship irrevocably changes in ways that will frighten them both. As a forbidden love begins to grow and identities are questioned, will they fight to be together, or will a predestined tragedy keep the sparks of romance at bay and inevitably define their futures?In a world of mythical Gods, untamed magic and prophecy, can love still conquer all?",
