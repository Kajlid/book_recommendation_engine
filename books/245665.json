  "description": "PRIZZI'S HONOR is no ordinary story of boy-meets-girl. Charley Partanna is a faithful lieutenant for the Prizzis, New York's most powerful Mafia family. The object of his affections is Irene Walker, a Los Angeles-based tax consultant. But it's her freelancing that pays--she's a hit woman for the Mob. She has also cheated the Prizzis out of an unforgivably large sum of money.This is very dangerous moonlighting indeed, and eventually it places Charley's oldest loyalties in conflict with his newest one. Which wins?\"His best book since THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE...he mixes caricature and character as easily as Charley hacks off thumbs.\" (Chicago Tribune Book World)",
