  "title": "In the Land of Men",
  "description": "In this powerful collection of stories, Antonya Nelson portrays women whose lives have slipped loose from their moorings and the men who can't really anchor them. Here we meet Roxanne, the tomboy who consistently chooses men who are not her equal; the loving Marta, whose husband keeps a separate house where he retreats when married life overwhelms him; and Bebe, a married mother of two teenagers who leaves it all behind when her lover comes on a motorcycle to claim her. With painfully keen perception, Nelson creates stories that linger in the mind long after they are read, and which create a unique view of relations between the sexes in the small towns and big cities of America.",
