But before her feet even leave the sand, she's taken hostage by a vengeance-driven pirate nearly as young as she is.Her capture is the key to his freedom...Captain Draven’s scarf veils more than his face. Underneath, he struggles between morality and survival. When Lux sees deeper into his motivations, she’s torn.
