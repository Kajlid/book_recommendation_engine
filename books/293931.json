  "description": "Seyda Yorkson is a is a daughter of a wealthy, noble line, brought up in society and trained to be a proper lady. Though she has been raised with expectations clearly laid out in front of her, she has always admired Lady Kaylyn Madara, the Heroine of Centralia who saved their country years ago. Now there are more Dragonriders and a new clutch of dragon eggs, and a call is sent out for the country's next generation of guardians. When Seyda defies her past and becomes a Dragonrider, there are plenty of hurdles to overcome. None of the Dragonriders think she has what it takes, but Seyda is determined to prove them wrong. In order to do that, she and her dragon must learn how to become a team and stand together in the face of political pressure, society's expectations, and secrets. While Seyda has her own secrets, a dark secret the older Dragonriders have been hiding is not as easily forgotten as they want. For a small country with larger enemies searching for a weakness, failure could mean this time Centralia won't win the war. If Seyda doesn't learn what it means to be a Dragonrider, it could spell disaster for them all, and the alliance between humans and dragons could be at an end.",
