  "description": "We are pulled to each other like magnets. Or moths to a flame perhaps? Let’s hope the burn doesn’t scorch too badly. Can you handle the heat? Time and space disappear and we are alone. The where is irrelevant. Only the who is of any consequence. You and I. For now. Until such a time that there is no you and I to speak of. Bodies merged into one. And then we dance. *** Escape into this erotic short story by award-winning, USA TODAY bestselling author, Alex Lux and get lost in the seduction that can happen between heartbeats. Adult sexual content. Graphic sex.",
