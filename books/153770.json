  "description": "A hidden beauty . . . a wounded beast. Can the curse threatening their happiness be broken?There is absolutely nothing improper about Hannah Foster, the vicar of Hartley's eldest and least pretty daughter, nursing the badly wounded Viscount Blackthorn back to health-that's if the returned officer can be saved. At twenty-seven, she is two years the man's senior, a confirmed spinster, and far too sensible to develop feelings for her patient. The fact he was once her childhood friend and has grown into a fine specimen of a man-his terrible scars notwithstanding-has no bearing on the matter. The viscount is unlikely to see past her plain exterior and recognise the caring, intelligent, passionate woman beneath. Even if he does, he's determined to break the curse that has plagued his family for generations by letting his bloodline die out. Her best friend Grace's warnings are moot; a man of Lord Blackthorn's wealth and position would never be interested in a woman like Hannah . . . would he?Â Returning to his childhood home, a place he'd vowed never to set foot in again, William doesn't expect to survive the terrible wounds he received while fighting the French at Arapiles-certainly not with all his limbs intact. Bullied into making what can only be described as a miraculous recovery, William can't decide if his nurse, the hazel-eyed woman with the lovely voice, is an angel or a devilish imp. She torments him, both with the foul-tasting concoctions she insists on coaxing down his throat, and by showing him a taste of heaven . . . of what might have been . . . if he were not cursed by the sins of his forefathers.",
