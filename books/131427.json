  "title": "Tantric Voyage",
  "description": "Life has been overfull with pressures and responsibilities for Hira Randall, with no time for satiating her more primal needs, so she books a sailing charter to satisfy at least one of her passions, sailing. But the charter unexpectedly turns into an erotic adventure with a man who’s heart is broken literally as well as figuratively. Julian Beard, captain and owner of the “Arrow,” lost his Beloved after nearly a decade together practicing the sexual and sensual rites and rituals of ancient Tantra. At one time an accomplished Tantrika, now he is a man-at-sea, surviving but not thriving, tucked away in an obscure corner of Washington state until the moment that Hira walks up his dock.",
