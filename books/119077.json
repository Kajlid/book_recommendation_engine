  "description": "Something Old, Something New, Someone Borrowed out of the Blue…Zoe Fitzpatrick will do anything for her catering clients, but this is getting ridiculous.It’s the wedding of the year in DC and the bride and groom have eloped. The father of the groom is a powerful senator who is set to announce his run for the presidency of the United States in front of all of the VIP guests and he’s not about to let a minor problem like a missing bride and groom ruin it. With a tempting offer of a big check and a set of dream jobs, he asks Zoe to step in last minute and pretend to be the bride.With her catering business teetering on the edge of devastation, Zoe can't afford to say no, even though her stand-in groom is the arrogant, pompous, and frustratingly attractive twin brother of the groom, Luke Whitfield. Ugh.Zoe and Luke are trying to play newlywed happy, but they already look ready for a divorce. It’s hate at first sight, but as the night progresses through wild first dances, awkward kisses on full display, and a humiliating experience with the President, the pretend feelings start to get dangerously close to real.Borrowed Bride is a laugh-out-loud, enemies-to-lovers, fake engagement/fake wedding, full-length standalone romantic comedy with a HEA. Perfect for fans of Christina Lauren, Ali Hazelwood, and Sally Thorne!",
