  "description": "Manhattan executive Corbin is haunted by memories of another time--memories that do not belong to him. Then, in the midst of a raging New York City snowstorm, the inexplicable images become more vivid and real. And before he knows it, Jonathan Corbin has stepped into a bygone world of gaslit streets and horsedrawn carriages--and into the center of a nineteenth-century maelstrom of love, revenge, obsession...and death. Through the swirling snow, he can make out the figure of a woman--someone he can't possibly recognize, but does; someone he knows he is destined to kill.",
