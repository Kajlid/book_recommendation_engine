  "title": "The Amazing Pitsville and The Beggar's Invisible Railways",
  "description": "A mystical land, a revenge obsessed two-hundred year-old lunatic who has the power to create his own evil dimensions, enslave millions, and make mystical lands his breakfast, and one dare-devil, adrenaline-junky, egotistical maniac who has the bravado to save them all if only he can first figure out how to save himself from his own vanity. Of course, the one thing that can help him save himself is the one thing the revenge obsessed two-hundred year-old lunatic is lusting over, Pitsville. McGavin will need help to stop The Beggar and his invisible railways from becoming an immortal king and reigning over one of the purest forms of life ever to exist. Unfortunately, his only help will come from a high-strung, fuzz-ball mystical critter, a careless Army tank driver who almost blows them up twice, and a confused fireball spitting beast who doesnâ€™t understand the difference between good and evil. Then again, he will also have the help of the most cosmically beautiful woman in all of the heavens, so beautiful that in Pitsville, light is shed from the imprints of her feet.",
