  "description": "In this dazzling third collection, poet Savannah Brown holds a magnifying glass to modern intimacy with a lens that burns as often as it illuminates. Moths, ex-lovers, Jeff Bezos, and other supernatural creatures flit through the pages as Brown charts her own cartographies through London and the world wide web seething in everybody's pocket. These poems pinch and pull through the smallest moments, like someone trying to zoom in on a smartphone photo, or someone in the thrall of a bad, bad habit.",
