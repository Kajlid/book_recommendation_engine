  "description": "Ordinary. Plain Jane. Goddess?  Aine Luna Parker here. I’m an ordinary, plain Jane. Until I entered the most imposing mansion known to man. Then the crazy train left the station and now all I can do is hang on for dear life.  I’m some supposed Goddess destined to bring magic back to earth. The problem isn’t the magic or all the new crazy in my life. It’s the men that come with the job.  It all started with three hotties that have bodies made for sin. Oh, How I love that sin. However, I just can’t seem to stop collecting more. The more I collect the more chaos they create. If my sex drive would calm down so I could focus on the problems at hand. I might be able to locate the prophecy that will help me release the world’s magic. If only these men didn’t draw me in like a moth to the flame.  Goddess, please don’t let me burn.  *Warning this book is intended for 18+. It is a fast burn Reverse Harem series, with a cliffhanger. This book contains lots of M/M interactions, light BDSM, and other explicit sexual scenes some readers may find offensive.",
