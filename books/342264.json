  "title": "How to Raise & Train Your Peppermint Shrimp",
  "description": "Why struggle with a dry, incomprehensible (boring) scientific manual when you can get a fun, easy to read guide that's packed with all the information you'll need to successfully raise the saltwater aquarium shrimp, Lysmata wurdemanni, in your home or classroom? This book is loaded with all the details that other manuals leave to experience and it is written so that it can be understood even by individuals who lack the scientific background and vocabulary to comprehend those other manuals.  You will get details on how to set up a spawning tank and how to encourage your shrimp pair to become romantically involved. Instructions are included for constructing a larvae collector so that even if your shrimp are producing eggs within your reef tank system, you can gather the babies without disturbing your aquarium. The larvae collector can even be used to collect larvae from other species too! You'll learn about larval requirements, from how to house them to how to feed them, as well as descriptions of their various stages and behaviors. There's even a troubleshooting chart to help you work through and eliminate problems, before they get out of control. And, yes, there IS a chapter on training your homegrown shrimp! This new edition also includes expanded chapters on alternate methods of larval rearing, raising other species of aquarium invertebrates, and commercial propagation.",
