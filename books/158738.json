  "description": "Former watt pad story unpublished and no longer available.My name depends on what my current assignment is. This month I am Calia Winters. I am a master of the art of seduction. I can bring men to their knees and have them begging me please for just a taste. My job is to seduce your husband. Why? To give you proof of his cheating heart so you can collect that hefty prenup sum. Hank Carter was supposed to be just another job. Another cheating husband put in his place. The country music star was an easy enough target. The only thing I didn’t count on was feeling guilty for the first time ever in my six years at Sizzle Inc. I knew seeing him again was dangerous, but I couldn’t stay away. You know what they say don’t play with fire or you might get burned.",
