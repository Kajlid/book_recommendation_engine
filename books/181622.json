He’s working toward a degree in a field he loves and even managed to score one of the coveted singles in the nicest upperclassmen dorm. There’s only one problem. Daniel. The guy whose single is attached to the other side of the connecting bathroom. The mess Alvaro could maybe ignore. The wet towels, balled up socks, and bottles and bottles of bubble bath. It’s the singing he can’t take. Every night it’s the same. Daniel takes a bubble bath and murders another of Alvaro’s favorite songs. One night, Alvaro stomps into the bathroom, ready to halt the mangling of another musical memory. But his feet fly up and his head smacks down. Daniel hops to the rescue in all his wet, bubble-covered glory, and a relationship begins that will continue to set Alvaro reeling. Until now, Alvaro’s life has been heading in the right direction. But can an attraction this strong—even to a guy who doesn’t organize his socks—be all wrong?Wrong Direction is a sweet and sexy novella with lots of clumsy mishaps, cute dates, and deep thoughts about life’s multiple directions.",
