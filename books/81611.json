  "description": "What do tampon Easter lilies, onion flavored peaches and a designer store hiding under the guise of a local Shop and Save grocery have in common? The prayers of Grace.Grace is 21-years-old, lives in Happy Meadows Trailer Estate, hates her church quilting group and, as far as she can tell, “has the good Lord’s ear.” Having his ear has enabled her to have a successful internet prayer business. For only thirty-five dollars a week, Grace prays for those who are sick, lonely, and sad. Her story is woven along with the stories of five of her clients: Cindy, who wants to move to Florida to escape tornadoes; Frankie, who longs for parties like the ones she enjoyed back in the heyday of Studio 54; Arnold who nervously hopes for the success of his “closed-door” women’s clothing and accessories venture; Drew, who is an inmate at Ware State Prison; and Johnny, who is looking for the girl he saw in a vision. When things begin to unravel for Grace, a series of uncanny events unfold which lead her on a journey filled with ridiculous situations, touching moments and a belief that can’t be shaken.",
