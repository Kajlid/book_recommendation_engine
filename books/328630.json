  "description": "England is bleeding. And there isn’t a thing I can do about it.I am once again a prisoner to Wessex, captured by King Egbert because holding me hostage will bring them to him—my two Vikings who will risk heaven and earth to save me. But I don’t need saving. I am Princess Emeline, and I was taught by the best, and his name…Skarth the Godless.The man whom I love more than anything in this world. But things begin to blur when Ulf the Bloody reminds me of the promise I made, and that promise is that I belong to him. We must work together to overthrow King Egbert, but the war I fight within my heart is far more dangerous than anything I will ever face on the battlefield. The choice is not simple because we all must make sacrifices. But I soon realize that all is not fair in love and war. Lives will be lost.Hearts will be broken. And come dawn, life as we know it will be changed forevermore.",
