  "title": "On A Bender Abroad",
  "description": "When a young man from California goes abroad in search of adventure, he finds himself caught in the whirl of the Italian nightlife, embedded with dreamers, drinkers and hopeless romantics. He parties with foreign beauties and annoying expatriates, close friends and belligerent acquaintances. Like any good adventure abroad, the stories are filled with triumph and failure, romantic encounters and botched seductions, shame and shamelessness.",
