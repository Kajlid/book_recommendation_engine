  "description": "Lucien Lance - a ruthless, relentless corporate raider. A man known for his single minded determination and his uncompromising thirst for money and power. A man so fearsome they had a name for him on Wall Street. Lucifer.When young Angelica meets Lucien at a business function she quickly discovers just how dangerous and sexy Lucien is, as he seduces her into an erotic world of dominance and submission using a mysterious pleasure technique called the 'Devil's Touch'.But Lucien's hunger for wealth and control comes with a cost... and Angelica must decide how much she is willing to risk to earn the chance of love. JUST A TASTE:The first brush of his tongue was broad and soft, setting a swathe of new nerves on edge. Then when she felt his mouth again, it was as a series of hardened rapid flickers around – but never quite on – the jutting stiffened nub at her center.“Oh, God. I... I can’t take... I’m going to scream!” she hissed.“Do it!” Lucien encouraged her. “Scream, Angelica. No one will hear you. Scream as loud as you can.”And she opened her mouth wide and the cry in her throat was a release of all her humiliation, her wanting, and her ecstatic rapture that sounded as a long exultant roar in the most absolute and shattering moment of Angelica’s entire life.Her eyes fluttered open slowly, and there was a dreamy, almost intoxicated glaze to her expression. Lucien was kneeling on the bed holding a glass tumbler of water. Angelica blinked up at him.“You fainted,” he said, and handed her the water.“I... I fainted?”Lucien nodded. “Just for a moment. It’s nothing to worry about. The Devil’s Touch does that to every woman.”",
