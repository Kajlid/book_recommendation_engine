  "title": "Lytefoot",
  "description": "To absolve himself of his guilt, the famous author, Nathan Rothwell, recorded an admission on a smartphone before his death, of what really took place the night his sister and Lytefoot hall's estate manager were murdered; his obsessive love for the ghost of the beautiful heiress, Lady Arabella Lytefoot, and his struggle coming to terms with a dark entity, so twisted by rage and jealousy because of his love for her, that he could reach out and harm those in the material world. A year later, the phone, which was never wiped after forensics, falls into the hands of a 21-year-old police officer in training, Steven Runcombe, after the 8-month long investigation concluded Nathan Rothwell was still guilty of the crimes of murder. Heeding Nathan's story gave Steve a curious thirst for the supernatural though, especially after also discovering his close friend, Rob Slatterley, had witnessed the smiling spectre of his girlfriend, just after her funeral. Armed with borrowed ghost hunting equipment and the dead author's smartphone, Steve, Rob, along with two other reluctant friends, head over to Lytefoot to seek the truth about 'what is the afterlife'? while trying to uncover more of Nathan Rothwell's story. However, what they didn't envisage, was the danger they'd put themselves in, the minute they entered the park. A foreboding place, where the shades of the past reveal themselves in unusual ways, and where reality had ceased to exist a long time ago.",
