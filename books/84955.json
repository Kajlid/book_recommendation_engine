  "description": "Jack's story is often funny but also refreshingly candid. By the time he was two years old he had run in hundreds of races but was considered 'two slow' by the industry. Unbeknown to Jack he escaped having a bullet in his head but was instead thrown from a van into a ditch on a busy road near Canterbury in Kent after having 'his identity' ripped from his ear with a pair of pliers. He was one of the 'lucky' ones that ended up in a rehoming centre where he was loved and cared for until an owner could be found for him",
