  "description": "True love…or a trap? Minders, Book 1 Josh Mackay has studied his quarry for two months, and now it’s time to earn his pay. Bringing in an escaped Minder—a psi who can bend anyone’s mind to his will—takes a specialist. Luring the surprisingly naïve Kiran Brunner to a safe house is almost too easy. As the tranqs take hold, though, the beautiful monster’s last plea, don’t let them hurt me, tears at Josh’s conscience. To his horror, they do just that. Kir let his loneliness and instant attraction to Josh lure him into a trap he should have sensed. Even as his consciousness fades, he sinks psychic hooks into Josh as a pure reflex, a survival instinct honed by years of abuse at the hands of the agency. Even though Josh’s job is done, he finds he can’t simply walk away. Not only because of what Kir is, but why the agency wants the boy back. Trouble is, he doesn’t know if he’s doing the right thing…or if his will is being twisted by the mind of a murderer.
