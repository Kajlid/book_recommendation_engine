  "description": "Rosemary Laurey is back with another wickedly delicious tale of love, lust, and the otherworldly with a new, and decidedly sexy, twist. . . Some Guys Are Real Animals. . .Antonia Stonewright isn't about to change her views on love. A sexy mortal companion is fine every now and then, but a soul mate? A partner for life? Please. She was burned once, and hundreds of years haven't healed the wounds. But reclusive potter Michael Langton is. . .different. His gorgeous wares are perfect for her new art gallery--and his gorgeous body is perfect for her. She can't get enough of his toned muscles or his amazing, dark eyes. Their nights together make them both purr with pleasure--except in Michael's case, purring comes naturally. So much for finding a regular boyfriend. Antonia has a truly sexy beast on her hands. . .\"Great stuff!\" --\"Romantic Times\" on \"Kiss Me Forever/Love Me Forever \"",
