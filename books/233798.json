  "description": "Keeping someone’s secret tore my life apart. I’ve paid retribution and now I’ve got to get my life back in order. I’ve made enough mistakes and now I need to spill my secrets to make those I’ve wronged and have them understand why I did what I did. Upon my release from prison, I made a set of goals—none of them included a raven-haired beauty who spoke her mind. I didn’t intend to have someone in my life romantically, but fate brought us together and I couldn’t ignore the attraction any longer. What I didn’t know was that she would teach me that one of my goals could have a different meaning. Now, my life is opposite of how it used to be; I’m no longer the man who gambles, drinks and sleeps around. With the strength of her by my side, I can do anything.",
