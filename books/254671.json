  "description": "Live hard. Love harder.Up until this point, I’ve been living my life for everyone but me. Trapped under my controlling mother’s expectations and rules.My only escape—a carefully guarded list of things I can only dream of doing. One by one, I slowly find the courage to start living.And that dream becomes a reality the moment my lips crash against a mysterious stranger’s in a drunken attempt to check another item off my list. In a single night everything changes.I wasn't prepared for the explosion between us, or how that one kiss would change the course of my entire life.Ethan Romero is the complete opposite of everything I’ve ever known. He’s the dark to my light. The corruption to my innocence.He’s showing me that life is more than a list to be checked off. It’s about living in the moment so you don’t miss the ones not on the list—the ones you didn’t even know you wanted.",
