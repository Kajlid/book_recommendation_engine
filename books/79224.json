  "description": "This was available as a perk for people who donated to the Harry Potter Alliance's Equality FTW fundraiser.The first section of John Green's unfinished, abandoned novel THE SEQUEL, which is a sequel to a novel that doesn't exist called THE ODD AT SEA. About the story, John says \"THE SEQUEL contains a lot of the ideas that ended up in THE FAULT IN OUR STARS, although it's a very different kind of story. I worked on THE SEQUEL between 2008 and 2010 before finally putting it aside. There is of course a REASON why I abandoned it: It isn't very good. But it has some moments I still like, and I'm hoping seeing a draft like this will provide a window into one writer's process. And of course I want to raise some money for the HPA!\" THE SEQUEL is the story of a young woman named Hannah al-Hajji who finds herself alone in the world after the novel in which she is a character ends. Everyone else in the novel disappears, but she for some reason is left with us. The story costars a young student chaplain, recently graduated from college, who happens to have read the novel that Hannah was a minor character in. The selection is 6,437 words long.",
