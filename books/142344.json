  "title": "Wildish: A Story Concerning Different Kinds of Love",
  "description": "An epic, romantic comedy set in the libidinous world of 18th Century London. Mystery, intrigue and wicked humour - historical fiction at its sparking best! England 1745. Poet and Master Wig Maker to the great and the good of London society, Wildish is a man whose ambition is to enjoy life to the full. Yet already events beyond his control have begun to impinge upon his dissolute life. The heart of the nation is beating to the drums of war, and thousands of vengeful Jacobite soldiers from Scotland and France are about to converge upon the capital. There is also the presence of Johanna: mysterious, enigmatic and vulnerable, a woman unlike any other he has ever known, and the inconvenient and yet increasingly agreeable sensation that he might be falling in love for the very first time. A magical journey into the outrageous, libidinous world of Georgian England where reality and fantasy, romance and the occult combine in a story of epic intensity and poetic beauty.",
