  "description": "Never trust a fairy...  Amara Seth's life was going fairly well. She had a steady job, she had her own apartment. The only thing missing was a cat - and maybe someone to keep her company in the cold winter nights.  A favor for a friend turns into a nightmare when a fairy turns her world upside-down. She wakes up in Fae, and already there are weird people in gray robes trying to kill her.  She's determined to get home. She even has help -- a ghost and a thief who make a deal to get her there. They're hot, and they're ready to protect her against the unknown dangers of this strange land. Things could definitely be worse.  But the longer she's in Fae, the more complicated her life gets, and the more hopeless getting home seems. A birthright, a dead kingdom, and the Bringer of Death bring new challenges she never even dreamed of. And in a land where her very existence is seen as a threat, getting home may become secondary to just staying alive...  This steamy reverse harem fantasy is intended for adult readers.",
