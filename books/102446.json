  "description": "A quest for Bigfoot and big love from the New York Times bestselling author of How Hard Can It?“For a good time, read Robyn Peterman!”—Michelle Rowen, national bestselling author A few hard truths . . . Don’t bet on Hasselhoff, Bigfoot might actually exist, and searching for the impossible may lead you to your heart’s desire . . .  It’s a big fat hairy deal when I lose yet another bet to my best friend, Rena. Not only do I end up attending Bigfoot meetings with her kooky Aunt Phyllis, I find myself traveling with a band of reality TV, Sasquatch-hunting nut-jobs! Not to mention a suspiciously shady film crew. As if those little nuggets aren’t enough to send me on the express train to Crazytown . . . I stupidly swear off men!  Clearly all this would mess up any gal’s social life, but the worst part of the story? The minute I send my libido on vacation, I meet Mitch. Yep, Mitch, the sexiest cop ev-ah. The hottest, best kissing, finest tushied, SINGLE guy I’ve ever laid eyes on. I’d rather be hot on his trail than anything that involves the word Big or Foot. But sometimes what you’re hunting for has been right in front of you all along . . .   “Robyn Peterman has this fantastically kooky/dirty/off the wall sense of humor that totally turns my crank . . . If you want/need a slapstick-esque romance with adventure you need to read Size Matters.”—The Book Vixen   “Incredibly funny and well written . . . All around it was just a romping good time!”—The Geeky Blogger’s Book Blog",
