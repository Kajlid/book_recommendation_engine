  "description": "Samuel deserves to die a thousand deaths.  I was so close to going home and then he ruined it all.  Now, I have to focus on how to survive because I don’t think I can go home.  And to be honest, after a few more nights with Benny, I’m not sure I even want to. Plus, the more I learn about the circus, the more intrigued I become. I discover that I have abilities I couldn’t have even dreamed of if I’d stayed in California.  But, if I’m to survive, I might have to embrace dark magic.  Can I do that without losing myself?  Or am I destined to become evil?",
