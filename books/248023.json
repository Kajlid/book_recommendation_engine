  "description": "Total Recall meets Scott Westerfeld’s Uglies.Sleep for three months and make your problems go away.Ellie Savage is used to promises. Her dermatologist dad and her psychiatrist mom run the Narcosis Clinic, a medical facility famous for ultimate makeovers, where disturbing issues are resolved while patients are beautified. Clients like pop star Dean Mathews are grateful to narcosis for healing their deepest wounds. Ellie is her parents’ most ardent supporter until her dreams become a nightmare. Ellie discovers that her true self has been shredded to bits by the scalpel and the only way for Ellie to remember is to forget everything she thinks she knows.\"The relationship between Cole and Ellie is absorbing (it's indisputably a mutual affection) while the twins' dynamic--they're supportive but playfully combative--is likewise effective. The plot eventually spins into thriller territory but shrewdly incorporates themes of parenting and self-confidence. Cypress' prose throughout is colorful: a crowd getting into 'a ginormous frenzy' and Ellie walking 'in a fog of convoluted memories and migraine medicine.' Well-defined characters in a zigzagging medical tale rife with surprises.\" --Kirkus",
