As the puzzle unravels, not least about Kimeranet’s past, a further mystery develops, as the travellers discover part of the Legend of the Kraal, and meet Kaarvok ... but should they trust him? And can they remain united as they struggle through this newly found world? Follow this next adventure and see if they can again successfully fight to save their friend and home.Cover Design: Julie Elizabeth PowellOriginal photo by Dr. Joseph Valks",
