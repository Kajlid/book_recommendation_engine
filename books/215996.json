  "description": "This work has been selected by scholars as being culturally important, and is part of the knowledge base of civilization as we know it. This work was reproduced from the original artifact and remains as true to the original work as possible.Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1800s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. This book is a reproduction of an important historical work.-An Excerpt: 'When you look up to the sky of a clear night, the vault of heaven appears sparkling with thousands of stars. In some places they seem crowded together like the houses in Boston; in others, they are more scattered, like the huts of the settlers in the wide wilderness of the west.'",
