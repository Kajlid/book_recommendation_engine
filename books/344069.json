He's the kind of guy who believes that weddings are simple affairs in which two people get married.

And any man with a daughter can appreciate Mr. Banks's feelings.Kay: Now, Pops, please. If we're going --Mr. Banks: -- and what's his last name? I hope it's better than his first one.Kay: Pops, I'm not going to sit here --Mr. Banks: -- and where the hell does he come from -- and who does he think is going to support him? If it's me he's got another guess coming. And who in God's name --To say the least, Mr. Banks isn't taking it well, and to make matters worse, he must host cocktail parties with the in-laws-to-be, initiate financial planning talks with Buckley, and moderate family conferences on who will be invited to the reception.Who can blame him when he sinks so low as to offer Kay $1500 to elope?But Mr. Banks holds his peace, and when the last wedding guest has departed from his confetti-matted house, he has his memories, and you have a merry record of his tribulations.",
