  "description": "For His Pleasure is a New York Times and USA Today bestselling series, and with each new book, the romance only gets hotter. And now, the story continues with book 18...  Twenty-two year old Kennedy Saunders is running away from her old life at MIT, and running towards a new life in New York City. A new life working for Red Jameson--and hopefully much more than that.  Because Kennedy isn't just some random girl trying to break into the advertising business. She's someone who has a connection to Red and Nicole, and she's determined to get closer to them, at any cost.  But Kennedy is shocked when, instead of working for Red Jameson, she finds herself at the beck and call of Red's new Chief Operating Officer, Easton Rather.  And Easton is not impressed with Kennedy's high IQ, her ivy league background, or anything else. But he does want something from her. Something that might just cost Kennedy everything, and force her to reveal secrets that will throw everyone's lives into chaos.  Under His Control (For His Pleasure, Book 18) is a tale of lust, submission, power and ultimately--a love story for the ages.",
