  "description": "In the spring of 1892, Cristy Anne Hayse would meet the person she was destined to spend the rest of her life loving. There was only one problem: The love of her life was a girl. The time was wrong, the place was wrong, but their love was true. From the moment Cristy Anne Hayes and Lisette Hayle locked eyes, both knew their lives would forever be connected. No one would have thought such a love could have begun in the small southern town of Green Springs. But it did, and it was beautiful. This is the two lovers' unsung love story, and the mark of a romance which would last a life time. --The Unsung Love Story is the first book in a series called The River. The next book in the series to be release will be called: Journey Home.(Preview the book more info.) [Warning: This second edition has yet to be edited. There is some strong language, one graphic sex scene, and same-sex love. Do not buy this book if the reader is offended by any of the previously stated issues. The reader has been warned.]",
