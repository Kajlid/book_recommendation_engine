  "description": "On the run.Nowhere to hide.Nothing they won't do to eliminate him.Jimmy's strange talents are going to be tested to their limits.How do you survive when your enemy's greatest weapon is a boy just like you?From The Times (London):\"Both Jimmy Coates: Killer and Jimmy Coates: Target are cracking adventures with enough ideas to make them more than just page-turners. Jimmy’s love for his family and best friend battle his instructions to kill the “democratic terrorist” Viggo. He is a wonderful creation with which it is easy to identify and sympathise. As in all super-hero tales, you half fear, half long for the extraordinary powers that guide our protagonist along labyrinthine corridors or show him how to duel with a kebab stick, even if using them draws him further away from normality into a manic or psychopathic state that is brilliantly described.\"Boys (and indeed girls) absolutely adore this kind of thing, and making Jimmy himself the gadget instead of, like Alex Rider, partly dependent on them, adds to the fun, especially once Jimmy’s intended nemesis, Mitchell, is activated...\"Joe Craig has developed the sharp satirical edge that keeps the new generation of boys hooked on books. Which is, in itself, the act of a superhero.\"",
