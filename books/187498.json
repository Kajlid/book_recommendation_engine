  "description": "I lost my virginity when I was twenty-five years old to a hooker my sister hired because she felt bad for me. That was six years ago and it's probably the least shocking fact about my life. That was, until I met Darcy Monroe, and \"shocking\" took on a whole new meaning... ---- Six years after escaping his cloistered, abusive, fundamentally religious upbringing, ISAIAH finds himself still dealing with the demons of his past, detached from society as a whole, and wholly unable to connect with, or trust, women. He engages in constant, meaningless sport sex with women, trying to numb the feeling of inadequacy inside. Then he sets his sights on his new neighbor... DARCY is strong, capable, outspoken, and in no way going to put up with some random jackass next door who decides to make a game of trying to get her into bed. But Isaiah is relentless. And Darcy finds herself torn between not letting him win, and giving into her own desire. Just as they start to get close, they realize that something more sinister is afoot and they will both be forced to confront feelings of betrayal that will set their lives in an unexpected direction ** This book is NOT \"Safety Gang\" safe. Triggers for childhood abuse, OW, stalking, attempted rape (not by H). Isaiah is a deeply flawed character and can be hard to love as he tries to overcome his abusive upbringing. He has many missteps along the way. This is not a book for everyone. ** - Reformatted/revised edition 4/16",
