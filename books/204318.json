Her first real journey began when she boarded an airplane to London, England, where her single goal of shopping changed the moment she landed. A new friendship with her airplane row neighbor brought Susie a wild first night in town, where she reluctantly accepted a drink from a dashing young British Royal, Prince Harold Albert Winstrom.  The second confession of E.C. Towers' Starfucker: Erotic Shorts Series tells the tale of a midwestern American girl who finds herself at the center of a foreign national scandal.",
