  "description": "Rich Mullins was one of the most gifted musical visionaries of the twentieth century. He was thought by some to be a modern-day prophet. Others claim he was a saint. He was a radical believer, an original spirit devoted to a mighty God.This true story is seen through the eyes of close companion and confidante Pam Richards. She presents Richard's more human side in an intense and sometimes broken friendship which called on him to demonstrate the love of God. She learned that God's love is lived out in our relationships. \"The truth of our experience gives rise to our song. When it touches a heart, that song plants a seed to grow and bloom.\" Years after Rich Mullins' untimely death in a car accident, the author learned firsthand that art creates lasting memorials to moments, and that love is stronger than death. Through laughter and tears, despite differences and obstacles, their friendship led Rich Mullins and Pam Richards both closer to God.",
