  "description": "LOVE IS RELATIVE (Defining Love, Book One) When the one thing they want is the only thing they can't have, how far will Danny and Emily go to convince themselves that love is all that matters, even if itâ€™s forbidden? When Emily Winters returns home she thinks she knows what she's getting into. She's had three years to accept the fact that her former best friend/ love of her life/ boyfriend of exactly one day, Danny Donovan, is no longer any of those things to her. In fact there is a good chance he hates her. There is an even better chance that he is her half-brother. She thinks she knows what she is coming home to, but what she finds is the utter devastation that Danny's life has become thanks to the chain of events that Emily's mother set in motion three years ago. Danny has lost everything and Emily doesn't recognize the cold-hearted bad boy that Danny has become. She can only resist his temptation for so long before the line that separates right from wrong becomes blurry and negotiable as she and Danny try to navigate around it. When life in the small town of River Bluff becomes too much to handle, Danny and Emily are finally forced to deal, not only with their present, but also their past. When the truth of their sibling status is revealed will it tear them apart or allow them to finally be together in the only way they know how? Contains adult content. Suited for ages 17 and up.",
