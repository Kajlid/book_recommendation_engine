  "description": "Fifteen years ago, Collin O’Dwyer saved me from the bloody streets of Dublin. He just wouldn’t feck off and had to force his way into my life. I should’ve known he wouldn’t want me the way I wanted him; he was no different than the others who'd let me down. Now he’s back and the more I fight the fatal attraction, the stronger my desire for him becomes. If I’m not careful, he will be my undoing . . .",
