  "description": "It’s a hectic time to be a Greensmith. Rowen’s aunt Nadine is getting married! And it’s not just Nadine. Her cousin Rose is getting married too— on the very same day, no less. Great, right? Well… sort of. Now that things are set in stone, everyone is beginning to have their doubts.  To complicate matters further, Rowen can feel another murder on the horizon. She can sense it. Trouble is coming, and it’s coming soon. She doesn’t have to wait long. When an old woman is found dead in her own home, it’s easy to just assume it’s the death Rowen predicted. Rowen, though? She has her doubts.  Trouble is still on the way. Rowen needs to remain vigilant. It’s not just a murder she needs to be on the lookout for either. With two Greensmith weddings coming up, the drama just won’t end.  Thirteenth Volume of the Lainswich Witches Mystery Series. Approx. 50,000 words in length. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
