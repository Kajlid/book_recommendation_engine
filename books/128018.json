  "description": "Chicago native B.J. Warren travels to the Florida island of Ana Lia to care for her grandmother's house after her grandmother has an accident and breaks her hip. Nothing and no one on the island is anywhere near what BJ would call normal. The island inhabitants exist in a world that cares little for what folks do on the mainland. The center of activity for their society revolves around a diner called Rebecca's Cove where the self-centered B.J. alienates just about every member of the small community. But, she meets her match in a local woman, Hobie Lynn Allen. This is not a love at first sight story as both women find the other completely annoying and self-righteous. However, the island—and Rebecca's Cove—have an odd way of changing the way folks view their world and the people around them. Sometimes it's not a matter of what you're seeing, but rather, the position from which you see it.",
