I have never seen things stated so courageously and forthrightly ...I think you have a breakthrough ... This is a very, very important book.” Walter C. Kaiser, Jr. “It contains material rarely dealt with in any depth in theological literature ... seeks to grapple with the biblical evidence rather than seeking to defend the readily accepted conclusions ... fine research ... It deserves a large reading.” Marvin R. Wilson “I believe what you have presented is a key to understanding the Scriptures and God’s purposes in creation and redemption of fallen and disaffected humanity.” Joseph R.
