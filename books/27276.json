Now America has an epic poet of their own, Dax Tucker, who has made available this classic form of literature in a way that both inspires and enriches us while speaking to us in the language of our time.

To aid you in meeting this challenge you are transported to a late 16th century European village where you will meet Corliss Leafcatcher, the humble village gardener, and his son, Maddox, who aspires to be more than just a gardener like his father. It isn’t until he watches his father endure the mayhem wreaked upon him by the insanely jealous Prince Gavin that he learns to treasure the wisdom his father earns with blood, sweat and tears. For though Corliss is but a commoner, he is also married to one of the most beautiful women in the kingdom, Claire, and Gavin devises every insidious means to try and break them apart. However, eventually Gavin’s desire for Claire is replaced by an even stronger desire to break this man who has attained something he never could—happiness in the face of all odds.",
