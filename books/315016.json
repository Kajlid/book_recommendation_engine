  "description": "It began as a harmless prank.\n Then the next thing I know, I’m in the hospital parking lot with a looming deadline and a flat tire when Liam Dailey sidles up on a Harley, all brooding intensity and shaggy blond hair. He’s determined to be my savior. But I make a terrible damsel in distress. The verbal sparring is delicious foreplay and in a weak moment, I give him my number. It’s a mistake. See, my life is planned down to the very last detail. While it hasn’t always been a fairy tale existence, I’ve never wanted for anything. Now it’s my turn to give back, and I won’t rest until my debts are paid—all of them. And no one, not even Dr. Dailey, with his irresistible dimple and guarded past, will derail everything I’ve worked for. I won’t risk it. I can’t.\nIf I could change the past, I would. For me, and for her. Especially for her.\nThey call me Dr. Dirty, and I let them. My colleagues mean it as a joke, but they have no idea how stained my soul really is. The promises I’ve broken. The people I’ve failed. The shame that clouds everything. The only time I feel like a decent human being is when I’m at the hospital surrounded by patients—people I might actually be able to save. God knows I’m past salvation myself. Despite my sins, and there are plenty, I’m chasing redemption. A second chance. I might not deserve it, but I want it. What I’m not looking for is a warrior princess with a forgiving heart—until I meet Juliana. When she peers into my soul, she sees light where I see darkness.Now redemption isn’t enough. I want her too.But the road between us is littered with landmines and secrets—most of them mine. And I’m not sure I can put the past aside to be the man she deserves.",
