  "description": "“What I find in my territory is mine to keep. Even if it’s a man.”\nJag. Uninhibited. Possessive. Walks on the wild side.Dane. Gentle giant. Monster lover. Plays it safe.Dane always knew his illicit fantasies of rough sex and dangerous men would one day lead him down a path of no return, but no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t stay away.After being beaten half to death by his ex, he wakes up in a collar, chained to a wall by a wild man who claims Dane as his property.From the moment Jag lays his eyes on Dane, he knows he wants to keep him. Big, strong, with colorful ink all over, he is the most unique man Jag had ever seen. But Dane has to be tamed if he is to become Jag’s mate for life.All Jag needs to do is assure Dane that he will be protected and provided for, because the sparks are already flying. But Dane keeps nagging about irrelevant things like his family, responsibilities, and the Internet. No wonder Jag needs to keep him chained for longer than he expected.The only way out for Dane is to play the role of Jag’s obedient, loving ‘mate’, and bide his time until he can escape. But while Jag is absolutely batshit, and his junkyard den lifestyle is insanity, he also showers Dane with treats, worships the ground he walks on, and f*cks him like a monster, the way Dane always dreamed of in his most secret fantasies.POSSIBLE SPOILERS:Themes: primal play, modern day Tarzan, abduction, masculinity, fish out of water, opposites attract, deception, plus size heroGenre: Scorching hot M/M dark romanceLength: ~85,000 words (Standalone)WARNING: This story contains scenes of violence, abduction, offensive language and morally ambiguous characters.",
