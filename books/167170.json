  "description": "There is perhaps no other children's novel better known than Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which has been reinterpreted broadly, from Disney's beloved film to Robert Sabuda's clever pop-up to Frank Beddor's new fantasy novel. Lewis Carroll's whimsical, fantastical tale grabs every reader's imagination, and it is an artist's dream, bursting with visual possibility. Alison Jay has long wanted to bring her own perspective to the story. Now she shows us an exhilarating Wonderland, where Alice, the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, and all the rest are playfully quirky and adorably fanciful. With the complete, unabridged text and glowing full-color illustrations on nearly every page, this lavish edition is the perfect introduction to the novelâ€”and an elegant gift for those who are already Lewis Carroll fans.",
