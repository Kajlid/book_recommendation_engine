  "description": "When you're out and proud on the capital's fetish scene, life throws up familiar challenges with unfamiliar twists. Can graduate student Tina find a decent male dom with an ego smaller than Jupiter? Will lifestyle sub Chris ‘chebs’ Hamilton have to explain BDSM to the relatives at his wedding? Chris’ wife, Laura is hearing her biological clock tick, but is it wise to start a family when the world thinks you're a scandalous pervert? And how is Master Viper (aka Tom), a carpenter, supposed to stay solvent when half the scene expects him to make them custom kit on mates’ rates?",
