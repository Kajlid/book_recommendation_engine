Tortured and defiled, they make me wish I were back in that cabin where death was favorable to drawing another breath, but this time our captors can’t break what’s already broken.What scares me is the madness I see festering inside the only man I’ve ever loved. I’ve taken his freedom, his career, and his reputation. Yet despite all I’ve done, he’s determined to fight for me, kill for me, give everything he is for me…He’ll even die for me.NOTE TO READERS: Fervent is a dark romance with kidnapping and other disturbing themes. Intended for mature readers. Not for the faint of heart. You’ve been warned. Part 3 in the Condemned series.",
