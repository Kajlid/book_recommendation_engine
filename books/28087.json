  "description": "Pearls Before Swine was voted the Best Comic Strip of 2003 by the National Cartoonists Society, and in Nighthogs , the strip's third collection, Stephan Pastis proves that his strip is one of the sharpest, funniest comics in newspapers.You never know who you'll bump into at a diner at night.It could be a rat with an anger-management problem. Or an overly sentimental pig. Or a zebra with a story or two to tell about a crocodile. Or even a goat who just wants to be left alone.Welcome to Nighthogs , where the door is always open, the light is always on, and the coffee is as scorching as the humor.In this third collection of the immensely popular Pearls Before Swine , Stephan Pastis again takes us into the world of Rat, Pig, Zebra, and Goat, and he shows once more just how outrageous-and how hilarious-the unpredictable can be. Always surprising (and only occasionally depraved), Pearls Before Swine is one of the sharpest comic strips in newspapers today.So pull up a stool, have a cup of joe, and enjoy.",
