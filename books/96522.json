  "description": "For centuries the Tower of Regrets stood alone, and no man or woman dared turn their face to it, for fear of the curse that lay within. And so it might have remained—but for the recklessness of a king's foolish daughter...The Tower of Regrets is no more...and the wanderer Indigo has known but little peace. Her dreams are troubled ones, and her quest is far from done. A short time to heal the ragged tatters of her soul is all she asks.And for awhile her prayers are answered. But Indigo's refuge is no more—for a malignant blight now covers the land, bleaching all life from within...threatening even those she has come to love.And another of the demons that Indigo unleashed upon the world is at hand.",
