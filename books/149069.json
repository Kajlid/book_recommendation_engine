  "description": "In the game for love, only the winners walk away with their hearts intact… Trent O’Shea is a superstar athlete on the football field, but for one week each year he escapes into anonymity at an exclusive resort in the Florida Keys that caters to the rich and famous. Armed with a fake identity, he’s happy to sit by the pool and do nothing except enjoy some breathtaking scenery—and maybe ask her if she needs help putting sunscreen on her back. Laurel Burnett never met a bad boy she couldn’t catch. Cheating spouses. Deadbeat dads. Scammers. Once the determined P.I. sets her sights on them they all fall, and the next alleged perpetrator in her crosshairs is none other than the famous football player Trent O’Shea. The super-sexy linebacker who Laurel’s client hired her to track will be her biggest trophy yet. She’ll do anything to bring him down, even follow him to a resort paradise and use herself as bait. But things aren’t always as they appear and Trent and Laurel both learn that sometimes even perfectly planned plays can go wrong when love and lust are involved. Then it’s game on! A contemporary “mistaken identity” romance trope featuring a rich, alpha hero athlete who also happens to be a Texas cowboy, and the private investigator heroine determined to catch him.",
