  "description": "THEˆSYSTEMˆOF DOCTORˆGOUDRONˆANDˆPROFESSORˆPLUME, staged at the legendary Grand Guignol Theatre in Paris in 1903, was the first sensational horror play by Andre de Lorde, the prolific author who went to produce dozens more works in the vein of \"medical horror\" - claustrophobic, gore-splattered scenarios played out in hospitals, bizarre experiment labs, and madhouses. Here, a lunatic asylum is taken over by its inmates, resulting in scenes of terror, suspense and human butchery. This new translation of de Lorde's classic is augmented by an extensive introduction on the author's work in theatre, fiction and cinema, and also includes the bonus text of Edgar Allan Poe's original story \"The System Of Dr. Tarr And Professor Fether\" of 1845.",
