  "description": "This new translation presents two works, one by Epictetus and the other by Cebes, two ancient Greek philosophers of the Imperial period, in new translations of clear, straightforward English. In this book, readers will learn how to sustain emotional harmony and a ‘good flow of life’ whatever fortune may hold in store for them. This modern English translation of the complete Handbook is supported by and * the first thorough commentary since that of Simplicius, 1500 years ago* a detailed introduction* extensive glossary* index of key terms* chapter-by-chapter discussion of themes* helpful tables that clarify Stoic ethical doctrines as a glance. Accompanying the Handbook is the Tablet of Cebes , a curious and engaging text. In complete contrast, yet complementing the Handbook’s more conventional philosophical presentation, the Tablet shows progress to philosophical wisdom as a journey through a landscape inhabited by personifications of happiness, fortune, the virtues and vices.",
