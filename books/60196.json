When tax accountant Dean Fowler moves into a new home after wasting six years in an unfulfilling relationship, he finds the man of his dreams on his doorstep—literally. His new neighbour, gorgeous tattoo artist Caelan Stokes, has just become available after putting up with an unfaithful lover for too long. Opposites attract and an intimate evening of comparing notes on what it's like to find your hopes and expectations shattered leads them to share an even more intimate night of sexual pleasures. Caelan's wounds might run deeper than it seems at first, though, and Dean resorts to unusual measures to create something that lasts, but are the sparks—and the ink—that fly between them enough to build a new love on the ruins of their pasts? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
