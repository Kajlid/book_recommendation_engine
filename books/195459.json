  "description": "The visceral curtain of chaos has been lifted from Earth upon the defeat of Demon Lord Maâ€™al. Dorian Benoit and his allies may have thwarted the Infernal uprising for now, but no one survives an encounter with Hell unscathed. The war has already begun to take its toll on some, while others have had their eyes opened by the trials set before them. Maddening desperation can take hold of even the most resolute mind in times of unrest when ideals are challenged and friendships tested. New allegiances will form where others fall, and old enemies may find themselves fighting on the same side for better or for worse.",
