Subsisting among the ruins of a world torn apart by a devastating vampire virus, Devon wants to forget the man he once was and focus on protecting his wife and child from the wretched vampires that stalk them. The struggle for survival is relentless, but together they have hope. That is until a vampire that defies all the rules comes hunting.
