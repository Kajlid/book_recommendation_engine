  "description": "At the outbreak of World War One, millions of men left to fight in the trenches on the Western Front. Many of them were volunteers, miners, shopkeepers etc, caught up in that great rush of patriotism that swept the land in those early days of war and whose first experience of battle would be their last. This book tells the story of just a handful of ordinary men from Torfaen in South Wales and the experiences they encountered.",
