  "description": "Varus, Varus, give me back rny legions ! Give back my golden eagles !Augustus's cry of loss and anger echoed round the Empire when news of the most terrible disaster in their military history reached Rome. Three legions, wiped out to a man in the forests of Germania; three eagles, the sacred golden standards of the legions, in the impious hands of savage German tribes. Overnight the name of Varus became synonymous with the disgrace of Rome.Severus Varus, branded with his kinsman's shame, his military career blighted, swore to recover the eagles and restore the honour of his family and of Rome. His quest took him far from the Imperial but corrupt magnificence of Augustan Romeâ€”to the dark shadows of German swamps and forests, to long weeks of patrolling and skirmishing on the snow-bound border, to the horrors of mutiny, and ambushes and pitched battles with a tireless enemy, and finally to the discovery of the last of Varus's eagles.",
