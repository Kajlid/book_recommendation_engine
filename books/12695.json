  "title": "The Arrival of Fergal Flynn",
  "description": "For 16 year-old Fergal Flynn, growing up in 1980s Belfast isn’t easy. His father and brothers despise him; he’s his mother’s favorite one day, her punching bag the next; he has no idea what he wants to do with his life; and he fancies one of the boys in his class. Fergal just wants to belong—but knows he never will. When handsome young Father Mac arrives in the parish, Fergal embarks on a whirlwind journey towards a new life. As their relationship deepens, he discovers his sexuality, his talent for singing, and the wonderful, terrifying opportunities the world has to offer. Funny, tender, and unflinching, this is the story of a young man struggling to find his voice against all the odds.",
