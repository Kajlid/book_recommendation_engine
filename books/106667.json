The author does well to avoid most wellness cliches and known suggestions, adding a freshness to his descriptions that make the tips more useful. I especially liked how he created a sense of place for some tips, such as mentioning sitting outside on a patio to sip tea. Adding a visual and a sense of place creates more of a narrative flow than if he just listed wellness tips.A few of these tips could be fleshed out more, such as the one about expressing a sense of personal value that is quite important but only gets a sentence or two here. We’d like to know how he prefers to do this, and how we can emulate his proven strategies.The quotes are excellent and in many instances, unique. Readers of inspirational and self-help books are familiar with the best-known quotes of spiritual leaders and great thinkers, so it’s a delight when we find in this book some little-known ones well-chosen to illustrate the lessons.Pace is excellent, and most tips are well thought-out and patiently unspooled. Well done. The reader can take away and remember many insights from this book, making it truly inspirational.------",
