  "description": "The new court session begins, with Para and Cerlot Bilgern all but blacklisted. Many whisper about the change in name, not daring to voice their questions to the ranks at court. For Aren is much changed, and the ranks are changing along with her. The high lords are coming to court to witness Aren's mating ceremony. The barons returnâ€”to see if the baron of the North will keep his word. One, however, is missing. He sends no word, no well wishes. His absence is noted. There's a mating ceremony being planned and everyone's talking about the woman. They talk about how she changed over the winter, how she simply feels different to everyone's senses. No one stops to think about Av. To their eyes, the man is all but invisible as he wanders the halls of the palace with nothing to keep him busy but the spirits who haunt him. They probably should have asked what would happen, once Av and Aren mate.",
