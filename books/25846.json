  "description": "Follow the law and you’ll stay safe. But what if the law betrays you?It all started with the girl from the river: mutilated, tattooed, murdered. Tashué couldn’t help but look for answers and in the process, he uncovered the ugly truths being hidden by the very law he used to believe in—the law of the Authority. Now he’s fighting for his life. Mere survival isn’t enough; he desperately wants to save his son from the Authority, and he wants revolution. At any cost. Davik Kaine has been gathering power under everyone’s noses. Ruthless, ambitious, with a rebel army backing him, he wants revolution, too. He’s probably the only person powerful enough to protect Tashué from the looming implosion of the political field. And he’s the only person with the connections to save Jason. He may also be responsible for the death of the girl from the river. Is making peace with Davik worth it, if it saves Tashué’s son from the Authority? If Tashué plays along with what Davik wants, can Tashué get retribution for the girl from the river?",
