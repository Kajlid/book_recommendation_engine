Donovan, Senior Reviewer, Midwest Book Review\"Some books are so easy to read, to fall into the words, that you lose track of time and sense of place. I fell easily into the world Shanessa Gluhm painted. Between snappy, witty banter, and intriguing mystery, I devoured Enemies of Doves in a single sitting.\" -Jennifer Silverwood, Author of The Borderlands Saga",
