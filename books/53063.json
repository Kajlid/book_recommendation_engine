  "title": "The Yellow Arrow",
  "description": "The main character, Andrei, is a passenger aboard the Yellow Arrow, who begins to despair over the train's ultimate destination and looks for a way out as the chapters count down. Indifferent to their fate, the other passengers carry on as usual â€” trading in nickel melted down from the carriage doors, attending the Upper Bunk avant-garde theatre, and leafing through Pasternak's Early Trains. Pelevin's art lies in the ease with which he shifts from precisely imagined science fiction to lyrical meditations on past and future. And, because he is a natural storyteller with a wonderfully absurd imagination. The Yellow Arrow is full of the ridiculous and the sublime. It is a reflective story, chilling and gripping.",
