  "description": "A Skilled Socialite\nGloriana Blakely has finally gone too far. To the distress of her parents, this exquisitely beautiful debutante refuses to settle for anything less than the life - and the husband - she deserves. As punishment for her latest defiance, she is banished to her cousin's estate in Yorkshire for the autumn, where Society is barren and her childhood nemesis is close at hand. \n\n\n\nA Seductive Scoundrel\nRakish and handsome, Lord Alex Somers has finally completed his studies at Oxford, prolonged by a healthy amount of philandering and mischief. Unfortunately, he is now faced with the dire task of having to actually do something with his life. He returns to his family estate to ponder his future, only to discover a beautiful guest has arrived, and taken it upon herself to throw a lavish country party in his honor! \n\nSecrets, Spies, and Seductions\nAlex and Gloriana can't seem to avoid butting heads, with the tension between them increasing by the day. As the festivities begin, the two find themselves unwittingly pulled into a dangerous dance among the distinguished and powerful guests within the walls of Somerton. A deadly game of cat and mouse is overshadowed only by the building desire between the unlikely pair, as the scandalous secret weaves a web of seduction around them both.\n\n\nThe Scoundrel and the Socialite is the second installment in The Somerton Scandals series, but can be enjoyed as a stand-alone story.",
