  "title": "How I Became a Cornetist: The Autobiography of a Cornet-Playing Pilgrim's Progress",
  "description": "\"How I became a cornetist - The autobiography of a cornet-playing pilgrim's progress\" gives the reader a clear and wonderfully candid insight into Herbert L. Clarke's thoughts and experiences during his progression from childhood, to the beginnings of his career as an internationally renowned cornet soloist. In a remarkably humble and sincere manner, Clarke leads us through his first experiences with an ophicleide which had \"clappers as large as a teacup\", his premature enlisting into the Queen's Own Regimental Band, a \"frightful discord\" when playing off-stage trumpet parts with an orchestra, work as a professional violist, illness, his cornet-playing heroes, swollen lips, his failures, and ultimately, a small taste of his many successes. This long-awaited reprint of Clarke's autobiographical sketches aims to present the author's words in a clear and easily accessible pocketbook format. A bare minimum of editing has been carried out in this edition, with only the most necessary and utmost minor changes made to punctuation, grammar and spelling, so that Clarke's words may be read fluently yet preserved as purely as possible. \"How I became a cornetist - The autobiography of a cornet-playing pilgrim's progress\" is a must read for any brass player, and provides a remarkably clear window into the past, through which we are warmly invited to look.",
