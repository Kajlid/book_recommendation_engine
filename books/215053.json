  "description": "Soldier, High Schooler, Martial Arts Instructor, Convict, Bank Teller, Mechanic. What do these six people have in common? When you step into their shoes, they're going to survive the zombie apocalypse. Pick from six characters and play 100 possible endings in this choose your own path style adventure.Here's how it works: You, Dear Reader, play as the main characters of this story. Last time you checked, you had less than half a full magazine for your M4, and the armory might be a good spot for a refill. Then again, a bird in the hand gets the worm, and a helicopter ride to front lines would be significantly faster than a Humvee ride through clogged streets.I think I'll stick with Air Power and take that last seat on the helicopter. Go to page 247Strength in both people and bullets. Humvee it up! Go to page 64Zombocalypse, you say? That's right. Science has finally cracked the code on eternal life with the wonderdrug Gligazyme, but that advance came with a terrible price--the immortal living dead are coming to feed on human flesh. And that's not all you'll have to contend with...As civilization's fire goes out, the darkness creeps back in.The story takes place simultaneously with the bestselling Click Your Poison book, INFECTED, making it neither a prequel nor a sequel (let's call it an \"equel\"). As an updated and upgraded spinoff, PATHOGENS is the ultimate Zombie Apocalypse gamebook!Who will survive the zombie apocalypse? YOU decide in PATHOGENS!",
