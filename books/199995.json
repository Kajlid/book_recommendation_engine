  "description": "Angus Boone is the devil.  He lured me in, but not with candy or treats. And like the devil, he saw what no one else did. All of my sins...all of the stains on my soul.  And then he smiled.  I should have run...far far away.  Instead I made a deal that changed us both forever.  I made a deal with the devil.  ***This is part one of a three-part serial***   This is non-traditional romance with adult content, sexual situations, and a non-traditional Happy Ending. Don't worry. . . Nobody dies.",
