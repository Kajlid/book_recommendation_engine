  "title": "The Invisible Empire: Ku Klux Klan",
  "description": "Established in 1866, the Ku Klux Klan still remains one of America’s most secretive organizations. New York photojournalist Anthony Karen first transcended that secrecy several years ago when he got the opportunity to photograph a KKK cross-lighting ceremony. Since then, Karen has been documenting Klan organizations throughout the country. In The Invisible Ku Klux Klan , those photographs are compiled to form an absorbing document of one of the most notorious groups in history.Taken with unrestricted access, Karen’s images bring us deep inside America’s most private white nationalist organizations. Beginning with a brief introduction into the history of the Klan, the book provides detailed visual accounts of modern-day Klan life, including candid shots of rallies, individual portraits of Klansmen and women, as well as a look at the naturalization process for new members. Presented in intimate profiles a functioning Klan ministry, a group that has merged National Socialism with Klan ideologies, and a 58-year-old seamstress who makes custom Klan robes, among others. Accompanied by quotations from the late Dale Fox, Imperial Wizard of The Brotherhood of the Klans, The Invisible Ku Klux Klan offers an unprecedented glimpse into the shadowy society and its mysterious inner workings.",
