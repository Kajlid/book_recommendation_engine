  "title": "Tom & Christopher And Their Kind",
  "description": "From gilded youth to thirty-something. Young gay couple Tom and Christopher are steering through the minefield of changes in social and sexual mores of the 1960s and ’70s. Experimentation is the keynote of the age and Tom and Christopher dive in with a will as they move in and out of relationships and jobs in Britain and France, Channel-hopping and bed-hopping through the years. The precocious Angelo, still only thirteen at the start of the book, seems destined to create havoc with their lives at every turn, while – with echoes of Dorian Grey – they are perpetually haunted by the disappeared portrait of their young selves as David and Jonathan. This is the second novel in The Dog In The Chapel series. The third will appear in August 2016.",
