  "title": "The Mughal Emperors: And the Islamic Dynasties of India, Iran, and Central Asia",
  "description": "A detailed history of the long line of Mughal rulers from 1206 to1925, illustrated with exquisite paintings, manuscripts, and architecture.In the West \"mogul\" refers to a person of great power and influence. The word derives from the Persian \"Mughal\" or Mongol, the people who, initially under Genghis Khan, had an enormous impact as they set out to conquer the world.This book describes the rulers from the thirteenth to the twentieth centuries whose reigns and lands were affected by Mongol/Mughal power and who all shared the Muslim high civilization that flourished from Iran and Central Asia through Afghanistan to north and central India. Among the prominent leaders were Timur, or Tamerlane, who lived a life of remorseless conquest; Shah Abbas the Great, who brought the achievement of early modern Iran to its peak at Isfahan; Akbar the Great, who fostered an idea of inclusive government for India; and Shah Jahan, who gave India its finest monument, the Taj Mahal.In lively biographical portraits, illuminated by vivid quotations from contemporary chroniclers, these great men come back to life. We see them as administrators trying to meet the challenge of building strong central governments, as military leaders engaged in bloody and fratricidal struggles for succession, and as enlightened patrons of the arts and sciences. Women also play a prominent part in events, from court politics and artistic patronage to occasionally ruling. 260 illustrations, 140 in color.",
