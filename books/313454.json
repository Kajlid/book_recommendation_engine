  "description": "When I was little, I was obsessed with fairytales. My dad told me the stories of the stars and white knights who rescue princesses. I’d wear a silver plastic crown and stare at the sky, waiting for the day my knight in shining armor would come.Then my dad died, my crown broke, and my mom shipped my sister and me off to boarding school.And then I met them.My knights.Only they’re nothing like the fairytales I grew up on. They’re wrapped in sin and shrouded in darkness. Bossy, protective, alphaholes.And heirs to the Italian mafia.",
