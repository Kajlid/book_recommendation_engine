Now he spends more time balancing books than kicking butts, and that doesn’t make for a happy vampire.When a missing person case lands in the lap of Black Knight Investigations, Jimmy and his partner, Greg Knightwood, jump happily back into action—until their missing person rises as an uncontrollable vampire and all signs point to a supernatural coup orchestrated by an unknown vampire of immense power. With the case going sideways, more missing girls, and a new cop in town way too curious about Jimmy’s perennial youth, life in Charlotte is about to get interesting again.",
