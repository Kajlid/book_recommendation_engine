  "description": "Tobias Walcott, the Earl of Blade, has learned it is best to exercise rigid control over his passions and emotions in all that he does. Uncaring that it makes him seem cold and aloof to most in the ton, he is content with wooing only agreeable and demur women in his search for a wife. Until he finds himself trapped in a closet at a house party with the last women he would ever make his countess. Lady Olivia Sherwood is unconventional, overly decisive, and utterly without decorum—everything Tobias should not desire in a wife. But she cannot deny her attraction to the cold, handsome earl. Passion between them ignites, leading them to being discovered, and honor demands they wed. Tobias is unprepared for the strength of his desire for the bewitching beauty. He must do everything he can to avoid tempting the passion that burns for her…lest it lead to disaster. Each book in the Wedded by Scandal series is a standalone story that can be enjoyed out of order.
