  "description": "Desil has spent his life training, but a promise to his mother has kept him from using his abilities for anything worthwhile. Now all he does is help his mother manage her tavern as his father rests in a grave. Desil knows there’s at least one other mage somewhere in this territory who can do what he can; they share a connection through their magic, although they’ve never met. He stays up nights wondering what they might be able to accomplish together.When an opportunity to not only meet this mage but change the course of his future finally presents itself, Desil jumps at the chance. A great leader has disappeared, leaving clues that only Desil and this other mage can see. War is coming, and following the clues could mark Desil as a traitor, but he trained his whole life for something. If this isn’t it, then what is? He might unearth a new power capable of ending war, or he might die trying. Either is better than doing nothing.",
