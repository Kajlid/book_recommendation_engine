  "title": "On the Path: Refections of a younger self",
  "description": "\"On the Path: Reflections of a younger self\" is a compilation of more than two dozen poems written during Mr. Hunter's younger years accompanied by narrative reflections on the inspiration for much of the poetry as he navigated early life through loss, love, abuse, and work as a bisexual and gay identified person. The heartfelt poems Kim has written are infused with the experiences of the poet's diverse background which includes counseling and social work, hospice care, homelessness, human rights advocacy, politics, HIV education, teaching in the United States and Southeast Asia, and work with people facing life challenging illnesses including cancer and hemophilia. Mr. Hunter has a passion for expressing his voice through the writing of childrenâ€™s books and poetry. Kim is currently hunkered down in Cambodia during the CoViD-19 Pandemic after serving most of the past eight years as an English Teacher and Tutor with children and young adults from poor families living in the rural and mountainous areas of Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos.",
