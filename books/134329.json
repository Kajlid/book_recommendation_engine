  "title": "I Will Give Them an Everlasting Name: Jacksonvilleâ€™s Stories of the Holocaust",
  "description": "A unique approach to Holocaust literature, I Will Give Them an Everlasting Name comprises the compelling stories of nine Jews connected by the Holocaust and Jacksonville, Florida. They experienced the atrocities of the Holocaust in 1930s and 40s Europe, surviving multiple concentration and death camps such as Auschwitz-Birkenau, Dachau, and Bergen-Belsen. One escaped from a Soviet gulag, another hid in a hole in the ground for months, and another was in charge of executing Nazi criminals after WWII in Landsberg prison. The tenth story is about a courageous Gentile who saved many Jewish lives, risking his own.While each has his or her own unique, painful, and compelling story of survival, they all landed in a single city in the United States after the Jacksonville, Florida. These stories, however heart-wrenching they might be, demonstrate the triumph of the human spirit and, ultimately, the joys of lives well lived in their new home in the United States.",
