  "description": "Sadie Scofield is just a few days away from the race of a lifetime. The Texas River Odyssey may be 260 miles and multiple days of arduous canoeing where every turn of the river reveals new dangers-downed trees, alligators, pitch black night-but those dangers pale in comparison to going another year knowing that her father is ashamed of her.Last year, Sadie caused a disastrous wreck that ended her father's twenty year streak of finishes, and he's never looked at her the same. Now, she knows that finishing the race with her brother, Tanner, is her one shot to redeem herself. She's ready for anything...except Tanner ditching her for another team at the last minute.Sadie grits her teeth and accepts that she has to team up with Cully, her former best friend turned worst enemy. It's irritating enough that he grew up to be so attractive, but once they're on the river it turns out he's ill-prepared for such a dangerous race. But as the miles pass, the pain of the race builds, they uncover the truth about their feuding families, and Sadie's feelings for Cully begin to shift. Could this race change her life more than she ever could have imagined?",
