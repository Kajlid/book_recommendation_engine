  "description": "Leticia has had her fair share of hurt and hardships, but it seems things are about to go from bad to worse.  Her ex-lover, originally thought to be behind all this upset and pain, is dead. Two of her friends are missing and presumed dead, and the attacks on her and the new man in her life, Jackson, are becoming more ferocious. Who is doing this to them? When will they discover who the man, known to them only as ‘Boss’ actually is? Will Leticia and Jackson’s love stay strong through it all? It seems there is nowhere else to run, nowhere else to hide. They must fight, even if it means to their death... who will win is anybody’s guess.",
