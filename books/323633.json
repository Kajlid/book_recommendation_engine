  "description": "I was a twenty-two year old single mum with a thriving business, a beautiful daughter and two of the best friends a girl could ask for.He was thirty-three, a tattoo artist covered from head to toe in ink and to top if all off, he was a player with a capital P.I tried to resist, knew it'd end in disaster but he bulldozed his way into my life, into my heart. He was everything.She was always in the background, pulling him from me in one way or another. I told him, he didn't listen and then it all came crumbling down around us.I don't have anything left to give, he says he won't let me go. Where do we go from here?",
