  "description": "Poe Halliday was an accident, a chance meeting that could change my life forever.Growing up, my mother didn’t have secrets—her secrets had her. And after she disappeared, I had nothing. Or so I thought.When the invitation arrived, the opportunity to learn more about my mother’s past was too tempting to ignore. Heading west to meet a long-lost aunt was a risk, but the need for answers outweighed my hesitation. Losing my heart was never part of the plan. Poe broke down my walls, made me vulnerable, and now the dark history of this town threatens to tear me apart. Stella Bradleigh was a distraction, one who didn’t recognize my name.For as long as I can remember, I’ve been groomed for a future I don’t want. And death is the only way out.Or so I’ve been taught.When Stella showed up out of the blue, none of us knew what it meant. Beautiful, with a mysterious past and a snarky attitude, I figured she’d be fast, fun, and disposable. Instead, she consumed me, opened my eyes to the evil that festers here, and now I’m left questioning everything about my family’s legacy.\nOne click now to start this New Adult, romantic suspense series, brimming with shadowy secrets, a sinister plot, unbreakable friendships, and of course, love.\n*Please take note of the TW listed at the beginning of the book.",
