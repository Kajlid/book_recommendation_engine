  "title": "The Regent's Gamble",
  "description": "New York City is famous for New Year’s Eve—but most people don’t celebrate it with a fight to the death… with a wizard who’s already dead! Of course, that is only the beginning for Addison Rhydderch, who wakes up to learn that he’s the newest Regent—protector of the balance between the mundane and the supernatural across the Eastern United states. Easier said than done, even with the guidance of a dragon and the aid of a sultry dryad.  Brave, clever, and politically clueless, Addison seems like the perfect tool of the mysterious Regency Board… but even those Magi could never have foreseen the results of this appointment. With the Faeries threatening war and rumors of a mystical murderer stalking the streets, it is soon up to Addison to try and put out the fires flaring up from centuries old conflicts—Before both worlds are torn apart!  An epic tale for adults with a new twist on old fairy tales. Be advised for scenes of sexual content, daring fights, and graphic violence.",
