  "description": "\"The novella, Porcelain Life Raft, takes a look at the pressures to fit into the adult world. This demand, from a social perspective, often requires the sacrifice of imagination and personal enjoyment due to the need for perceivable success.The story follows the character, Charlie, as he goes through the transformation from an imaginative young man that has trouble balancing the life inside his head with reality, to a rigid adult that has trouble finding joy. The struggle between the two, and the relevance to the struggles that many feel with this same issue, add a satirical edge that make the work both relatable and comic.\"",
