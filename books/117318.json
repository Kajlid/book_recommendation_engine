  "description": "A mysterious power has come into Paul Moreaux's life. In the summer of 1938 he discovers that he can \"fade.\" For thirteen-year-old Paul the possibilities of invisibility are at first bewildering, then thrilling. But in a New England mill town torn by union strife, bigotry, and shocking sexual secrets, he soon sees things it is better not to see and learns things it is better not to know. Paul longs to travel, to escape small-town life, to become a famous writer. But his \"gift\" bears far more terrifying prospects as it propels him toward a future there is not foretelling and a chilling act from which there is no forgiveness, no forgetting...and no turning back.",
