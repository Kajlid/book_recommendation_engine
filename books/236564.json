  "description": "Still recovering from their adventure into the Middle Realm, Jinx, Tori, and the gang have settled down to enjoy some \"normal\" time in Briar Hollow. Then Cezar Ionescu walks in the front door asking for a favor. An abandoned house owned by the local Strigoi clan is attracting the attention of the Haunted Briar Hollow web series.  Cezar knows the old place is haunted, but he doesn't know the identity of the ghost or the reason for the presence. Can Jinx gently ask the spirit to move on before Mindy, Nick, and Kyle find something else inflammatory? Remember the spectral baseball game? No one wants more of that kind of trouble.  Tori seizes on the request to suggest a combination slumber party / camping trip with Lucas and Connor in tow. Festus and Rube are onboard, and Rodney is determined not to be left behind. For her part, Jinx is more than ready to get away from her daily mirror calls from Barnaby complaining about the diplomatic firestorm she touched off when she promised the Dark Druid the Agreement segregating the Middle Realm would be lifted.  But as usual, there's more to the abandoned house than anyone imagines. When the group brings home a \"helpful\" spirit, Jinx finds out more about Fae politics than she wanted to know, and discovers a completely hidden element of her already complicated family history.  Come back to Briar Hollow for To Haunt a Witch, Book 8 in the Jinx Hamilton series!",
