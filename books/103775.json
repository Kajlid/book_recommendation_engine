  "description": "Since childhood, author Fiona Gold Kroll has been drawn to a photograph of her great-uncle, Benjamin Albaum, a Jewish man who disappeared from Paris at the beginning of World War II. A Stone for Benjamin is the compelling story of her quest to discover his fate. Chasing Holocaust shadows across Europe and beyond, she begins her powerful journey searching for clues with nothing more than a misspelled name, old photographs and family stories. Determined to uncover the truth about Benjamin's life and death and France's betrayal of its Jewish population, Fiona pieces together her great-uncle's life, elevating Benjamin's legacy from a number tattooed on his arm at Auschwitz to a more complete memory of the vibrant man he was.",
