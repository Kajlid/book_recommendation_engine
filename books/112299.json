  "description": "Some loves transcend time. Some loves were never meant to be. Some loves are cut short by the evil of others. When Sheriff James Tolbert and his fianc√© were killed by a malicious rancher and his cutthroat minions, nobody could expect that the very passion that fueled their love would be the same passion that fueled ghostly revenge. When grave robbers unearth Sheriff Tolbert's tomb searching for Old West relics, a vengeful spirit is unleashed on a small Texas town hellbent on revenge. If those responsible couldn't be made to pay, then their progeny would, and they would pay in the most bloody and horrific manner the spirit could dream of. Can modern day law enforcement stop a spirit destined to fulfill an oath made in death? Even when aided by a Texas Ranger and UCLA Paranormal Investigators, how can they stop something that is already dead and buried?",
