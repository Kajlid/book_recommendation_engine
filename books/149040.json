  "description": "Most people believe the best way to forget someone is to throw them down a well. Or lock them in a room with eight keys, or bury them at a crossroad in the thirteenth hour. But they're wrong. The best way to forget someone is for them never to have existed in the first place.When sixteen-year-old Tuesday wakes from sleep for the first time, she opens her eyes to a world filled with wonder - and peril. Left only with a letter from the person she once was, Tuesday sets out to discover her past with the help of her charming and self-serving guide, Quintalion.Along the way she runs into mercenaries, flying cities, airships, and a blind librarian. But what is her connection with the mysterious Book of Days - a book that holds untold power...'Just when I thought nothing new could be achieved in fantasy, along comes The Book of Days. K.A. Barker has created an extraordinary world, a series of compelling landscapes and an unforgettable cast of characters. All hail K.A. Barker for giving us something so dazzlingly different! And funny too!' JOHN MARSDEN",
