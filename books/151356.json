  "description": "Things haven't gotten much better for Colonel Chaz Sheperd, but at least now he has some friends to blame his problems on. Chaz has a plan for saving the world, but he needs the help of his companions to carry it off. Can a twelve year old girl, a rookie soldier and a battle weary war hero save the planet? Things are changing faster than anyone realizes, and Chaz's new found companions are not all they appear to be. The question is, who is Chaz willing to sacrifice to give human kind a chance for survival? This time, even the enemy isn't who he thought it was.",
