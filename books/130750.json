  "description": "26 year old Presley Goult's life is anything but ordinary. Her mother abandoned her as a toddler after her father’s death, leaving Presley to be raised by the only family she has left-her uncle Arnold. After years of being away she returns heartbroken and devastated knowing this is the last place she wants to be. Unbeknownst to her, Kadenburg is not your ordinary town. There are secrets that have been kept from Presley for her own good. Will she find out the truth of who she is and the part she will play in the war that is about to erupt before it is too late to save everyone that she loves?  28 year old Lorcan Bamey was Presley's best friend growing up. He has always been there for her when she needed a friend and someone to lean on. Although he has always wanted more from Presley, rules are rules and he was forbidden to express his interest in having a relationship with her. You see, his upbringing was very different from most of the boys in town; the female must make the choice. It is part of Urseth’s law; laws that Presley will soon discover when her uncle finally decides to be honest about their ancestry. Will Presley accept the truth about Kadenburg, and herself, in time to save her people?",
