  "title": "Robert Kennedy: His Life",
  "description": "He was \"Good Bobby,\" who, as his brother Ted eulogized him, \"saw wrong and tried to right it . . . saw suffering and tried to heal it.\" And \"Bad Bobby,\" the ruthless and manipulative bully of countless conspiracy theories. Thomas's unvarnished but sympathetic and fair-minded portrayal is packed with new details about Kennedy's early life and his behind-the-scenes machinations, including new revelations about the 1960 and 1968 presidential campaigns, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and his long struggles with J. Edgar Hoover and Lyndon Johnson.",
