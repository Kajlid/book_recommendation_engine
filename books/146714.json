  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author, T. Sue VerSteeg...Most women have those two very distinct, very different voices in their mind. One can usually be chalked up to common sense, the other to mischief, mayhem or just plain morbid curiosity. Both are always there, though, ready with their two cents worth.Jemma Keith is no exception to the rule. She doesn't have a problem agreeing to photograph her cheating ex-boyfriend's wedding. The dilemma, however, is what to do once she gets there. Common sense feels like taking the high road; she can handle being the better person. Mischief wants to slither in, crashing the whole affair down around his worthless ankles.What's a woman to do when she can't make up her mind?At least both sides are in complete harmony about the bride's cousin, Anthony he's hot, handsome, and oh, so tempting.Join Jemma as she weaves through a web of lust, temptation, revenge, and maybe even love.",
