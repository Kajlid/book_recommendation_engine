Upon mastering agency tactics, however, he drops out to train young Chicago blacks as Freedom Fighters in this explosive, award-winning novel.As a story of one man's reaction to ruling-class hypocrisy, the book is autobiographical and personal. As a tale of a man's reaction to oppression, it is universal.",
