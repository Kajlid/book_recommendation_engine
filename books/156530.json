  "title": "Children of Nature: A History of Witches",
  "description": "Witches, they have never really had a good press. Feared and persecuted throughout history, their crime being a belief in something different and knowledge that frightened ordinary people or simply for being poor and old. At the height of their persecution thousands of men, women and children were tortured in the most barbaric ways possible, hung or burned at the stake for crimes they couldn't possibly have committed. Some were executed for having a knowledge of herbs and for healing the sick. This book takes a look at the history of witches, from pre Christian times up to the modern day.",
