  "description": "She'd got his number…luckily! For savvy antiques dealer Rowan Dunn life is good—until a passport error gets her deported back to South Africa! Stranded at the airport, Rowan can remember only two phone numbers—her parents' (definitely not an option!) and her best friend's brother's. As much as she hates it, Rowan knows she has no choice. It's time to call Seb Hollis and ask for help…. Seb is even sexier than Rowan remembers—and just as infuriating! He's always pushed her buttons, but at least now she knows how to push them back. Maybe it's time to start sleeping with the enemy—even though Rowan's sure there won't be a whole lot of sleeping going on…!",
