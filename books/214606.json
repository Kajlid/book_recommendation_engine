  "description": "Tom and Samantha. Feisty friends from childhood who feel like they know each other inside out, until the day comes when one of them suggests they go to a BDSM club together, and become formal play partners. Pushing the limits of what each of them can individually stand in their lifelong friendship, they attract and repel like magnets, until the time comes when they must choose how they will relate to one another—and what kind of relationship they will go on to have in the future.Whilst on this journey of discovery, the two of them meet and make a new friend—Alexis. A young woman with a hidden and secretive past, and a mystery surrounding the relationship she has—or has had—with a renowned business entrepreneur who begins to integrate himself into Samantha’s life, unknown to any of them whether he has done it for him, or for her . . . or for Alexis, being the mysterious link from his past.",
