  "description": "Lizzie Wilburn is a riot. She is loud-mouthed, strong-minded and tough, as eighteen years surviving in the scum of Southside Jamaica’s ghettos have taught her. She is also outrageously wealthy. But the latter is news to her, as she wakes up on a hospital bed after a hit and run accident. Incidentally, she gets stuck with a pair of filthy-rich, infuriatingly haughty parents. To make things even worse, they force their ‘lowlife’ daughter to marry the son of another business magnate. Lizzie’s new husband, Justin Winters, is handsome and as tempting as the most wicked of sins, but a serial womanizer whose only interest in his wife is limited to her business empire. Bound by a pre-nuptial agreement to remain faithful to his spouse, Justin tries every possible trick to go back to his playboy lifestyle. Lizzie, in turn, wants him badly, if only she could get him to even spare her a glance, let alone to come anywhere near her. Will any of them succeed in their quest?",
