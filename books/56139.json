  "title": "Pagan Christianity?: Exploring the Roots of Our Church Practices",
  "description": "This book - written by George Barna and Frank Viola - traces the historical roots of Protestant church practices and asks if the modern-way of doing church is a departure or a development from what Jesus and the apostles taught. Since the book released in 2008, it has never been refuted. The authors have responded to all objections and critics at the book site PaganChristianity dot org, which includes endorsements by scholars. This book is not a stand alone; it only deconstructs. The constructive sequels (Reimagining Church, From Eternity to Here, Finding Organic Church offer practical solutions. Frank Viola's newer books have been recommended by pastors and church leaders. They are for a wider audience. See the entire catalog on the author's blog.",
