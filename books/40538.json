  "title": "Stripped",
  "description": "Stripped is a collection with a twist. Yes, the fiction contained herein includes works from some of the best-known names in flash fiction as well as the work of emerging writers, but the bylines have been removed so you can’t tell who wrote what. What’s more, the stories hinge largely on gender roles — but with the authors’ identites stripped from their stories, editor Nicole Monaghan has created a bit of a guessing game. Did a woman, for example, write that piece about ambivalence toward motherhood? Or was it a man? More to the point, does it really matter? Or is there something bigger going on when men and women stretch their minds and imagine what it might be like to be the other? Authors include Meg Tuite, Michelle Reale, Myfanwy Collins, Tara L. Masih, Roxane Gay, Kathy Fish, Pamela Painter, Sara Lippman, Sherrie Flick, Len Kuntz, Marc Schuster, Michael Martone, Nathan Alling Long, Curtis Smith, Sean Lovelace Robert Vaughan Christopher Allen, and Randall Brown.",
