  "title": "36 Questions That Changed My Mind About You",
  "description": "Inspired by the real psychology study popularized by the New York Times and its \"Modern Love\" column, this contemporary YA is perfect for fans of \nEleanor and Park. \nHildy and Paul each have their own reasons for joining the university psychology study that asks the simple question: Can love be engineered? The study consists of 36 questions, ranging from \"What is your most terrible memory?\" to \"When did you last sing to yourself?\" By the time Hildy and Paul have made it to the end of the questionnaire, they've laughed and cried and lied and thrown things and run away and come back and driven each other almost crazy. They've also each discovered the painful secret the other was trying so hard to hide. But have they fallen in love? Told in the language of modern romance—texting, Q&A, IM—and punctuated by Paul's sketches, this clever high-concept YA is full of humor and heart. As soon as you've finished reading, you'll be searching for your own stranger to ask the 36 questions. Maybe you'll even fall in love.",
