  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Louisa's antique telephone is disconnected, but that doesn't keep it from ringing. And it doesn't keep Louisa from answering. Her caller is someone with a message from beyond the grave. The mysterious caller is somehow familiar, and has a message that unravels the mysterious past of Louisa's Swedish family, including the deeply hidden secret from World War II. She'd welcome the distraction of the cute boys competing for her attention, but instead, Louisa must figure out her role in her own story--before the telephone rings for the last time.",
