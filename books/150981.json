  "description": "When I chose to leave home I knew what I was giving up. I knew I was walking away from life as I knew it and the plans that we had made. We…us…him and I… It’s funny to think of him in a different light…or life. That’s what it feels like, a lifetime ago. But I’m a different person now. I have rules and goals. And if it wasn’t for my parents' vow renewal I would have successfully evaded him for the rest of my life. This is not by choice, I can tell you that. I just need to focus and remember the key to this weekend is avoidance…and alcohol. But if anyone can pull that off it’s me, Sidney Chandler, queen of avoiding anything that will make me feel. It’s just one weekend, right? One very long weekend with my family…friends…my sisters and me…together, and our nemeses, the McAllister triplets. What could possibly go wrong? Everything. They say you never forget your first love, now just imagine how hard it is to forget your only. This is going to suck.",
