  "description": "Luray Flitch is a neurotic, pill-popping recluse who discovers a prophetic Victorian diary, only to learn that the end of the world is just around the corner. With his trusty dog, Jason, Luray ventures out to warn the world that the end is near, but people keep trying to steal the diary. Written a century before by British clairvoyant Permelia Lyttle, the diary hides many other a murder mystery and Permelia's strange life in the Women’s Lunatic Asylum, where she was forced to give psychic readings to the power elite of her day. Prophecies unite in this satirical novel of eccentric villains, top-level conspiracies, the Apocalypse, and one really terrific dog. Follow Luray’s search for redemption, inept gun play, and discovery of the meaning of life while dancing the naked tango with the sweet but quirky Abigail Lind in the midnight gardens of Belvedere.",
