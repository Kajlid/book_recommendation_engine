  "description": "God either has a cruel streak or a peculiar sense of humor. At least that is what \"Plain\" Jane Cooper thinks. Why else would He have stuck her smack in the middle of the beautiful Cooper family? And why did she have to get duped into minding house for that exasperating Luke Reiley?Luke has his own set of problems. His brother just married the woman Luke loves, and they will be living in his home after their honeymoon. With all of that to worry about, Luke might as well throw his energy into what he does best: teasing. And nobody is more fun to tease that the stiff, starchy Jane Cooper. How will Jane handle this outrageous relationship.",
