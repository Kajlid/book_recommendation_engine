Their three children--teenage aspiring model Samantha, pre-med student Scott, and entertainment lawyer Allegra--are successful and happy. Allegra, as an attorney to the stars, has a career that consumes so much of her energy that she has little time for a private life--until a chance encounter with a New York writer turns her life upside down. Suddenly, she finds herself planning a wedding at her parents' Bel Air home.As preparations begin, the chaos of last-minute arrangements, surprise announcements and ever-increasing anxiety brings out both the best and the worst in everyone. But while couples in each generation of the Steinberg family struggle with broken vows and new hopes, the real meaning of Allegra's wedding emerges. It is a bridge between the past and the future, an opportunity for reconciliation, forgiveness and new hope for the future--as weddings often are for us all.",
