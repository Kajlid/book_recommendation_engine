  "title": "Things I've Learned from Women Who've Dumped Me",
  "description": "The Emmy award-winning former executive producer of The Daily Show and The Colbert Report has assembled a stellar lineup of men who have one thing in all have been dumped...and are willing to share their pain and the lessons learned.Relationships end. And in almost all of them, even the most callow among us take something away. This is a book about that something, whether it be major life lessons, like \"If you lie, you will get caught,\" simple truths like, \"Flowers work,\" or something wholly unique like, \"Watch out for the high strung brother in the military.\"This anthology will be comprised of longer and shorter pieces, drawn from an array of impressive celebrities, writers and public figures. Some pieces may be a paragraph in length while others will be full-blown essays. All of them will be about that salient something men take away from a failed relationship. Yes, men learn.This is not a touchy-feely book. This is not a self-help book. This is a book packed with smart, funny and insightful stories from men you probably thought never got dumped, or if they did, would never admit it.",
