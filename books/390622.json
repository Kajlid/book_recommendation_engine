Truth is silenced, and those with bold faith are now terrorists - terrorists who must be hunted down and destroyed. With the help of his friend Aaron, a Navy SEAL with expert computer hacking skills, Zach devises a plan to breach the government's lockdown on rogue webcasts. But his proclamation of faith comes with a heavy price. Now, imprisoned by the ruthless government official, Jack Johansen, Zach must fight for his life, his friends, and his precious wife and children.
