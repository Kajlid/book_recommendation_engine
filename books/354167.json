  "title": "The Heidegger Reader",
  "description": "The Heidegger Reader brings key texts from the entire course of Heidegger's philosophical career into one volume. Many of the selections, translated here for the first time, offer new insight into Heidegger's thought for both the beginning student and the experienced scholar. A critical and interpretive introduction by Gunter Figal traces the many thematic paths that are necessary for developing a comprehensive understanding of Heidegger's most important work. The carefully chosen readings are designed to reflect the concerns that are most relevant to philosophy today. Special features include an authoritative chronology of Heidegger's life, a current list of the Complete Works, and a definitive translation of Heidegger's controversial interview with Der Spiegel.",
