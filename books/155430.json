  "title": "Where Once Was Light",
  "description": "A continuation of the Written Pictures series of novels, Where Once Was Light was without doubt the most difficult to write, placing the reader, as one of the leading ladies of the series, sharing in her observations and feelings as she struggles forward. Those struggles though are not without their rewards as the series delivers its promise and serves up another erotic thriller.Using ideas for an earlier aborted novel from 2005 and 2006, Where Once Was Light explores the impact of an untimely lost love and the sacrifices that will be made to get it back. Originally finished in summer 2012, this book was comprehensively rewritten during 2013 which in turn sowed the seeds of ideas for the next book in the series, Shadows Creep.Work continues to get it ready for release in 2017",
