  "description": "After years of playing in the minors, Will Grant is called up to the majors as the new starting centerfielder for the N.Y. Nighthawks. He worked hard to achieve his dream. Moving on from his occasional girlfriend, Will’s not looking for a commitment. His fresh start in the big city is all about baseball and getting established with the team. But when smokin’ hot Jackie Rice shows up with her six-year-old, Mickey, at Nighthawks’ day camp, all bets are off. Mickey idolizes Will. Soon Grant’s spending plenty of off-the-field time with the boy and his mother. It’s all fun and games, until a mind-blowing secret revealed throws Will a curveball he didn’t see coming. Sometimes reaching for a homer ends by striking out. Can the centerfielder handle the life-changing challenges he faces?",
