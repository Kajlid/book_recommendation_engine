  "title": "The Yeshua Sanction: Book Two: The Mikveh Scrolls",
  "description": "This second book in The Mikveh Scrolls series is the thrilling continuation of the intense struggle for the souls of mankind; raging between Dr. Simon Cross, The Reverend Geoffrey Proudman, and their team of archaeological discoverers, and the powers and principalities of darkness.Darker than the first book in content and imagery, The Yeshua Sanction is grittier and even more intensely focused on the all-too-real spiritual battle in which people of faith find themselves in today's secularly stylized world. Author Steven G. Lightfoot's use of demons and the persona of Satan to represent the very worst of the opposition, drives home the point that, though the book is fiction, the battle is real. Relentless action combined with thoughtful, spiritual content make for an unparalleled reading experience. The inspired foreword by Brittany McReynolds sets the tone for Lightfoot's literary craftsmanship. You will be blessed!",
