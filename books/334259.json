  "description": "Twenty-two-year old Daniel, son of Melchior and Esther, lives out his days in rebellion and a drunken stupor . . . a great embarrassment to his father and his older brother, Joshua. Life is boring beyond belief, he thinks. But everything about his life is about to change . . . Melchior, former court astronomer, has been a wealthy merchant for the last three decades. As he prays for a miracle to save his son, he again ponders the signs he sees in the heavens. Perhaps the time of the young Messiahâ€™s work on earth has now come to fulfillment. In this tenth book in the A.D. Chronicles series, the Thoenes tell the parable of the Prodigal Son in a dramatic and memorable fashion.",
