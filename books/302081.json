  "description": "Monkey Heart (the second in the series) picks up where Monkey Mind left off. Haint Blue has invested her savings in her new business, a meditation retreat in Catfish Springs, Florida. Bookings are few. Bills are piling up. Her brother Iggy isn't returning her calls. What is he hiding? Why won't he talk to her? Haint struggles to stay positive. As Halloween approaches, bookings pick up. Guests include a group of Wiccans, three cryptozoologists after the Florida Skunk Ape, a dieting club, survivalists planning for TEOTWAWKI (The End Of The World As We Know It) and an overflow of Halloween revelers fresh from a drag show. The camp is lit up with activity and merriment. Haint is aglow as well, preoccupied by the attention of the lead cryptozoologist, Buster. All Saint's day begins with the sheriff banging at her door. One guest is missing. Murder? Foul play? Bigfoot abduction? This quasi-cozy goes French farce as the events of the previous evening are reviewed. And while someone or something has snatched her guest, Buster is capturing her heart.",
