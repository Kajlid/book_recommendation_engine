  "title": "Burned Child Seeks The Fire",
  "description": "This unusual memoir is the story of a self-described \"dark, pudgy, mean, defiant little brat,\" born in Berlin in 1929 of a half-Jewish mother and a Catholic father and sent to a concentration camp almost, it seems, as a bureaucratic formality. Raised Catholic, Cordelia Edvardson had little in common with her fellow inmates, some of whom despised her as a \"German swine.\" Singled out for punishment, she was selected to act as a secretary for the monstrous \"angel of Auschwitz,\" Josef Mengele. Impressionistic and na√Øve, Edvardson's third-person memoir retains a highly effective childlike quality (\"she had learned that anything can happen, no matter what and no matter when, and for inexplicable reasons\") that holds even in the most horrifying episodes. After World War II ended, Edvardson moved to Sweden, where this book was first published. She then converted to Judaism and moved to Israel.",
