  "description": "The Oberon is the only place one can still find the American Dream alive and well. Thousands of settlers from America have come to live in this mysterious land accessed only by an energy portal in the South Pacific. The settlers are there to mine orichalcum- a mineral that can give even the casual user magical powers - and to reap the strange high tech salvage that litters the dead cities of an extinct human civilization.Sarah Orange, a young and troubled girl from Southern California, is one of those settlers. Facing a futureless existence in modern day America and betrayed by her long time boyfriend, Sarah takes off to The Oberon and falls in with a group of illegal salvagers that operate in the dead cities only at night. Facing death, betrayal, and the heavy hand of her corporate overseers as well as the murderous hatred of the alien Oberon natives that live a medieval existence, Sarah searches for love and money in a world so close to- and yet so different from- our very own.",
