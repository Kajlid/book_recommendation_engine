If you like aliens and football then I suspect you're unlikely to find a better combination than than THE GFL.” — Phil Plait, Discover Magazine THE MVP is the fourth book in the Galactic Football League series, following on THE ROOKIE, THE STARTER and THE ALL-PRO. Set in a lethal American professional football league seven centuries in the future, THE MVP puts huge humans on the field with four alien races, creating a game that is faster, stronger and deadlier than anything we know today. Star quarterback Quentin Barnes has spent three seasons putting together a hard-hitting, hard-fighting team that combines rookies, rejects, discarded free agents and seasoned veterans from all five species. He has fought against racism and bound his team together through shared sacrifice, blood, tragedy and victory. But this season, Quentin faces the biggest challenge yet — the deadly threat of the mysterious Prawatt, who seized the ship carrying Quentin and his teammates. As THE MVP begins, the Ionath Krakens face certain death at the hands of this unknown race.",
