  "description": "Brooke Daniels has a secret.Tucker Lloyd has none.The university doesn't know what to make of the relationship between the shy, quiet girl that no one had noticed until their very own version of Hugh Hefner started bickering with her.Their relationship is friendship with a lot of insults, flirting and sexual tension.Brooke doesn't know what to make it of it either, especially when Tucker seems to be her very own dream catcher.Tucker understands the relationship, he respects Brooke, he likes her and when he finds out what she's been hiding from, he feels protective of her.That doesn't mean he won't hurt her though.Even though she's been hurt by everyone in her life, Brooke still finds herself giving in and surrendering, especially when those bright baby blue eyes stare up at her and those soft, full lips that surround a crocked grin, whisper the two words that take her breath away ... she knows that she say should no, she knows that the answer has to be no, she knows that she can't afford to say yes, but she always does, who knew that the most seductive words in the world could be the two that shatter it all in the end? After all, all he said was ... Trust me.",
