Now taken as a royal concubine, her resistance to Kosmas is starting to slip. He's launched an all-out war in his efforts to seduce her, and Keely is feeling the heat. There isn't any erotic button that Kosmas won't push, and he's a vampire used to getting what he wants.  Brutally taken by rival vampires, Zander is desperate to escape. Beaten and broken he's thrown into the back of a wagon, where he finally learns the reason for his captivity, and the person behind it. The clock is ticking, and Kosmas is out to seduce the red-haired concubine. Can Zander get back to Golden Harbor before it's too late, or will he lose Keely to their seductive leader?  This series is best read in order. See Taken: The Vampire's Concubine - Part One and Part Two exclusively on Amazon Kindle.",
