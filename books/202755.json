But mind me lads and lassies, there are other things there as well - danger and risk and uncertainty, and creatures never before seen by the likes of sell-swords and wizards who tread upon the sun-lit lands of the Realms.\"This place is called Undermountain. And it is far beneath the crust of this world, yet right under fair Waterdeep. It is a dangerous labyrinth nestled deep in the bowels of the earth. It is a dungeon. I, Elminster of Shadowdale, know well. I shall tell you of these twisting corridors, and of the man who made them his. Listen ye carefully - especially if ye are intent on delving into its depths. Perhaps what I tell you could save your life.\"Perhaps.\"This sequel to The RUINS OF UNDERMOUNTAIN contains the 128-page Campaign Guide to Undermountain: The Deep Levels, a 32-page adventure booklet, a 16-page MONSTROUS COMPENDIUM booklet, four full-color, poster-size maps of the levels described in this boxed set, and a set of eight DM Assistance Cards to aid in trapping the corridors and rooms of this, the greatest and most dangerous dungeon in all the Realms.The original campaign expansion set wasn't enough?
