  "description": "Buddhism blossoms from the words and life of Siddhartha Gautama, the Buddha. Buddhism is a philosophy, not a religion, and billions of people model their way of life on the peaceful and compassionate teachings of the Buddha. He is not worshipped as a god, but rather respected as an everyday human being who rediscovered a way of life that led to the end of his suffering and confusion about the apparent tragedy of the world. Buddha's words and teachings continue to influence society in positive ways by encouraging us all to develop happiness and peace from within.A Little Bit of Buddha is a wonderful introduction to the life and ways of one of the most unique humans the world has known.",
