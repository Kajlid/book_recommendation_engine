  "description": "In Engagement, Europa fulfilled her destiny and saved her people by bringing them back home to Europa. But she was not prepared for the price of her fulfillment – the loss of her father. Unable to accept his loss, Europa fails into a deep state of anger, despair and grief. She turns against Kiijon, blaming him for taking her away from her father. Her actions break her connection to the Orbs and the bond of the Quanundocii begins to disintegrate. While Europa hides away in her room, Jeanip and Kiijon endeavor to keep the monarch together. But the home land they have returned to is not the one that was left six thousand years earlier. Jupiter’s implosion caused severe damage, destroying the Oonock’s world. Death and disease plague those that remained behind for several thousand years. Many died. Vegetation and wildlife were destroyed creating vast wastelands. The Oonocks suffered greatly and are not eager to embrace the clan that left them behind. Some clan leaders feel a new clan should be named to rule as the supreme monarchs and advocate for a new king and queen. Europa’s lack of appearance and leadership strengthens their belief she is not fit to rule and others start to agree. As the clan leaders argue amongst themselves, a new advisory arises determined to turn the people themselves against the new monarchs. With the help of an ancient enemy, this new threat will take up JeffRa’s vow of revenge and dedicate himself to ending the Oonock race once and for The New Monarchs tells Europa’s story as she tries to become the queen she was meant to be. If she fails, not only with her brother die but the very race she and her farther fought to save will perish and JeffRa will win at last.",
