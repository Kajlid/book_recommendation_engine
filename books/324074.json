At each train station, a few lucky orphans from the crowded streets of New York City receive the fulfillment of their a home and family. This \"orphan train\" is the vision of Charles Loring Brace, founder of the Children's Aid Society, who cannot bear to see innocent children abandoned in the overpopulated cities of the mid-nineteenth-century. Yet it is not just the orphans whose lives need mending -- follow the train along and watch God's hand restore love and laughter to the right family at the right time!",
