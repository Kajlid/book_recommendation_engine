  "description": "Two strangers trapped together in a blizzard.  One running from the past; one with no future.  Two destinies collide.  London Sykes is on her own for the first time in her life after a sequence of betrayal and abuse. One man rescues her only to destroy her himself. An unfortunate accident lands her in a ditch only to be rescued by the most closed-off man she’s ever met, albeit undeniably handsome.  Kadin Cole is at the cabin in the woods for the very first and the very last time. Since his grief doesn’t allow for him to return home to a life he’s no longer able to live alone, he’s finally made what has been the hardest decision of his life. His plans change drastically when a beautiful woman in a little red car crashes into his life.  How can she trust another man?  How could he ever love again?  Will happenstance and ensuing sexual attraction be enough to heal two hearts enough that they can see in themselves what the other sees?",
