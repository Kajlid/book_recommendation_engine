  "title": "Echo",
  "description": "The highly anticipated follow-up to Bang. Echo is the second book in the Black Lotus series. It's been said the longest echo ever measured lasted 75 seconds, but I can assure you, this will last much longer. The bang deafened the world around me, muting everything into nullity, allowing the reflection of its destruction to live far beyond its intended life. It will follow me forever, destroying meâ€”destroying you. You want answers? So do I. *Due to the dark and explicit nature of this book, it is recommended for mature audiences only as some scenes may be particularly disturbing.",
