  "description": "2010 Reprint of 1949 Edition. This title shows the same intensity of thought and conviction which had made Neville famous amongst progressive thinkers. In this volume we see not only a profound religious feeling, but also a sense of the dignity and responsibility of human life. Our own feeling about the results of his experiments as a whole is that they are not just an addition to our existing knowledge, but require a revolution in our whole way of thinking about the world.",
