  "description": "Book Two in the Cruentus Dragons SeriesFor months, Jonah Genjhury has hunted Athena. Waiting. Planning. Dreaming. Finally, he finds his prickly runaway mate and he knows it’s time to claim her for the Cruentus clan—and himself. Athena, however, isn’t easy to convince. She fights a union with everything in her. Now he must convince his angry mate she’s his while an age-old battle with the Dragon enemies rages around them.Athena Xanthopoulos isn’t having any of this “Dragon” business. They’re myths, and she certainly isn’t the mate of one of those flying, scaly, blood-sucking creatures. Okay, so he’s not scaly most of the time and he’s super hot, but that doesn’t mean she wants to spend eternity with him. Trouble is…she can’t stop wanting him.",
