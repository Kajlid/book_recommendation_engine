  "description": "Contents:Prince CaspianThe Voyage of the Dawn TreaderFor many years C.S. Lewis held in his mind an imaginary picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. \"Then one day when I was about 40, I said to myself, 'Let's make a story about it'.\" And so The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, written written in 1949, began the series of books which, with their remarkable combination of adventure, humor, fantasy and allegory, have become classics of children's literature the world over. This special omnibus edition contains the fourth and fifth Chronicles of Narnia.",
