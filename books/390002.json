  "description": "Micky's having a shit day. On the one hand - he's out of jail and on his way home. On the other - his head still throbs from the whippin' he got on the inside. If only he could remember a bit more about it - but the memories are blurred. And something dark and nasty nags at him - something he wishes he could remember but at the same time feels sure he'd like to forget. And that's before someone goes and kills his Dad and pins it on him. Rams a bottle through his neck. Nasty. Real nasty. Still - Micky's no dumbarse. He's sure he can solve his Dad's murder before the week is out. He just needs a few beers to get his head straight. Lie low at his mates bedsit... Get ready for a race against time as Micky and his pigthick sidekick Rezza immerse themselves in the crap and dregs of London's bungling criminal underworld. Trying to prove his innocence and jolt his short-term memory before it's too late. Take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the thrill ride of a lifetime - just bring a sickbag, a bullet-proof vest and some codeine with you! Just in case...",
