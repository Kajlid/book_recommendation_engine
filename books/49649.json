  "description": "Without the angel forcing him to brake, Liam could have killed the gorgeous girl who ran in front of his car to save a little boy. He owed the rescuer big time and would pay his debt no matter that she acted cranky and became more difficult with every meeting. After all, how hard could it be to walk a bunch of mangy mutts?  Men are scum and no one can tell Sadie any different. It's why she stays away from them. Until a crazy, hotshot soldier runs her down with his convertible. Now because she's bruised and sore, she's stuck having to accept his help in her elite dog-walking business. Just her luck that some of the expensive pets go missing, and Liam decides the puppy-mill rumour needs to be investigated. And once they're forced to spend more time together, mutual attraction spirals out of control.",
