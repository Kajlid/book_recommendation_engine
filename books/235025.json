  "description": "HE’S MY UNEXPECTED HERO… All my life, Darian James has been my dad’s friend. Nothing more and nothing less—until the day I found out my own father was sleeping with my best friend. Then, Darian becomes my personal savior. Taking me into his home, he cares for me and helps me cope with the ultimate betrayal. And suddenly, he’s so much more than just my best friend’s father. He’s the man I can’t get enough of.  SHE’S MY PERSONAL TEMPTATION… Ever since Heather Abrams walked in on me in the bathroom, naked and sporting one of the worst erections of my life, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about her, about the way she stood there and devoured me with her eyes, about the way her body would feel beneath mine, about how she’d sound screaming my name. There’s just one problem: she’s the nineteen-year-old daughter of my closest friend, and she’s totally off-limits.  ONE NIGHT CHANGES EVERYTHING… When a severe thunderstorm rolls in, knocking out the power and trapping us in a much too small room, I can barely keep my hands to myself. But when she touches me, all bets are off. Heather will be mine, even if that means losing everything I’ve worked so hard for.",
