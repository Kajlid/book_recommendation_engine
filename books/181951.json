  "description": "Jack Winters is in a bit of a pickle. Things started out just fine. He had a decent job and a few friends. Then he met the woman of his dreams. They go out on a date and things go really well. That’s when things go south. The morning after turns out to be a week later and the world went ahead and ended itself while Jack was far away in dreamland. Now he’s awake in a post-apocalyptic world with no family, no job, and worst of all, no girlfriend. Along with his friends and some other random tag-alongs, Jack will journey cross country to find the woman of his dreams against zombies, heavy metal horsemen, pirates, and a power so immense and evil it will put his very soul to the test.A rip-roaring tale of one man's road trip through an apocalyptic wasteland, Apocalypse Wow takes the standard post-apocalyptic tropes and pokes them with the humor stick while knee deep in the world of 90's pop culture. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll hurl.",
