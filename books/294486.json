  "description": "This book is catharsis for me, and therapy for you. Sometimes this book hurt me to write, sometimes it may hurt to read. It is about broken souls, empty rooms, and the property of turning your miserable cracks into colorful mosaics. This book as about being foreign, both away and at home, about being Arab and Muslim. It is about faith and how sometimes you need to lose it to find it again. Channel all your old sads and hopefully we together can make new happies out of them, an alchemy of emotion. This book, above all, is about humility. Poetry is about realizing you are vulnerable, man or woman, rich or poor. Learn to embrace and love that. That is what living this book and writing it taught me. That the I should always be lowercase.",
