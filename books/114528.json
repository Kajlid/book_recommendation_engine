  "description": "How far will one woman go for revenge? October, 1655. Marie St. James is betrayed by her lover and hanged as a witch. When she returns as a restless spirit, she sets in motion a chain of events that will extend two-hundred years into the future. As the key characters reincarnate, they are forced to face the truth about the past and the wrath of a spirit that still lingers, waiting for justice to be served. Before Marie's spirit can be at peace, the characters must put the puzzle of the past together, piece by piece. Time is against them as Marie's original curse has placed restraints on their efforts. If they can beat the clock, Marie's soul can be put to rest. If they fail, the cycle must begin again, bringing the circle of characters together for another chance at putting the past, and a vengeful spirit, to rest.",
