And unlike everyone else in his family, he hasn’t a lick of magic.

Until the night when the outside world—specifically his new neighbor—discovers him.Liam Watson lives in a culture filled with electronics, mobile devices, and social media—where there is no magic or even the belief in it. And as much as Quill finds Liam irritating (he’s so cute it’s annoying), he can’t help himself.Now Quill’s getting a taste of the outside world and of Liam…and he wants more. But all is not well in this magical, urban garden, and someone—or something—is changing the very essence of it.And wherever Quill goes, the danger grows…",
