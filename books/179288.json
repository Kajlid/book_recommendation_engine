Christian Matters is a neurotic architect living in Chicago, but thrown off his routine by a bizarre episode he blames the whiskey on, he abandons his promising career, girlfriend, and home for a life-changing journey to California, where he meets a cavalier aristocrat named Lester Rothschild and the extravagant musician Ella Athens. Mysterious and insane, Lester takes Christian on his adventure to open Société, the most luxurious entertainment complex at the heart of the world's richest city. But, with the chance meeting of an unlikely visitor and the sudden death of a lover, colliding events lead him to unravel the true ambitions behind the greatly anticipated opening of Société, where he discovers the fate of something much greater is at stake. @AlexanderHelasForeword INDIEFAB Book of the Year Awards Finalist, 2015USA Best Book Awards Finalist Visionary FictionUSA Best Book Awards Finalist New Age FictionSouthern California Book Festival Honorable Mention, LAMidwest Book Awards Honorable Mention, Chicago",
