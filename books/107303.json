  "description": "Kaz Barrett isn’t saving for college. Every penny he earns at the sketchy Sit’N’Spin Laundromat is for his mother, who suffers from a mysterious sleeping disease. At the start of summer, everything seems on track, but when anarchic, pink-haired Zoey walks past the laundromat’s window, Kaz’s ordered life spins out of control. Smart, mysterious, and full of music, Zoey is unlike anyone else Kaz knows, but Zoey has a secret and she might be the one puzzle he doesn't want to solve.",
