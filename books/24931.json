  "description": "My arrogant fake fiancé? I can't stand him. Cocky and charismatic Emmett Rhodes isn’t the relationship kind of guy, but now that he’s running for mayor of our small town, his bachelor past is hurting the campaign. Thankfully, I'm the last woman who would ever fall for him. We're total opposites—he's a golden retriever and I'm sharp and snarky, but he’ll cosign on my restaurant loan if I play his devoted fiancée. Between romantic dates, a prom night re-do, and visits to a secret beach, things heat up, and the line between real and ruse is lit on fire. I see another side of Mr. Popular, and now I wonder if I was all wrong. We can’t keep our hands off each other, but it’s all for show… right? A sizzling, hilarious, enemies-to-lovers fake dating rom-com with an HEA. This is the first book in the Queen’s Cove series.",
