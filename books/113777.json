  "description": "Bored and restless, Jasper thinks he will never escape the sleepy, desert town of Benton. Little does he know, his life is about to become more exciting than he could ever imagine.  Jasper’s wild ride begins one day when an odd little man brings a magic mirror into the antique shop owned by his mother. The mirror’s magic is activated by a sequence of notes Jasper unknowingly strums. The next thing he knows, he’s trapped inside the mirror in a twilight world of glass, as the mirror transports him back to Renaissance England and the chamber of a nobleman’s daughter, Elena Culstone. While Jasper despairs of every being free of the mirror or returning to his own time, he falls in love with the fiery Elena, who believes the young man she glimpses in her mirror is a figment of her imagination.",
