  "description": "When S.W.A.T Sergeant Marcas MacArthur laid eyes on the bronze skin beauty who moved in next door, he swore he wouldn’t touch her. Leading one of the most elite S.W.A.T teams in the state of South Carolina, left no room for relationships. Marcas knew Sarena Rucker was a woman who deserved a man’s last name. She was a temptation he fought to resist and he vowed to stay far away from her. Now if only he could follow his own rules.  The emergency room nurse had eyes on her sexy-as-sin neighbor. Sarena had a thing for men in uniforms, and Marcas MacArthur decked out in his S.W.A.T tactical gear made her knees weak. He was the perfect package--sexy, alpha, rugged and intense. She'd lusted after him from afar, and was unaware he even knew of her existence. But she was ready to make her presence known. Only he made the first move by sauntering over to her, and let his plans for her be known. The sexy cop didn't realize he wasn't the only one that could issue orders. Sarena had a few of her own, and Marcas was determined to meet every one of them.  The chemistry between Marcas and Sarena was electrifying, casting a light on the passion that burned between them. There are those lurking back in the shadows, who want nothing more than to extinguish the blaze, and exact revenge on the S.W.A.T officer by taking the one person who made his heart beat again.  Marcas is willing to go to extreme measures to protect Sarena. Will he be able to rescue her? Or will Marcas lose the one person who gave him hope for a future?",
