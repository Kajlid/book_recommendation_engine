  "title": "Someone Who Will Love You in All Your Damaged Glory: Stories",
  "description": "A fabulously off-beat collection of short stories about love--the best and worst thing in the universe.In \"A Most Blessed and Auspicious Occasion,\" a young couple planning a wedding is forced to deal with interfering relatives dictating the appropriate number of ritual goat sacrifices. \"Missed Connection--m4w\" is the tragicomic tale of a pair of lonely commuters eternally failing to make that longed-for contact. The members of a rock band in \"Up-and-Comers\" discover they suddenly have superpowers--but only when they're drunk. And in \"The Serial Monogamist's Guide to Important New York City Landmarks,\" a woman maps her history of romantic failures based on the places she and her significant others visited together.Equally at home with the surreal and the painfully relatable (or both at once), Bob-Waksberg delivers a killer combination of humor, romance, whimsy, cultural commentary, and crushing emotional vulnerability. The resulting collection is a punchy, perfect bloody valentine.",
