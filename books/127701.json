Master of Illusion Book II continues the story of the tormented genius, Angel, and his childhood friend, Elise, the prima ballerina who once graced the stage as La Belle and now directs their own opera house, the Opéra Magique. Their lives ensue in an entanglement of secrets, subterfuge, tragedy and love through which they battle their fated hand. Though the skeletons of the past continue to haunt, the veil concealing the truth begins to fall. It is Paris,1892, and the Opéra Magique is riding a wave of unparalleled success, with the help of Sprite, the Master's popular, fairy-like assistant.

But, in discovering the truth of the past, the truth about Angel and the truth about love, do they find the solace they so crave?Can Angel and Elise overcome the barriers of fate, or will they be destroyed in their determination to do so?",
