  "title": "Dido in Winter: Poems",
  "description": "This collection is a mapping of the senses, in which rapture and disillusionment shadow each other, reflecting a world \"where sun swirls on the rock-face by the spring/moving its blue and yellow hands/then vanishing.\" It is a book searching for truth beyond beauty by a poet who shines increasingly bright. Anne Shaw is also the author of Undertow (Persea 2007).",
