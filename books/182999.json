  "description": "Well here we are.Senior Year.A year that by definition means I’ll be one of about 300 other kids running my school.Greenville High.I know what you’re all thinking. “Oh no, here comes the book about the virgin wallflower who the popular guy meets and instantly falls for.”Wrong.I’m not an ugly duckling that the cool cats use to make themselves look like even bigger jerks, and I’m definitely not a wallflower, though that whole virginal thing, well that’s really none of your business. I’m just the girl more interested in taking pictures and playing on her acoustic than getting caught up in the petty drama that four years of high school is guaranteed to create. Until Christian.I know, I know. It’s always a guy isn’t it?Girl on the fast track to any college she chooses, always seems to get tripped up by the guy.But hear me out! This guy…he’s different.You see, Christian Cayne isn’t just some guy I almost ran down on my first day here and later fell in love with. I wish it were that simple. It would make what’s gotta happen now easier. Christian is a lot of things to a lot of people since he landed here with his dad at the end of the summer, but in a couple of months, he’s going to have to be one thing only to me. \nMy step-brother.",
