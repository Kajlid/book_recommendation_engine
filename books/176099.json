  "title": "Dante Gabriel Rossetti",
  "description": "Dante Gabriel Rossetti was the central figure of the Pre-Raphaelites. Together with Hunt and Millais, he started the original Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, and was the 'poetic inspiration' of the movement. His turbulent and romantic imagery has always beguiled and intrigued art-lovers.This beautifully illustrated book, published to accompany the landmark Rossetti exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam and the Walker in Liverpool, is the most thorough and up-to-date analysis of the life and career of this pivotal nineteenth-century English painter available today.It reproduces all of his most famous works in glorious colour, and major sections are also devoted to Rossetti's subjects from Dante; his representations of artists and their models; his drawings of Elizabeth Siddal; the medievalizing watercolours of the late 1850s; his monumental decorative projects at Llandaff Cathedral and at the Oxford Union; and his contributions to the decorative arts in the form of book bindings and illustrations, stained glass, furniture and picture frames.",
