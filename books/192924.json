Lily has changed from an angelic little girl into someone she is afraid to be alone with.What scares Julia most, though, is that she knows why Lily is acting this way, but no-one will believe her. If she is going to help Lily, she will have to find the answers alone, embarking on a search that will take her to the shadowy back streets of Venice.There Julia finds far more than just answers, and uncovers a heartbreaking, long-buried tale of tragedy and devastation. And this discovery has put her in serious danger . . .'I defy you to read the first chapter and not singe your fingers reading all the rest. It’s that compelling. It’s that good.' DAVID BALDACCI",
