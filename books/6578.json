  "description": "Short Story from the With or Without series.I have Aubrey and Matt on the brain, so of course I chose to use them. This is related to their book, but not. I sort of wrote this scene as if it would go in their story after the Epilogue. I don’t think I’m giving anything away because of course ya’ll know they get a Happily Ever After. And I don’t think you have to know them well to enjoy this scene. That said…I hope ya’ll enjoy it.__________Word Count: 1479 Status: Complete",
