  "description": "HumanAlien is a young adult fiction tetralogy that invites you into the life of Vic, a half human half alien that explores life, feelings, Earth and the Universe. Take her hand, follow her path of healing and get ready to question everything you ever knew, starting with a heartbreak.. \"While most stories start with the beginning, mine begins with the end. The end, when my breath is stuck in my throat and I drown and burn up in flames. The major heartbreak, that’s what they call it. I feel surrounded by darkness and the sound of shattering hearts. How can a story that starts with the end ever turn into something good?\"...Excerpt from \"I have never read a book quite like HumanAlien. Told through a series of what feel like personal reflections—but somehow manage to be more intimate than journal entries—the emotion in HumanAlien is so raw! I’m finding myself reliving some of my most regrettable failed relationships, my heart breaking for the girl I was and the thousands of others who have had to and will endure the same. It’s like poetry mixed with philosophy and fantasy, and I don’t even know how that would work, but it sort of does!\" by Jessica Willis. (Amazon)**\"It goes through hills and valleys of being introspective and philosophical to being super topical and journal- entry like. It's fascinating.\" by Koshiz (Twitter)**\"Honestly, the way this book describes mental health is like you are watching yourself inside out on the pages. Eerie but captivating.\" by Natalia Martinez (GoodReads)** \"do not be surprised if this becomes one of the most important books of our time. It's beautiful but the message is where the real power of this book resides. Please read it... do it for your soul.\" Katie B. (Twitter)",
