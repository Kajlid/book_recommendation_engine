  "title": "Infinity: The Story of a Moment",
  "description": "In the course of a single extensive interview, this novel recounts the colorful life of a wealthy, eccentric Italian composer through multiple layers of unreality. As Massimo recalls what his master, Tancredo Pavone, told him about his life, he often repeats Pavoneâ€™s outrageous opinions on everything from the current state of the world to the inner life of each musical note. Eventually, it becomes comically clear that not only does Pavone not always distinguish between memory and imagination, but also that Massimo does not always understand what it is he is repeating. A moving portrait of a close bond between two people from utterly different social spheres, this narrative is an insightful look into the world of a composer and the process of artistic creation.",
