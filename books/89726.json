  "description": "Devilishly attractive Lord Illingworth is notorious for his skill as a seducer. But he is still invited to all the “best” houses while his female conquests must hide their shame in seclusion. In this devastating drawing - room comedy, Wilde uses his celebrated wit to expose English society’s narrow view of everything from sexual mores to Americans.",
