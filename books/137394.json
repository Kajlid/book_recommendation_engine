Her love life is meh, her piano is her home, and her best friend is her vicarious source of fun. Everything is in harmony until blade-like fangs dig into her flesh to obliterate everything she ever knew to be true. Now she is a supernatural powerhouse. Now she is a force of nature. Now she is a target.Overture, the first book in a four-part series of the same name, introduces readers to a heroine who will find that she is leagues stronger than she ever thought she could be, more passionate than she dared to believe, and critical in ways she could never have fathomed. In a symphony of vampires, evil, magic, and timeless love, Elma sings a pivotal song. Watch as she learns the tune.",
