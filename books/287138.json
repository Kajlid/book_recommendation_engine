  "description": "Lucy is 15. She and her teenage friends are waiting to give evidence in criminal trials against a fanatical religious sect that worships the Magnifico and disposes of detractors by lethal injection.  Their lives are in danger and they are sent out of London for their own safety, and placed in a foster house in Wales where the Magnifico has no followers. The foster mother seems kind, but they are unable to trust anyone but themselves. Their experience of the world outside the confines of the sect is extremely limited and they have to rely on their wits and resilience to battle through dark times. Although they are careful never to divulge anything that might help the Magnifico to track them down, his agents have their ways and means.  A sequel to The Father's House.",
