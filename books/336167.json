  "description": "Powerful, dangerous, broodingly handsome Falcon Delaney was a loner, a man of action who'd spent years pursuing a stolen cache of Union gold. When he awakened in a locked cellar and gazed into the enchanting eyes of Victoria Fontaine, he was bewitched, on fire, aching to possess her. Giving her no chance to protest or resist, he kissed her thoroughly--and she was spellbound by waves of potent heat. Beneath Falcon's city manners was a wildness nothing could tame, and Victoria refused to be ashamed of her reckless, wanton desire for this complex man who left her breathless with passion. Torn between obsession and duty, Falcon longed to cherish her, but he knew he could make promises, offer her no future. She was willing to disregard every rule to have him--until a heartbreaking telegraph sent her riding West in search of a killer, with Falcon savaged by her betrayal... and hot on her trail. He'd follow her forever if it meant he'd learn her secret, but would uncovering the truth drive them apart for good?",
