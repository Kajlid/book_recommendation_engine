  "description": "The last time Marilyn actually spoke to Benjamin was when she needed to borrow a crayon... that was ten years ago. Benjamin and Marilyn have known each other all their lives. They've gone to the same schools, ridden the same bus, and had the same teachers for as long as either of them can remember. But they aren't friends. It's nothing personal; they just don't have much in common. Benjamin has always been a bit of a geek. Marilyn is shocked when Benjamin refuses to do her one little favor. Boys don't usually say 'no' to her. And okay it actually would have been a pretty big favor. When Marilyn stops by his house to apologize for her behavior she is even more shocked to find that she likes spending time with him. He's still a geek, but he's also funny, thoughtful, and sweet. And she likes the way she feels when they are together. What a surprise that after all these years they can still find friendship. It just goes to show that sometimes you find the best things in the last place you look.",
