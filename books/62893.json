She was running late for Health class and as punishment was forced to sit in an assigned seat next to Aiden Parker, the son of Willowshore’s most racist man. It didn’t take long before they were sent to the office and forced to do a project about researching each others families for the principal. As if it’s not bad enough that she has to figure out a way to interview Aiden’s racist family, she ended up in a game of revenge with him that causes them both to unwillingly fall for each other. But Essie doesn't want to fall in love with Aiden, not because she's Hispanic and afraid of his father, but because she has her own dark secrets that forbids her from love. Will this forbidden love end up in tragedy or in a happily ever after?16+ years",
