  "description": "What if death was the only way of remaining in the heart of a loved one?  Violinist, Jacob Elliot is fleeing Fellwood; trying to leave behind the memories of a lost love, death, betrayal, torment and terror. But they haunt him - just as she said they would.  They follow him - just as she said they would.  But will they ruin him - just as she threatened they would?  His only two possessions - his violin and a curious, locked box that never leaves his side - are all that prevent the shadows of his soul from conquering him.  But the shadows have an ally. One who walks through them collecting their secrets. But do the shadows really want to be seen and will stirring them change a past that has been shrouded with dark deceptions?",
