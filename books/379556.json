  "description": "Major Tommy Black is at the crossroads of a brilliant, clandestine career. Lost... without purpose or mission. His life in sealed records and whispered stories of his violent exploits. Devastated and blaming himself when a member of his covert task force commits suicide, but when the man’s daughter is kidnapped, Black, the man with “a talent for violence,” sacrifices all for the nearly impossible chance to save the girl... and maybe his soul.For fans of Robert Ludlum and Lee Child, BLACK FIRE is a “tour de force of explosive action” that takes the reader on an epic, breathtaking adventure from the exotic Indian Ocean island of Mauritius to the remote interior of South Africa and across Europe into the towering mountains of Central Asia, and introduces a riveting new hero to cheer along with Reacher and Bourne — Tommy Black.",
