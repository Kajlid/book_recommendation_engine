  "description": "Three classic novels in one Summer in Williamsburg (1934), Homage to Blenholt (1936), and Low Company (1937).Fuchs wrote, “I devoted myself simply to the the life in the hallways, the commotion at the dumbwaiters, the assortment of characters in the building, their strivings and preoccupations, their troubles.” These novels are as alive today as the day they were first printed, as exuberant. There are few novelists in America today who possess Fuchs’s talent, his energy, his sense of life.",
