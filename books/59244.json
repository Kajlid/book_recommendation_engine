  "description": "A journey into the psyches of men whose crimes have shocked the world. Canter gives a detailed profile of his 'marauders and commuters' theory - looking at killers whose confused and devious attempts to satisfy their brutal desires led to their capture. Most chillingly, the role of the victim is how someone can unwittingly risk becoming etched on a murderer's map, without realizing the journey they are taking could be their last.",
