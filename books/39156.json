  "description": "There's a Monster, living in Eads City. It lives in the water, in the gutters, even in the orphanage. Both beast and pet, both freak and God, it controls the lives of every single person within the city limits. People like Jane, a religious prostitute, struggling to build a life away from the streets for herself and her husband, a phobia-plagued genius drug-salesman. Or like Sufjan, an ill-fated pyromaniac just trying to survive the city streets. And caught between them all is Alaska Darling, a morally torn hit man, trying to destroy the mob at its roots. A childhood drifter and drinker, Alaska has found his calling in Eads City, trying to save innocence one individual at a time. But he finds out quickly that killing the beast may mean playing its game, as well. In a gangland setting of the distant future, human beings must live in an inhuman age. It's the year 2171, and for these pilgrims on Mankind's newest frontier, the woods are still full of Evil. As Alaska is swallowed alive by the thing he set out to destroy, Sufjan and Jane fight to outlive their own vices and to rise out of the city shadows. They fight to stay alive in a world bathed by blood and fire; one where, sooner or later, they must all face the Monster.",
