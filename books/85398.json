  "description": "The setting: Iran during the 1978-1979 revolution. The plot: how a perfect political storm is formed to get rid of the Shah. This is a fictional story, heavy on the political side, dealing with the game that intertwines the political policies of nations and the power play of the major and all powerful oil companies. The story evolves in the 1970â€™s at a time when the U.S. is trying to cause religious unrest in the Soviet Union by first making Iran a religious state. Their hope is to create this situation in Iran by supporting, but not openly, a religious fervor through a new religious leader in Iran. The effect of that new religious fervor, they hope, will spill over to several of the Russian states and create civil and religious rebellion in the USSR. Parallel to the United States plotting this course of events to bring down the Soviet government, the major international oil companies are secretly meeting to sabotage the US plans which they see as an extreme detriment to their own operations. The intrigue is witnessed through the eyes of an American educated Iranian oil executive who has romantic entanglements with a top oil company lobbyist. During the tumultuous times of the Iranian revolution and embassy takeover, he is forced to try and escape from those that would arrest and kill him. His harrowing experiences in trying to work his way out of Iran to the Turkish border are both funny and frightening. Although fictional, the book is peppered with true and real stories, anecdotes and folklore as witnessed by the author during the pre and post revolution days in Iran. It is a depiction of internal and external forces coming together making the perfect storm to overthrow the Shah of Iran.",
