  "description": "My brother's best friend, NHL god Easton Scotch, has always seen me as a kid. Now, I'm his new roommate and I'm determined to show him that Claire Merrick is all grown up. Boston Hawks left wing and bad boy personified, Easton is untouchable, reckless, and sexier than any one man ought to be. He has a complicated past, makes questionable life choices, and doesn't want anyone growing too close. Least of all me.  East makes himself clear on his first day out of rehab, when we become reluctant roommates. At best, I'm angling for friendship. But soon, East is lowering his guard and we're bonding.  When we cross a line there's no coming back from, he spirals, jeopardizing his recovery and my heart. If Easton is the risk taker, then why does it feel like I'm the one gambling it all?",
