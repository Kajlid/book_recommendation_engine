  "description": "Aspiring actress, Piper Coleman, is injured in a car accident on an icy mountain road. She falls in love with her rescuer, part-time cowboy, Matt Jordan, while they shelter in a vacant cabin. Matt hikes through waist-deep snow to get help when she sinks into a coma, but she is rescued while he’s gone. When Piper awakens, she’s forgotten the accident and Matt. As Piper struggles to fully recover, her parents won’t let Matt near her. They believe he is responsible for her injuries. Matt is sure if Piper sees him, she’ll remember everything. He’s in love and determined to be with her, but will the love they shared be enough to overcome her memory loss, her physical difficulties, and her protective family?",
