  "description": "Da’vi, the relentless. Da’vi, the cold and harsh. The alien who keeps his distance, yet never fails to bicker with me over the smallest details. Tension between us is coiled so tight it’s bound to snap... and I’m bound to do what I always do--leave. There’s a hundred different reasons I should go, yet I’m drawn in by the only thing that matters to me anymore--and it’s certainly NOT Da’vi’s friendship. I’m talking about saving humans.  One last mission and I’m done jumping through everyone’s hoops, Da’vi’s especially. Only, this lead we’re following... it brings us closer than I ever thought we could be. And once Da’vi and I cross that line, there’s no going back. I’ve got two choices: fight this bond... or SURRENDER.  Too bad for Da’vi I’m not the type of girl who goes down without a fight.",
