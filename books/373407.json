  "description": "Maggie's family did not have much money, but they did have love. That very love hangs thick in the air the day Maggie's momma dies, leaving behind seven children. While Maggie's grandmother stands idly by, the children's fate is decided by the state-run social services department. And Momma's letter. Years later, when Maggie begins to look into her family tree, what she finds is a bad case of root-rot. Could the secrets dug up be the very key to healing her broken family? A tale of choice and chance, Wisteria Trees is also a story of survival and hope.",
