  "description": "Shoshana's Refuge explores the struggles of a young Israelite woman during the reign of Solomon. Traditions, expectations, and the laws of the God of Jacob rise up like a prison around Shoshana, but she takes refuge in her favorite places: her kitchen and the top of the hill where she feels the breeze in her hair. When an accident forces her to take refuge under the law of God and away from all that she loves, she struggles to see Godâ€™s grace in her circumstances. Will she find freedom among God's people? Or will she seek refuge somewhere else?",
