  "description": "Sitting beside a smokey fire, Edison and his new friend Jonathan hear a curious tale of pirates and a cabin boy who is swept into an underwater tunnel on Dead Chest Island. Is the tunnel really there and where does it lead? Edison and Jonathan concoct a crazy scheme to borrow a boat and search for the tunnel. Edisonâ€™s loudmouth sister is a vexing last-minute participant in the quest. They set off on a sunny Caribbean afternoon, planning to return in time for supper. But the motor sputters and dies, triggering an amazing chain of events. Find out how the three adventurers deal with a treacherous tidal wave, shadowy dolphinbots, puzzling petroglyphs, a mysterious crystal, and a seriously evil band of spies. Are you ready to expand your reading horizons beyond sorcerers and vampires? Dead Chest Island is perfect for adventurous girls, boys, and dolphins ages 8-12 who are fascinated by the \"secrets\" of science and the \"magic\" of technology.",
