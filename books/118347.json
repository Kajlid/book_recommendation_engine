  "description": "After years of feeling numb to the world, Ava is finally ready to move on with her life. A spontaneous trip to Thailand with her best friend, Olivia, goes horribly wrong when Ava is kidnapped and held against her will in a secluded house deep within the Thailand forest. Her only contact is with the Thai men that kidnapped her and the mysterious Australian man who insists she has information that he needs; information he will do anything to secure. Hayden knew from the moment he first met Ava that the assignment wasn’t as black and white as he had expected it to be. He’d been sent to Thailand to retrieve the information from a suspect linked to a known terrorist- Ava being that suspect. But Ava isn’t like any of the other suspects he’d dealt with before, and as every day passes, he continues to grow suspicious that there is more to the story than he is being led to believe. When Ava and Hayden are faced with the real possibility that the reason for her kidnapping goes beyond what either of them could have ever imagined, they must move past their differences and find a way to work together, if they want any hope and chance of survival.",
