  "description": "They were strangers in a seductive game of hide-and-seek.One by one, the women were disappearing. Each had been young, vulnerable...and each had been spending time on the Internet \"chatting\" with a mysteriousstranger. It was Carrie Blue's job to track down that stranger, to put herself on the Internet in the guise of a lonely young student, and to smoke out a cunningly seductive killer.But soon Carrie is drawn inexorably into a world where truth is indistinguishable from fiction, where fantasy and reality collide. It proves far more difficult than she ever could have imagined to resist the lure of a twisted mind--one that may already have figured out who Carrie is, and marked her as his next kill.",
