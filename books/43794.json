Intrigued by the teenager peering inside, Morgan wants to know more, and invites him inside, just to talk. This leads to dating and a decision to attend the Halloween dance at Anderson's school. Morgan uses his considerable talents to create authentic costumes for them both... but the night of the dance, a long-dead World War II ace pilot makes his presence known.",
