  "title": "The House with the Blind Glass Windows",
  "description": "Set in an isolated fishing village in northern Norway, this novel chronicles one year in the life of 11-year-old Tora. A tragic legacy of the German occupation, illegitimate Tora is a social outcast. Worse, Tora also has to cope with the fear of her brutish stepfather and his sexual assaults. She consoles herself with lonely fantasies about her real father, with books, and with the friendship and support of a few village women. This proletarian feminist novel is about the victimization of women, but also about women's solidarity and power. Awarded a coveted Nordic prize, this is the first volume of a trilogy.",
