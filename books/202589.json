  "description": "They say opposites attract. In my world that isn’t a good thing. I did everything I could to escape the grips of motorcycle club I grew up in when I turned twenty-one. It wasn’t about fear, or betrayal, or even lack of love. I just needed my own life. I had to know how it felt to stand on my own two feet without their protection. Then I met Diesel. Mysterious, dark, with eyes that screamed to be understood. From the second I met him, I knew I needed to be in his life. There’s just one problem – he’s a member of a different motorcycle club. Two things that should never be combined. Yet I can’t stay away. No matter how hard he pushes. I can see beyond his mask. I need to know who he is and I’ll overcome any obstacle to be in his life. A friendship is born, followed by an epic love. Our relationship is forbidden. But I’ll do anything to be in his life. Anything.",
