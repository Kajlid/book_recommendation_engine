  "description": "The centuries-old wisdom of the Tao, as told  through the profoundly wise and delightfully  entertaining illustrations of Tsai Chih Chung.In   The Tao Speaks , Tsai Chih Chung  brilliantly retells, through his enchanting and  irreverently humorous cartoon panels, the two  thousand-year-old text of Tao Te Ching ,  the inspiring classic upon which Taoism is  based.Attributed to the great Chinese philosopher  Lao-tzu, the Tao Te Ching has  attracted generations of followers from across the  world to its simple tenets of modesty, peace, and  realism. According to Lao-tzu, \"If we are at  peace with ourselves and the world around us,  success will come unsought.\" Advocating poise,  serenity, and complete assurance, Lao-tzu teaches  men and women to work with nature rather than resist  it.The Tao Speaks   offers the centuries-old wisdom of the Tao to modern  readers searching for new ways to bring meaning to  life. As with Tsai Chih Chung's previous books,  the original Chinese notes are contained in the  margins of each page as an aid to scholars and  Chinese-speaking readers.\"Tsai Chih  Chung's books are awe-inspiring. his line is elegant;  his characters are sharply drawn; his humor is sly  and appropriate; and his subject is profound. This  is cartooning of the highest order.\" -- Larry  Gonick, author of The Cartoon History Of  The Universe, Volumes I and II .",
