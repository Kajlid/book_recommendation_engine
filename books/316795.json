  "description": "Until a couple of days ago, my life was peaceful. Lonely and isolated - but peaceful. I did all the things an Earth Witch does while trying to avoid the past and not think much about the future: Bake cookies, plant flowers, hang out with Cheetoe, my feline familiar. Drink too much beer and wine.And then, she showed up. My worst nightmare wrapped in black wings and red lipstick. The Succubus.And for some reason, she has it out for me and my town.After a thorough thrashing from her leaves me bloody and unconscious, I wake up in the cabin at the end of the lane, staring into the blue eyes of my savior.And his super hot roommate. And his other hot roommate - that hates me for some reason. Oh, and his other hot roommate,Â  who eats more chips than anyone I've ever known. Just me, four hot guys, and my snarky cat......and more than a few dark secrets.",
