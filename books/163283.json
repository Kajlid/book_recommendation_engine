  "description": "Librarian note: the title of this book has been changed to Rebound Roommate (Men of Lake Tahoe Series #3)She was the girl I once tutored. The girl I watched from afar, and then one night she did the unimaginable and offered herself to me when I hadn't thought she noticed me that way. I felt like the luckiest bastard in the world. Until Mira Frasier betrayed me. I left for college in a rage that colored every relationship afterward. Now I'm back in Lake Tahoe, and Mira is still the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Except I know better. She's cold. A heartbreaker. And somehow I've gotten wrangled into living with her--the one person I never wanted to see again. Forced proximity has a way of breaking down barriers and revealing secrets. While the two of us are under the same damn roof, no place to hide, Mira's beautiful body and smart mouth taunt me on a daily basis. The only thing left to do is get her out of the house...or give in to the fire still burning between us and hope that this time I can walk away and forget her. \n**All books in the Blue Series are stand-alone stories that can be read in any order.**\nDeep Blue (Blue Series #1)-- Cali & Jaeger Blue Crush (Blue Series #2) -- Gen & LewisTrue Blue (Blue Series #3) -- Mira & TylerBlue Streak: A Blue Series Novella (Blue Series #4) -- Nessa & ZachNew Blue (Blue Series #5) -- Hayden & Adam",
