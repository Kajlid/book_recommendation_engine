  "title": "Why Believe?: A Reasoned Approach to Christianity",
  "description": "Chemist and Christian Apologist Neil Shenvi Explores the Evidence for Christianity For centuries, skeptics have disputed the claims of Christianity―such as belief in an eternal God and the resurrection of Jesus Christ―arguing that they simply cannot be accepted by reasonable individuals. Furthermore, efforts to demonstrate the evidence and rational basis for Christianity through apologetics are often deemed too simplistic to be taken seriously in intellectual circles. Apologist and theoretical chemist Neil Shenvi engages some of the best contemporary arguments against Christianity, presenting compelling evidence for the identity of Jesus as portrayed in the Gospels, his death and resurrection, the existence of God, and the unique message of the gospel.  Why Believe?  calls readers from all backgrounds not only to accept Christianity as true, but also to entrust their lives to Christ and worship him alone.",
