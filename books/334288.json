  "description": "Ryan is the love of Darcy’s life. He’s come a long way in learning how to give up control and trust, but he’s still holding onto the security of keeping his own place, which bothers Ryan. When Darcy’s brother Martin comes to visit, Darcy’s natural instinct is to bring his brother to his old apartment, instead of to the home he shares with Ryan. Ryan is hurt by this, thinking Darcy doesn’t really consider them life partners.Ryan is well aware that Darcy’s life circumstances have made him a natural Dom, and it’s for that reason, he’s reluctant to do any kind of sexual role play with him which would give Darcy the taste to dominate; although secretly, Ryan craves submission. When Ryan’s ex lover reappears, it rekindles his addiction, an addiction that went too far in the past. In his attempt to ensure that Darcy learns to trust, Ryan neglects his own sexual needs, which leads to circumstances which threaten to tear Ryan and Darcy apart for good.",
