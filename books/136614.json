In this makeshift office, he panhandles and dispenses his peerless wisdom. Well-educated, fiercely intelligent with a passionate interest in philosophy and a profound love of nature, Eddie is an enigma for the locals. Who is he? Where did he come from? What brought him to a life on the streets? Though rumors abound, none capture the unique worldview and singular character that led him to withdraw from the perfidy and corruption of human beings. Just as Eddie has decided to plan his return to society after nearly two decades on the streets, he encounters Jane, a kind woman whose intelligence and integrity rival his own. Jane makes it her mission to uncover the painful secrets of his past, to make him whole again. But will she heal Eddie or will he save her?A dizzying ride between past and present, The Oracle of Spring Garden Road is a tour de force of love, betrayal, tradition, the transformative beauty of nature, and the heavenly music of life.",
