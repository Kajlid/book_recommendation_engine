  "description": "With a head full of get-rich dreams and a business idea but no funding, Fran McBride embarks on a life-changing challenge. Immersed reluctantly into an equestrian life, Fran has to grasp the basics of not only how to care for a horse, but how to ride and jump. In fact, her very future depends on it! For a capable adult, just how difficult can that be? Maybe not so. For our super intelligent yet super un-coordinated Fran? Very bloody difficult. Will she make it? Will she get her desperately sought after investment?",
