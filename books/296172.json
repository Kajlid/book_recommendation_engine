A battle for the souls of the lost.And only The Landlord reserves the right to feed.Caught between a tortured past and his desperate vision for the future, Brask, too, comes face to face with a horrifying truth: Hell on earth can be exactly what you make of it.In Wistwood, bestselling author Jonathan Kieran crafts an atmospheric and terrifying tale of human culpability. By turns elegiac and raw, Kieran weaves an insinuating psychological tapestry threaded with lust, magic, murder, and a host of unforgettable characters. Wistwood is a dark fable certain to haunt readers long after the last core-shattering page has been read.",
