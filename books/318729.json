  "description": "What happens when a down-on-her-luck single mom meets not one, but two sexy saviors? Roommates with twice the benefits.Jess has one goal in life—protect her son. But when an overcrowded shelter puts her and Jasper out on the street in the dead of winter, she fears she's going to fail that mission. Help comes in the form of confirmed bachelors, Tony Moretti and Dr. Rhys Beaumont.Tony and Rhys share the same motto—work hard, play harder. But when fate drops a homeless waitress and her young son on their doorstep, their wild and free lifestyle takes a sharp turn. Their desire to help her is only surpassed by their desire to claim her, share her, make her theirs.When Tony and Rhys offer Jess a place to stay and security, there's no denying the chemistry between the three of them. All she has to do is let them in. But Jess isn’t willing to get hurt again . . . no matter how persuasive, how determined, how deliciously possessive her new roommates are.",
