  "description": "What if you were scarred and you didn't know why? What if your blood was the aphrodisiac of the underworld? What if your life line is not years but centuries and you couldn't remember any of it? You might not recall that you're seriously involved with a sexy and dangerous vampire(although really he's hard to forget). You might not know why his ex-girlfriend wants you dead, or why an attractive yet psychotic detective is out for your blood.But that's the pitfall of amnesia, I can't remember four years into my past let along four centuries. But I know this: my name is Zara, my blood is fire, and everyone's dying for a taste.",
