  "title": "Secrets of a Former Fat Girl: How to Lose Two, Four (or More!) Dress Sizes--And Find Yourself Along the Way",
  "description": "An inspiring account of one woman’s successful mission to lose six dress sizes and change her life for good  Any woman who’s ever been a “fat girl” knows: the label sticks in your mind, regardless of how much weight you lose. Twenty years ago, at 5'4\" and 185 pounds, Lisa Delaney was despondent over diets that never worked and disappointed by her dull job and lack of a love life. Fortunately, a late-night epiphany involving a half-gallon of mint chocolate chip ice cream convinced her that becoming a former fat girl—in body and spirit—was the key to creating a life she truly loved.  Today, seventy pounds lighter, Lisa is a successful writer at a national magazine. She is married to a man she loves. And she wears a size two.  Eye-opening yet refreshingly accessible, Secrets of a Former Fat Girl reveals the seven secrets of Delaney’s success, exploring how shifting from wannabe former fat girl to actual former fat girl is as much about seeing yourself as a confident, secure, desirable woman as it is about achieving an ideal weight. Featuring concrete advice to help readers drop two, four (or more!) dress sizes and re-imagine their own best lives, this book offers the strategies and support to help them effect real change once and for all.",
