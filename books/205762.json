  "description": "Ancient Egypt. A land divided. A nation plundered by usurping foreigners. And a family of true Egyptian blood determined to claim back their heritage. Seqenenra Tao, Prince of Weset, can trace his family's lineage back to the last true King of Egypt. When the Setiu usurper, King Apepa, demands that Seqenenra impoverishes his family, the Taos are forced to make a decision which will change their fates and Egypt's history forever. Choosing to fight rather than submit, Seqenenra raises an army and heads to a desperate battle on the plains of Egypt to reclaim his country. But battle is the least of the challenges he faces. From within his very own house, a traitor is waiting to strike.",
