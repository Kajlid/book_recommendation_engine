  "description": "Lilly Winters gave her virginity to Court Devlin—her brother’s best friend—at the age of eighteen. Losing it in the back of his pickup truck hadn’t been romantic, but it didn’t matter because she loved him. But afterward, Court distanced himself from her and Roan, and she knew it was because he felt like he betrayed her brother.Court Devlin is a bear shifter and a member of the Grizzly MC. After turning his back on the two people he cared about, he immersed himself in the biker life. The MC is violent and dangerous, but he embraces it.After Lilly is attacked, Court delivers retribution to the man that hurt her in the most grisly of ways. He realizes he can’t let Lilly go again, not when his bear has already claimed her.",
