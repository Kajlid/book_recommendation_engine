  "description": "The Hard Blokes might be going up in the world, but Dave suspects something sinister is about to go down.The Hard Blokes of Sparta are gaining a reputation as high-class adventures-for-hire, always willing to lend a magically-strengthened hand in the monster-slaying department…for a fair price, of course.When it becomes apparent an especially evil daemon has been engaged to slay the Hard Blokes, Dave decides the only sensible course of action is a pre-emptive strike.But taking on a daemon on their home turf was never going to be easy, especially when the daemon in question is horribly ancient, exceptionally sneaky, and addicted to stealing fragments of souls. And when you lose a part of your soul, it turns out that one thing it throws into question is your understanding of the past…Now everything Dave and his friends thought they knew seems uncertain, and the danger isn’t only the horrible monsters, but the Hard Blokes themselves…The second Hard Blokes of Sparta story is a stand-alone fantasy novel set in the mysterious and mutable magical world of Level 31.",
