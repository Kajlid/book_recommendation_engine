Then one afternoon he gets a phone call that suddenly brings him face to face with the worst tragedy of his life. But the human spirit does not destruct easily. It is resilient and tenacious. And asclose to going down as Dean is, he's determined to keep swinging until  the very end.If ever there has been a story to give voice to the joy and pain of love it's Forever Three--a stand-alone sequel to the internationally acclaimed bestseller Beyond Nostalgia.",
