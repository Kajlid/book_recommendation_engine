  "description": "Understand the social and historical significance of rock-and-roll Brief, authoritative, and current, Dave Szatmary's Rockin' in Time: A Social History of Rock-and-Roll, 8/e, weaves the major icons of rock-and-roll into a larger social/historical fabric. Rather than an exhaustive catalog of artists in rock history or a guide to learning musical notation, the book places rock-and-roll in the context of the social issues that surrounded and shaped it. Topics include the influence on rock music of such trends as the civil rights movement, political and economic shifts, demographical change and the baby boom, the development of the music business, and technology advances.
