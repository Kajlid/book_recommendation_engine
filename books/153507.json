  "description": "The truck should have flattened Libbi into a pancake, but a mysterious boy named Aaron saved her life. The problem? Aaron’s the local Grim Reaper. The bigger problem? He saved her so he could ask her to take over his job. Now, Libbi has just days to choose between dying like she was supposed to or living a lonely life as Death Incarnate. The choice only gets harder when she learns Aaron’s reasons for wanting out of the whole morbid business. Basically, his job is beyond terrible.Still, when Aaron looks at her, there’s something more in his eyes. Something sinister, dark and secret. Something he’s hiding. Libbi will be damned if she’ll die without figuring it out. And she’ll be damned if she takes over as Reaper and lets him go.",
