  "title": "A Little Gay History: Desire and Diversity Across the World",
  "description": "When was the first chat line between men established? Who was the first \"lesbian\"? Were ancient Greek men who had sex with each other necessarily \"gay,\" and what did Shakespeare think about crossdressing?\"A Little Gay History\" answers these questions and more through close readings of art objects from the British Museum's far-ranging collection. Consulting ancient Egyptian papyri, the Roman Warren Cup's erotic figures, David Hockney's vivid prints, and dozens of other artifacts, R. B. Parkinson draws attention to a diverse range of same-sex experiences and situates them within specific historical and cultural contexts. The first of its kind, \"A Little Gay History\" builds a complex and creative portrait of love's many guises.",
