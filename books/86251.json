  "description": "Ned needs to get the hell out of Binnara Point. He can feel himself slowly sliding into the abyss of small town obscurity while his family rot contentedly in front of the TV. In an attempt to salvage his future, Ned accompanies a pair of school chums on a debaucherous trans-continental jaunt. With the help of his friends, a misunderstood neighbour, some peyote and a time-machine Ned takes the first steps toward his salvation, learning along the way never to trust a stripper, to always question a threesome, never to drink from a plastic bag and to always take your chances.",
