  "description": "This is the autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, translated to Telugu, an Indian language.What I want to achieve- what I have been striving and pining to achieve these thirty years- is self-realization, to see god face to face, to attain moksha.In this classic autobiography, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi recounts the story of his life, entwining memories of his childhood, marriage, experiences in South Africa and later with the freedom movement, with his constant struggle to attain absolute truth and his quest to be one with god.Narrated in Gandhi's simplistic prose, An Autobiography is a glimpse into the life and mind of the man who would lead his country to freedom and be hailed as the greatest figure of the twentieth century.",
