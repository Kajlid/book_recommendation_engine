  "description": "The world teaches us that if something has no value to us, it’s easier to throw it away without any attempts of repair. My dual mission has been to use my voice and experience to end throwaway culture, but also keep white women accountable by helping them see how unchecked privilege and relationships with power, privilege, and oppression affects the mental health of black and Indigenous women of color.   What many well-meaning co-conspirators don’t realize is that starting the journey into anti-racism requires a deep examination into the self. A journey similar to the hero's journey, it allows you to deeply uncover the roots of who you are in hopes of showing up differently in the world. The hero's journey in ancestor culture often involves fables of a hero who goes on an adventure, struggles through existential crisis overcomes the crisis, and returns to victory all to begin a journey again.  Through shared storytelling, these 5 friends share their most vulnerable journeys on how they are taking co-conspired action together.",
