  "description": "Welcome to the Rust Valley.  The Wild North is full of nasty places, but there are some places you just don’t go. One of them is that scrapyard desert known as the Rust Valley. It’s where vehicles go to die. That’s why you don’t go in after them.  The bounty hunter Nox made a promise to himself that he’d never be caught dead there. Yet, when a couple of kids end up wandering inside that metal maze, he finds himself with no other choice.  He decks himself out in his finest armour. He’ll need it. That land is where the rust-covered Clockwork Commune live, and if they don’t scavenge the metal off you, they’ll scavenge the flesh instead.  Nox is used to being called the Coilhunter, but this time he’s saddling up with a new, more fitting title: the Rustkiller.  This is a standalone book in the Coilhunter Chronicles series, which can be read in any order.",
