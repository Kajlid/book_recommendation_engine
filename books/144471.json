I urge you to read book one, Anonymously Yours, before reading this book. **This book been recently updated and edited**This book is recommended for mature audiences 18+ due to sexual content, language, and a demanding alpha male.It has all been a complete lie.I thought he was the real deal. He made my toes curl and for the first time ever, I'd found that special \"O\" I've been missing in my life. He was damn good at giving me those impressive O's.His lies tore that all apart. I refuse to let his betrayal ruin all the things I've worked so hard for. Screw Him! I deserve better, and I would get it to if he would leave me alone. Daemon didn't become the ruthless business man he is by letting go of the things he wants... And he wants me.If I can survive the next few weeks working with him, I will be completely free from him. It's a deal we made and one I plan on making him keep. Sounds easy doesn't it? Well, its not. When Daemon wants something bad enough, he plays dirty..he plays with my emotions, he plays with my body and worst of all, he plays for keeps.",
