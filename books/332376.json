  "description": "Life has never been easy for Raven, and she liked it that way. Keeping things interesting was her motto. Once a Dark Guardian Raven is now a VC Warrior who feels caught between two worlds. Her loyalty to both was sometimes an inner battle within herself.Being a woman in a man’s world she’s had to battle harder, be smarter and never play the woman card she had turned in so many years ago. Once again, she finds herself fighting for her place and once again, she walks alone in that fight. Respect wasn’t something given to Raven, it was earned daily, and she was fine with that. It was all she knew.A secret from Raven’s past has turned her world upside down. There were things Raven could forgive, but Charger McNeil’s betrayal wasn’t one of them. He had crushed the guarded heart she freely gave him more times than she could count, and this time was one too many. Knowing what she must do Raven faces her demons alone as she tries to forget Charger ever existed in her world. What she doesn’t realize is that this will be her biggest battle.",
