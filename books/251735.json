I never want to be anywhere else.  My whole world has changed. She is my whole world.  I'm not sure how to be me again. I've never felt more like myself.  I've never needed anyone, but I need him. I love her. I'll always love her.  But is our love enough? Can Levi and I really survive this? Together, Ivy and I can survive anything.",
