  "title": "On Fire Island",
  "description": "A book editor spends one last summer on Fire Island in this sparkling and surprising new novel from the author of A Shoe Story.As a book editor, Julia Morse lived and breathed stories. Whether with her pen to a manuscript or curled up with a book while at her beloved Fire Island cottage, her imagination alight with a good tale, she could anticipate practically any ending. The ending she'd never imagined was her own.To be fair, no one expects to die at thirty-seven. So when the unthinkable happens to Julia, rather than following the light at the end of the proverbial tunnel, she chooses to spend one last summer near those she loves most.As she follows her adoring, novelist husband Ben to their--unexpectedly full--home on Fire Island, she discovers the ripple affect her life has had on the trajectory of so many: her baseball loving, young-at-heart neighbor who believes it's best not to go it alone, two bright-eyed teenagers eager to become adults, and her best friend who must shake off heartbreak for a new chance at love.With poignant comedy and insight, On Fire Island is an ode to the stories all around us and to the brightest types of loves...for the people closest to you and the places that shape you.",
