  "description": "Though technically a novel, Night is also an unmistakably autobiographical depiction of the author's own gruesome experiences in Nazi Germany's death camps. Told through the eyes of 14-year-old Eliezer, the tragic fate of the Jews from the little town of Sighet unfolds with a heart-wrenching inecitability. Even as they are stuffed into cattle cars bound for Auschwitz, the townspeople refuse to believe rumors of anti-Semitic atrocities. Not until they are marched toward the blazing crematory at the camp's \"receptions center\" does the terrible truth sink in.Recounting the evils at Auschwitz and Buchenwald, Wiesel's enduring classic of Holocaust literature raises question of continuing significance for all future generations: How could man commit these horrors, and could such crimes against humanity ever be repeated?An unabridged production on 4 CDs (4 hours).",
