  "description": "MYSTERY, ROMANCE, AND MAGICK COLLIDE WHEN LONG-LOST TWINS ARE REUNITED.Thais Allard:I hate New Orleans. I hate Axelle, the guardian who popped up out of nowhere when my dad died. I hate everything about my new life, including the fact that I have to start a brand-new high school for my senior year. I feel like I'm standing on the edge of a cliff, and something huge is about to push me off, down into an unknown world. And what will I find there? Myself? Or worse - the truth about my past?Clio Martin:Today when I went to school, there was another me there. A Northern me with a different name, but still me - black hair, green eyes, and an identical birthmark on her cheekbone. A simple separated-at-birth story? Oh no - the truth is much more bizarre, much darker than that. And following the truth to its source will bring our family together, split our family up, and lead me to falling in love with someone I thought I hated.",
