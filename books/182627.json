  "title": "Japan Is Not Flat Like Its Girls: 46 Days Pushing Across The Country",
  "description": "Author watches seasons of Man vs. Wild and Forest Gump in Japanese until enough is enough, and he quits his job. He’s going to begin at the top of Japan and start skating south, following the ocean and a long trail of 7-Elevens. He’ll encounter wild animals and camp in a graveyard. He’ll make friends along the way and a new grandmother. Up and over never-ending mountains, Elliot faces many challenges, swollen ankles and 46 days of rising suns. With his skateboard he will reach and fall at new speeds. His tan will be golden and his chastity belt tight. The rice will be plenty and the holes in his shoes many. But he will not be a chicken. Japan will be crossed, from Hokkaido to Okinawa.",
