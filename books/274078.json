  "description": "Max Wainwright's life has been filled with difficult choices, dating back to his rough upbringing in England, a life he left long ago. But as tough as some of those choices have been, he has never regretted making a single one of them – with the exception of the one he made several years ago during a business trip to Seattle. Walking away from the only woman he's ever really cared about continues to be the biggest regret of his life – the only regret. Jill Parrish was young, naïve, and impressionable when she first met and fell head over heels in love with the handsome, enigmatic Max Wainwright. She innocently believed their passionate affair would last forever, and that she had met the love of her life. But when he left her without a backwards glance, her heart and spirit were irrevocably broken, and she feared she would never be whole again. When Max and Jill meet again by chance, she's finally managed to move on, and is even contemplating an engagement to another man. Will Max find a way to overcome his deep-seated emotional issues and finally claim the only woman he's ever loved? Or will he risk losing Jill forever, and regretting it for the rest of his life?",
