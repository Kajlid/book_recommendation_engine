  "description": "NyAshia (Swahili for Beautiful African Princess of Purpose) herself is a 7yr old African-American girl who has locs, glasses and a dark complexion. She enters her dream a bit discouraged and tired of being teased by other kids. Join NyAshia as she travels through dreamland on a journey to learning her African Heritage, self-awareness and freedom. NyAshia learns that there are no limits to what she can do in life after meeting such leaders as Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. & President Barack Obama. NyAshia's Freedom Ride is inspiring little girls of color to love and accept everything about themselves--from the color of their skin, the texture of their hair to the rich heritage of which they belong. The whimsical, vibrant, eye-catching illustrations of Eman L. Faulkner bring this story to life! This book is a gem filled with the belief that all things are possible and even has a not so hidden lesson on the meaning of a name. Hurry! Hurry! You don t want to miss this Freedom Ride!",
