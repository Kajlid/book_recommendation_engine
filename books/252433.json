  "description": "Ridley Pierce doesn't believe in justice.  She didn't find any when she was a child, and nothing she's seen since has changed her mind. She makes her home as far away from her dark past as she could find, spending her days restoring motorcycles and her nights handing out her own brand of justice to abused women, using her powers on the people who aren't big enough villains for the Legion of the Guards to worry about.  When a team from the Legion interrupts her take down of an abusive creep masquerading as a hero and arrests her, she's thrust into the world she's long avoided. A world of heroes and villains.  Ridley has no interest in being a hero or joining the Legion.  But the villain the team is after is just the sort of scumbag she loves to take down and the four guys after him want her help.  She has to decide if she's ready to step out of her shadows and nightmares or remain trapped by her past.",
