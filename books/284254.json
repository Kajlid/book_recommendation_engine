  "description": "s/t: : Princess and the Goblin, Princess and Curdie, Light Princess, Phantastes, Giant's Heart, At the Back of the North Wind, Golden Key, and LilithThis enchanted collection brings together eight of George McDonald's most well known fantasies into one delightful volume. The George McDonald Treasury includes The Princess and the Goblin, The Princess and Curdie, The Light Princess, Phantastes, The Giant's Heart, At the Back of the North Wind, The Golden Key, and Lilith. MacDonald's classic works have inspired deep admiration in such notables as J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, G. K. Chesterton, Elizabeth Yates, and Lewis Carroll. C. S. Lewis wrote, \"I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master; indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.\" One day while in a train station, he picked up a copy of Phantastes and began to read. \"A few hours later,\" said Lewis, \"I knew I had crossed a great frontier.\" G. K. Chesterton cited The Princess and the Goblin as a book that had \"made a difference to my whole existence.\" Madeleine L'Engle wrote, \"Surely George MacDonald is the grandfather of us all-all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.\" If you loved J. R. R. Tolkien's Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, you will love the works of his hero and model - George McDonald.",
