  "description": "Since the times of magic, Bob Conner’s WWII fighter plane was as close as he could get to dancing among the clouds and nestling in the shoulders of his mighty emerald dragon. It had been thousands of years since the magic was buried deep within the Earth to protect it from mankind. Now the world has changed forever as it has been rediscovered, and once again brought to the Earth’s surface. Now that the magic has been released, it is up to those few elves and dwarfs that have stayed behind to put things back. With the help of three special women and a small air force of vintage aircraft, this courageous group battles the darkness and it is the light that ushers in a whole new age of enchantment.",
