  "description": "Night and Day, Virginia Woolf's second novel, although traditional in form, displays the preoccupations and largeness of ambition which portend the mature novelist. As her impulsive aspiring quartet try to escape the conventions of society in search of their true selves, Virginia Woolf paints an unforgettable picture of the intellectual aristocrats of pre-1914 London.",
