  "description": "La Vie en ChocolatDominique Richard's reputation says it all—wild past, wilder flavors, black leather and smoldering heat. Jaime Corey is hardly the first woman to be drawn to all that dark, delicious danger. Sitting in Dom's opulent chocolaterie in Paris day after day, she lets his decadent creations restore her weary body and spirit, understanding that the man himself is entirely beyond her grasp.Until he touches her. . .Chocolate, Dominique understands—from the biting tang of lime-caramel to the most complex infusions of jasmine, lemon-thyme, and cayenne. But this shy, freckled American who sits alone in his salon, quietly sampling his exquisite confections as if she can't get enough of them—enough of him—is something else. She has secrets too, he can tell. Of course if she really knew him, she would run.Yet once you have spotted your heart's true craving, simply looking is no longer enough. . .",
