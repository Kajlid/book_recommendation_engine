  "title": "The Moon and the Virgin: Reflections on the Archetypal Feminine",
  "description": "Nor Hall writes with a strikingly original perspective on women in myth and literature, examining and giving new meaning to the underlying archetypes. She explores such principles as androgyny and virginity, freeing them from the limited social context in which we have trapped them, and argues the necessity of feminine rituals in history. In her search for the original forms of the feminine, Hall guides us on a journey though myths and symbols, confronting them not in the rational mode of the language itself, but on the deeper level of the unconscious life.",
