  "description": "“An Historically Correct Novel telling the Otago Pioneer Gold Story”This historical novel picks up the Otago story from where Oatcakes to Otago finished; with the discovery of gold in Central Otago. Thousands of men and a few hardy women gave up what they were doing in California, Canton, Victoria and Dunedin and went into The Interior to make their fortune.While the McDonald family is imaginary, but representative of real characters in the true Otago story, nearly all the situations they encounter are historically correct. It is a story of the courage, perseverance and independence of the Otago pioneer character, forged in the extreme conditions of climate and deprivation.The survivors of this struggle became our great-grand-parents, so that we could become New Zealanders. This is their story.Donald Offwood is a direct descendant of the first settlers in Otago, was born in Invercargill and lived for some years in Dunedin. His great-grandfather was a gold miner.Donald is a retired Air New Zealand International captain whose previous book Oatcakes to Otago tells the story of the Scottish emigration to Otago. It is in its third print.",
