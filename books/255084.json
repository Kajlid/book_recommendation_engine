  "description": "Two Worlds. Dark Magic Rising. The End Game.   Why is it always in the middle of the night? The call came in, an old friend, a harrowing problem and a fight to the death, literally. Then I found myself on a breakneck journey to a place I’d hoped I’d never have to see again. And that was before the real fireworks began.    Next up on the rollercoaster ride to hell; secret meetings, an occult hideout, and an army of the most sinister evil imaginable. And the battle to end all battles.   That was in this world, and it had nothing on what I was about to face in the next as I pursued my final enemy into the blackest of nights.  The Shadow Rises is the fifth and ultimate Morgan Rook novel in the The Order of Shadows series. If you love supernatural thrillers, high octane action and gritty magical adventures, then you’ll love this new book from Kit Hallows, author of Urban Fantasy books with teeth!
