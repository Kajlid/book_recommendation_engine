  "description": "Ai, Koi, and Ren are cupids-in-training. They work hard every day, matchmaking and collecting points so they can become angels. But as everybody knows, the course of true love never runs smoothly, and thatâ€™s especially true with this trio of well-meaning but bumbling wannabes. Published in authentic Japanese right-to-left format with a full-color insert, this manga is aimed at younger readers but has enough charm and wit to interest a mature audience as well.",
