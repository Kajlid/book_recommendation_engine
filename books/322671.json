Their mother perished in a car crash, and Sage’s stepfather, Alan, resents being burdened by a responsibility he never wanted.

She was committed to Willowbrook State School and has lingered there until just a few days ago, when she went missing.Sage knows little about Willowbrook. It’s always been a place shrouded by rumor and mystery. A place local parents threaten to send misbehaving kids. With no idea what to expect, Sage secretly sets out for Willowbrook, determined to find Rosemary. What she learns, once she steps through its doors and is mistakenly believed to be her sister, will change her life in ways she never could imagined . . .",
