  "title": "Carving a Sky: A Perspective on Life",
  "description": "It is human nature to strive for excellence. But how does one reach a state of excellence characterized by unlimited freedom and limitless space? How does one carve out a sky for oneself? Carving a Sky by Samarpan, monk–teacher and bestselling author of Tiya: A Parrot’s Journey Home, explores the nature of space in life. Written as a travelogue, it is the story of Arpo, an upwardly mobile young manager, who meets a monk on the Upasana Express. As they travel from Kolkata to Haridwar, the monk expounds on life through its five aspects: existence, strength, growth, freedom and space. Their conversation and this book—delves deep into Hindu scriptures to offer an alternative philosophy of life rooted in an inclusive, accepting love for all, a love that is not circumscribed by exclusive affection for a few. Evocative, expansive and intensely spiritual, Carving a Sky will be an invaluable companion in one’s life’s journey.",
