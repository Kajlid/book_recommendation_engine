  "description": "For months, I've been chased by a red dragon. They're the females of the dragon shifter invaders, fierce and vicious and as ruthless as they are wild. She hunts me wherever I go, and I'm not safe even behind the walls of a fort. There's only one thing I can do to stop her…  …And that's to take her as my mate.  But to win the heart of a female dragon, I have to conquer her first. Not so easy for a human man...but Teva's worth the challenge.",
