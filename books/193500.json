  "description": "\"I've always wanted to go to Japan.\" For over twenty years this mantra was uttered after every Kurasawa movie, during every Japanese dinner and upon returning home after every holiday. Until finally, one evening after watching the classic Japanese movie Tampopo, something happened. As the movie drew to an end he turned to his wife and sighed deeply. \"I've always wanted to go to Japan....\" Much to his surprise, she replied \"So let's go!\" His 50th birthday was looming on the horizon and it seemed like the perfect time to buy some extra-legroom seats on a plane, spread their wings and fly away. After joining up with a small band of fellow adventurers, two British-Canadians headed off to the land of the rising sun to experience the delights of bullet trains, bento boxes, communal baths and eating pancakes on Mount Fuji. Told with gentle humour, this is the story of their trip to Tokyo, Takayama, Kanazawa, Kyoto, Hiroshima, Miyajima and Kawaguchiko. Grab a pot of green tea or a bottle of sake, curl up in your favourite armchair and experience the journey for yourself from the comfort of your own home. Beautiful photographs in every chapter will help guide you on your way, and at the end you will find yourself sighing \"I want to go to Japan.\"",
