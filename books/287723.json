  "title": "Double Deception",
  "description": "If you had an identical twin, would you ever choose to switch places without anyone knowing?  Kari Clark finds herself in a complicated predicament after she reluctantly agrees to go on a date and pretend she's her identical twin sister, Cassie. Jarod Drake falls in love with her, all the while thinking she's her twin. How will Kari get out of this quandary, especially when she would like nothing more than to be dating Jarod Drake herself?  Double Deception is a clean romance that explores the complexity of jumbled, mixed-up love.  A true romance must come from the heart, a trait that author Ruth Davidson has no shortage of. Her style of writing is largely inspired by Jane Austen, considering her to be the first true romance author, and also Hallmark, believing that beauty is in its simplicity. Ruth's catchphrase for her books is \"clean romance that leaves a smile in your heart,\" and she fully commits to that ideal whenever she puts pen to paper.
