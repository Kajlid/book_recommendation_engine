  "title": "The Normans in the South",
  "description": "The Normans in the South is the first of two volumes that recount the dazzling story of the Norman Kingdom of Sicily. It is the story of Robert Guiscard who was perhaps the most extraordinary European adventurer between Caesar and Napoleon. In one year, 1084, he had both the Eastern and Western Emperors retreating before him and one of the most formidable of medieval Popes in his power. The Normans in the South details the creation of a cosmopolitan kingdom whose remaining monuments still dazzle us today.",
