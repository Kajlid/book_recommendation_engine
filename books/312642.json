  "description": "Kane Easton isn’t friend material. He’s a master manipulator. No one understands why I give him such a hard time. They can’t see past his flawless exterior, but I know he’s keeping a secret—something he’ll protect with absolute ruthlessness. He thinks I’ll fall in line with the rest of Xavier High. Believes he can kiss me into submission. He has no idea what he’s up against. I may be the youngest Genovese, but I’ve learned from my family. I’ll make Kane regret the day he ever crossed my path. Perfect Enemies is the sixth and final book in The Five Families series but can be read as a standalone novel.",
