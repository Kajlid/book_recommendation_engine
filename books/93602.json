She thinks she is witnessing an accidental drowning at an open water swim. What else could it be? An elite athlete doesn’t sprint away from the pack, stop, never to move again. But then, a week later, another swimmer known more for her beauty than athletic ability drives her car off a 20-foot cliff into the Pacific Ocean.Only Trisha believes the accidents aren’t so accidental. Naively she asks too many questions to precisely the wrong people. Her suspicions are dismissed by friends and family. But her inquiries continue and lead to an expanding web of intrigue, revenge and danger.",
