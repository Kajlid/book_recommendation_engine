  "title": "Mythbusting the Cult of Confucius: What the Chinese Really Are, How to Understand Them and Why We Need to",
  "description": "China is ever-more important to western countries, yet remains shrouded in myth. This book is the first to part those myths and demystify the realities of Chinese ways. Western people need to know because Chinese traits and values, combined with China's modern power, now literally affect all. This book examines the ancient origins of Chinese thinking in Confucianism and consequences for the modern world: it is especially relevant to business and government relations with China, also to educational and immigration issues. Yet it contains far more than warnings alone. Above all, it shows ways western people might learn from Chinese people, and to compassionately help them break free of their past.",
