  "title": "52 Weeks: Expecting: A Daily Devotional Guide to Get Closer to GOD",
  "description": "52 WEEKS, the series, is a collection of books to promote daily devotion to God. Although each book has a specific theme to tie the weeks together, the daily content is very general and guides you through 52 weeks of devotion to God. This book series is for the male, female, single, married, divorced, or uncertain. All of the topics are relevant to all people.  The first installation is entitled, \"52 Weeks: Expecting.\" The term “expecting” generally refers to someone that is pregnant and planning to give birth soon. This book is not about pregnancy. It is about the spirituality of expectation. This book is a preparation tool for anyone that is planning to walk into newness. If you are planning to walk into parenthood, by any means, adoption, childbirth, stepchildren, foster children, or if you are simply anticipating that one of these may be in your future, then you are expecting. If you are waiting for God to change you and make your mind brand new, then you are expecting and this book is for you.  Each week includes an introductory paragraph regarding a particular topic and each day starts with a short scriptural passage to guide your daily devotion. Following each scripture, you will find a few blank lines. These lines are for jotting down any thoughts, questions, or reminders for your prayers. I encourage you to purchase a small notebook for expanded journaling. This is a circular study, which means you can revisit this devotional at any time and grow each time you work through the scriptures.  Take a journey with millions of people across the world as we dedicate ourselves to daily devotion to God. Join us as we become better people and build better relationships. #devote52weeks",
