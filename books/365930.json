  "title": "Buffalo Coat",
  "description": "Originally published in 1944, Buffalo Coat spent several weeks on the New York Times bestseller list. The first adult novel written by acclaimed Idaho writer Carol Ryrie Brink, winner of the Newbery Award for the outstanding book of children's literature in 1936, Buffalo Coat has become a classic of Northwest literature. It tells the tale of three doctors who came to Opportunity (Moscow), Idaho, in the 1890s seeking success and fortune in the town with the promising name. At first all attained their private objectives and financial success, symbolized by owning a great buffalo coat to wear through the bitter winters. Then one by one, each of their lives ended in tragedy. Noted for her human insight and succinct storytelling, Brink's Buffalo Coat was perhaps her finest novel, the first in a trilogy about northern Idaho and eastern Washington that also includes Strangers in the Forest and Snow in the River.",
