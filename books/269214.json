  "description": "My life is my job. It’s all I need. Or so I thought. Everyone around me assumes I’m arrogant and cold-hearted, but it’s a persona. One that keeps me safe in LA. I might be at the top, but looking around, it’s lonely as hell. Not that I’d ever utter those words out loud. Not a chance. And women come and go like the wind. None of them are looking for real love. Until her. A new PR agent that I wasn’t expecting to like at all. But she shakes me to the core of my being, wakes me up, and forces me to feel things I thought were long gone. I only have one rule–never get involved with anyone in the business. Now I just need to convince her of that.",
