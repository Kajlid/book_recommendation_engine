  "description": "Can you really be in love with two people at the same time? 17-year-old, Punekar Sujay is a simple, religious guy who belongs to a family for whom prestige and one's image in the society are of utmost importance. For his orthodox family, concepts like love, attraction and (god forbid!) girlfriends do not exist; there are only arranged marriages because your family knows best. And so all his life, Sujay has believed that love doesn't strike you as a teenager. But when an unusual misfortune brings spunky and quirky Gunjan into Sujay's life, he has no idea how amazingly complicated his life is going to get; because his mother has already promised him to be wed to the sundar and susheel Jyoti. Every time Sujay tries to make a decision, he can't, because he really is in love with both Gunjan and Jyoti. And that is not how life functions - certainly not his family. Will he be able to get out of this mess? Or will the mess really take over his life? Only time can tell. Bachelor'$ Marriage is a story about love, friendship, family and what it means to really grow up.",
