But none of them knows the real Tommy—the one with a shocking pedigree, a few too many secrets, and a healthy scorn for rakes like Jonathan.She is everything Jonathan never wanted.

And suddenly he’s re-thinking everything...including the possibility that succumbing to prophesy might just mean surrendering to love.",
