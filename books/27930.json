  "description": "As the world battles the greatest evil of the century, once more American lives are jeopardized and Christian ideals put to the test. They who endure will be the Victors.After three centuries, the Morgan family’s spiritual heritage is waning. Gone are the days when Morgans struggled against religious persecution, carved civilization out of the wilderness, and fought to defeat slavery. Now, as the Nazi menace engulfs Europe and Japanese militarism threatens the Pacific, the four young adult children of Johnny and Laura Morgan show small concern. Preoccupied with big bands, movies, radio, and sports, they care little about spiritual things.When a family reunion in San Diego is disrupted by news of Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor, Johnny and Laura’s efforts to rekindle their children’s interest in their roots are seemingly smothered. Within months, Alexandra, Walt, Nat, and Lily are scattered abroad, placed in situations that test their faith and endanger their lives.On the homefront, Johnny and Laura face rationing and threats of Japanese invasion. Then, like the Old Testament account of Job, come four messages bearing ill tidings about the fate of their children. Shaken by the news, Johnny and Laura are confronted by the possible extinction of an entire generation. With nowhere else to turn but God, they discover that in the blackest night His light shines brightest.",
