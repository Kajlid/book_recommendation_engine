  "description": "Abandoned . . . again! Waggit misses the team of dogs who live in Central Parkâ€”his real family. He should have listened to them and never trusted the human. Now she's brought him to a faraway place and left him there. But Waggit is determined to find his way back home and nothing is going to stop him . . . not chains, not cruel enemies, not anything. When Waggit comes face-to-face with a very unusual human and an unlikely ally, he must decide if he can trust his instincts and his heart one more time. The long journey may lead him to the park, but what if it isn't home anymore? In this sequel to Waggit's Tale , Peter Howe continues the exciting story of a young dog who finds what he needs to survive in the most unexpected places.",
