  "title": "Answered with Math: Cool problems solved with math and physics",
  "description": "Have you ever wondered if we can blow up the Moon? What about why 72 divided by an investment's interest rate gives you the investment's doubling time? We can answer questions like that with a bit of pretty simple math and physics. This book is a collection of solutions to problems like that. I go through enough of the math that you should be able to follow along, but this isn't as detailed as a textbook. Most problems are covered in one to two pages. My goal is to give a glimpse of how powerful math can be to people who are interested but don't think about it all the time. If you enjoy questions like the two I asked above and you were able to understand most of your high school math, you'll probably enjoy this book. The best description I can think of is that it's kind of like Randall Munroe's 'What If?' except that he's a better writer than I am and this has more math in it.",
