  "description": "The ruggedly handsome Lt. William Marshall of His Majesty's Navy carries a secret close to his heart, one that is more important than either his loyalty to England or his devotion to duty. His shipmate, Lt. David Archer, is not only his best friend, he's been his lover for over a year. The penalty should their relationship be discovered? Death, by hanging. Both men control their passions and exercise discretion aboard ship as best they can, but the ship's quarters are close, shore leave is infrequent, and in the military. . .nothing is permanent. A transfer to a new ship leads to danger as Will and David are caught in a web of intrigue. Ordered to masquerade as lovers in order to flush out and help capture a saboteur who is known to use blackmail to achieve his ends, they face possible discovery of the truth. Then a murder attempt leaves Davy near death while Will is sent off, without knowing his lover's fate, to command a captured French vessel. Will and David have always known the risks, known that death might take either of them at any time. Their chances of staying together were never high...could it be that their luck has finally run out?",
