  "description": "Just before the American President is scheduled to appear in Sam Moore's hometown of East Goodland, Sam's retirement plans are pushed back when his daughter, Beth, goes missing. In his search for Beth, Sam is guided by an unusual talisman-a small green marble-that reveals a perplexing link between Beth and her mysterious roommate, Zafina Azziz. Who is the real Zafina? Med student, loving friend, Egyptian royal-or a keeper of deadly secrets? Is she involved with a group of suspicious students from the Middle East? And does Zafina know where Beth is? Meanwhile, Sam's friend Senator MacDonald is tapped for the Presidential nomination, and his small town goes berserk, both with the news and in preparation for a Presidential appearance at the new arts center gala. That's when Sam discovers that someone is out to destroy the President-and that someone is hiding in East Goodland. \"A keeper! This is a story you will want to read more than once to pick up stray bits of the story you may miss on the first reading. You'll want to read all of talented author Aaron Paul Lazar's books. Lots of excitement in all of them and you'll come to think of the characters as old friends you'll enjoy visiting with again and again.\" Anne K. Edwards, author of Shadows Over Paradise",
