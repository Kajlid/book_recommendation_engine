  "description": "Back in Miztli’s village, his family was worried, wondering about him and his life, concerned for his wellbeing. To send him word or hope to receive word back cost more than the simple miners could afford. However, the news, when received, was anything but favorable. Chantli’s father had nothing good to say about his former apprentice, and was not above claiming bad behavior and damage caused, hinting that the boy was an outlaw now, entangled with the criminal elements of the Great Capital.  Elotl, Miztli’s older brother and a restless troublemaker, bored and resenting his villager’s life anyway, refused to believe the rumors, and when the opportunity to sneak away and head for the distant capital of the Aztecs presented itself, he grabbed it with both hands, not prepared for the impact the Great Capital would have on him, or the challenges it would readily hurl his way.  In the meanwhile, the southern valleys to the west of Miztli’s original village managed to awake Tenochtitlan interest. The brewing war between local powers resulted in a plea for help that the Aztec Capital received favorably. Miztli’s knowledge of southern tongues, brought to the Emperor’s attention by the irrepressible Ahuitzotl, had him embroidered in the spying business once again. A seemingly simple mission of eavesdropping on the foreign delegation inside Tenochtitlan Palace turned out to be a whirlwind of dangers when gone out of hand, having him fighting or fleeing most unexpected surroundings, the imperial zoo full of caged jaguars and pumas being only one of the bizarre locations.",
