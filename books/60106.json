  "description": "THE STREETS OF OUR Can you remember a time before video games? A time where kids were forced to use their I-Maginations instead of their i-Pads? Where \"Tribes\" were formed and innocence was lost? Where growing up and growing strong was not just for the body, but also for the spirit? The Streets of our Youth follows the hilarious and often embarrassing adventures of Richey Storm and the Draden Tribe, a club of ten-to fourteen-year-old boys caught up in the tumultuous times of the sixties, just trying to get from one day to the next. The story begins on November 22, 1963. President Kennedy has just been shot and the Draden Tribe is faced with a weekend without television. As we follow their exploits, we are transported back to a time before 500 channels, DVRs, laptops and zombie-zapping video games, when young boys and girls fended for themselves. They lived life to the fullest using ingenuity and creativity to invent magical worlds and dangerous excursions while shaping the hopes and dreams of a generation.",
