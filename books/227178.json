  "description": "Floetry \"flowing like poetry\" 1438200269 Floetry is a Collection of short stories and poetry. Some of the poems are about everyday life, love, and experiences. While the short stories seem to took on a life all their own as soon as the pen hit the page. Then there are time when I see something of beauty so I write about it, other times it's a feeling or something passionate and I write about it, but most of the time I hear it, and it's like something needs to be said and I have to write about it. All of which I've collected here to share with you. \"Enjoy them as much as I have enjoyed writing them!\"",
