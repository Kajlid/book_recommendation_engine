Especially if that war comes in the form of a mostly naked man and he just happens to be one of the most powerful beings in the city.And your ex.Another unfortunate truth: No matter how poorly things ended, you’re going to wind up scraping him up off the cement and dragging him in off your doorstep. And, of course, that’s when the real trouble begins.",
