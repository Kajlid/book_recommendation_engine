  "description": "London is burning, and the fae are holding the matches.   I am Cassandra Liddell: FBI Special Agent and bad-ass Pixie. After barely surviving my last assignment, I'm on the hunt for answers about my past, when bombs start exploding all over London. Fae terrorists have attacked and thrown the city into chaos.  To make matters worse, my best friend Scarlett has been abducted, and her captor is playing a twisted game of “Simon Says,\" sending me riddles paired with impossible tasks. Roan, a seductive fae warrior, is willing to help me … but of course he has a price. One I’m not sure I’m willing to pay.  Hounded by supernatural pursuers and hunted by the CIA, I'm racing against time to save Scarlett, and to stop London from burning to the ground. Rage is simmering under the surface, and when it boils, I'll unleash a fire of my own.",
