  "description": "In her groundbreaking book, Wild Finding Power, Spirit, & Joy in the Root of the Female Body, Tami Lynn Kent invites every woman to journey deep into the heart of her female body, to her root place, and the root of all womanhood. Through stories, visualizations, and creative exercises, the wisdom arising from the female body has been distilled into this guide for us to explore the feminine nature as never before. Based on her work with women in the pelvic space as a women’s health physical therapist, Kent has created a whole new way of discovering the female form. Kent draws from her experiences with the physical body and the female energy system to provide a framework for us to explore our inherently creative this inner range of the wild feminine. Kent teaches us how to read the physical and energetic patterns of the pelvic bowl and restore access to the natural resources–the wildness–within our bodies. Along the way, Kent infuses this guide with healing stories and rituals for every woman to cultivate her creative ground, change core patterns that diminish her radiance, and receive sustenance from her own wild feminine.",
