  "description": "\"My Stepbrother, My Lover\" is a Hot New Adult Stepbrother Romance by Alice Ward.  This is a Full Sized (approx. 430 Pages) Standalone Novel with NO Cliffhanger!  I should have known better.  The moment Jackson Montgomery III showed up for his tutoring session, I knew he was trouble, but I ignored my intuition.  Soon, I couldn't get my mind off him and he had no trouble letting me know that he wanted more than lessons from me.  The only problem was, he was the heir to a family fortune and I was the product of a single, feminist mother and working to supplement my financial aid at Harvard.  We shouldn't have been together, but I'm proof that opposites attract and I was definitely attracted to him and wanted him in a bad way.  Temptation weakened my resolve and I ended up having the most erotic night of my life with Jackson, but by the next afternoon everything took a turn for the worst.  The sexy frat boy that just rocked my world was in his ex's arms and I was devastated.  Then, a surprise engagement announcement from my mother revealed yet another unbelievable turn of events.  She's marrying Jackson's father, and the man I hated and wanted more than anything was now going to be my new stepbrother!  This book is intended for a mature audience, 18+ only.",
