  "description": "My name is Honor, but I have none to speak of. I’m a high-society princess on the verge of ending it all. I have nothing to show for my life, though my bank account would say otherwise. Money and status has controlled every ounce of my world and I want no part of it. It’s what took away the most important person in my life. He’s gone and I’m alone, and no one is here to save me. Pain is the only pleasure I can feel anymore.  To find a healthier avenue to deal with my grief, I turned to Lotus House Yoga for salvation—and found it in the tall, dark, and brutally attractive Nicholas Salerno. He’s everything I’m not. Lives every day to the fullest, loves his family, and goes after what he wants with a thrust that’s unmatched. I can’t help but be swept up in his beauty as he attempts to show me the light and reawaken my desires. Except Nick doesn’t know what I’ve hidden, and I’m afraid he’ll despise what he finds…when my sins are no longer silent.",
