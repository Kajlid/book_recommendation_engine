  "description": "In part two of the Corporate Hitman Trilogy, the story centers around SCRATCH.  SCRATCH knew exactly what he was in for when he sold his soul.  Pierce Eaglemohr's offer of freedom was nothing more than a pair of invisible handcuffs. Now SCRATCH is at the center of an FBI investigation and time is running out. The wall of lies is beginning to crumble.  It's the worst possible time for him to meet a woman and it's too bad that Monica Tidwell is the one woman with the power to destroy him.  History may try to repeat itself, but this time he's not alone. The Hitmen have his back.",
