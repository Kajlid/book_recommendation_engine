  "description": "ANAGRAMA word…A hidden meaning…A simple game…It’s a man’s world, so as the first female CEO of the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world, I have to bring it to its knees every day. I live for my job because I’ve worked damn hard for it. I’ve been called everything from a ballbuster to a maneater, but I wear the titles with pride. It means I’m feared and respected. I have everything a powerful woman could want: the perfect job, the perfect Manhattan address, and the perfect man who’s as dominant in the boardroom as he is in the bedroom. Until someone decides everything I have should belong to her. Even when you’re on top of the world, you still have to watch your back. I didn’t, and in the blink of an eye found myself at rock bottom. I lost everything from the man I loved, right down to my dignity. Now my life has become a puzzle—an anagram that needs to be unraveled.I always thought I was irreplaceable. I was wrong.",
