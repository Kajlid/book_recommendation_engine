  "title": "One Cruel Night",
  "description": "A heart-stopping sexy contemporary romance prequel to  USA Today bestselling author K.A. Linde's new Cruel Trilogy. I spot the mysterious stranger across the party. I’d seen him in the park, writing furiously in his worn leather notebook. He’s pure confidence, born and bred in high society with eyes like a hawk—observant, cunning, and wicked. With sensual lips and a body made to worship, he’s exquisite. A work of art. While I’m young, innocent, and completely out of my depth. But I’m drawn to him. Captivated by his approach. When he asks for one night, I have only one word for him. Yes. One summer in Paris. One night with him. One cruel night.",
