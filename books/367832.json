  "description": "Clement Freud arrived in England and was despatched to a notorious 'progressive' school, where he spent more time drinking cider than attending lessons. After an eccentric childhood, and a spell as an apprentice chef at the Dorchester Hotel, things went downhill as Clement became a soldier, night-club owner, journalist, television personality and Liberal MP. By the end of Freud Ego, Clement is celebrating his win at the Ely by-election...a contest for which he backed himself 33-1.",
