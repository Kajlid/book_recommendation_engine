Max is Sadie's confidante, her protector, and her best friend. This summer will be all about them. This summer will be perfect.And then they meet Dylan. Dylan is dark, dangerous, and intoxicating, and he awakens something in Max that she never knew existed. No matter how much she wants to, she can't back away from him.But Sadie has her own intensity, and has never allowed Max to become close with anyone else. Max doesn't know who she is without Sadie, but she'd better start learning. Because if she doesn't make a decision about Dylan, about Sadie, about herself it's going to be made for her.",
