  "description": "Do you believe it’s possible to own, purchase, communicate, and come to know a ghost? Ron Shaw does. He bought and paid for his own ghost Mary, on a crisp fall day in 2013, never having sought such a find, as he bunked and junked his way through the flea markets and garage sales of his native Atlanta, Georgia. Warm, witty, and down to earth, you will find yourself entranced by this unique collection of stories and observations, replete with a full measure of Southern ambiance and hospitality. You won’t want to miss this one!",
