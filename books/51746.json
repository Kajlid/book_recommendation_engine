In order to solve the crime, she and Briggie have to uncover the secrets in Alex's own family tree, discovering in the process why she was sent away to Paris at age eighteen. Her searches yield facts that explain the strange isolation of her adolescence. A recent convert to the LDS Church, she is still grieving over the death of her husband but is powerfully attracted to Daniel Grinnell, a psychotherapist who knows just a little too much about her for comfort.",
