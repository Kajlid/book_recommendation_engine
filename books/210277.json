  "description": "I Am No One You Know contains nineteen startling stories that bear witness to the remarkably varied lives of Americans of our time. In \"Fire,\" a troubled young wife discovers a rare, radiant happiness in an adulterous relationship. In \"Curly Red,\" a girl makes a decision to reveal a family secret, and changes her life irrevocably. In \"The Girl with the Blackened Eye,\" selected for The Best American Mystery Stories 2001, a girl pushed to an even greater extreme of courage and desperation manages to survive her abduction by a serial killer. And in \"Three Girls,\" two adventuresome NYU undergraduates seal their secret love by following, and protecting, Marilyn Monroe in disguise at Strand Used Books on a snowy evening in 1956.These vividly rendered portraits of women, men, and children testify to Oates's compassion for the mysterious and luminous resources of the human spirit.",
