He roams the country seeking assignments, but gradually comes to realise that while some of his quarry are unremittingly vile, vicious grotesques, others are the victims of sin, evil or simple naivety.In this collection of short stories, following the adventures of the hit collection The Last Wish, join Geralt as he battles monsters, demons and prejudices alike...The anthology is composed of several stories, loosely linked in a chronological order:The Bounds of Reason (Granica możliwości)A Shard of Ice (Okruch lodu)Eternal Flame (Wieczny ogień)A Little Dedication (Trochę poświęcenia)The Sword of Destiny (Miecz przeznaczenia)Something More (Coś więcej)",
