  "title": "A Cage for the Wind",
  "description": "Jerry is a writer, a box-truck driver, a desk-jockey, sometimes a murderer, but more often than not, he's a liar, and no one in his circle of associates, acquaintances, or lovers can ever be sure when, and more importantly, if he's telling the truth. But over the course of the next few days (or weeks, or months, or years, who can really be sure?) he will go on a journey, maybe, of self-discovery riddled with mind-transporting drugs, childhood-rooted romances, and ancestral malarkey. Or, maybe he's returning home from a journey he can't remember anything of. The only thing he can be sure of, is that he's not sure if he's leaving to or returning from, or if he's even gone away in the first place. In this story, Jerry's life is told from three points of view of gradually-intensifying insanity. His melodramatic world is seen through his own eyes, narrated in the nameless voice of another, and finally, through anecdotal poems which serve as thoughts, musings, reflections, and more. So come along, hop on board, join Jerry in his quest for... whatever. Maybe you can make sense of the mess, if, of course, there is any sense to be found at all.",
