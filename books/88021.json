  "title": "Constant Companion: Your Practical Path to Real Interaction with God",
  "description": "Many believers in Jesus Christ are living life against the backdrop of disenchantment. They have a core desire to be known completely and loved intimately, yet they have searched in vain to find connection and God seems distant. Constant Companion by Ami Loper captures hearts with an accurate portrayal of the needs the soul harbors for love, acceptance, and an abiding bond with the Creator. It is a bond found only by immersing oneself in a baptism of love, a love which comes from a God so committed to fellowship with humankind He sacrificed Himself to make it available. Readers will explore the biblical foundations for two-way communication with the Creator that form a persistent thread from the Garden of Eden to the Cross and discover what may be keeping them in a state of spiritual starvation, longing for connection, yet feeling there’s no place for them at the table. They will establish their faith and feel empowered as they recognize the applied wisdom from Scripture for this challenging journey to hear from God. A wealth of practical guidance awaits as the reader is guided along the path to hearing the voice of their Good Shepherd. The highest calling is found in our bond with our Creator. It’s time we were able to hear from our “Constant Companion.”",
