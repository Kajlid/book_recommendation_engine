  "description": "Frollo I’m bound by the vow I made to myself to uphold the honour and sanctity of my church and my village. For years I’ve held onto this promise, never faltering, never succumbing to the whim of sin and desire…that is, until I met her. The sweetest of temptations with a siren’s body and a beautiful soul to match. I can feel myself losing the will, and the strength to uphold my morals. I’m haunted by this woman, this she-devil of desire. I crave her…and I will make her mine, even if I have to burn in hell to claim her. Quinlan Esme may have caught the Pastor’s eye, but he’s not the only one, and he's refusing to play fairly. I’m younger, more daring, not to mention willing to go to any lengths to get what I want. He thinks he has the upper hand, but his duty to his village and church is his weakness, and so is she. I know what I have to do, and I’m more than ready.",
