To keep watch over her.She’s entered my life and turned me into a different person.One who cares about others, or should I say her. Specifically her.Her shyness tells me she’s a good girl too, almost for sure untouched by another man. Ever.Clearly, this is just the beginning.Of this journey. Of…forever. Because she will be mine.",
