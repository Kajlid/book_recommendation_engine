  "description": "\"Living in both worlds is no longer possible.\" Thade, just some forgotten punk reject; a widower living in the shadow of his undead marriage. 9 months now. His wife, Yvette, is missing and he can't remember if he ever really knew her. Did he do it? Of course he didn't. Because of course he did. She left everything. Her keys. Her phone. Her car. All her clothes hanging like delirious fabric in the visceral closet. Dinner in the oven, her little signature. Her alien fingerprints. Wandering, wandering into the hopeless day; lost, until one day a piece of paper with several AOL credit card accounts slips itself into his lunch. \"Yvette Davina\" - her maiden name. But that doesn't matter because his wife -can't- be dead. Probably in the arms of another man. Or another woman. Hallucinating the nightmare of his wife's death; dreams of heaven's crest forever grounded, and in all the confusion, Nancy is sacrificed. And Tracy wanders into his life, drunk and sick and menacing advances. The only answer to the unraveling world around him comes from the mind of an ancient predator, Joshua. The vacant eyes of something primal; timeless. And all this drops at his feet...as it pulls him in.",
