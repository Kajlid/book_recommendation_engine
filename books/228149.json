  "description": "Entrepreneur and bestselling author of  The Lean Startup , Eric Ries reveals how entrepreneurial principles can be used by businesses of all kinds, ranging from established companies to early-stage startups, to grow revenues, drive innovation, and transform themselves into truly modern organizations, poised to take advantage of the enormous opportunities of the twenty-first century.  In  The Lean Startup , Eric Ries laid out the practices of successful startups – building a minimal viable product, customer-focused and scientific testing based on a build-measure-learn method of continuous innovation, and deciding whether to persevere or pivot. In  The Startup Way , he turns his attention to an entirely new group of established enterprises like iconic multinationals GE and Toyota, tech titans like Amazon and Facebook, and the next generation of Silicon Valley upstarts like Airbnb and Twilio.Drawing on his experiences over the past five years working with these organizations, as well as nonprofits, NGOs, and governments, Ries lays out a system of entrepreneurial management that leads organizations of all sizes  and from every industry to sustainable growth and long-term impact. Filled with in-the-field stories, insights, and tools,  The Startup Way  is an essential road map for any organization navigating the uncertain waters of the century ahead.Includes a PDF of charts and graphs from the book.",
