  "description": "All Aren wanted was a cottage on a lake. Instead, she was taken by the throne, forced into being the figurehead of palace lands. She is not content being a puppet to those who would attempt to manipulate her.Few people, if any, know how far its influence truly stretches. Their people's history is long and this dark era has stretched back so far that no one recalls how it started, or how to deal with a queen strong enough to force the court to her bidding. Summoned by events that count not possibly have been forged by mortal hands, Aren's parents arrive at court. A few days later not one, but all four barons arrive.Between Aren's parents plotting, and the secrets kept by the barons, Av is pressured into behaving in the name of forging political alliances.All neglect to ask a simple question. What does Aren want? And how many hints will the throne give before it purges the whole court?",
