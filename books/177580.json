  "title": "A Brush with the Coast",
  "description": "This is the lavishly illustrated story of one girl and her dog, documenting their adventures walking the South West Coast Path. The girl, an artist needing inspiration for an exhibition, roped in her reluctant Ridgeback as her side kick and together they embarked on a six hundred and thirty mile walk, taking seven weeks and changing their lives forever. The artist, with her sketchbook in hand, found inspiration, saw the best and worst of human nature, experienced the most beautiful and wild landscapes and discovered an enduring love for the simple act of walking. The dog caught a rabbit, travelled on a steam train and followed wherever the artist led.This is a book celebrating the beauty and diversity of the South West Coast Path, seen through an artist's eyes. An experience that one girl and her dog will never forget.",
