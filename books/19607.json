  "description": "Her man’s a convicted murderer, but Brittany Booth is determined to save him from incarceration in a secure mental hospital by flushing out the witness who failed to come forward. The murdered man’s lover and friend are equally determined to see his killer declared insane. Unluckily for private investigator Annie Raymond, both sides land in her lap. Annie has her own troubles. Her relationship with Scott has ended and he is engaged to local detective Kate Ronsen. Annie tired of Scott long ago, but Kate does not believe it and is in a position to make life very difficult for Annie. With a boss ready to grab credit for her work when it goes well and lay blame when it doesn’t, Kate’s antagonism could make things impossible. It’s a tangled nightmare and the last thing Annie needs as she fights to find a way out of a stalled chapter in her own life.",
