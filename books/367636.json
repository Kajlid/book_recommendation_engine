  "title": "Finding H.F.",
  "description": "Abandoned by her mother and raised by her loving but religiously zealous grandmother, 16-year-old Heavenly Faith Simms (H.F. for short) has never felt like she belonged anywhere. When she finds her mother's address in a drawer, she and her best friend, Bo, an emotionally repressed gay boy, hit the road in Bo's scrap heap of a car and head south. Their journey through the heart of the American South awakens both teens to the realization that there is a life waiting for them that is very different from what they have known and that the concept of family is more far-reaching than they had ever imagined. Julia Watts is the author of the novels Wedding Bell Blues, Piece of My Heart, Phases of the Moon, and Wildwood Flowers. She lives in Knoxville, Tennessee.",
