She hopes her diligent efforts will finally earn her father’s respect and keep visitors safe and comfortable.But all her hopes for the future are dashed with the EMP attack.Broadcasts offer only a brief warning before missile strikes wipe out all power and communications across North America.

A fight further complicated when they are cut off from the mainland – and an unexpected assailant threatens their lives.Someone is stalking one of the guests, hiding out on the island and sabotaging Elna’s desperate efforts to sustain their source of fresh water. When her father goes missing and another guest is gravely injured, remaining on the island isn’t an option.But even if they reach the mainland, there are no longer guarantees of safety in a world where science and reason have descended into post-apocalyptic anarchy.And survival of the fittest reigns supreme.",
