Even if you haven't read some of them, you've undoubtedly heard of them—their mere titles are synonymous with greatness.But what exactly is the Western literary canon? Why does it contain certain works and not others?What is its history? What is its future?Most important: What do particular works in the Western canon tell us about the development of literature and civilization?You explore these and other thought-provoking questions in The Western Literary Canon in Context, a thorough investigation of more than 30 key works of the Western canon and the critical roles they played—and continue to play—in the development of Western literature. Over the course of 36 lectures, award-winning professor and author John M. Bowers of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas takes you from the formation of the Bible to the postcolonial literature of the late 20th century, revealing the exciting stories behind these classic works and their often surprising connections with one another.It's an insightful approach that will reshape your thoughts about the evolution of literature and will open your eyes to the hidden dialogue among Western civilization's most cherished and influential authors.",
