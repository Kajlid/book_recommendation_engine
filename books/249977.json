  "title": "A Change of Climate",
  "description": "A collection of poems about climate change, written by poets from across the globe and offering their local perspective on a global issue. This collection represents the top 20 poems that were selected as part of a global competition to find poems about climate change. Some of the poems in this collection are sad, some of them are angry, some of them are even funny. But all of them are real. Real poems from real people about the very real topic of climate change. All profits from this book will be used to support the Environmental Justice Foundation, who investigate and expose environmental and human rights abuses through film and photography. By purchasing this book, you are helping to support their Climate Campaign, which is centred on fighting for the rights of climate refugees.",
