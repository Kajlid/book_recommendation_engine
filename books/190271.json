Until she met Tanner Parks her life was basic... Uneventful but simple. He was the unattainable bad boy... Just out of reach yet Lily longed for him desperately. He was fowl mouthed and cocky... Demanding and arrogant. But he was exactly what Lily needed... He made her stronger. He gave her the drive to keep her head above water, when everything else was falling apart.",
