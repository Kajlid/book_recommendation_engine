  "description": "It was 1872 in Wyoming Territory and seven-year-old Robert Paul had a plan. A plan to save his pregnant mother and sister from his cruel and abusive father. But his plan didn’t include being stopped by eight Sioux warriors on the warpath!Five-year-old Fox Kitten and three-year-old Chameli, Blackfoot sisters, didn’t have a plan. They just wanted to be rescued from their Cheyenne kidnappers and be returned to their grandmother. But they were being held at the sacred White Horn in Montana Territory’s Crazy Mountains. Who could save them?Hackmore had the perfect plan. Or so he thought. Have his men kill Snort and Old Swede and their buffalo teams on the eastern plains of Wyoming Territory. Steal their wagons loaded with buffalo hides and sell them in Chesterville. Then he’d get his men drunk and run off with their share of the money. It was the perfect plan. Except—it was Sunday. A bad mistake! And Snort was still alive. An even worse mistake! Because Snort wasn’t alone!Doc Whitfield also had a plan. A wild preposterous plan—if he could only pull it off. First, save the children. Then he, Snort, “Buff,” the white-haired buffalo hunter, and Jaime Larson, a fast-draw friend, would go looking for Hackmore and his gang of killers. Chesterville was about to witness one of the longest and deadliest gun battles in the town’s history.",
