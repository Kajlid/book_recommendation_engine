  "description": "Ava Valentine is a time-traveling bounty hunter from the distant future. She’s chased her fugitive back to present-day New York City, where she hopes her new contact will lead her to an uneventful capture. What she’s not expecting is to get mixed up with a man she suspects is a vampire. Dexter Stone is a mysterious soldier of fortune. He holds an allegiance to few, and has a reputation for selling out anyone if the price is right. His word is good though, and once he chooses a side, it’ll take more than monetary gain to sway him to the other. A run-in with an unsavory person from Ava’s past forces the pair into an uneasy alliance. And soon, Ava will discover that she could be Stone’s saving grace—or his downfall. Please Staked is a 25,000-word novella.",
