  "description": "Newly discovered scientific proof validating the legends and myths of ancient floods, fires, and weather extremesPresents new scientific evidence revealing the cause of the end of the last ice age and the cycles of geological events and species extinctions that followedConnects physical data to the dramatic earth changes recounted in oral traditions around the worldDescribes the impending danger from a continuing cycle of catastrophes and extinctionsThere are a number of puzzling mysteries in the history of Earth that have yet to be satisfactorily explained by mainstream the extinction of the dinosaurs, the vanishing of ancient Indian tribes, the formation of the mysterious Carolina Bays, the disappearance of the mammoths, the sudden ending of the last Ice Age, and the cause of huge underwater landslides that sent massive tsunamis racing across the oceans millennia ago. Eyewitness accounts of these events are chronicled in rich oral traditions handed down through generations of native peoples. The authorsâ€™ recent scientific discoveries link all these events to a single cause.In The Cycle of Cosmic Catastrophes Richard Firestone, Allen West, and Simon Warwick-Smith present new scientific evidence about a series of prehistoric cosmic events that explains why the last Ice Age ended so abruptly. Their findings validate the ubiquitous legends and myths of floods, fires, and weather extremes passed down by our ancestors and show how these legendary events relate to each other. Their findings also support the idea that we are entering a thousand-year cycle of increasing danger and possibly a new cycle of extinctions.",
