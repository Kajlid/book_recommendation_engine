  "description": "Luke Besnik wasn’t looking forward to visiting the Badlands Territory. His alpha has given him the impossible task of talking some sense into his selfish sister. But the moment he met Adley Hoyt, his trip was more than worthwhile. Adley has yearned for a fated mate ever since her adopted parents told her about shifters. Just when she almost gave up hope, Luke turned up in town. Discovering she was meant to belong to him was a dream come true—until she realized his connection to the girl who’d made her life miserable for the last year.",
