  "description": "If you've been hurt by friends and family, especially within the church, this book is for you. God's royalty, along with society, have experienced a sweeping loss of identity while captive \"in Babylon\". If you know you were made for more, it's time for you to arise and fulfil your call to royalty. Leaders Get Up. With great vulnerability and transparency, Barb Wall shares the prophetic insights God gave that birthed her significance through her deeply offsetting season of encampment in Babylon. This unique autobiography will empower you to become the royal you've always dreamed of becoming. The Lord makes poor and makes rich; He brings low and lifts up. He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the beggar from the ash heap to set them among princes and make them inherit the throne of glory. (I Sam. 2:7-8a)",
