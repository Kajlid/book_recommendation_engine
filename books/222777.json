  "description": "Judith Lucy has been cracking jokes about her parents for years. But when a birth relative's casual comment implied that she despised them, Judith was shocked. Sure, she had been talking about Ann and Tony Lucy like they were one-dimensional Irish nut bags who had ruined her life for years, but there was always more to them and her own feelings than that.So Judith decided it was time to write the full story of her parents and her childhood.Judith Lucy is one of Australia's best-known comedians; this is her first work.",
