  "description": "Julia Henry and her family may have escaped the rent trap, but curiosity has drawn a predator home.When Julia Henry’s former neighbour plunges eight stories to her death in the snow, she’s convinced her previous landlords harassed the woman to suicide. But when she investigates, another dead girl turns up with a connection to a serial rapist. Julia and her husband put as much distance as they could afford between them and the landlords who put them through hell, and stories from humiliated tenants match Julia's own. She's determined to prove their tactics resulted in tragedy. But the half-empty building is hemorrhaging tenants, the girl's boyfriend comes complete with a wife and daughter, and the best friend overdosed days after giving police their only description of a serial rapist. ?It seems someone wants Julia buried under the heaviest blizzard in thirty years, and she’s run off the road in a whiteout. One of her daughters narrowly escapes a brutal rape steps from home, and two nightmares converge. Julia goes from shaken to livid. The only way she can protect her girls and live to see the snow melt is to expose the wrenching truth behind the rapes, the deaths, and the strangest absentee landlord ever.",
