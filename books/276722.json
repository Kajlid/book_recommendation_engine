  "description": "HOLDING MARCO follows a young man, recently out of a relationship and with not much motivation in life, trying to find a quality man to fulfill his needs as he recounts fond memories of love-making. Dealing with daily life and perhaps living in the past a little too much, he looks no further than his ex's best friend: Marco, a summertime cowboy who works at his family's horse ranch in Mexico.But the mundane drama isn't with Marco, it's with the ex, Tony, once considered a trophy boyfriend. Tony has occasional appearances in the story that only bring memories of passionate love-making and the too-familiar feelings of love mingling with heartbreak.However, Marco is called to the ranch many months sooner than planned. But certain things happen when Marco is away that could ruin the life of the young protagonist.",
