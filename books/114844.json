  "description": "Hadley Beckett’s quest for wedded bliss perseveres.A dare. My intrepid sportscaster boyfriend, Finn Wilder, keeps me guessing and on edge, especially when it comes to jumping off bridges or marrying me. Infamously anti-marriage, he promised me he’d consider taking me to the altar if I give him more time. Done. We’re in our thirties, and the sand is running out of the hourglass. My clock is blaring. Diving headfirst and setting marriage aside for the moment, I try a different angle, and I shove my persuasion skills into overdrive to convince Finn to at least have a baby with me. Little did I know his issues run deeper than I ever imagined.It’s an uphill climb ahead, but I can’t back down. I have too much to lose, and executing my plan will be a leap of faith or folly. Still, I’m determined to triumph, but so is Finn Wilder. No matter what it takes.",
