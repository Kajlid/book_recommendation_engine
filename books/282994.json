  "description": "An anthology of poems that heal, offer hope, and inspire.\"She walks in beauty, like the nightOf cloudless climes and starry skies;And all that's best of dark and brightMeet in her aspect and her eyes.\"--Lord ByronHere is a collection of beauty, inspiration and light. Liz Rosenberg has gathered poems of sunlight and starry skies, of light flickering in a dark and difficult world. Where light literally shines in one poem, in another it may be represented more light in the deepest of loves, a smooth pebble found in a pocket, and even, in the greatest despair, as in Shelley's great line, \"If Winter comes, can Spring be far behind? \" Whether about hope, beauty, comfort or healing, this collection is filled with poems of light.Like Rosenberg's award-winning Earth-Shattering Poems , this multicultural anthology features poems by authors from around the world and from ancient to contemporary times. Some of the poets included are Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Jane Kenyon, Rainer Maria Rilke, Christina Rossetti, Rumi, and Ruth Stone.",
