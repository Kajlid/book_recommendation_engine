  "title": "Liars: How Progressives Exploit Our Fears for Power and Control",
  "description": "Glenn Beck, the New York Times bestselling author of The Great Reset, reveals the cold truth behind the ideology of progressivism and how the tenets of this dangerous belief system are eroding the foundation of this country.Politics is no longer about pointing to a shining city on the hill; it’s about promising you a shiny new car for your driveway. The candidate who tells the people what they want to hear is usually the one who wins—no matter the truth. Politicians may be sleazy and spineless, but they’re not stupid. They see that the way to win is by first telling people everything that is wrong with the world, and then painting a Utopian vision that they’ll create right here on earth, one where no one is ever sick or hungry, jobless, or homeless. All we have to do is surrender our freedom and someone else’s wallet and they’ll make it happen. And so they continue to lie, and we continue to believe them, and they keep winning elections. The only way to break the cycle is to understand why Americans fall for the deception over and over again. Progressives from both parties exploit us by first pointing out the things we should be afraid of, and then offering us “solutions” to these fears­­—solutions that always require us to give up our freedoms. In his signature no-holds-barred way, Beck destroys the false promises of Progressivism and asks Why do we accept the lies?",
