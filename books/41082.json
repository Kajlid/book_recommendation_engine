  "title": "The Hope",
  "description": "The Hope is a vast ocean liner, five miles long and two miles wide and one mile high, which lurches through the waves on a voyage to nowhere, carrying a million passengers in her rusting belly. After some thirty years at sea, everyone aboard her has gone just a little bit loopy, and violent death has become a way of life. All sorts of horrors lurk in the ship’s darkest corners — rumours made flesh, unspeakable creatures, peripheral-vision insanities. The only certainty is the Hope, which was once a multimillionaire philanthropist’s dream, has become a floating nightmare.“As an allegory of late-20th-century existence, it catches admirably the rust, waste and putrescence of consumer ideals. I am glad to think that the 1990s will be decorated by more of Mr Lovegrove’s fiction” – The Spectator“Lovegrove’s controlled writing… the words accurate as assassin’s bullets… is the book’s best argument against the anarchy of the unleashed future that is depicted so vividly in this first and fierce effort” – The Sunday Times“Very gutsy first work with tremendous spark and imagination” – The Daily Telegraph",
