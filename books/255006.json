  "description": "Discover a wickedly funny fantasy that is The Princess Bride meets Once Upon a Time. Perfect for fans of fractured fairy tales!Not all quests are heroic. And neither are all heroes.Writing his memoir wasn’t something Geoffrey P. Ward had ever planned to do. He had enough on his plate, thank you very much, and that sort of self-indulgent behavior didn’t appeal to him. But answering the same questions about his backstory over and over irritated him more.Yes, he started off as a hero before he became the world famous fairy tale villain consultant he is today. When he mentioned it in passing in his Guide to Villainy, it hadn’t seemed that big a deal. Apparently, not. And now, he’s stuck penning the story about the grand quest that drove him from hero to villain all to appease people’s curiosity and to save his sanity.And if that wasn’t bad enough, another quest comes knocking on his door. Literally.Princesses are really more bother than they’re worth. Even if they are rather intriguing at times…***Bouncing between the quest that began Geoffrey’s villainy career and the quest that may end it, Geoffrey P. Ward’s Guide to Questing is a hilarious romp into the murky world of fairy tale heroes and villains.Though part of a series, this is the standalone novel and can be read on its own.Buy your copy today and dive into a different kind of fairy tale quest!",
