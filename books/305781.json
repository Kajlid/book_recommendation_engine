My husband’s stuck in the past, lost in his fractured mind, and the last ten years are a blur to him, meaning I’m a blur to him. But I’m not a ghost. I’m a woman. I’m alive. I breathe. I hurt.Should I let go or hold on?My instinct is to let go, but I have family now. People who matter to me. A posse I’ll kill for. I’m no longer nothing, I’m something. I’m a Sinner. And I’ve found my ride and die… now I just have to get him to remember me. Impossible?I’ve beaten worse odds and survived. Game on, Maverick. Game on.",
