  "description": "After a horrifying ambush by the Demons, the Elves realize that it is only a matter of time before the war is brought to the forefront once more. The younger generations have come of age and are expected to take their places beside their parents in battle. It is something they trained hard for and are ready to do. They begin by looking into the past for other battle techniques that might have been lost to them over the millenniums. The one who is the most vigilant on that front is Ennacas, an Elf who seems to always have to learn everything the hard way. In her studies, Ennacas has learned that Tratchars were once the most feared warriors. She wants to know why and there is one Elf she can turn to for answers. As an ancient, Rothliel was fully trained to serve the Empire as a Tratchar Warrior. At her request, he will share the knowledge that has been lost to those who share their talents. Only one Tratchar cannot attend his classes, Endiku, for the war in the Free Lands, where he lives, has not abated.The order of the Great Guardian of the Free Lands to bring Ennacas leaves Endiku no choice but to face his Life Mate, for The Great Guardian has a quest for them that will take their combined talents to complete. When the time comes for him to collect his bride, he is apprehensive. He has not spoken to her for centuries and is unsure of his welcome. She is a woman now, and there is nothing more dangerous than a female who feels she has been taken for granted, especially one who is a Tratchar and an Eagle Claw.",
