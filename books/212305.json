  "description": "This practical 92-page booklet demonstrates, through simple examples, how A.A. members throughout the world live and stay sober one day at a time. Originally published in 1975 and revised and updated in 2012, this A.A. General Service Conference-approved publication has helped untold thousands of alcoholics, especially many in early recovery, face “life on life’s terms,” and live as a sober person within a given day and “just for today.” From the preface to the book: “So not drinking at all—that is, staying sober—becomes the basis of recovery from alcoholism. And let it be emphasized: Living sober turns out to be not at all grim, boring and uncomfortable, as we had feared, but rather something we begin to enjoy and find much more exciting than our drinking days. We’ll show you how.”",
