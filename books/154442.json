  "description": "Upon the death of her mother, 26 year old Leia York is left bereft and grief-stricken. An old college professor extends her an invitation to join him in one of the most beautiful, yet most dangerous, places on earth - the Amazon rainforest. She embarks on an impulsive journey, hoping to forget the sadness of her life in Chicago. Shortly after arriving in the village, Leia is among those chosen to go on a quest that is vital to the survival of the natives. The six week quest is fraught with danger, adventure, and unexpectedly: love. A love which is strictly forbidden. Will Leia respect an indigenous law that prevents her from pursuing the only love she has ever known? The Blue Amaryllis is a unique story that blends romance and adventure, while exploring the very real ecological issues threatening the Amazon rainforest and tribes within. It is a story of a proud people whose unique way of life faces extinction, and the passionate love that develops between one of their own and an outsider.",
