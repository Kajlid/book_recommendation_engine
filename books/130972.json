  "description": "Jumpin jacksnipes! Duckburg's richest tycoon is on the hunt for legendary square eggs and he's bringing Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie along! It's our second complete, chronological book of Duck adventures by internationally celebrated fan favorite Don Rosa following in the footsteps of Disney legend Carl Barks with his own distinctive style! Famed for his prizewinning Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Rosa wrote and drew two decades worth of ripping Duck yarns and is among the world's most beloved modern cartoonists. Star stories in our second Rosa book include Return to Plain Awful, Rosa's sequel to Barks Lost in the Andes. Then, in His Majesty McDuck, Scrooge beats the IRS by seceding from the Union... only to have his new country colonized by the Beagle Boys! Plus more! Presented with a rich archive of Rosa's cover art and behind-the-scenes factoids, these Duckburg epics are getting a definitive, comprehensive North American edition for the very first time at a bargain price worthy of Scrooge himself!",
