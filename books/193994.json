  "description": "Once upon a Timely in the West, a frontier boomtown has more than its share of scoundrels. It takes a hero to keep them in line. Red Wolf—the Cheyenne who stood up to Mayor Wilson Fisk in Secret Wars' 1872—is the only man who can fill fallen Sheriff Steve Rogers' boots. But after a battle with the Surveyor, Red awakens in a world very different from his own -albeit one still filled with snakes in the grass. He has no ID and no jurisdiction, but the town he arrives in needs a lawman to serve and protect.Collecting: Red Wolf 1-6",
