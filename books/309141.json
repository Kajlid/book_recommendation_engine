Pudgy Heather, granddaughter of the Governor of California, lives in an exclusive gated community in Los Angeles with celebrities and political figures as neighbors during the Vietnam War-era.

As Heather comes of age, she must make decisions about how she wants her own life to look. Which of the many inheritances of her parents will she keep and which will she jettison?",
