  "description": "One man leaves the life of a lawman behind him and works to clean up a new area in space.\nOn the planet now known as High Tortuga, the mine workers are far too close to being slaves so the ruler of the planet shut them down.\nExcept for the mine owned by Venfirdri Lan.\nHe's taken his mine off the grid and decided to keep everything running. With no need to pay the workers, profits should be good.\nAfter all, who's going to stop him?\nHe had no idea there was a new type of man working for justice on the planet.\n\nA man named Barnabas.\n\nIn fact, he didn't even know who Barnabas was. But he's about to.\nBarnabas may not be Ranger One anymore, but one thing definitely has not changed: when someone screws over the powerless, Barnabas is going to bring the pain. With a bloodthirsty AI running his advanced spaceship, those who love evil should start looking over their shoulders.\n\nLife just got a lot more fun.\n---\nNOTE: This book contains cursing. Perhaps humorous cursing, but cursing nevertheless. If this offends you, I don't suggest reading this book.",
