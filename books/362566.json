  "title": "Alice Eats Wonderland",
  "description": "This cookbook adventure is based on Lewis Carroll's masterpiece, \"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.\" The cookbook contains one or more excerpts from each of the twelve chapters of the original story, but each has been given a new twist, with the theme that Alice, like most children, is more or less constantly hungry. Her appetite is assuaged only by her pursuit of the animal characters (and some of the vegetables) that appear in the story. Alice learns to prepare, cook, and consume these, with the help of the included recipes. Although many of the characters seem, alas, to be transformed into edible dishes during the adventure, the story has a surprisingly happy ending.",
