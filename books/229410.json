  "description": "THE DEVIL'S BRIDE Bounty Hunter Lou Prophet is stalking the notorious train robber Frank Beauregard, a man with as much conscience as a rattlesnake with a baby rabbit in its craw. This snake, however, has a woman in his craw--an innocent young woman who came west from Minnesota to be the mail-order bride of a lonely rancher. Miss Mattie Anderson finds her new home high in the Colorado Rockies far from what she'd expected. She finds her husband-to-be far from what she'd expected, as well. Why is his hired man so tongue-tied? Who's the dead man in the shallow grave out back? As more dead are piled high and the lead flies like snowflakes in a prairie blizzard, Mattie begins to wonder if she hasn't promised herself to the devil himself. Only Lou Prophet can save her from the ties that not only bind but threaten to hang her...THE DEVIL'S FURYGetting hitched in Colorado is one of the last things Lou Prophet remembers before he finds himself stumbling around the Mexican desert with a bloody gash in his head and a small army of Mexican cutthroats hot on his trail. The mercenaries are being led by a stubborn Pinkerton detective named Wolcott. Wolcott is looking for the stolen train loot that Prophet was supposed to return to the U.S. marshal in Denver. But that was before the bounty hunter got married. Before he was supposed to live happily ever after with the charming, beautiful mail-order bride, Mattie Anderson. Now Prophet is stumbling around Mexico, dodging bullets and bad men and trying to find out just how deep a hole he dug for himself when he said -I do.-",
