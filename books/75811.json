Jim has settled on the English coast with his son Jim, and Silver has returned to rural England with his daughter Natty. While their escapades may have ended, for Jim and Natty the adventure is only just beginning.           One night, Natty approaches young Jim with a return to Treasure Island and find the remaining treasure that their fathers left behind.
