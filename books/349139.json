  "description": "The hunk who appears on Annie's doorstep is a looker. The tall attorney's aura is clouded, and Annie can see that he's been suffering for some time. But all that's going to change, because two new people are going to come into his life. And Annie wonders who the lucky pair is going to be. Jake knows how things are supposed to be, and that doesn't include fertility clinic mix-ups or having fathered a child with a woman he's never met. And looking at the redhead who is the mother, Jake realizes he's missed out on something spectacular. But the woman believes her grandfather talks to her through roadside billboards! Still, he asks himself, is that any stranger than his sudden compulsion to woo her? Everyone knows how things are supposed to be-first comes love, then comes marriage, then comes the baby in the baby carriage. Maybe this time, things are going to happen a little differently.",
