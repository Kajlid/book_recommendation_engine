Simon knows fatherhood is a huge commitment, and though it’s daunting, he sees how much Dec wants it, and he’s sure that together, they can succeed in anything—despite the worries nagging at him.  But just as their new life is taking shape, a health scare disrupts their plans at the worst possible moment.
