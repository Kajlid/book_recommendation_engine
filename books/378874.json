  "description": "Iguana Bay was all sand, sea and sky---the perfect getaway spot. But Elise Ramsey wasn't on vacation. She was a prisoner. She was slated to be the star defense witness at a murder trial, an alibi for a man who was guilty as sin, and bounty hunter Dylan Davis didn't want her testifying. He had his reasons. But the more he got to know this woman who had to be bad news, the less those reasons mattered, and the more he realized he was acting like a criminal himself. He was still determined to see justice done, but he could no longer keep Elise captive. She had to come to him of her own free will.",
