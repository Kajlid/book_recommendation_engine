  "description": "Meow, My name is Milo and I am a brown cat. I am a gregarious kitten and I’ve got many a parrot, a dog called Max, Missy who is a cat, and even Lemon. Do you want to know who Lemon is? You will get to know about that from this book. Have you heard that all cats walk their own way? I am not an exception. You have no idea how many interesting places I’ve visited. I was in the library, at school and even on tennis courts. Everywhere I went, I had a lot of adventures, which I describe in this book. By the way, my lady is Julia. She goes to the third grade of junior school. She helped me a little in writing this book. She has also authored all the drawings. I hope you will enjoy them. I wish you a pleasant reading. Milo",
