  "description": "After what can only be described as a momentous year, vampire bounty hunter Morgan Bailey is looking forward to a nice, quiet birthday. But fate has other plans. Instead of gorging on cupcakes and enjoying a private party for two with her sexy new boyfriend, Morgan is hot on the trail of a sidhe—a subspecies of fae—who’s run amok in Portland. But this is no ordinary fairy; he is as powerful as he is psychotic. And considering the supernatural nutjobs Morgan has dealt with in her time, that’s saying something.To take him down, Morgan forms an uneasy alliance with the Fairy Queen and embarks upon her most outrageous adventure yet. But in the midst of the chaos, Morgan realizes there is more to this sidhe than meets the eye. And if she fails, if he achieves his endgame, it will trigger devastation unlike anyone—or anything, human or otherwise—has ever seen.",
