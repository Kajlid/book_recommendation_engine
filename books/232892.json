  "description": "Didn’t you get the hint yet? I’m a bastard, and I own that shit. My soul is dark as well as my actions. In the end, life will always cause pain, it’s the shit you have to endure to appreciate the good things that are scarcely thrown your way. I’m Yegor Volsky, second in command of The Dudnik Circle. The Russian Mob, in case you need a label.  The instant I laid eyes on Ruby, drugged and strapped to a bed, every inch of me swore to protect her from that day forward, even from myself. She needs to know, needs to feel, what it’s like to belong to me. She will hate me for what comes next but it’s inevitable as I hunt down the one responsible for her kidnapping, and putting her in danger.  Family ties that should have been kept buried in the past, come floating to the surface as retribution lies on the horizon. Revenge is a slippery slope and as I brace for the fight to come that will bring the past to collide with the future, I find myself struggling to be worthy of her love. Will we slip in the blood of our enemies or gain traction to move forward?   *** This steamy, dark, kinky, mafia, standalone romance is not for the faint of heart. You’ve been warned. ***",
