  "title": "The Divine Heart of God the Father",
  "description": "In this book an intimate portrayal of God the Father and His Divine Heart is provided through brief narratives. Topics include how our Father is in relationship with us, the inestimable beauty of His Majesty; His sweetness, softness, gentleness and tenderness as Almighty Father. His profound thirst for union with us, deep sorrow at our distance and urgent call for us to return to live in His Infinite Love. The process of union with God the Father from the heart of our souls to the Core of His Divine Heart is described, from the context of the New Israel and intersecting relationships with the Sacred Heart of Jesus Christ, Immaculate Heart of Mary, the Holy Spirit and the Heart of the Holy Trinity. The tapestry of interplay between our Father's Divine Heart, Will and infinite love is explained, while the upcoming reign of the Father in the Eucharistic Era of the Holy Spirit is introduced.",
