  "description": "Jack Madigan should be leading an enviable life. The sole heir of a '70s rock icon, he lives in a once-magnificent Boston town house with his teenage son, Harlan. But there's one tiny drawback: Jack is agoraphobic. It's not really a problem as long as his dad's royalty cheques keep coming, but when the money runs out, Jack must face losing the only home he's ever known - and his only safe zone. Now he has to figure out how to deter the bank's perky real-estate agent, hold on to his house, keep his son at home, and - with the help of the tenacious little girl next door - finally step out onto the sidewalk.",
