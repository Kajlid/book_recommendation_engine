  "title": "Women May Be from Venus...But Men Are Really from Uranus: A Parody of Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus and Other John Gray Books",
  "description": "Wouldn't it be nice to read a book about relationships that made you laugh instead of point fingers? Now you can. Katherine Black, armed with her biting wit and in-your-face directness, takes on John Gray's over-simplified psycho-babble relationship books and delivers a knockout punch.Read why men could not possibly have come from Mars or any planet other than Uranus, how women are responsible for setting up civilization, and why men are inept when it comes to communicating with women.If you enjoy satire packed with a healthy dose of reality, get ready for a wild and hilarious ride!",
