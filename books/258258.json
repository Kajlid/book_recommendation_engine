  "description": "Clara and Nancy, two sisters working in Holloway Prison in 1913, find themselves face-to-face with imprisoned suffragettes: women fighting for the same freedoms they want for themselves. Soon Nancy is drawn to one inmate in particular - the enigmatic `Duchess' - and decides to follow her into the fight. But Clara is torn by the very laws her sister has chosen to try to change. She's fallen in love, and yet marriage would mean giving up the job she loves, and losing her independence forever. How can she possibly choose between the two sides of her heart and not lose a part of herself?",
