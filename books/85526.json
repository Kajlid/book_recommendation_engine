  "description": "“I Need You” is the continuation of Sara’s story from my first book, “Just One Night,” and also from “Let Me Fly.” Sara Lonneman is home in Wisconsin and finds herself falling for Darrin, the protective, strong, ex-military man that has been her salvation for the last desolate year of her life. Sara and Darrin have a pseudo relationship at best that leaves her realizing that Darrin might have more demons inside him then she can handle. Chris Lake, the dominant, head-strong, underground boxer, has come to find her in Wisconsin, after they only spent one night together in college, exploring a Dominant/submissive relationship. He has changed a lot in the last year or so, making Sara question her sanity for participating in their passionate night in Colorado.  Sara finds herself torn between the two men. Ultimately, she has to choose between what is right for her, and what is right for her heart.",
