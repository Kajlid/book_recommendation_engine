  "description": "Itâ€™s easy to be strong - to be brave- when you're the hero. And so Hallagond, Captain of the Rangers, thought himself to be, until a cruel fate suggested otherwise. Devastated, broken, he runs from the judgment of family and friends. Driven by despair, he runs from his shame - he runs from himself. But no one can run forever. From the author of Elfhunter comes a tale of faith, determination, and towering triumph. Where in the spirit does courage lie? When do we learn to forgive? How does the heart find its fire?  It starts with a spark. Out of fear will come fire. From the ashes of one man's life, something will rise. Strength will take a new form. Courage will find a new name: FIRE-HEART",
