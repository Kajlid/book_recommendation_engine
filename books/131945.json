  "description": "This is a true story of how John felt and reacted to the decline of his wife, Yvette, into the quicksands of dementia. The story relates how he, Carmen (the companion to Yvette), and others struggled, sometimes against wise counsel, to prevent Yvette from sliding downhill mentally and physically. Their love for Yvette gave them the incentive and the energy to fight against the odds and to achieve some positive results. Really though, this is a love story of a husband for his wife together for sixty-nine years.",
