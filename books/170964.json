  "description": "Haven't read Book 1 in the series yet? Get it FREE on Amazon **COMPLETE 10-BOOK SERIES. No need to wait for the next book!** Nelson Moore, the lovable stoner, takes over the telling of this, the eighth installment in the series. What he shares is terrifying and surprising. After encountering the living dead in Central Park, Nelson must escape New York City and get to his grandfather, Jim Scofield, in Concord, New Hampshire. With his mellow, sweet demeanor, nobody could have predicted what this kind-hearted man went through on his journey. Concord may only be hours away, but plans have a way of crumbling during a zombie apocalypse. As Nelson works his way through the dangerous streets of New York, he encounters other survivors; some friends, some strangers. Compassionate and unable to ignore people in need, Nelson sacrifices his plans to help others. The resulting madness will build the character you first came to know and care about in volume four of these chronicles. Gem Cardoza asks Nelson to tell his story, unaware of the horrors he went through on his journey across the country. Nelson reluctantly agrees and leaves nothing out, from the fates of his friends to each terrifying encounter with the walking dead. If you thought Nelson was interesting before, this will change the way you see our long-haired, scooter-riding friend. Sit back and dig in. Maybe pack a bowl, too. It may help set the mood.",
