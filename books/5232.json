  "description": "Baron’s Court, All Change was the Holy Grail for all collectors of beatnik, mod and hippie ephemera until it was republished twice in the 21st century. Terry Taylor's only published book, unavailable for decades, documents one summer in the life of the unnamed sixteen year-old narrator. Leaving his home and job he dabbles with spiritualism, is seduced by an older woman and moves into dealing dope. His London is sharp suits, jazz, drugs, nightclubs, and sex. Rare secondhand copies of the first edition have sold for in excess of £300 .Terry Taylor was born in 1933 and inspired the novel Absolute Beginners by Colin MacInnes. Aside from being an assistant to noted photographer Ida Kar (and her lover, despite the age difference between them), Terry was also a hustler; so he knew a thing or three about drugs. He died in 2014.",
