  "description": "Orion & The Wildcat is a story based on real events in the life of the author. Paul tells of his adventures or more importantly his misadventures in life, love and relationships. It culminates in him finally realising that he has been living in fear for too many years. Fears that many people have but rarely face and free themselves from a life less ordinary. A story from the heart with no hold barred also reveals a number of shocking revelations. So ask yourself - What is your deepest fear - This true story may unveil the answer. John Harricharan, #1 Best Selling Author of The Waterbook said,\"Paul Sutherland has written a magical, mystical adventure about life and its magnificence. I love stories with an \"other-worldly\" bent -- stories such as Richard Bach's, \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\" and \"Illusions\" and that's why, I think, Paul's new book, \"Orion and the Wildcat\" fascinates me so much. It is somewhat like a blueprint of life itself. I will not reveal any of the story here, but will let the readers discover the wisdom for themselves. Keep this book on your desk (not your bookshelf, mind you) so that you could go back to it time and again.\"",
