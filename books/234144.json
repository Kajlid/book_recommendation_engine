  "description": "Augustinus (354-430), son of a pagan, Patricius of Tagaste & his Xian wife Monica, while studying in Africa to become a rhetorician, plunged into psycho-philosophical doubts in search of truth, joining for a time the Manichaeans. He became a grammar teacher at Tagaste & lived much under the influence of Monica & his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome & soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the Sceptics & Neo-Platonists. His studies of Paul's letters with Alypius & the preaching of Bishop Ambrose led in 386 to his rejection of sensuality & to his famous conversion from mixed beliefs to Xianity. He returned to Tagaste & there founded a religious community. In 395/6 he became Hippo's bishop & was henceforth engrossed with duties, writing & controversy. He died there during the successful Vandal siege. From Augustine's large output the Loeb Classical Library offers the autobiographical Confessions (2 vols); On the City of God (7 vols), which unfolds God's action in world history, & propounds the superiority of Xian beliefs over pagan in adversity; & a selection of Letters which are important for the study of ecclesiastical history & his relations with other theologians.",
