Leaving England and moving to America, novelist Travis Casey and his British wife move in with his parents to help them with life in general during their advancing years. Having developed a greater understanding of his former country, Casey continues his observations of what has changed over the past two decades and tells of the drama of living with aging parents in his own humorous way.And when bureaucrats are put between an act of nobility and common sense, things are bound to become complicated. As he and Wendy endeavor to make life easier for their loved ones, they battle with immigration rules, trips to the hospital become a matter of routine, and a boy and his truck are on their way from California to join them; All this while Travis struggles with the ‘New’ America.",
