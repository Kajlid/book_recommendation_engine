  "description": "Their love survived the 80s. She wished she hadn't.A funny, bitter-sweet romantic dramedy set to an 80's soundtrack, proving first love never truly dies... Libby London fell in love in with the 80s, came of age in the 90s, and now, in the 21st Century, she's completely falling apart... Her New York City fashion sensibility is more 'vintage tragedy' than 'retro babe' and might just be what's holding her back in all matters of life and love...At least that's what her well-meaning friends think. They've staged a #80sIntervention in an effort to bring Libby bang up-to-date. But how do you move forward when the one you love holds you in the past? Between her dreaded birthday party, friend's madcap ambush, and being forced to relocate her Pretty In Pink thrift shop, Libby's nearing the end of the rope... If her therapist isn't quick, it could be a literal one.Read what people are saying about Victoria Van Tiem’s new dramedy, Holding out for a Hero:“The book is one of the most uplifting, soul searching and delicately written books I've ever read! Depression, guilt and grief mixed with leg warmers, a parrot and one big gesture, set to an 80's soundtrack -could you ask for more?” –Chicks That Read“...a superb & addictive story.” --Rachel's Random Reads “I didn’t want to put this novel down, I just wanted to know what happened next…” –On My Bookshelf“...quick, entertaining and fun read. …it’s also very emotional and deep, which I really loved.” –Sky’s Book Corner",
