Debtors beware. He’ll slit your throat for a nickel. And make no mistake, he will collect.  You never screw with a man’s pride, money, or oil. It’s Texas Law. Unwritten, yet gospel.

No amount of money will ever rebuild everything that’s been shattered. Jack is left standing in the middle of his own chaos.  Greed and power are the least of his worries now. Death is knocking on his front door, wanting to collect.  The woman he’s given his heart to just might become his collateral this time around. Past sins may trump everything...",
