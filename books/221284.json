  "description": "NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER! FIRST PLACE WINNER OF THE NATIONAL EXCELLENCE IN ROMANCE FICTION AWARD!1462 South Broadway is a smoking hot example of how kink and BDSM can be sexy and playful instead of always brooding or deviant. Have you ever found yourself mired in the redundancy of day to day life? Perhaps everything seems perfect, but somehow existence just feels uninspired and mundane? This is the precise rut where Jessie Hayes finds herself. She has a great career, witty friends and an adventurous spirit to keep her fulfilled, but the matter of contention seems to be, she is constantly disappointed in men. After yet another failed and painfully boring relationship, Jessie’s friends convince her to try something new, something crazy…something intoxicatingly sexy, and profoundly erotic. What follows is a journey of sorts, but not one as cliché as simply finding the perfect man and living Happily Ever After, because there is far too much story to tell in between. Follow talented author KC Decker as she takes you on an intensely erotic journey of BDSM, kink, sexual awakenings and ultimately, deep, abiding love.",
