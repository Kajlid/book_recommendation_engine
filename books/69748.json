  "description": "Poppy lives in hell and has for as long as he could remember. The only bright spot he has seen in years is another prisoner being held in the cell next to him. If he can save Marcus, Poppy knows that he will have done at least one good thing in his life. He just had to find Marcus's friends and let them know that they are being led into a trapâ€¦and then go back to hell.Dean Stone is an assassin. He's cold, hard, and without remorse. He's also pretty damn sure that he has stepped into a crazy world. His friend, Gage has mated with the cat king of a pride. His other friends are missing and the agency he works for is a complete mess. What's crazier than that?When Dean goes to the place where he's supposed to pick Marcus up, he finds something else altogether. Poppy is sweet and innocent and about as sexy as he could possibly be. He is also scared out of his mind and clinging to Dean like a second skin. And Dean doesn't have the heart to deny the man, even when taking care of Poppy turns into a full time job.But when danger arrives on their doorstep, Dean's training as an assassin comes in handy, especially when Poppy is kidnapped by the same men that held him in the first place. And Dean has no remorse what so ever about killing anyone that stands between him and the man he's falling for.",
