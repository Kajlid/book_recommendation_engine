  "description": "How a na√Øve stranger can rise above his aggressors and teach them about courage and honour. Archer's reward for being the most worthy student in his graduating class is to lose his home and all his friends. The place he is sent to is a world away from home and he has to get used to many different aspects of this new life, starting with daily torment from Peter and his henchmen. The first day at his foster home is so bad that he wants to leave but the first day at his new school is so bad that he is forced to leave. At the new foster home, Rory and Tom are much friendlier and things finally seem to be improving. Not for long. He is back on guard with the arrival of two antagonistic sisters but his normal defences are useless against an adversary like Mandy. Archer is dragged further into the shady world of Stiff and his gang of teenage shoplifters, but how can he hope to survive when the people he thought were his friends betray him?",
