  "title": "The Austrians",
  "description": "The nation-state of Austria has only existed since the fall of the Austro-Hungarian Habsburg empire in 1918. This work examines the Austrian people's struggle to find their identity against the pull of multi-national Danubian traditions on one hand and racial German ties on the other. It also describes the role the Austrians have to play in the modern world and how they have come to terms with their recent past.",
