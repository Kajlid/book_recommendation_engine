  "description": "When John McKirrop, a down-and-out tramp, takes shelter in a deserted graveyard one night, he witnesses the disinterment of the body of a young boy. Yet no one takes much notice of his stories. After all, who would believe the ramblings of a homeless drunk? Father Ryan Lafferty, the local parish priest, is trying to help the boy's distrught father find his son's body. Alarmed by implications of black magic, he becomes even more inquisitive when McKirrop dies under suspicious circumstances. At the same time, a young female doctor, Sarah Lasseter, begins to query procedures at the Trauma Unit where she treated both the missing boy and McKirrop. The unit is famous for its pioneering research in brain damage and its state-of-the-art technology. So why are the head consultants behaving strangely? And why are the trauma labs shrouded in secrecy? KEN McCLURE is an award-winning medical scientist as well as a global selling author. He was born and brought up in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he studied medical sciences and cultivated a career that has seen him become a prize-winning researcher in his field. Using this strong background to base his thrillers in the world of science and medicine, he is currently the author of twenty-three novels and his work is available across the globe in over twenty languages. He has visited and stayed in many countries in the course of his research but now lives in the county of East Lothian, just outside Edinburgh. This book was first published by Simon & Schuster Ltd. (UK) in 1995",
