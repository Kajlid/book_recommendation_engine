  "description": "Things are going good for Keely Fey. Thanks to a rave review in the Iowa Star, bookings are at an all time high at Fey Creations. Until a Talent stealing psycho uses her salon as a personal shopping ground. When all the clues point to her business it’s nearly impossible to convince the authorities she’s not The Collector. Top this off with the reemergence of a childhood friend—an imaginary childhood friend—and some pretty scary changes in her Talents and things go from downhill slide to avalanche.",
