  "description": "A cabbie’s been beaten up, there’s a drunk and disorderly in the interview room and a possible child abuser is on his way in. Just a pretty normal Christmas Holiday for Resnick and his team. Then Dana Matheison calls to report her flat mate, Nancy, missing. Pretty soon the police have proof that Nancy was kidnapped, and then — as the New Year celebrations wind down — the first tape arrives and Resnick knows they’re dealing with a dangerous psychopath.",
