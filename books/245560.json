  "title": "Equality for Women = Prosperity for All: The Disastrous Global Crisis of Gender Inequality",
  "description": "A groundbreaking book about the direct relationship between a woman's rights and freedoms and the economic prosperity of her country. \"The authors speak to hearts as well as minds.\" --Maud de Boer Buquicchio, UN Special Rapporteur\"Not only timely but profoundly important--a must-read.\" Jackie Jones, Professor of Feminist Legal studiesThe economics of gender inequality is often reduced to equal pay for equal work. But there is much more to it than that. Can a woman, whether married or single, register a business in the same way as a man? Can she sign a contract? Do men and women have equal ownership rights to property? Does she have the right to confer citizenship on her children? Are there criminal sanctions for sexual harassment?Gender inequality in the fields of education, law, employment and wages lead to incalculable social and political disparities. These disparities in turn give rise to endemic poverty and violence, to individual frustration, social instability and cultural disaffection. When women are deprived of their rights, economies are eroded, democracies weakened, and the fabric of societies radically undermined. This pioneering book shows, once and for all, the direct correlation between the freedoms given to women and the prosperity enjoyed by all.",
