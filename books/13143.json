  "description": "Dr. Kate Drexel had just begun to suspect that the ‘beasts of Sirius’ were far more intelligent than they’d believed when the Sirians escaped containment. What no one hadn’t suspected was the reason behind their amazingly complex genome or that their rapid cell regeneration pointed to more than an extraordinary adaptability. The right thing to do, Kate was sure, was to find them and somehow return them to their home world. She didn’t expect them to find her first. Genre: Futuristic Romance.Rating: Carnal/Erotic. Multiple sexual partners, ménage, adult language and situations.",
