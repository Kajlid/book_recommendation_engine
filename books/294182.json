  "description": "Joel Chandler Harris, author of the Uncle Remus tales, had an interest in preserving the romance and history of his native Georgia. His most notable effort in this area reached fruition in 1896 with the publication of Stories of Georgia, a collection of tales of the state's early days and of some of the men and women who shaped its destiny. Today, more than one hundred years later, the timeless appeal of these stories makes them an interesting and valuable item of Georgiana.",
