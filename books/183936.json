  "description": "Tzipporah Berger is thirty-seven and single, which is practically unheard of in the Orthodox Jewish community she now calls home. Her increasing religiosity and need for kink may have broken up her first marriage, but she’s decided it’s time to try again. And the rabbi’s wife has just the man in mind.Elan Klein is the neighborhood butcher whose intimidating size and gruff manner hint at a deliciously forceful personality. But BDSM isn’t exactly something you discuss during an Orthodox courtship. Will a marriage to Elan solidify her place in the community that she loves and provide the domination and pain Tzipporah craves or will she forever have to rely on flights of fancy to satisfy her needs?Craving Flight is a novella written for the Goodreads BDSM Group's Bring Out Your Kink writing event. Members provided a photo and letter to inspire writers to create an original story and writers picked the prompt that spoke to them most. It will be available exclusively to BDSM Group Members on September 7th and to the general public on September 21st. And best of all? It will be free! Join the BDSM group now to see the prompt that inspired the story (prompt 16)!",
