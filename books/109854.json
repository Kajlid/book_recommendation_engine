  "description": "Saying “I love you'' doesn’t erase the old scars and fears. \"I love you to insanity. I'm not even sure if it's a good thing.'' — Duke Skye is trying to overcome what happened with Sean. Now that she’s slowly healing, both physically and mentally, she’s determined to do something she should have done sooner. She’s meeting twice a week with a new, very young therapist, Dr. Marshall. There, she’s able to talk freely, unwind, and question things. Most of the sessions she talks about herself and her hangups, along with her relationship with Duke, which is still on rocky ground. \"I want to taste his sweat. I want to hear his groans. I want to feel him inside of me.'' — SkyeBut while Skye is slowly getting back on her feet, Duke feels like he's drowning. He’s afraid of pushing her too much, of initiating intimacy, and it’s weighing between them. Moreover, knowing that he's not the one she’s talking to anymore is making him feel things he never thought possible. \"It’s a matter of when I’ll stop fighting.\" — DukeAs days pass, Duke is showing over and over how vulnerable he truly is and how Skye has more power over him than she ever imagined. When Skye sees how they keep hurting each other, she’s determined to do everything in her power to make things right, no matter what the cost. But one thing is still sure; she can count on Duke whenever she needs him, even if they disagree and fight. When Duke loves, he loves with everything he’s made of, the good and the bad. \"Loving her is confusing, making me afraid of myself and what I can do ... because I can break us both.\" — Duke",
