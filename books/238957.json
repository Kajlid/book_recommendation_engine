  "description": "DON’T LOOK UP. THEY KNOW YOUR FACE.Halcyon Slavic is a Christian and a drone-tracker, relying on her independence and society’s apathy to live life her own way. As long as she keeps her faith private, she’s free to believe what she wants. But her second life monitoring Budapest’s massive system of surveillance drones is a short fuse. When a drone appears at her window one night, she knows the fuse is lit, and abandons mainstream society to fight back against the eyes in the sky. But her new life hits her with more than she bargained for. She finds herself hiding in a semi-secret community of Christians who simply want to live upright lives away from the world’s lies and suspicion. These saints of the slums want nothing to do with reckless anti-government fanatics who spend their nights sniping the city’s drones out of the sky. Halcyon hides a double-edged secret. And her hunter has followed her. Can Halcyon manage balancing her new life in a strange community while keeping one eye on the sky? Or will she be caught unawares by this elusive and secret threat from the airspace over her only place of refuge?",
