  "title": "The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America",
  "description": "In the years between the end of WWII & the mid-1950s,Â the popular culture of today was invented in the pulpy, boldly illustrated pages of comic books. But no sooner had comics emerged than they were beaten down by mass bonfires, congressional hearings, & a McCarthyish panic over their unmonitored & uncensored content. Esteemed critic David Hajdu vividly evokes the rise, fall & rise again of comics in this engrossing history.",
