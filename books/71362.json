During the scuffle, Ash is seriously injured with no hope of survival until a mysterious woman appears out of no where. The woman instructs Skye to journey to the Southern Kingdom, a haven built by the surviving members of humanity, if she ever wants to be with Ash again. “Our fates are in your hands. Don’t fail us,” the woman warns Skye before literally vanishing into thin air, taking Ash with her.  Harvester is an action packed novel which follows Skye’s journey of self-discovery and brings into question what it really means to be human.This is a young adult novel which contains some dark elements, language, violence, and mild sexual situations.",
