  "description": "Tad’s trust fund buys him anything and everything he wants. But all the cash in his pocket can’t keep boredom at bay, so he finds his way to the Address, the city’s most exclusive brothel. Tad is ready to play — the man who walks through the door is supposed to be at Tad’s mercy for the rest of the evening.  But from the beginning, the guy doesn’t seem to understand who’s in charge, and from the moment the whore demands Tad call him “Daddy,” all bets are off. In fact, Daddy couldn’t care less about what Tad wants. Instead, he’s more than ready to give his spoiled little boy exactly what he deserves.   This title can also be read in the Rules to Live By anthology.  Word 16,000; page 68",
