  "description": "I never intended Joshua Lars, the sexy-as-sin sculptor to be more than a one-night stand. How was I to know his masterful hands and dominant command would wake the sleeping submissive within me? Any of my friends would have said that Mellie Carson was an independent, successful woman who would never kneel for a man. I’d already chalked my one foray into surrendering my control up to naïve stupidity. I was far too smart now to do it again—or so I thought. Then came Joshua… Determined to resist his powerful draw, I tried to forget him, but Fate—and a killer—had other plans. Now, in Joshua’s arms, I might be safe, but I fear my heart isn’t. Can he save my life while saving my submission?",
