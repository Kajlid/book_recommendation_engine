  "description": "Pain is inevitable, but not all pain is the same. Soulful and honest, Everything is Okay confronts and gives voice to two common mental illnesses: depression and anxiety. Because sometimes what we need more than anything is to feel understood, and know that hope and light are always there - even when life is at its darkest.Sometimes I stare at the bottle. I know I need to take it. It will help. But the darkness has already crept in.",
