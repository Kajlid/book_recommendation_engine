  "description": "After fifteen fearsome years on the page, \"Horrible Histories\" are coming to the small screen - with all the nasty bits intact - of course. In \"Savage Stone Age\" readers can discover the full story: what Stone Age people used instead of toilet paper; why a hole in the skull is good for headaches; and, how to make a Stone Age mummy. Join Rattus Rattus and the gang for the funniest, fastest, nastiest and daftest ride through history you're ever likely to see.",
