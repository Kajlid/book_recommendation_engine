  "title": "Patriarchy",
  "description": "This book deals with the nature, origin, hermeneutics and sociology of patriarchy. Reviewing the sources available, it discusses the historical contexts which have nurtured patriarchal societies. Finally it applies these ideas to Indian history and sociology and examines how caste has interacted synergistically with patriarchy in India. A useful text for students as well as for the general reader.‘Today, the term 'patriarchy' is used somewhat differently. It is not only a descriptive term that explains how specific societies construct male authority and power, but also an analytical category. The transformation of patriarchy from a descriptive to an analytical category happened in a specific global historical context, the 1970s, that gave birth to a rousing feminist intellectual culture.’ This book forms a part of Theorizing Feminism Series edited by Maithreyi Krishnaraj.",
