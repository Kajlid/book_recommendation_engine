  "description": "When Roxanne Murdoch took the place of her absent employee and delivered a 'belly-gram' herself, she never expected to spend New Year's Eve locked in a bank with the vice-president she'd been sent to surprise. Yet there she was, a respectable businesswoman dressed like a harem girl, barricaded against a howling blizzard with the devastating Bram Tyler, trying to extinguish the fire he'd ignited within. Soon he'd crack her icy facade and melted her cautious reserve. But what would happen at blizzard's end when passion faced reality! The entire book is the story of Roxanne and Bram - the dialogue and verbal sparring between these two is a standout with sexual tension to spare.
