Only sweet, gentle Matilda knows. Because she's the one playing all the jokes! She's a genius with idiot parents—and she's having a great time driving them crazy. But at school things are different. At school there's Miss Trunchbull, two hundred pounds of kid-hating bully. Pull a trick on \"The Trunchbull\" and she'll string you up.
