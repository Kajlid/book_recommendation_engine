I want the future he and I have spent hours talking about, but I’ve never had the courage to reach out and grab it. Now I do.  I knew on our first date; she was the girl I was going to marry. I told her so every chance I could get. Even went as far as asking more times than I can count, but never on one knee. I knew that she wasn’t ready, but I needed her to know that I was.  I’ve been planning for weeks, wanting to make everything perfect. I took her words to a whole other level, and now I’m worried I’ve gone too far.  This is a 30k word companion novella to the Southern Heart Series.",
