  "title": "I, Rene Tardi, Prisoner Of War In Stalag 2B",
  "description": "In the first of two graphic novel volumes, Jacques Tardi — with four decades of cartooning and almost two dozen graphic novels behind him — tells Rene Tardi's story, masterfully recreating historical and personal details with remarkable fidelity, guided by extensive research and his father’s notes. Featuring some of Jacques's most intense and meticulous drawing, punctuated by somber grays and punches of red and blue rendered beautifully by Rachel Tardi, Stalag 2B is a personal and artistic triumph.",
