  "title": "Righteous Release",
  "description": "David Chambers is a member of the religious group 'the Eternal Fellowship'. Their beliefs forbid any involvement with the outside world, and any temptation to embark upon a life with the 'wordlies' is considered a betrayal of the Lord. David's loyalty to the Eternal Fellowship is discovered when marriage looms ever closer; a realisation that he is not destined to wed a woman who was chosen for him and, with thoughts of exploring the big wide world, he makes a decision that will ultimately turn his entire family and friends against him. Righteous Release will capture the mind of the reader with an engrossing tale of a young man's convictions as he enters a world that is far from the life that he has been accustomed to. Outside of the Eternal Fellowship awaits the world of politics, and one that will open the door to the future he has chosen.",
