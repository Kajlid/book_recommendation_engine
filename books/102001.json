  "description": "Dear Author,WTF! One minute I’m making dinner (for one), the next there’s some incessant banging on my door and the next, I’m on the floor with him on top of me, kissing, rubbing, grinding… something happened… something must have happened. I’ve never seen him look like that. I’ve never seen him look at ME like that! And never in a million years did I think he’d be kissing ME! What is going on!Photo Description: Two shirtless men are writhing on top of one another on a hardwood floor. Personal effects seem scattered around in the men’s anxiousness to be with one another. The guy on the bottom has a massive tattoo spanning his rib cage and the guy on top seems to be in raptures.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love Has No Boundaries\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story.",
