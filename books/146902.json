  "title": "The Violent Father & Son: A True Story of Tragic Loss",
  "description": "“I looked across the court, their eyes were cold and arrogant, they didn’t feel guilty for what they’d done.”  From the author that wrote the best-selling The Violent Stepfather 1, 2 and 3 comes The Violent Father & Son. The story continues with the family who suffered at the hands of their violent stepfather. They thought life could only get better, they truly believed that the worst was behind them. If only they knew of the horror that was heading in their direction and the heartache they were about to suffer from a shocking incident.  It was just like any other night, until those distinctive knocks on the door… life would never be the same again…  The true story of tragic loss and unbelievable violence…  A lack of justice…  A family can so easily be broken…  “This story played with a range of emotions, I felt anger, sadness and outraged especially at the climax and inside the hospital I felt the emotions pouring out of me. Amazing insight into a traumatic childhood dealing with horrific incidences all the while the family sticking together through difficult times. Salvatore gets more brilliant with every story.” – Jo Johns Author.",
