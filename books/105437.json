  "description": "A paranormal erotic novella/short story (8700 words).Our heroine, known only as “Beloved,” has had it with vampires. Or so she thinks. After hightailing it out of frozen Poughkeepsie, New York for Mexico in an effort to escape both winter and the loser vampire ex-boyfriends she’s sick and tired of fending off, she finds something she never thought she’d encounter under the blazing tropical sun—a vampire god.Enter Julio, an immortal Aztec god that blends elements of the Western vampire with the chupacabra. It’s lust at first sight when Beloved lays eyes on him in human form on a white-sanded Mexican beach, and despite all attempts to resist, she finds that at last she has found her destiny as his mate. Wild otherworldly sex ensues that takes them to a parallel universe where the power of the ancient Aztecs blends with modern bloodlust to create a new level of passion, and where Beloved finds a new role as the Chupacabra Queen.",
