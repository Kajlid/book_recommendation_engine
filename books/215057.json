  "description": "In this unique inquiry into the deepest incarnation of love, author Richard Matzkin has looked to his extraordinary, three decade long marriage to Alice as a living laboratory to research the elements that comprise a truly loving, magnificent partnership. He has discovered 39 Loving promises, statements of intention you pledge to yourself, not to your partner that are the behavioral components of a deep, abiding love. These Promises are a profound path to transform your relationship into a magnificent one. Richard Matzkin has a magnificent relationship with his wife Alice. He is a former men’s group leader, director of a domestic violence program, program director of a psychiatric hospital and meditation teacher. He is also an accomplished sculptor, jazz drummer and author, with Alice, of the award winning book, THE ART OF Celebrating the Authentic Aging Self. “Immensely practical. I cannot imagine a book that holds more potential to improve relationships. Just reflect on one of these promises a day and the sky is the limit” -Stephen G. Post.
