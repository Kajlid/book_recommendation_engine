  "description": "Things are a lot messier at Hillcrest than I believed. I can’t trust anyone, not even myself, and especially not the handsome students around me.HU was supposed to help me move on, be a fresh start, but then I walked into a feud between Sawyer and Declan. The hatred between them is palpable, and yet I find myself in the middle, somehow. And Travis? Don’t get me started on that one. He might be sexy, but he gives a new definition to the word psycho.None of them are innocent, I now know, but what their crimes are is anyone’s guess. Am I the only innocent one around here? No, no I’m not.My heart is torn between these broken, beautiful bullies, and I don’t know what to think. My heart, it turns out, isn’t the only thing on the line. What happened that night in the dorm was only the beginning, and my life is about to change forever with what I discover.Travis was right. We are all monsters at Hillcrest, even me. **Freak is a darker romance, meaning there are topics that might offend you. Self-harm, suicide, stalking, and more to come in future books. Be warned.** A Dark College Bully Romance.",
