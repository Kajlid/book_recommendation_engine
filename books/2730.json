  "description": "'Jeffrey,' the chief said, 'this morning an eleven-year-old boy stumbled upon the bodies of three men linked to the Giovanni crime family. These men were small-time thugs, but a witness from the neighborhood spotted a black Lincoln town car speeding around the corner just blocks away from the scene.' 'What is the witness's name?' 'It was Sean Shadow.' Forensic detective Sean Shadow has been working for the New York City Police Department for twenty-seven years. He's just three away from retirement, but when the city falls into peril due to a severe tax shortage, he loses his position as the department's lead detective. He's replaced by a recent grad named Jeffrey Robinson, whose cocky nature instantly rubs Sean the wrong way. When Jeffrey is assigned to a triple homicide case of which Sean is the only witness, the bitter detective decides to feed Jeffrey false information and crack the case on his own to prove his worth. After Sean discovers that the murdered men are associates of Rigo Giovanni, the city's most notorious crime boss, he spins out of control, fueled by his resentment for Robinson as well as his hatred for Giovanni. As he searches for justice, Sean moves outside the law, putting the pieces together for a case against Giovanni. But can he gather enough hard evidence to put Giovanni behind bars for life before someone is killed? Kirby Taylor's Broken Justice is a suspenseful detective novel perfect for lovers of criminal action dramas.",
