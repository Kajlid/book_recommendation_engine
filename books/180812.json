  "description": "The fabric of our life is stitched together with precious threads of captured memories, stirring emotions, and lasting events which are permanently etched across the tablet of our mind. What if those life-forging memories were gone? Would we no longer exist or would life start anew? To even imagine such a catastrophic possibility is frightening, but for Emma, a young woman battling brain cancer, the challenge was all too real. Her tale is fictional but it mirrors those of thousands of individuals who have traveled down strange paths of new memories and forgotten love. Emma's story begins 15 years before being admitted to a well-known Portland hospital for brain surgery. It was a different time, devoted to higher learning and the tender devotion of her sweetheart, Mark. Their union had been loving...but not lasting, ending suddenly at Emma's behest. Mark, now a brilliant psychologist at a prestigious hospital, often looks back, weighing the good and bad of those days to help him focus on the future. He has tried to move on, dating Lea, a young intern, who has helped him to once again feel...and hope. Destiny brings three star-crossed lovers together to share in the rarest of moments. Twisted together through time and circumstances, Mark and Emma explore long-shrouded emotions while trying to discover their past. Learn the true meaning of melancholy in the pages of this unique novel, and discover what it is to have loved and 'lost.'",
