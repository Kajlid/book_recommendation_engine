  "description": "Find a gay man in a gay bar. Matt's sure that should be a lot easier than it actually is.Matt's having a run of bad luck - one that's lasted ever since he stepped out of the closet. An uncanny ability to home in on the only straight guy in a bar room full of gay men really isn't doing his sex life any favours. A knack for picking complete jerks whenever he does stumble upon a genuinely gay man isn't helping either.But, this time everything is going to be different. This time Matt's absolutely sure his gaydar has guided him towards a completely sane, entirely gay man - which is why he's arranged to meet him in the gents' room in five minutes.What could possibly go wrong?",
