  "description": "In a bid to claim his soul, an angel and a demon argue over the fate of an ancient Roman soldier.   The decision is made to bring him back to life, not in Ancient Rom, but in modern day Colorado.  Here he must complete the seemingly impossible challenges laid out before him, under the watchful eyes of the celestial duo.   Without a sword and shield to protect him, the warrior must rely on his new-found ability to read, and a little bit of divine inspiration in this humorous tale of the power of a second chance.",
