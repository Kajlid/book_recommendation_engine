But how do you find someone who has vanished without a trace?Something strange is happening in the small mountain town of Serenity, Tennessee.

With them are new partners Dante Swann, a medium, and Robbie Hodge, a telepath.The town is already on the edge of panic, but the mysterious events take a sinister turn when a body unrelated to the missing persons case surfaces and one of the SCU agents vanishes.
