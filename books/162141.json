Five years ago, Cal thought he was doing the right thing. Now Katy-along with her mouthwatering miniature cupcakes-are awakening feelings too irresistible to ignore. All Cal wants is to cherish and protect her. Or will his guilt and Katy's reluctance to trust keep their chance reunion from becoming a mission possible?Look for A Place in Her Heart by Trish Milburn, along with two more free ebooks inspired by real-life Never Too Late by Christi Barth, and A Wing & A Prayer by AndreaLaurence.",
