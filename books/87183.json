  "title": "A Commonplace Book of Pie",
  "description": "\"If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.\"—Carl SaganPoet and baker Kate Lebo takes her cue from Carl Sagan's quote to reinterpret everything we thought we knew about pie. Lebo calls the book \"a collection of facts, both real and imagined, about pie.\" A mix of prose poems, recipes, fantasy zodiac, and ephemera balance Lebo’s technical baker know-how with lyrical ruminations on the real and imagined relationships between pie and those who love it. The book includes two dozen watercolors and illustrations by artist Jessica Lynn Bonin that put pie and baking in a contemporary, feminist context.*Check out the newly released book trailer for ACBOP: http://vimeo.com/75490017It's sweetness, snark, and sincere contemplation all mixed with a secret ingredient.Kate Lebo Kate Lebo makes poems and pies in Seattle, Washington. Her writing has appeared in Best New Poets, Gastronomica, and Poetry Northwest among other journals, and she's currently at work on a pie cookbook for Sasquatch Books, forthcoming in 2014. She teaches creative writing at Richard Hugo House and pie making at Pie School, her cliche-busting pastry academy.
