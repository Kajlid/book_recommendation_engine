  "description": "Jacob Linden was only a child when the gruesome tragedy had transpired—and now, as a man—the horrific and scarring memory of his past may not only come back to rip into him, it may be coming for you! Learn of the events that Jacob cannot bare to speak, and discover the inner workings of one of the world’s most murderous and secretive dog-breeding-to-fight-and-kill cults that is sure to leave you questioning your safety and your sanity. As Joel Hunter Gun says at the beginning of this story, “Warning: this work of fiction may not be suitable for the weak of mind or the weak of heart,” and that could not be more true. This terrifying thrill-ride of a story may, indeed, leave you Scarred for Life! (Approximate, average reading time 20 minutes. ASIN: B00OKRDEG6. This is an alternate cover edition.)",
