  "description": "High school literature teacher Grace Berry is an expert on Shakespearean love, but she knows almost nothing about real-life romance. She has no time to learn either, as she's busy battling overbearing parents, a bullying principal, and a stubborn father.Then she suddenly finds out that award-winning author Lincoln Atwood is coming to take over her classes. No way will she surrender her authority to a hotshot male writer who doesn't know the first thing about poetry. Even if he is sinfully sexy.After making a deal with his estranged brother, Lincoln is forced to stay in Bliss Cove for over a month. He'd much rather be racing sled dogs or mountain biking, so why not take a teaching gig to kill the time?But Lincoln's belief that teaching will be \"easy\" is quickly proven wrong after he confronts the intriguing Grace with her embroidered sweaters and spine of steel. And when he learns about the sizable gap in Grace's education, the plot thickens considerably.Too bad this beautiful teacher is off-limits...or is she?",
