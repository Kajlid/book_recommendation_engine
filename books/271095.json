  "description": "Four sexy vampires. One mortal-born witch. An ancient secret that will test them all.I'm not a very good witch. It's not my fault. Being born a mortal sucks and my black cat familiar follows me around like a security blanket. All the other coven brats make fun of me.My vampires don't seem to mind. They pose as my mentors and get Aunt Sandra off my back. My initiation into the Royal Covens is only three days away. They're supposed to teach me how to hide what I really am: a reincarnation of some ancient and powerful witch. I think they're just telling me that to get in my pants. What my vampires don't hide is their hunger for me, both for my blood and my body. That dangerous kind of thrill is going to get me into serious trouble. Captivated: Royal Covens Book 1 is a medium-burn reverse harem romance and part of a 3-book series.",
