  "description": "Tiny is the leader of The Skulls and the main protector of Fort Wills, but that wasn’t always the case. He has a dark past, and it’s about to come and bite him in the ass. Eva cannot stay with a man who’ll keep her in the dark. She’s the daughter of the man who runs the underground fighting circuit in Vegas, and there is iron in her that none of the Skulls suspects. Backing down from what she wants has never been in her nature, but Tiny is too far gone. There’s no hope of holding him. When Tiny and his boys are attacked on a drug run, he has no choice but to head to the woman he loves. Tiny doesn’t know which of his men are alive or dead. He only knows his past has finally caught up with him. But how can he go back home without his daughter’s man? Lives will be tested, and lives will be lost. Tiny will be pushed to the breaking point, and he’ll have to make a choice. Who can he save when all seems lost?",
