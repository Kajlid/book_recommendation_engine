  "description": "\"Quarrelling erupted. The faeries bickered amongst themselves. The magpies and squirrels tossed spiteful comments at each other across the clearing. The mushrooms started to wilt in the nasty atmosphere created by the squabbling. And the Smashbasher crept closer, gobbling up the forest, chomping the old ones, crushing and crunching its way toward The Linney.\" Will the forest creatures find a way to save their homes? Can they put their squabbles aside and come up with a plan to stop the Smashbasher? You can find out by sitting down somewhere comfortable and reading this book. Heartwood is a full colour, illustrated first chapter book for children aged between 7 and 9 years old. A magical story set in an ancient forest, Heartwood is a beautiful introduction to reading independently. The book provides a useful stimulus for teachers and schools as part of a curriculum on environmental issues. Heartwood also explores conflict resolution, creating together and resilience.",
