  "description": "I wondered what my life would have been like if we had never moved to the ho-dunk town of Spring Valley, Illinois. Sure the internet service was splotchy, there was nothing but miles of wheat fields, and I probably wouldn't be faced with death at every corner. My only neighbor in this god forsaken town was...well there really was only one to describe him, hot as hell. With his sinful dark looks, unusually silver eyes, and kissable lips, there was something about him that was more than meets the eye. Of course I was determined to find out. Chase Winters might be drool-worthy, but he was also insufferable, arrogant and...in short a d-bag. Our relationship was anything but love at first sight. Not even close. There was something weird about the family living next door. What I hadn't expected to find was an underworld of trouble. Chase and his cousins Lexi and Travis are Divisa, half-demon, half-human. Getting them angry was hardly in my best interest, not if I wanted to live. As it turned out, that might be the least of my problems. I've been tagged by hell. Now every ugly, nasty being from hades was on my trail. I have suddenly became a magnet for demon disaster, and the only way I am getting out of this alive was by putting my life in the demon spawn's hands. One wrong decision and my butt was toast.",
