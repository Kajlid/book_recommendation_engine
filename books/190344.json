Worse yet, she seems totally immune to my charms.I love getting a rise out of her. And for some reason, she always gets a rise out of me.She thinks she is better than a degenerate like me. She might be right. But I'm not giving up until I take the prissy know it all on the ride of her life- on me. I can't wait to see the look on her face when I've blown her mind six or seven times in one night.Trouble is, I've gotten in deeper than I meant to. And I don't know if I ever want out.HEAT is a standalone novel with no cheating and a guaranteed HEA!",
