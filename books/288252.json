  "description": "Have you ever wondered how soulmates fall in love after they meet? One touch was all it took to pierce through the hatred, the revenge, the payback that kept Reaper’s sanity in check. Unable to bear to be touched, Ginny breezed through his safeguards, stirring the flames of desire and trying to make him believe love was possible again, while his tortured soul just wanted to find the peace he had promised himself once all his enemies were there to keep him company in hell. One look was all it took for Ginny to recognize her soulmate. Now she was determined to show him that love, mercy, and forgiveness would bring the light back into his life. Her warrior was no longer fighting alone to battle his nightmares, and this Kentucky woman wasn’t afraid of stealing his heart and making it hers. One love that would have to be strong enough to overcome Reaper’s biggest enemy—himself.  Having lost faith in love, The Last Riders, and himself, it was only when Ginny committed a desperate selfless act of love that Reaper realized that, to save her, he was going to have to put his life on the line again. This time if he lost, not only would he lose Ginny, but the Last Riders forever.  How was he supposed to know his wrath could cost him everything?",
