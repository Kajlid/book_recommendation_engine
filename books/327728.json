  "description": "When I woke up this morning, I became aware of two things:One, I felt hungover, and I knew I hadn’t had a drop of liquor.And two, I was pretty sure I had accidentally married someone.I, Olivia Sutton, have a Ten Year Plan. It’s air-tight and written in permanent ink. You know what’s not on the plan? Getting married to the man I used to love to hate. But when my sister’s pre-wedding trip goes horribly wrong, I find myself legally bound to my old nemesis, tech sensation Lachlan Hayes. Lachlan pitches a plan to temporarily stay married. It is absolutely insane? Yes. But it has the potential to fix so many problems for both of us—and create even bigger ones.As secrets unravel between us, I discover there's more to my nerd husband than arrogance and a party-boy reputation. Falling for this guy is definitely not on the Ten Year Plan, but living in the same house? Acting like I’ve given my heart to my husband? Public kisses that make me forget my name? When our fake marriage becomes all too real, Lachlan and I find ourselves crossing lines we swore we wouldn’t. It has me wondering if I can walk away from Lachlan when our time is up.Or if I’ll be the first to fall.",
