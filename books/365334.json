  "title": "Good Wives: Image and Reality in the Lives of Women in Northern New England, 1650-1750",
  "description": "This enthralling work of scholarship strips awayÂ abstractions to reveal the hidden--and not always stoic--face of the \"goodwives\" of colonial America. In these pages we encounter the awesome burdens--and the considerable power--of a New England housewife's domestic life and witness her occasional forays into the world of men. We see her borrowing from her neighbors, loving her husband, raising--and, all too often, mourning--her children, and even attaining fame as a heroine of frontier conflicts or notoriety as a murderess. Painstakingly researched, lively with scandal and homely detail, Good Wives is history at its best.",
