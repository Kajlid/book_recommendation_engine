  "description": "UnknownCan I become the man they need me to be? KnoxI learned early in life that love is an illusion-- it’s a tool people use to get what they want. I never trusted anyone until I met the three guys that would become my best friends, my true family. Aside from them, I’ve kept my guard up...until her. The last week of our senior year in high school, I fell hard and fast for a girl I had no business wanting. We spent one incredible night together...and then, nothing. I awoke alone the next morning with no trace of her in my bed. To say I’ve been fucking up my life ever since is an understatement. I come from chaos, so that's what I’ll become. There was only one time I thought I had a shot at something better and...well, look how that turned out. So, I’ll drink and fuck my way through college, and worry about the consequences later. But unexpectedly, the woman I feel for turns back up in my life, and it turns out that our night together had consequences of its own. Unknown is a full-length novel with a hot-mess hero, a feisty heroine, a secret baby and an HEA. It is the second inter-connected STANDALONE in the Bainbridge University Series and it follows Uncovered. For the best reader experience, they should be read in order",
