  "description": "Having paid a cruel price, after the failed quest to Aquarius, Len is finally forced to take charge. However, increasingly out of his depth, he consistently leads his cause from disaster to disaster. Dogged by catastrophe and convinced the predatory Dark Destruction targets him, he eventually abandons his pursuit for the Imperial Throne. Deserted to stand alone, against the insidious forces which tear the empire apart, Kai is convinced to take command, in order to preserve what remains of the realm. But after inheriting dark secrets and ancient promises of prophecy, a ferocious force, which otherwise lay dormant in him, is awoken. As it becomes ever easier to forsake the light, Kai fights the desire to turn his ever-growing authority against those he despises. Despite differences, difficulties and temptations, his only salvation lies in his love for Anna, however, the imperial heirsâ€™ discovery, that he hides a violent past and dangerous alter-ego, leads to confrontation, betrayal, abduction and true, terrible power.",
