  "description": "Who thought writing ‘LOSERS’ on a menu could lead to an affair of love notes?It didn’t start out as love. How could it when I vowed never to fall in love.Reef Burton, the sexy blue-eyed Australian football player, and his mates are definitely not ‘Losers’, yet writing it on a menu gave me a reason to smile. Only it didn’t make it to the trash. He returns to the restaurant where I work wearing his killer smile. I wasn’t to know those squiggly lines and arrows meant something—an offensive play his football team learned at an earlier training session. He’ll see what I wrote. Apart from it being awkward the next time I serve him, he could also report me to my boss.I can’t lose my job when in hindsight, I need to pay all the bills rolling in and care for my father.I’m thankful he kept it as our secret.Until he left me a note.Responding will only lead to more trouble.So, when Mr Blue Eyes-Blond Surfy-Hair gives me one of his spine-tingling looks, how can I resist?* COCKY NOTES is set in Australia and takes place before Cocky Bastard.",
