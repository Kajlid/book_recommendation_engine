  "title": "Haiku Dream: 100 Short-form Poems",
  "description": "Haiku is a form of poetry that originated in Japan, proliferating from the sixteenth century to present day. Now a global art, many different styles and practices have emerged, though traditional structure remains largely the same. In English, each poem consists of three lines that usually total seventeen syllables in 5-7-5 format. Customarily, Haiku use natural imagery to establish a peaceful vignette or illustrate a simple truth.This original collection by author D. Elby holds to these patterns, with an abundance of poems meant to be appreciated mindfully, spiritually, and with a sense of catharsis. But you can enjoy this title any way you like! Perfect as a modern introduction to the art, this book makes a great read at any pace.",
