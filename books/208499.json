  "description": "Save a horse. Ride a cowboy.  Bull riding is dangerous as hell, but that’s half the fun. Guts, glory, and cute country girls lined up for days. It may only take eight seconds to win, but I can go all night.  Yeah, I’ve broken almost every bone in my body at some point, but I’ve been the World Rodeo Champion two years running. Nothing’s gonna keep me from making it three.  Not even Mae Guthrie, a spitfire who’s as hot as a Texas wildfire and one hell of a distraction - and who acts like she doesn’t remember me at all.  ...I’ll just have to remind her that we’ve been acquainted.  I bet she’ll remember once she’s screaming my name.   Jackson Cody nearly ruined my life.  I was dumb, drunk, and eighteen. He was a rodeo star with a smile that could melt steel, and I was this close to giving him everything.  Thank god for that close call with the cops.  I learned my lesson, grew up, and moved on. Now I’ve got my first huge assignment as a photographer, and if I play it right, this rodeo shoot could make my whole career.  There’s just one problem, and it’s got spurs, boots, and hazel eyes.  He’s grown up too - Lord has he grown up - and he’s only gotten hotter, cockier, and more dangerously alluring since the last time I saw him.  But now I’m older, wiser, and not interested in a fling with a cowboy…  ...right?  It’s only a couple of days. How hard can he be to resist?  Ride is a 90,000 word standalone romance, and it’s got a happily-ever-after ending and explicit scenes that’ll make you need to turn the AC up.",
