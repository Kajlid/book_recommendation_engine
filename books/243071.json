And they’ve returned home with the only chance the Windsworn have of defeating the Smelterborn.  Hope, however, will prove to be short-lived and bittersweet.

As the fighting begins, a small band makes their way east on a desperate quest: to destroy the source of the Smelterborn’s power once and for all. Chances are, none of them will make it out alive.  Eva and Fury will be tested like never before. Heroes will fall. Kingdoms will shatter. The price of victory has never been higher.  Will Eva succeed in driving back the darkness or will everything she loves be crushed beneath the iron fist of the Smelterborn?  Don’t miss the epic conclusion of the Gryphon Riders Trilogy!",
