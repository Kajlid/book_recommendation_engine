  "description": "After a night of wild sex with a total stranger, Taylor Scott never expected to see the man again. What a shock when he walked into her office weeks later as the representative of the father she never knew she had, a man who'd left her his entire empire. With her father's killers still at large and vultures hovering to pick apart his massive corporation, Noah Cantrell soon becomes the only person she can trust. He's also the man who teaches her the pleasures of erotic love, demanding her body even as he sets barriers to any kind of personal relationship â€” because Noah has a dark secret he never shares, one that prevents him from ever opening himself up to anyone again except in bed.As the two follow a treacherous path through the world of corporate intrigue, a path that takes them from the corporate boardroom to the jungles of Mexico, with the sex growing hotter by the night, can Taylor find a way break through that wall he's built around himself?",
