  "description": "Jen, a shy and quiet girl of almost 16, is deathly afraid to talk to boys her age and only feels comfortable enough to be her true self around her small circle of friends. Despite the pressures society places on women and teenage girls to look perfect, Jen navigates her way through the ups and downs of attempting to improve her self-esteem, but she experiences many bumps along the way. Can she improve her grades enough to be allowed to visit her cousin in Hawaii? Will she overcome her shyness and gain self-confidence? What about the guy she has a huge crush on? Will she ever be confident enough to talk to him? Will she ever fall in love? Discover what happens as she tries to empower, motivate and inspire herself to become the young woman she's always wanted to be.",
