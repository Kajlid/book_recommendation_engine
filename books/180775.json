  "title": "Mindfulness in Action: Making Friends with Yourself through Meditation and Everyday Awareness",
  "description": "“One of the great spiritual leaders of all times” offers mindfulness meditations and guidance on how to bring awareness into everyday life with “an illuminating wisdom that dances through every page” (Tara Brach, PhD, author of Radical Acceptance)   The rewards of mindfulness practice are well reduced stress, improved concentration, and an overall sense of well-being. But those benefits are just the beginning. Mindfulness in action—mindfulness applied throughout life—can help us work more effectively with life’s challenges, expanding our appreciation and potential for creative engagement.   This guide to mindful awareness through meditation provides all the basics to get you started, but also goes deeper to address the questions that naturally arise as your practice matures and further insight arises. A distillation of teachings on the subject by one of the great meditation masters of our time, this book serves as an introduction to the practice as well as a guide to the ongoing mindful journey.   “Mindfulness is the direct path to insight—and no one has ever illuminated that wonderful path more skillfully than Chögyam Trungpa.” —Pema Chödrön",
