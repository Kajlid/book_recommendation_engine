  "title": "The Quest for Corvo: An Experiment in Biography",
  "description": "One day in 1925 a friend asked A. J. A. Symons if he had read Fr. Rolfe's Hadrian the Seventh . He hadn't, but soon did, and found himself entranced by the novel -- \"a masterpiece\"-- and no less fascinated by the mysterious person of its all-but-forgotten creator. The Quest for Corvo is a hilarious and heartbreaking portrait of the strange Frederick Rolfe, self-appointed Baron Corvo, an artist, writer, and frustrated aspirant to the priesthood with a bottomless talent for self-destruction. But this singular work, subtitled \"an experiment in biography,\" is also a remarkable self-portrait, a study of the obsession and sympathy that inspires the biographer's art.",
