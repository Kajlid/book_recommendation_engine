  "description": "Tristan and Ushna are building a secure infrastructure in their rapidly growing tribe and family. Tristan is plagued by dreams he barely remembers. The return of childhood friends is anything but joyous. The mechanizations of assassins are uncovered. The Magi and Warrior Orders are in chaos. The children of Tristan’s former Twin Flame are winning a place in their hearts as Tristan’s nemesis, Daniel Sullivan, causes more confusion. Amidst it all, Tristan struggles with the urge to bind Ushna to him but he can’t because Ushna already has a Flame waiting for rebirth. Tristan would do anything to protect that bond, even if it means losing Ushna in the next life time unless he remembers his dreams of the forgotten.",
