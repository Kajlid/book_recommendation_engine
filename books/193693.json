  "description": "Superheroes exist Driven, honest, courageous… true heroes. They live among us, and all over the world, they save lives. Their stories are told in hushed tones to rapt audiences, over and over again, myths of epic proportions.  This is not that kind of story  Jolene Faraday is the girl next door, the type of woman who will babysit your kids or lend you twenty bucks when you get into a bind. She takes care of her mother, works her way through college, and even escorts her elderly friend to church. But no one knows the other side of her story. Jolene is also the Detroit area’s most infamous, infuriating burglar, robbing the mansions of the wealthy and making a mockery of the law enforcement officials who vow that each job will be her last. She thrives on the chaos, the infamy, the pure thrill of every heist she pulls off. And then one day, it happens. Across the globe, a new wave of ordinary people find themselves with super powers. Some hide, afraid of what they’ve become. Some become heroes; others, villains. Jolene just becomes a better crook. And suddenly, it’s not just police officers after her. She’s officially under the jurisdiction of StrikeForce, Detroit’s supernatural law enforcement force, an agency shrouded in mystery. As her actions become more audacious and the world begins to see that she is far more dangerous than they ever realized, she finds herself on StirkeForce’s most wanted list. Which leaves her with a choice to make: learn how to become a hero, or embrace life as a super villain.",
