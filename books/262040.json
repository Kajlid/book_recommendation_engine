  "description": "There's a kind of debt you can't ever pay off, not entirely. And that's the kind of debt Dwight owes Gail. The girls of Old Town have their own family values, their own laws-and when someone too dumb to know better breaks them, an example needs to be set. Dwight's got his own reasons for taking the job, and deadly little Miho . . . Miho likes to play with them a little first.",
