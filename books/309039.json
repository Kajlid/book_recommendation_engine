On the way down it burns like whiskey, coats your throat like a love song, and enters your belly with the force of a hurricane.I told myself never again.I thought I had put those ghosts behind me, but some secrets don’t stay buried forever.Fate has a way of forcing you to face them, and Sasha was the curveball I never saw coming.I didn’t want to fall for her.  In fact, I was determined not to, but she danced her way into my heart with her pink glittered Converse, and the sweet taste of peppermint. She’s way too young, and chasing something I can’t give her, but that doesn’t stop me from wanting her. If I give into how I feel, will we last the summer, or are we bound to burn?Bound To Burn is the 4th book in the Blood & Bone series. Although it can be read as a standalone, the books should be read in order, for the best reader experience.",
