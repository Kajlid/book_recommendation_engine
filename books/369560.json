  "title": "On Having No Head: Zen and the Rediscovery of the Obvious",
  "description": "Headlessness, the experience of \"no-self\" that mystics of all times have aspired to, is an instantaneous way of \"waking up\" and becoming fully aware of one's real and abiding nature. Douglas Harding, the highly respected mystic-philosopher, describes his first experience of headlessness in \"On Having No Head,\" the classic work first published in 1961. In this book, he conveys the immediacy, simplicity, and practicality of the \"headless way,\" placing it within a Zen context, while also drawing parallels to practices in other spiritual traditions. If you wish to experience the freedom and clarity that results from firsthand experience of true Being, then this book will serve as a practical guide to the rediscovery of what has always been present.",
