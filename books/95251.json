You need to read the others in the Songs of Submission Series*Sequence OneBegTeaseSubmitSequence TwoControlThe Songs of Dominance were released as an experiment. They were traded peer-to-peer on the Goodreads group, CD Canaries, and on my Facebook page.But the stories have become canonical, and things are revealed here that will be come important later, so I feel they need to reach a larger audience.Please read these after Submit, or you're going to run into major spoilers. It's best if you read before Control, but not a big deal if you read Control first.",
