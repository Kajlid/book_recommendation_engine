  "description": "With over two billion adherents worldwide, Christianity is the worldâ€™s largest religion. However, with a multitude of denominations, and a huge variety of opinions on many of its central tenets, it can be difficult to obtain a balanced overview of the faith. Renowned theologian and bestselling author Keith Ward draws from his vast array of experience and knowledge to provide a unique and authoritative introduction for the simply curious and for those seeking a deeper understanding of this complex faith. Examining differing Christian perspectives on fifteen major themes which range from Creation to conceptions of the Trinity, Ward reveals a religion which is united by a common belief, despite being stunningly multifaceted, as he encourages readers to think creatively about a tradition whose impact has been felt in the most remote areas of the planet.",
