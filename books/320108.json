Now that she has my attention—now that I have her scent—I want more than one taste.

It’s my birthday but my new boy toy canceled our date. I envisioned a wild weekend for two… and nothing as changed. I have every intention of finding a man to unwrap me like the gift I am. There’s no shame in shaking what my mama gave me to get who I want. I’m on the hunt, but this time I might be prey for a mafioso.",
