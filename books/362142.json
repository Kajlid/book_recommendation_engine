  "description": "Brodie Duncan expected a week vacation with his girlfriend Melanie on their first cruise to Alaska. What Brodie didn't know was that Melanie had no intention of joining him. Stunned at being left standing on the massive cruise-liner as Melanie made her escape to the mainland, Brodie stood with his cell phone in his hand staring in horror as she hailed a cab and vanished, telling him they were through. Stranded, on his own, and feeling completely self-conscious about it, Brodie convinced himself he should make the best of a bad situation. Maybe have a fling. No strings attached. What he didnâ€™t bargain for was a man as appealing as Julian Richards. Julian was trapped in a bad relationship with a selfish woman he was starting to resent. Meeting the luscious blue eyes of the tall, dark and handsome Brodie Duncan caused a reaction in Julian that shocked him. Instantly attracted to each other, Julian began having the same desire to play with fire on this week-long Alaskan cruise. What neither of them expected was the depth of their feelings for each other and the chance at finding a soul mate. Within days the men turned a typical Glacier Bay bound cruise into the steamy Love Boat, and gave a whole new meaning to the phrase, Inside Passage.",
