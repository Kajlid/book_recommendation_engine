  "description": "The most popular and perhaps the greatest of Maupassant's full-length novels, A Woman's Life is the story of the unfortunate Jeanne, a Norman gentlewoman. Avarice and lechery, cruelty and greed, conspire against Jeanne wherever she goes.Maupassant exposes the evil around Jeanne with characteristic detachment and precision, yet his pessimism is, as always, qualified by passages of great lyric beauty, and by the touching sympathy and tenderness with which he portrays his heroine.",
