Holding their triggers down their weapons pumped forty bullets straight into her. Glass seemed unaffected by the shells, not even flinching as they hit her. She walked slowly up to the brothers and blew towards them. The bullets flew out of her mouth and bounced off the men's faces. S and M shuddered under the onslaught, putting their arms up to protect themselves.\"You're under my control and will do exactly what I say,\" Mrs. Constance ordered. Glass turned and stepped towards her.\"You killed Windy. Would you like to taste death?\" Glass asked in a whisper.Mrs. Constance had no idea what this mirror creature was talking about, but then she had killed so many people it was often difficult to remember all their names.Book #2 Sapphire Breaking Glass &Book #3 Gold Terror in Mind are now available on Kindle",
