  "description": "DC Renee’s Scrubbed is a heart-felt, emotional, fun, and sexy contemporary romance written in K. Bromberg’s Everyday Heroes World project.It was supposed to be a straight-forward contest. Everyday heroes. May the best one win.I was going to shine, to show my own hero, Sidney, that I had what it takes to make it at Modern Family. Not to mention, I’d get to learn from her. Well, that part I did. Learn, that is.And I even had the perfect contestant, the one I knew was going to win it all. Noah Shields, doctor and hottie. I’m talking the “you can scrub me down anytime you want, doctor” type of hottie. One problem. He didn’t want anything to do with the contest. Or me. He didn’t think he deserved the hero title.He was wrong.He was a hero. No, correction, he is a hero. He just needed a push to see it for himself without letting the demons from his past and the heartache he was harboring taint the good man he truly was.I was just supposed to help him see – from the goodness of my own heart. That’s the thing, I involved my heart. And when that sucker came into play, I was no longer playing for him to win the contest. I was playing for him to win at life…not just survive…and I was playing with my whole heart. Because it was his.And now the contest was over, and I’m left standing alone, wondering if his heart isn’t too damaged to be in it too.",
