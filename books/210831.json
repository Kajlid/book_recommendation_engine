He shares what he saw with Izzie, his beautiful, but conceited, on-air reporter. When she fails to show up for work for several days, he becomes concerned. His hardboiled boss says forget it. Stuck-up girls like that walk out on jobs all the time. Jackson pursues the matter anyway and is warned to focus on his work—or else. He and his free-spirit brother, Zac, follow leads that get them in over their heads. They end up in Ambergris Caye, off the coast of Belize, where they fight, to not only save Izzie’s life, but their own.  ESCAPE FROM AMBERGRIS CAYE will appeal to those who enjoy a good mystery along with a glimpse into the horrific crime of human trafficking.",
