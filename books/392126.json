These mansions were built in the mid-eighteenth century onward and were gradually abandoned and forgotten. Here, Blake documents what is left of fifty mansion houses with brief histories and beautiful photographs of the haunting ruins. Included are Mountpelier Lodge (Dublin Hellfire Club), the birthplaces of Daniel O'Connell and the Duke of Wellington, and the one-time homes of Grace O'Malley and the Smithwicks brewing family of Kilkenny. \"\"A handsome and immensely sensitive study of some of the most haunting and unforgetable mansions ever to have been built in Ireland.\"\"-Irish Voice \"\"Hauntingly beautiful pictures...accompanied by fascinating historical information\"\"-Irish American News \"\"`Abandoned Mansions of Ireland' should prove to be an endlessly fascinating coffee table work.\"\"-Midwest Book Review",
