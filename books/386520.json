  "title": "Centaur's Awakening",
  "description": "Logan, deeply soaked with unicorn magic, is the ultimate slave to the unicorn, his mind, body and soul completely forfeit to the unicorn's whims. Blake on the other hand has his fair share of troubles with the centaurs, a rival clan to the ones on the farm capturing him and forcing him to see his once innocent world in a different light. The unicorn's son, Keallan, is the brothers' only hope. Can he rise up and overcome his own failings to help the two men before Logan is totally lost and Blake is held forever by the centaur clan? And can all this prevent the bloodshed that will soon follow as the unicorns and the centaurs prepare for war?",
