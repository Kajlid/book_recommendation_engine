  "description": "Rusty Lane comes from an abusive childhood, and then marries two abusive truckers, one of whom was an arranged match. She fights for her freedom becoming an independent woman, and mother of two. She is blessed with the love of not one, but two soul mates. The first is killed in a tragic accident. The second is love at first sight, until he begins doing the one thing she detests, driving a truck out of necessity. His job keeps him on the road so much they both lose sight of what brought them together in the first place. After years of feeling as if she's just an after-thought, then discovering he's had an entire life on the road she's not meant to be a part of, including another woman. Rusty must make a decision. Will she walk away, or fight for her family?",
