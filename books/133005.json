  "description": "Some call it love at first sight; he calls it trouble. He swore never to fall for anyone again … so why can’t he stay away from her? Gabriel Beaumont has one rule when it comes to dating—don’t. After he found himself on the wrong end of love once, he swore to never let it happen again. And in the three years since he moved to Paris to open an art gallery, it’s suited him just fine. Until her. From the moment Juliet Chandler crashed into his life, she upended his entire world. She’s a beautiful aspiring writer from New York who left her Big Law job to attend a summer institute in Paris, and he’s happy to be her guide around the city if it means spending time with her. There’s just one problem. He can’t keep his eyes—or his hands—off her. She’s the falling-in-love type, and he doesn’t do relationships. But with summer coming to an end, he’ll do anything to keep her. Even if it means facing the life he left behind.",
