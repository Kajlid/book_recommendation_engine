  "description": "Dorsal Finn is a sleepy town, nestled in a small crescent shaped bay, facing the gleaming Atlantic Ocean.In its one hundred and ninety-eight year history the town has come to know mystery and skullduggery like the dearest of friends, so much so it has now become quite normal to have the odd explosion here or missing person there without many of the townsfolk raising as much as an eyebrow.And it is in the town of Dorsal Finn that one Beatrice Beecham now resides, a girl of remarkable talent amongst which is an absolute, innate gift for finding trouble.Within these pages are all kinds of trouble: witches, shaman, and sea monsters, to name but a few.Yet Beatrice is to find out that of all the terrible things lurking in the shows of Dorsal Finn, the biggest threat may come from the town itself.",
