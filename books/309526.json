  "description": "Seven peaceful years have passed since the siege of Westron but not all is well in Argys. Heresy is rampant, King Raymond is dead and Valia wishes to abdicate in favour of Martemio but already threats loom over the succession as his nephew, backed by the One-Church, is plotting a bloody revenge that may spark a war with Kithai. Leweth hasn't been idle either and with the aid of Trychomion, a powerful summoner, has hatched a bold plan to build the greatest empire Thresiae has ever seen, over the dead bodies of her foes and with an Empress at its helm. The Dark Gem may have been banished for now but certainly not forgotten, least of all by Medas, the exiled Head of the black robes, who is actively seeking to retrieve it from the Netherworld... and something is about to be found.Demetrio tells of nightmares: 'A great plague spreading like a dark tide over the land, except it isn't an illness. Or perhaps it is, but nothing like the world has ever suffered...' As demons prowl the land and assassins plot in the shadows the future appears less than certain, paving the way for the final installment of the trilogy.",
