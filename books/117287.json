  "description": "An eclectic collection of new and previously published poems, SCRAMBLED examines everyday events with humor, compassion and irreverence, all drawn from an indomitable will and served up with a rare gusto for life. Praise for \"Trish Dugger is a deliciously good poet, sassy and clever. I was deeply moved by several poems that were, beneath the clever chattiness, heartbreaking and memorable, especially those memories of her husband and his absence.\" STEVE KOWIT \"You’ll want to call Trish Dugger a mischievous romantic, comical and tender. And, when you read SCRAMBLED, you’d be right-on. Here is an enthusiastic life brimming with lust, good humor and, dare I say, passion.\" ROGER APLON",
