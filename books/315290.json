  "description": "My testimony outlines the trials and triumphs as I navigated the world equipped with the lessons of my grandmother, coupled with the reality of adulthood. It is my hope that my story will inspire others to realize the power of self-development and understand that you can live a life of good success by changing the way you think. But most of all I desire to take back my power and live my life being who God created me to be. Moving forward with confidence and perseverance in the next chapters of my life.",
