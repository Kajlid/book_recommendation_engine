  "title": "Her Cold-Blooded Protector",
  "description": "It’s not easy being human when Earth is run by aliens.  Lena has been locked up, imprisoned in a multi-species penitentiary on Earth, and all she wants is to get back to what she’s good at: keeping her sister safe.  Kormak is a levekk—a member of the same cold-blooded, alien species that enslaved her planet—and he is the key to her escape.  Kormak hates humans, and he’s not afraid to show it. They burn hot and bright but are snuffed out quickly, and the last thing he wants is a human slowing him down.  But she needs a protector, and he’s drawn to her flame. When an accident derails their escape and strands them in the wintry wilderness, just who will end up saving whom?",
