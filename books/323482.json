  "description": "On the Vampire Reality Show, Forever After, unexpected love isn’t the only plot twist.Autumn Reid is in a rut. At nearly thirty years old, she hasn’t ventured outside her sleepy Georgia town of Covey Crossing. When her father sees an ad for a new dating show, Forever After, she jumps on the chance. It’s a dating show with a twist, featuring a vampire bachelor. Sure, the winner gets the choice of cash or immortality, but Autumn doesn’t expect to make it that far. She just needs a shakeup in her dull life. What she doesn’t expect is the infuriatingly handsome vampire duke.  Impoverished duke Oliver Gray desperately needs money to save his estate. When he’s offered the chance to become the bachelor on Forever After, he has no choice but to accept. There’s a catch—he has to wear Victorian clothing from the era during which he turned and pretend to have been hibernating for the last one hundred years. Fine. He can pretend to be clueless and don a top hat once more. What he truly struggles to figure out is the alluring human with a smart mouth. But he can’t seem to send her home, not when something deep down inside insists she may be his one true mate.  But figuring out whether they might love or hate one another is the least of Autumn and Oliver’s problems. Contestants are being murdered one by one, and a vampire appears to be to blame. But the show must go on, and the director is convinced a relocation to their finale destination in England will solve all their problems. But Oliver and Autumn’s dreams of forever after may be cut short when the killer follows them across the pond and decides Autumn is next.",
