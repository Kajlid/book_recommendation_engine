  "description": "Award-winner of the Hollywood Book Festival, bestselling thriller The Torah Codes has been called a Jewish version of The Da Vinci Code.\"FIVE STARS - I wish I could put an additional star on the rating system for this book.\" - Roseanne Schmidt, Goodreads.com, July 21, 2011\"FIVE STARS - Let me put this quite the question before us is not a fictional one. If The Torah Codes describes a real phenomenon, then we are talking about statistical evidence that the scriptures are indeed supernatural--that is to say, holy, inspired by a force with, at the very least, a god's-eye-view of history. Including, one might presume, future history.\" - Ien Nivens, Berkshire Fine Arts, May 23, 2011A reclusive computer programmer, Nathan Yirmorshy, pounds out ones and zeros in the quiet of his home while his landlord secretly watches from behind a two-way mirror. When an intercepted note connects the landlord to a secret society, and a detective ends up dead, Nathan must abandon his home and everything familiar to him, open his heart to a tarot reader he has never met, and trust her with his life--just as the ancient scriptures have foretold.An appendix of essays by rabbis, doctors, and physicists discuss the themes of the book, specifically, the Bible codes and the Shekinah, the female aspect of God.
