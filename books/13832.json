  "description": "Book 1 in the Kiwi Series about a magical cat.Have you ever wished your cat could talk or wondered where he/she goes when you are not around? Kiwi is a black cat with a big secret – she is magical and comes from a city of catizens. One night when the moon is shaped like a cat’s claw, Amy and James follow their pet cat to see where she goes. With a flick of her tail, Kiwi turns the kids into kittens and leads them to the blue-lit Cat City, where the budding detectives help Inspector Furrball to investigate a catnapping and Kiwi meets her nemesis.Furry fun for ages 7-99. KIRKUS REVIEW – “Though the book is a mystery, the bloodshed-free crime means that the book is safe enough for younger readers to enjoy, and funny moments – provided by the bumbling Paws and lots of “cat” wordplay – keep the story light. The sleuthing will captivate young readers... Cats, a dash of fantasy, and a puzzling mystery are a recipe for a fun read...”In the Kiwi Series, Amy, James and Kiwi go on different adventures, dealing with catnappings, jewel thieves, giant mice, time travel, haunted houses, Father Christmas, pyramids and more. The fun stories contain positive messages about loyalty, friendship, honesty, bullying and the power of friendship.With illustrations by Nikki McBroom.Book 4 in the series was a finalist in the Children's Books category of the National Indie Excellence Book Awards 2013.",
