His comedy of errors escapades as he sleeps through, cuts and disrespects his classes intensify as he not only dates the Cool Kids’ “Virgin” Mary, but manages to fall into an after school job as an apprentice drug dealer and a college-aged girlfriend in New York City. Sevag’s own drug experiments take him into dangerous territory with some serious side effects. Welcome to the jungle.",
