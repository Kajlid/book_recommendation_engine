  "description": "Her… Darkness wants me. I’ve been surrounded by darkness since the day I was born. It is all I’ve ever known. It consumes me, it suffocates me, and no matter how far I run, darkness is always at my heel threatening to devour me. My darkness is… fear! I never believed I could feel anything else until the moment he touched me. He has given me hope. He has allowed me to dream, to want, to desire more than I have ever thought possible. He’s my protection… my safety… my future… I am his. But darkness always has a way of creeping up and casting its shadow. Will it consume me or will his love be strong enough to keep me in the light? Him…. She’s my obsession and I can’t seem to get her off my mind. It drives me crazy but I think about her constantly. I want her. No, I need her. I crave everything about her; her touch, her taste, her smile, her eyes, and her innocence. Just being close to her turns me on. No woman has ever made me feel this way and I can’t get enough. I have to have her. Her body, her heart, her mind, and her desires belong to me. No one can ever take what’s mine and make no mistake she IS mine. I know she has a past and I know she has secrets, but no matter what comes our way I will fight for her. Her secrets I can handle but with such uncertainty from her past, will it finally catch up to her and destroy the new life she has built before I can save her?",
