  "description": "When Liz’s best friend and roommate moved out taking the next step in her relationship, Liz’s search for someone new left her scratching her head. If she thought finding potential dates was rough, finding the ideal person to share her home with was even harder. Apprehensive and spooked to say the least after meeting a few candidates, her hope is renewed when Wyatt knocked on her door. Single, inexperienced and on his own for the first time, he was looking for a fresh start. What Liz didn’t count on is her boyfriend, Chad’s, reaction to the new young, buff, male roommate. Will their relationship survive or will she and Wyatt find themselves navigating the online dating world as they left swipe together?",
