  "description": "Growing up in a dangerous and abusive home at the hands of his stepfather, this red-headed stepchild had been beaten, stabbed, and psychologically tormented. He was manipulated into committing crimes including theft, arson, assault, and murder. Not only was he fearful for his own life but had to consider the safety of his mother and three small sisters from their alcoholic and drug addicted abuser.After years of absolute torment, there was finally an opportunity of freedom for his family when his dad was imprisoned. However, relief was short lived when his mother died before he had even graduated high school. Fearing that his three half-sisters (ages 9, 7, and 2) would be sent to foster homes, he sought guardianship from the courts despite his young age and criminal past.Dr. Powell shares a first-hand view of all the pain and suffering that accompanied his child abuse. Despite the circumstances, he shares how he was able to fight against the odds to overcome his past, while protecting his sisters in the process. This is a story of inspiration which demonstrates that none of us are defined by our past, but only by our willingness to succeed.",
