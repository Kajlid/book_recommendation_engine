  "description": "\"Genetopia\" is the story of Flint, a young man in search of his possibly-abducted sister in a far future where nano- and bio-technology have influenced and accelerated the evolution of humans and their strangely altered surroundings. In this world, illness is always to be feared as symptoms can be a part of the transformation re-engineering active genes; mutating germ cells; migrating traits from species to species through plague and fever. This is a world where organic AIs grow in the jungle, either worshipped or feared, where trees sing to each other and new houses are grown to order. To find his sister, Flint must travel through communities and wildlands no normal person would brave. Flint's story is the story of the last true humans, and of the struggles between those who want to defend their heritage and those who choose to embrace the new. \"Genetopia\" will appeal to the core science-fiction market, but also to those interested in environmental, political, biological, and anthropological issues.",
