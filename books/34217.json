  "title": "Super Power of the Day: Origins of a Sixth Grade Superhero",
  "description": "The Sixth grader Chase Cooper was a normal kid with normal problems... An annoying younger sister. The fierce black labs down the street. A teacher he has nicknamed \"Meany.\" He dreamed of being special but never thought it would happen. Then one day, he awoke with a superpower.  In the first volume of the Super Power of the Day trilogy, Chase faces the challenges and adventures of having a new superpower each day. Some powers help Chase bravely face his fears. Others seem to do nothing but bring him problems. Through it all, he learns more than he realizes about the people around him and how to be the hero of his own life.   A My grandson visited us at Thanksgiving and I gave him Super Power of the Day volume 1 to read. He wasn't finished when it was time to go home and took it with him. I quote, \"The main emotion I had was being sad when the book ended. I got so sucked into it that I kept the lights on much longer than I was supposed to. I kept reading more and more to find out what was going to happen. It reminded me of \"Harry Potter\" because they both had some kind of super power...they used for good. I hope the second one comes out soon.\" (Henry-age 10). Ms. Wachtler is an educator and really knows how to write for children. I and my grandson would highly recommend this book!!!!!!Grandma Nancy",
