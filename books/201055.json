  "description": "USA TODAY BESTSELLER • From J. Kenner comes a tantalizing ebook novella starring fan favorites Damien Stark and his wife, Nikki Fairchild. Deepest Kiss follows the couple from their island resort to their home in Los Angeles, and introduces Dallas Sykes, the seductive bad boy in the newest Stark International Novel, Dirtiest Secret—the first book in a new trilogy of the S.I.N. series.   Includes a special preview of J. Kenner’s provocative new novel, Dirtiest Secret!   My love for Damien Stark runs deep, and my need for his touch runs even deeper. He’s my shelter in this world, my light when everything seems dark, and all it takes is one kiss for my body to come alive.   Yet no matter where we go, our secrets threaten to surface. Someone dangerous from my past is back to stir up trouble, and now it feels like there’s nowhere I can hide.   I know Damien will always protect me, that our fierce desire will give us strength. In his arms I find safe harbor—and the sweetest release.   Deepest Kiss is intended for mature audiences.   Praise for J. Kenner and The Stark Trilogy   “Kenner may very well have cornered the market on sinfully attractive, dominant antiheroes and the women who swoon for them.”—RT Book Reviews   “J. Kenner has written a sensually seductive storyline that catches your imagination. . . . [Release Me] will suck you in from the very start.”—The Reading Cafe   “[A] sexy and exciting ride.”—Fresh Fiction, on Claim Me   “[An] immensely satisfying series . . . The roller coaster events of Complete Me give this novel a page-turning quality.”—Heroes and Heartbreakers",
