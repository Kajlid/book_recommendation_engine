  "description": "Pam feels so much shame about what happened in the elevator with Mr Foster. She'd never done anything like that. Didn't know what had come over her. And now he was going to fire her, she was sure of it. An envelope waits on her desk when she arrives at the office Monday morning. Surely this it it. She should start packing her desk. But it isn't a pink slip. It's a note, written in Foster's own hand...... And it contains orders. On His Orders is the second book in the Books Similar to Fifty Shades of Grey series. The rip roaring opening story At His Command is available on Amazon today.",
