  "title": "Legless in Ginza: Orientating Japan",
  "description": "Legless in Ginza is a witty and idiosyncratic picture of Japan at a traumatic time in its history. Robin Gerster lived and worked in Tokyo while Japan was reverberating with the shocks and aftershocks of political, bureaucratic, financial and social scandal. Part travel book, part personal and professional memoir, part cultural study, Legless in Ginza also ponders the travel experience itself. How does an outsider orientate himself in Japan? How does he adapt the country to suit himself? What does it mean simply to be `away'? And what-and where-is the elusive place called Home?",
