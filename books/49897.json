  "description": "William Codex is just like any other man. He has a family and friends. He loves his job, most of the time. He's worthless without a strong cup of coffee in the morning. Except, in his case, he can't tell anyone what he does for a living.   Special Agent William Codex is part of the Holzer Initiative, a top secret branch of the FBI. His job is to project us, the mortals, from the threats of the supernatural and, to protect well meaning supernatural citizens from discovery and harm from the mortal world.   While responding to the murder of a dear friend and member of the supernatural community Codex discovers a much deeper conspiracy. Before he knows it Codex is caught in a spiral of murder and mystery that is somehow connected to his departed friend.  He must: protect a beautiful young woman just stepping into her considerable physic powers, deal with a deadly sorceress, track down Bigfoot and, battle wits with leprechauns. And those are just his allies.",
