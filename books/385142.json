  "description": "In the first Division Mythos book, Before Leonora Wakes, Red Piccirilli is a runt, a dreamer, a naive boy with an imaginary friend and little else. But right before summer vacation starts he finds an albino girl trapped in a shed behind a local house. After Red frees her, the world he knew quickly unravels into something more mysteriousâ€”an unsteady reality where a man with silver teeth and buzz saw voice points him toward the true meaning of sacrifice. With his friendship tested, he fights for life to be as it once was, but he finds out that things can never be the same once the strange girl wakes. Author Lee Thompson started selling fiction in early 2010, and most of his work centers around his Division Mythos. His novels include NURSERY RHYMES 4 DEAD CHILDREN (Delirium Books, 2011) and THE DAMPNESS OF MOURNING (Darkfuse Publications, 2012). His current novel, THE COLLECTED SONGS OF SONNELION, is being serialized on Darkfuse Publication's website every week.",
