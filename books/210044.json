  "title": "Down the Stream of Stars",
  "description": "A great interstellar migration has begun, down the gateway known as the starstream. Remnant of the Betelgeuse supernova, the starstream is a grand, ethereal highway deep into the Milky Way. It is also a living entity: born of the merged souls of the once-living star and the other beings who died in its creation. Who could have predicted the wonders of the starstream, or the perils it unleashed? Among the perils is a terrifying race known as the Throgs-shadowy beings that live in the n-space of the starstream. Entire worlds have died, destroyed by the Throgs. But life goes on, and colonists continue tosettle new worlds. Colony-bound aboard the starship Charity are one Claudi Melnik, a child of uncommon talents-and an AI named Jeaves, who has his own interest in an encounter with Throgs. When the unthinkable occurs, Claudi must face alone the challenge from beyond space and time. And no one, not even Jeaves, could have predicted the final confrontation, or imagined where unexpected friendship would be found. Down the Stream of Stars, triumphant sequel to the bestselling From a Changeling Star, is a daring journey across the gulf between human and alien, to the heart of consciousness itself.",
