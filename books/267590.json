Rebound with each other?\"What starts as an act of revenge rekindles long-buried desires between the forbidden lovers. As Sean and Calliope drive across the country, their stunned exes follow—and so do the secrets they hoped would stay hidden.But all road trips, and some love affairs, have to end somewhere.",
