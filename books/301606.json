  "description": "Ten Rules Of The Road I Learned At My First Concert is one ordinary guy's saga of 160 concerts over the last 44 \"From scalping tickets to catch Captain Fantastic at the height of his success to missing the opportunity to see Sir Paul close down Shea Stadium; from meeting one band in the middle of 43rd street to watching another play in a parking lot; from seeing a crowd throw objects at an amateur lead-in band to hearing two legends, Macca and Bruce, play \"I Saw Her Standing There\" - twice; from never seeing Van Morrison play \"Someone Like You\" to having him surprise us all with a rendition of \"Send In The Clowns\"; from attending a concert that never started to being at a show that we wouldn’t let end; the “Ten Rules Of The Road” have marked the moments of my journey from August 15, 1976 right through today.\"",
