  "description": "BOOK ONE in the Undeparted Series.Cassandra is trying to figure out if she was actually bitten by a vampire and whisked away to his castle or if it was it a very vivid dream, one which has left her to contemplate her own sanity. Unknowingly, she is the only mortal to resist the vampire's bite and capture the heart of the most powerful vampire that ever existed; the one who began the entire race of the undead, Quentin Castle. For ions Quentin has felt nothing but the lust for blood. But Cassandra has awakened something in him that he had forsaken a millennium ago; he is determined to win this beautiful woman by mortal means rather than by the vampire's bite. But will he be able to suppress his natural instinct? Will he be able to prove to the skeptical Cassandra that he is a vampire and not an imposter, a wannabe? What hideous thing will he do to prove that he is a vampire, prove that he isn't using some kind of parlor trick, some Houdini magic, and that he is the real thing? As evidence mounts on Quentin's behalf and she can no longer deny her encounter was real and not a dream, will Cassandra be able to resist his evil charm and convince her boyfriend, police officer Mike Lapp and best friend Lucy that vampires really do exist and she's being stalked by one? To expedite their liaison, Quentin devises a scheme to blackmail Cassandra by setting up her boyfriend for a murder he didn't commit. Cassandra must surrender herself to Quentin for her boyfriend's sake and wait for Mike to scale the walls of the vampire's castle and rescue her. But when her boyfriend arrives, she's in for the shock of her life. People are not always what they seem to be.",
