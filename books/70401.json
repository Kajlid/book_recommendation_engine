  "description": "“You need to know this thing between us isn't over.\" Michelle Slattery is no stranger to human cruelty. She's a cop, after all, never mind a witch herself. But when her best friend disappears and all signs point to the same mages who have been killing witches across the country, she's in over her head. There's only one place to turn for the kind of tracking help she needs… The werewolves. Josh Neelan didn't expect to ever see a witch at Pacific Pack headquarters. She's no ordinary witch in need, either—Michelle was his first love. The one he left behind when he turned a decade ago. That their attraction flares instantly after all this time can mean only one impossible thing: she's his mate. As danger looms and the case intensifies, Josh's need to follow the fates and claim Michelle as his mate grows…his man battling his wolf to keep them safe. And Michelle must decide just how far she'll go to find her forever. This book is approximately 64,000 words",
