After meeting Quinn, he’s more determined than ever to make his father see who he is and how deeply he loves.Captivated by their growing passion, the young lovers have a rude awakening when the vengeful alpha who murdered Quinn’s parents finds him, and vows to destroy anyone who gets in his way.Some say the battle between good and evil is determined by which power is fed the most, but in nature, no power compares to that of an alpha’s claim.",
