  "description": "Danielle and Ethan may have solved their problem with vampires, but other magical beings have taken interest in the ones who discovered the cure.On the run trying to escape a gaggle of evil pixies, a clan of creepy werewolves, a coven or two of wicked witches, and a school of lovely but malicious mermaids, they fight to have a normal life. But that isn't so easy when the only aid they have is from slightly dishonest fairies and flirtatious vampire bodyguards.This is Danielle and Ethan's happily forever after....Note from the author: This is NOT the last time you will see Danielle and Ethan though!!! Max and Nadia’s story overlaps theirs! To keep print costs down for those of you who prefer that, I have to break the story up into standard-sized novels. So if you want to see more of what happens to this couple as their “happily forever after” continues, stay tuned for The Order of Curse-Bound Knights which I am working on right now.The Fateful Trilogy was Danielle and Ethan’s story to tell. The Fateful Series will give them all their chance to be the main characters.",
