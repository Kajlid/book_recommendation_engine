  "description": "This book is a biography of Sri Pothuluri Veera Brahmendra Swamy (Telugu: పోతులూరి వీరబ్రహ్మేంద్రస్వామి) a Hindu mystic, born in 1610 in Kadapa district of Andra Pradesh state in India.He is the author of Kaalagnaana, a collection of predictions about future or prophecies, a Telugu text that predicts the arrival of Kalki in the form of Sri Veerabhoga Vasantaraaya!Few of his Predictions:According to Kalagnanam, the Third World War ends by 2046 or later (which will end on a Makara Sankranti Day, when Jupiter in Aquarius Rasi). The year 2012 does not indicate the end of the World, as said by Mayan Calendar, but as per Kalagnanam severe earthquakes and calamities are indicated in the Telugu year Nandana (2012–13) that takes millions of lives, and also revival of Mayan civilization(Mayan people are said to be the Descendants of Viswakarma/Viswabrahmin community of India, who have flown to North America for some reasons, a long ago). Possible reason behind the ending of Mayan Calendar on 21-12-2012 is, they might have noticed the advent of Lord Kalki/Lord Veera Bhoga Vasantha Raaya, change of velocity of planets, Stars and Milkyway/Galaxy, and as such they would have left the Calendar calculations and predictions to our fate. Surprisingly, it was clearly mentioned about the change of velocity of planets, etc. in Kalagnanam, and in particular, there is change in the velocity of Jupiter after Plavanga (2027–28) and suddenly from 2034 Jupiter will transit three Rasis a year.",
