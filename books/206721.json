  "description": "A new edition published under the name Simon Strange can be found hereNathan was the only man in my life growing up, and I've missed him since he and my mother divorced three years ago. When he called my up for my eighteenth birthday, I was shocked. I had so much I wanted to talk to him about... but would he still think of me the same, once he knew?  But this older man, who I've always looked up to, doesn't react at all the way I thought. Not in my wildest dreams would I have imagined it would be him that breaks me in for the first time, and teaches me how to be his good boy.  If you can't tell there's some serious M/M risque story in this book from the cover and description, Bradley Nyx can't help you.",
