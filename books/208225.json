  "description": "He’s suffering in silence...Teague Carter, one of the four owners of Pier 70 Marina, has spent his life feeling rejected. To the point that he has never allowed himself to get close to anyone. He prefers it that way, in fact. But he refuses to believe that his destructive behavior might be something more than rebellion.He’s unable to speak...Hudson Ballard, Pier 70’s mechanic, has been fighting his attraction to Teague for years. He has stood by and watched the kid get more and more out of control, but this time is the last. If Teague wants to use sex to escape his problems, Hudson is certainly willing to be the one to show him that he’s good with more than just his hands. Sometimes words aren’t necessary.There are fireworks when this out-of-control bad boy agrees to no strings with this tatted up, dominating mechanic. Can Teague and Hudson keep their emotions from getting involved in their arrangement? Or -- thanks to the demons from their pasts -- will the darkness steal from them before they have a chance?",
