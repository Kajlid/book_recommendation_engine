  "description": "In a tall, narrow brownstone, in Brooklyn, New York, there is a girl with a secret. That girl is Rose Knight. She needs to raise millions of dollars to save her father's life. The arrogant and suave Damien Castle is good at uncovering secrets. He's even better at catching criminals. When he meets Rose he knows something is amiss but he can't help but get distracted. It isn't her terrible dress sense that confuses him, or even her obsession with Egyptology. It's the fact that he has never felt this way about a girl before. But when duty and love are both on the line, which one will Damien choose? 'Shaken' is the new companion novel to Joss Stirling's award-winning YA romantic thriller 'Struck' and its follow-up, 'Stung'.",
