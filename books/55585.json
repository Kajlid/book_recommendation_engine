Somehow surviving the annihilation, she hides in a Sydney house with her dog, Bonnie. She knows she has to leave before the \"eyes in the sky\" detect her and have her captured, but she never expects an alien to save her and Bonnie from the jaws of a ravenous, feral dog. Never expects to be drawn to Renate, the alien male who seems more human than any man she's ever known.She fights an attraction she can't win, and soon enough she's in his arms, under his hard, amazing body. Except their unearthly desire might not be enough to keep them together when Renate's alien comrades close in.",
