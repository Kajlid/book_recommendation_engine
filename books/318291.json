The only thing she doesn't have is her best friend and man of her dreams, Henry Crawley. When Henry announces his plans to join the Regulars, her father's adamant disapproval of him deepens and prompts a deal to be struck:She has two weeks to secure Henry's proposal, or she must give him up forever and marry a man of her father's choosing.Alicia agrees. But when one of her attempts goes awry, she gets a begrudging proposal from someone else entirely--Matthew Wycliffe.

After all, with the deal she struck with her father, she'll never marry the man anyway. But as they endure dark castles, hot-tempered soldiers, and hidden secrets brought to light all in their quest for a proposal from Henry, Alicia notices something different about the insufferable, grumbling Matthew Wycliffe.
