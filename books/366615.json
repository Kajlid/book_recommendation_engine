  "description": "What begins as an adventure soon becomes a nightmare...Locals claim it is haunted and refuse to put a single toe past the front door, but to siblings Peter, Celia, and Margaret, the Priory is nothing more than a rundown estate inherited from their late uncle-and the perfect setting for a much-needed holiday. But when a murder victim is discovered in the drafty Priory halls, the once unconcerned trio begins to fear that the ghostly rumors are true and they are not alone after all! With a killer on the loose, will they find themselves the next victims of a supernatural predator, or will they uncover a far more corporeal culprit?Title: Footsteps in the DarkAuthor: Heyer, GeorgettePublisher: Sourcebooks IncPublication Date: 2010/11/01Number of Pages: 347Binding Type: PAPERBACKLibrary of Congress: 2010029982",
