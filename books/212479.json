  "description": "Set on the Lower Missouri River during the late summer of 1835. Two brothers, fur trappers Zebadiah and Jonathan Creed are bushwhacked, their beaver pelts stolen. Jonathan is murdered and Zebadiah is left for dead. Found by a Quaker doctor and his daughter Anna, they nurse Zeb back to health and insist he stay. Anna’s fresh desires and a dream of a peaceful life cannot quell his burning for revenge and Zeb sets out to find Rudy and Baumgartner, the two men who killed his brother. Through Billy Frieze, a dubious traveling companion, Zeb’s search leads to Frenchy, a St. Louis bordello owner who delves out justice using wolverines. Rudy is killed, not by Zeb’s hand and not before Zeb learns of conspiracy within the American Fur Company and a personal web of deceit, drawing him to New Orleans – under the spell of Madame Sophie le Roux. Zeb kills Baumgartner unexpectedly, but only with the help of Olgens Pierre, Sophie’s half-brother and freed black man. Zeb must pay back his debt, including him in two vendettas, one to do with stolen slaves, the other an epic love triangle stretching across decades and length of the Mississippi River. Written in his own words, Zebadiah Creed spins an exciting tale that leads us by steamboat down the Great Mississippi to St. Louis and on to New Orleans, where Zeb finds revenge is never as simple as killing a man, where retribution and redemption are not the same.",
