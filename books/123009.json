  "description": "Pumpkin spice and not playing nice – this ball just got more interesting, thanks to Prince Too-Handsy.The plan was as clear as glass: infiltrate a high fae court’s ball, uncover the truth behind my father's death, and avoid my sadistic stepmother and stepsisters.But now, I find myself engaged to Prince freakin' Charming, the last fae I'd ever choose for a dance partner, much less a fiancé. And I'm hardly the ideal bride for a fae prince—a human bartender who loves piercings, tattoos, and devours pumpkin-flavored anything.Prince Charming thinks he can use me in his twisted game to overthrow his father. Little does he know, I’m not just some human he can push around.Now, in over my head in a world of glittering gowns and deceitful smiles, I’m betrothed to the one fae who could unravel everything—including my resolve to not let him touch me.But there's this thing about Charming—he's got a way of getting under my skin even from across the room. And it's messing with my head, making me question everything.Our engagement is more than a dance of power; it's a game that could shatter crowns and hearts. And I'm right in the middle, balancing on the edge of a glass slipper that's cracking under the weight of secrets and forbidden desires.Igniting Cinder is a spicy m/f fairytale retelling where a pretend engagement will heat up in a dance of ink, charm, and forbidden desires.",
