  "description": "The road to his dream life of bondage is a stormy one for eighteen year old Rory. He is seduced by an older man who takes his virginity, but the encounter turns sour when he is then bound and thrashed in an abuse of the young lad’s trust. More abuse follows when his violent father comes home unexpected; leaving Rory battered and in need of an escape.Fate brings Alex to the rescue - a hunk of a man that Rory will fall for - their mutual attraction is intense. But having witness the carnage inflicted on Rory, Alex assumes that he himself is dangerous for the lad, as he likes to flavour his sex with a good sprinkling of violence, torture and bondage.Alex takes flight to Amsterdam where he tries to escape his attachment with a weekend of full on BDSM fun - an orgy in a sauna, group sex in a dark room, and a night in his room at the Black Tulip Hotel which is furnished exotically with a full range of equipment. Alex teams up with another hunky dominant male to test it all out on a sexy Dutch submissive.But fate leads him back to Rory and their road together is eventually a happy one – for it leads them to pain and bondage!",
