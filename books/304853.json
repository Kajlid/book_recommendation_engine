  "description": "If you’re interested in world economics, politics, history, or culture, you’ll run into China before long. Today’s People’s Republic of China is built on millennia of history and continues to influence present-day events—but what is the real China?The Trouble with China explores this highly complex nation and explains why and how it all fits together. Drawing on years spent in the People’s Republic coupled with deep analysis, Peter Mitchelmore offers a “street-level” view of China and its people as they really are. He delves into how China’s deeply rooted culture continues to shape modern history, covering key events like the Cultural Revolution, the Tiananmen Square massacre, and ongoing issues with Hong Kong, while also sharing more personal insight into how real people in China live, love, and cope. For anyone with an interest in China—academics, business people, citizens, and diaspora—The Trouble with China is for you. This book goes beyond the media headlines to show the everyday realities of Chinese people and the country’s surprising diversity, exploring China’s charms as well as its multi-faceted problems.",
