  "description": "Being raised by my abusive stepfather forced me to look outside my home for a male role model. I didn’t have to go far to find one. My freshman year in high school, Percy “P-Nut” Welsh moved next door. A patched member of SoCal’s notorious Filthy Fuckers MC, he was an easy man to admire and befriend. He was respectful, kind, and intelligent. We soon became close friends, and that friendship lasted long after I graduated. As I grew older, my feelings for him changed, but I chose to keep my thoughts to myself.When my life turned tragic one day, Percy stepped in and saved me. He saw it as his duty. I viewed at it as an opportunity. I wanted him so bad I ached. There were two things that prevented me from having him:One; I was a virgin, and I wasn’t about to give myself to someone who wasn’t committed. \"NUTS\" is a unique friends to lovers erotic romance tale that has no cheating, no sex outside the relationship, and the most heartwarming of HEAs. Although it is book 5 of a series, it is a stand-alone novel that does not require reading any other novels in the series to enjoy.",
