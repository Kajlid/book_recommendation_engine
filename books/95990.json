  "description": "Fifteen-year-old Raven Wishmore was supposed to snatch a cauldron. Instead she accidentally blows up a library.When Raven’s father—a spy for Kingdom Quest, a secret society devoted to protecting magic and punishing magic abusers—is charged with finding a priceless cauldron, Raven is coerced into joining the investigation. She reluctantly goes undercover at Saint Cloud Library, the supposed location at which the cauldron is being guarded. Raven—in her gum snapping, skirt wearing, ditzy disguise—is employed at Saint Cloud, which is ruled by a tyrannical library director who has declared all book sections closed. Her coworkers are wary, unfriendly, and unconcerned that the library’s magic is taking on the disposition of a chained monster.It gets worse. Thanks to a cyber security leak an organization of magic abusers know the cauldron is at Saint Cloud. They will burn the library to the ground to get the cauldron if Raven doesn’t find it first. The only things Raven has going for her is her friendship with the mischievous Montamos brothers, who specialize in breaking and entering, and her dubious magic, the ability to read things to life. However, Raven is unwilling to use her power as she knows firsthand that her magic-based creations are willing to destroy her. Raven must decide if saving the library and recovering the cauldron is worth the personal risk of using her dangerous magic, or if she should let Saint Cloud and its employees fall.",
