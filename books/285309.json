  "title": "An Egg for Ansel",
  "description": "Ansel has a thing for older men.  Specifically his friend’s father Daniel, a penguin shifter who is surprisingly innocent for a forty-seven-year-old man. Ansel probably shouldn’t flirt with Daniel. Or go on a date with him. Or send him photos that Daniel claims are “irresponsible.” But Daniel’s so cute when he blushes, and it’s just a bit of fun. Ansel’s learned that men only want one thing from him, and then they’re gone.  But Daniel doesn’t leave.  In fact, Daniel wants nothing more than to love and take care of Ansel. But Daniel is an omega, just like Ansel, and in polar bear shifter culture a “blood-bond” can only exist between two people who have a child that is genetically related to both of them. If he asks Ansel to be his mate, will he be able to make Ansel happy? Or will he be just one more guy who asks Ansel to settle for less than what he truly wants?  An Egg for Ansel is a second-chance age gap romance with plenty of lace, cuddling, and MPreg of the penguin egg variety. It’s the second book in the Alaskan Pebble Gifters series, and will only make sense if you’ve read the first book.",
