  "description": "Huy has risen from lowly origins to become the Seer of the King. Yet Amunhotep's patronage is both a blessing and a curse to Huy, who feels imprisoned by the gift Thoth has imposed on him and by the life he must live to keep it. Though rewarded with wealth and influence, Huy longs for the pleasures of those he sees around him, especially love, which seems forever lost to him. But when the King calls for his help, Huy has no choice. The life he knew is coming to an end, but his contribution to Egyptian history is just beginning.",
