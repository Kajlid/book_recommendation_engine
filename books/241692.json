  "title": "Nobody Speaks Hawaiian in New Jersey",
  "description": "At times wickedly funny and satirical, at times touching and dramatic, \"Nobody Speaks Hawaiian in New Jersey\" brings together a luckless college president who dreams of building a monstrous new Climates and Environments Building on her ever-expanding campus; a disgruntled president of the United States who secretly hopes to lose his bid for re-election; and a destitute and barely-ambulatory 86-year-old resident of a New Jersey nursing home who is engaged in a life-and-death struggle. His mission: replenish his exhausted health benefits by qualifying for a government-funded job as a Hawaiian-speaking airline mechanic. Set in 2024 and employing humor to explore important themes, \"Nobody Speaks Hawaiian in New Jersey\" is an imaginative and suspenseful page-turner that continually surprises the reader.",
