Robbed of her loved ones and altered by the venom of an alien species, she's forced to leave her old life behind and survive the ruins of Earth.Haunted with grief and pursued relentlessly by monstrous swarms and desperate survivors, Tabitha must face her own changing nature and ever-evolving abilities as she searches for the remnants of civilisation. But when humanity turns on her, and the alien threat hunts their hybrid creation ever more obsessively, Tabitha quickly realises that there's only one side left to fight for â€“ her own.",
