  "description": "I’m so excited to be headed to the Academy of Enchantment, where I’ll be a transfer student for the following year.Except I never make it.When a shadow demon boards my train, I’m overcome by his power and I blackout.And when I wake up? I’m in a place called Dread. And, yes, Dread is as wonderful as the name implies.Awaiting my arrival at the train station is a guy named Harlow. He’s an incubus—a demon, and with his leather jacket, his bad-boy attitude and the fact that he can't keep his hands off me, I know he's trouble.Not only that, but Harlow has instructions to deliver me to my host family.And that means I’ve been expected in Dread. But how and why? That’s the mystery I need to figure out. And pronto.But, first, I have to survive the evening at Castle Raven Night, and I have to survive my host family, Count Jean-Claude Von Zarovich… the third.Yeah, the count might be the hottest guy I’ve ever seen in my life, but he’s also a vampire, and last I checked, vampires eat you.Then there’s Riven. Riven is the headmaster of Ever Dark Academy, and he’s the reason I’m here. And, yes, he’s just as freaking hot as Jean-Claude and Harlow. Only I’ve got a bone to pick with Riven because he totally hijacked my plans.And yet, there’s something about Riven’s soulful eyes, Jean-Claude’s pain, and Harlow’s need that makes me think maybe a quick layover in Dread wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world…",
