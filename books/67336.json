  "description": "If he had not shoved the muzzle-loader down the bear's throat on page 10 and blown bruin's head off on page 11, George would have been shredded wheat and this would be a short story. As it is, Uncle Roger comes from Scotland, identifies George as Sir Charles Gordon, Lord Rock Raven, heir of Ravenhurst, and takes him to Scotland. For generations, Ravenhurst had been the stronghold of Scottish chiefs who lead Clan Gordon to battle \"for God and Our Lady!\" It was filled with memories of persecution for their Faith. It was the scene of the last stand of the great Earl, Sir Angus. Back against the altar and the desecrated Precious Blood, outnumbered twenty to one, the giant grasped his two-handed claymore and laid the sacrilegious enemies of his God around his feet \"like sproutings clipped from a hedgerow.\" But when the boy Gordon rode across the drawbridge, he did not know these things, nor that Catholics were outlaws, that hearing Mass in seventeenth-century Scotland meant deathâ€”that he must choose between death here or hereafter. He did not see the outlaws peering through the bracken, studying him. In their eyes was the question: would he take up the claymore where it had fallen from the bleeding fingers of Sir Angus?",
