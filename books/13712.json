  "title": "How the EPA?s Green Tyranny is Stifling America",
  "description": "The relationship between environmental regulation and economic growth has gone from dysfunctional to disastrous under the leadership of Barack Obama’s EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson. Jackson’s EPA has assumed broad new powers and promulgated sweeping new regulations unlike anything America has seen since the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act were signed into law 40 years ago. While much of the public has focused on the EPA’s plans to regulate greenhouse-gas emissions, the agency’s power grab extends into far more areas of society and the economy than fossil-fuel use alone.In this Broadside, Rich Trzupek explains why Obama’s EPA is different and more dangerous than any other since the agency was created. While the tentacles of this EPA are silently creeping into our lives, Lisa Jackson smilingly assures us that everything the EPA does generates revenue – instead of costing industry billions of dollars and America hundreds of thousands of jobs.",
