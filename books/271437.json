  "title": "Adam II: ICON",
  "description": "In the darkness between the stars, nothing is quite what it seems. It seemed that Adam and the Kinetics were safe, but they must hide from Shape-shifter menace. It seemed that the Demos were defeated, but the victory was based on deception. It seemed that humanity and AIs had the winning card, but forces gather to destroy it. What will protect the Earth-Centauri system, if we lose the power of the Icon?",
