  "description": "Three days after Sheriff Roberts hanged her for the brutal massacre of a group of teens, Catherine Cartwright rose from a shallow grave. She and Jesse – the only survivor of an undead attack on their hometown after her death – set out to find a safe place and some answers. They find allies at a local reservation and a long-standing threat the likes of which neither of them had ever heard of before. Cat’s hopes of finding a cure for herself are surmounted by the urgent desire of finding one for Jesse when he’s bitten by one of the mindless, infectious creatures wandering the frontier. Her last hope is to kill the monster who started it all before Jesse turns, and even that isn’t a sure bet.",
