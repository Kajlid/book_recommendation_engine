  "title": "A Thousand Bridges",
  "description": "It was just an ordinary murder, a drug deal gone sour, leaving three dead teenagers and a drug dealer convicted of the crime. So, when Katherine Furay shows up at P.I. McDonald Clay's doorstep five years later to say her daughter had been a witness and that the murder wasn't ordinary at all, Mac suddenly finds himself in far over his head. The last thing Clay needed was a cause, and he wasn't looking for reasons to live. He just wanted to be left alone to grieve for his dead partner and girlfriend Patty Sheevers, brutally murdered the last time Clay had adopted a \"cause.\" But Katherine Furay was Sheevers's best friend, and now she needs Clay's help, so he finds himself torn between responsibilities to the living and continuing a numbing, uninvolved self-indulgence. To his surprise he discovers he does have some good qualities left. He starts out investigating Tommy Lovett, the owner of a local pool hall in the north Florida city of Palmetto Bay, and winds up going head-to-head with a powerful gubernatorial candidate. In the process, he fights to regain his self-respect and to save the people he loves. For Clay, the question moves from simply who committed murder to \"Do you know what your government is doing?\"",
