  "title": "About That...",
  "description": "I like things straightforward, simple. Too bad he’s complicated as hell…  From the moment I met Cal, I knew I had to keep my hands off. He had the potential to get me fired, break my heart, and earn me more than a few hours in confession with Father John—and my whole freaking family.  But there’s nothing more tempting than something you can’t have… or someone.  About That… is a standalone novella. You can read Then Again when you're done and see Sofia's brother Sam find love.",
