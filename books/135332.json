  "title": "A Journey in the Seaboard Slave States",
  "description": "It is rare to find an impartial look at the Southern States before the Civil War, but Frederick Law Olmstead's Journey through the South is a superb view of every aspect of the South; he talks to the Slaves, the overseers, describes the economy and temper of the people in a highly readable travelogue. In Journey, Olmsted comments on the land, the people, agriculture, industry, and slavery. He frequently notes the inadequacy of roads and travel accommodations in the region, and laments the waste of valuable product due to the lack of means and routes. He is generally pleased with Raleigh, and comments on the beauty of the architecture and the evergreens. His travels also take him to turpentine and rosin works. He provides detailed descriptions of the turpentine forests and examines the naval stores, tobacco, and tar industries. He casts an especially critical eye on the institution of slavery. Like North Carolina antislavery advocates Hinton Rowan Helper and Daniel Reaves Goodloe, Olmsted concluded that slavery retarded the economic and social progress of the South. He was especially troubled by the lack of urbanization and manufacturing and agricultural diversity and sophistication. Goodloe later assisted Olmsted in publishing a two-volume compilation of his southern travelogues and antislavery sentiments titled The Cotton Kingdom, which appeared in 1861.
