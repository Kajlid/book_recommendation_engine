Inspired by an episode on Oprah from years ago that dealt with men addicted to porn, a dream, and information from 8 women's lives, Portrait of Our Marriage, is a story you don't want to miss. Nicky, embarks on a journey to find herself and become her own person despite the legacy of a domineering father and an emotionally—and often physically—distant husband. Reminiscing events from her life, she looks at pictures and remembers romance, falling in love, marriage, and family. This is the story of one woman's life as her husband's interest in pornography becomes an obsession that ultimately changes both of them. Although this is a fictional memoir and only one woman's journey, many women today deal with this issue in silence, feeling ashamed and embarrassed. What would you endure for love? THE ROMANCE WILL SEDUCE YOU. THE STORY COULD BE YOURS!Nicky led a sheltered life until she met Brett: An adventurous, handsome, smart, and exciting lover. She had never known this kind of love before, either emotionally or physically. She pictured her life with Brett as a partner, a friend, and a father to her future children. And when they married, Nicky knew she had found everything her heart and body desired.But when Brett’s fantasy world of racy magazines, explicit videos, and disturbing internet porn becomes an obsession and affects their marriage, Nicky has to ask herself: What happened to the man I married?Portrait of Our Marriage is the story of one woman’s journey.\"Write about what disturbs you, what you fear, what you have not been willing to speak about. Be willing to be split open.\"Natalie Goldberg\"A book doesn’t come with a suggestion box, and the writer is not obliged to sculpt a story to your specific needs.\"Nora Roberts",
