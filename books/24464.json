  "description": "In the quest tradition of J.R.R. Tolkien, The Serpent's Egg begins as Ottawa lies under siege. Parliament Hill has fallen to dark forces. A group of children, led by Miranda, searches through the maze of caves and tunnels under the Library of Parliament. They are in quest of the magic needed to save our world and another, older world from Hate, the Demon, and her crazed minions. For Miranda and her companions, it's also a journey of self-discovery, where friendships and personal courage are put to the ultimate test in the never-ending war between good and evil.",
