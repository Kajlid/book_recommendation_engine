  "title": "Death of a Guru: A Remarkable True Story of one Man's Search for Truth",
  "description": "Rabi R. Maharaj came from a long line of Brahmin priests and gurus and trained as a yogi. He meditated for many hours each day, but gradually disillusionment set in. He describes Hindu life and custom, vividly and honestly tracing his difficult search for meaning and his struggle to choose between Hinduism and Christianity. At a time when Eastern mysticism, religion, and philosophy fascinate many in the West, Maharaj offers fresh and important insights from the perspective of his own experience. “A unique revelation of the inward struggles of a Hindu and the ultimate triumph over death that he discovered. I found it challenging and inspiring. Must reading.”―Hal Lindsey",
