  "description": "A John Cleese Twitter question (\"What is your pet peeve?\"), first sparked the \"Weird Things Customers Say in Bookshops\" blog, which grew over three years into one bookseller's collection of ridiculous conversations on the shop floor. From \"Did Beatrix Potter ever write a book about dinosaurs?\" to the hunt for a paperback which could forecast the next year's weather; and from \"I've forgotten my glasses, please read me the first chapter\" to \"Excuse me... is this book edible?\", here is a book for heroic booksellers and booklovers everywhere.This full-length collection illustrated by the Brothers McLeod also includes top \"Weird Things\" from bookshops around the world.",
