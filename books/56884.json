  "description": "Her only chance was to hide. His only choice was to find her. 1890, Idaho Territory. Libby Blue has found a refuge from her past in the Idaho wilderness. Leaving her ruthless father and a privileged Eastern girlhood behind, she finally has freedom in the wild West. There, Libby can run a ranch, make her own choices, and never have to answer to any man. But then Remington Walker rides into her life—and he poses a more serious danger to Libby than she’s ever faced. Despite herself, Libby finds Remington breaking through all her defenses, threatening the fragile safety of her western refuge. But what she doesn’t know is that Remington has a reason for being there. A reason that could well destroy them both.",
