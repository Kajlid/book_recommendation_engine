  "description": "'The real redemption in these superbly gripping stories comes from their canny human detail, and the vivid, unsettling clarity they bring to our lives.’ \nSunday Times\n'He writes with the craft of Julian Barnes or, even, Truman Capote.’ The TimesAn expedition to Mars goes terribly wrong.A seaside pier collapses.A thirty-stone man is confined to his living room.One woman is abandoned on a tiny island in the middle of the ocean.Another woman is saved from drowning.Two boys discover a gun in a shoebox.A group of explorers find a cave of unimaginable size deep in the Amazon jungle.A man shoots a stranger in the chest on Christmas Eve.In this first collection of stories by the author of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time Mark Haddon demonstrates two things: first that he is a master of the short form (several of the stories have been longlisted for prizes), second that his imagination is even darker than we had thought.",
