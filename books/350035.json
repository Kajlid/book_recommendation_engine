Yet as the mysterious Raven, an outlaw who defies the English and protects the people, Alec could be Leitis's noble hero again—even as he risks a traitor's death.But He Knew Her Heart Was HisLeitis MacRae thought the English could do nothing more to her clan, but that was before Colonel Alec Landers came to reside where the MacRaes once ruled. Now, to save the only family she has left, Leitis agrees to be a prisoner in her uncle's place, willing to face even an English colonel to spare his life. But Alec, with his soldier's strength and strange compassion, is an unwelcome surprise.

And as danger and passion lead them to love, will their bond survive Alec's unmasking? Or will Leitis decide to score her beloved enemy?",
