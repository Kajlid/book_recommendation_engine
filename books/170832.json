  "description": "The Good Knight is on his watch when he hears a sound. Roar! Is it a dragon? A great big dragon? He searches the woods and finds a surprise. Three very little dragons are almost ready for bed. But who will read to them, tuck them in, and kiss them good night? Is this a job for the Good Knight? Young readers, like the young dragons, will quickly fall under the Good Knight's spell.\"Stories of valiant knights slaying fearsome dragons are going to fall sadly flat after one reading of this bewitching tale.\" ( Kirkus Reviews , pointer review)",
