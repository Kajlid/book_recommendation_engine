  "description": "The relentless war with the Elementals was not the only cause of the scars Ruth Tusk bore. Her father, the leader of the mounted Chargers, has been killed in battle, and as a woman, she is forbidden from following in her father’s footsteps and is desperate to realise her dream. As she seeks to become part of the King’s Army, Jecko, the battle-worn relic, is forced to leave. He reluctantly agrees to guard the agricultural estate for Lady Scala’s womanising husband, whose lands are at risk of occupation from Armastad and his army of bronze warriors, with not only Jecko’s life but his family placed in harm’s way.  A Suit of White Armour is book 3 in the Rake's Drift series.",
