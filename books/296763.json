  "description": "For years, Jimmy Tudeski has written some of the most controversial fictional comedies out there, but who is he? We know he's a writer, we know he's worked with some of the biggest comedians in the UK, we know he's ghostwritten many books for other people too, but if he's so good at what he does, then why hasn't he become a famous stand-up comedian himself yet?All will be revealed inside this one-off publication, him hiding inside the pages of a book, simply because he's too scared to get up on stage and say anything out loud. A memoir of insightful topics, passionate rants and things that puzzle him on a daily basis, which confusingly leads him to believe he's not worthy of your laughter at all. Only available in paperback (with pictures inside the book too) Jimmy talks about his writing career, a caravan, even astrology, randomly talking everything a stand-up comedian would talk about in one of their own sell out shows. Question is â€“ Why is Jimmy considered a comedian gone wrong?We've built him up, we've laid the path, so get ready for some of his craziness, never seen in one of his books until now. This is it, Jimmy Tudeski in all his glory, ready to entertain and give you... Fu$king hell, talking about yourself in third person and selling yourself on the back of a book is actually harder than writing the inside part for you!",
