  "title": "The Damned Thing",
  "description": "This engrossing tale presents as its central theme the ultimately unknowable – and untameable – essence of nature and the natural world. Told from several different perspectives, the story focuses on a freak fatal accident that is written off as a wild animal attack. But does that description get at the truth of the matter? At least one witness is convinced otherwise. A story of the paranormal that was once loosely adapted for an episode of the television series Masters of Horror.",
