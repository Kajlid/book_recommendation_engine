  "description": "The brilliant new novel from the bestselling authors of Come Together and Come Again , soon to be a film from the producers of Four Weddings and a Funeral .It’s the 1970s in the sleepy English village of Rushton, and Mickey Maloney and Fred Roper are next door neighbours and best friends. In and out of scrapes from childhood, they share everything from their first cigarette to their first kiss. They’re convinced that nothing will ever keep them apart – but they’re wrong. Fifteen years later, Mickey is beginning a new phase of her life with a small flower shop in London. Squeezed into the tiny flat upstairs, she’s a loving, if chaotic, single mother, trying to build a secure life. Fred’s about to get married to Rebecca, but when he bumps into Mickey in the aisle of Toys ‘R’ Us, his whole world turns upside down. The Boy Next Door is a warm, funny and moving novel about second chances and falling in love and learning you’re never too old.",
