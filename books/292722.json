  "description": "Psychic Copeland Forbes can’t get a good night’s sleep. His dreams are being haunted by two restless spirits, one crying out for his help and, the other bent on destroying him. Only able to communicate through dreams, the anguished spirit gives Cope just enough information to send him running back home to New Orleans to solve the mystery.  Ghost Detective Jude Byrne is against Cope going back to The Big Easy. It was trouble as long as the Mississippi that sent Copeland fleeing New Orleans in the first place but, if Cope insists on going, Jude is going to. To make the mission as safe as possible, Jude puts together a team of psychics, warlocks, and detectives he’s hoping are strong enough to keep everyone, namely Cope, safe.  When the spirits’ identities are revealed, tragedy strikes a member of the ghost detective team. Will help arrive in time or will they be left with only the ghost of a chance?",
