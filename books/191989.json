  "title": "The Atheist Bible: Knowledge is Power!",
  "description": "A burlesque, philosophical, humorous, spiritual, and scientific case against the menace of theism and organised religion, by Daniel S. Fletcher. Neither physicist, nor biologist, merely a humble, cocky, vaguely eloquent kid, with a polemic against the tyrannical conditions imposed on man by man, 'divinely' mandated by the ancient superstitions of the illiterate desert. This is a contribution to the war of ideas - for humanism over barbarism, poetry over pogroms, literature over scripture, irony over immolation, and the triumph of philosophy, science, reason and morality over the archaic and totalitarian commandments and divisive preachments of doctrine. Wisdom begins in wonder, and knowledge is power! Viva la libertad!",
