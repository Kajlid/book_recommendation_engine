  "description": "Spirited, impetuous Miranda Chadwick arrived in the untamed New World prepared for any peril. So when the notorious pirate Jack Blackstone kidnapped her, she was certain she could somehow make the insufferable golden-haired rogue surrender to justice. But Miranda soon found that she was the one surrendering â€” to the shameless desires that the scoundrel's bronzed, lean body and demanding caresses ignited ... and her own reckless hunger for more!Jack Blackstone regarded the furious Miranda Chadwick with a triumphant grin.
