  "description": "'The past doesn't define me. It's just a place I've been.' Seth Kingston is back in town with years of regrets. Regrets for the way he left things with Penny, the hurt he caused her, and the future they could have had together. He had his reasons and now all he wants is to make amends and have a second chance at love. But Penny wants no part of what he's offering. She's accepted that life is hard, love is an illusion, and you can't trust men. Especially men named Seth Kingston. And yet... he's so tender with her. He's patient, and caring. Is it possible that he's changed? Can they really try again? The past has a tendency to embed its vicious talons deep into a heart, never to let go again. Penny has enough tragedy to last lifetimes and isn't willing to let anyone scale her walls. Can real love survive anything, even an unforgiving past?",
