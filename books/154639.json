  "description": "After a tragic accident that plays on an endless loop in her mind, wild child Kate Jolie died inside. She now functions only through her rigid, ironclad routine, which keeps her mind and soul in check – balancing her in a dangerously precarious position between life and death Rocker and Master's student Sam North knows no limits and seeks out every challenge to conquer and defy. With his cocky grin, piercings, colorful tattoos, undress-you bedroom eyes and magnetic sex appeal, he has no trouble finding women to warm his bed. When he spies his new professor, the gorgeous Ms. Jolie, she’s just another summit he wants to climb in order to reach its peak. But as he begins to catch glimpses of her soul, she becomes his Everest. Kate Jolie is the only woman who wants nothing to do with Sam North - and the only woman he can’t do without.",
