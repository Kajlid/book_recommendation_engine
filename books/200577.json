  "description": "Having two centuries of his life behind him, Austyn began writing these five letters describing his unfathomable existence.He recounts the life he led, from the strange heat felt within his nursery and triple struck lightning events nearby, to his acquisition of a multitude of mind-shattering abilities.Throughout his young life, his first life, he dealt with the emergence of a new ability almost every year, and losing it the following as a new ability formed, yet all the while, something even more powerful was incubating inside him.But Austyn isn't the only Austyn...When time travel and the power to imagine is only limited by one's imagination, errors can be made that can not be erased without crossing a line that one should never dare cross.The day he learns his family has become entangled in a future catastrophe, Austyn's adventure becomes a mission that may just lead to his understanding of who he really is.If you like Time Travel, paradoxical occurrences, 90's memories, wizard-like abilities, and questionable sanity in an Author, then this is for you!",
