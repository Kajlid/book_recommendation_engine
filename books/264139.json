  "description": "Seventeen-year-old spy Loveday has been training for her first international spy mission for years, with a former-CIA father and a secret team that works in the underbelly of Washington, D.C.  For her first mission, all she has to do is crack a ring of car thieves for London’s premiere hotel owner, Charles Darnay. But Darnay’s bumbling buffoon public persona belies secrets that could add dangerous complications to Loveday’s mission.  And he’s not the only one who’s lying. If Loveday doesn’t expose the truth, her team could be in mortal danger.",
