  "description": "Leon Garber’s an accountant and occasional assassin. But he’s one of the good guys. See, Leon’s only interested in taking out abusers. He’s not the only serial killer on a mission, though. His past employer Like Minded Individuals, Inc. (LMI for short), employs quite a few. Mostly, Leon was a model employee. Or at least, he was until that little falling-out he had with them last year. Now he’s got a target on his back. He’s seriously out-numbered, but even worse, LMI has hired Leon’s former associate, Cody Spangler, to track him down. Unfortunately for Leon, someone else from Leon’s past, someone he never wanted to see again, has other ideas for Leon’s welfare.Old allies and new enemies clash to bring down the insidious Like-Minded Individuals, Inc. Serial killers have never been so much fun.",
