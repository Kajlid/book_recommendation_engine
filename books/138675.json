Will they find their path toward the future together?Eighth and final chapter of Fargoer, a novel set in the mythic far north.We welcome you to step into the dark northern forest. The time when no plow had touched the ground this far in the wilderness. When tall shapes of viking ships struck terror and awe everywhere they set their sails. This was the age of dreams and legends, of powers now long forgotten. The whispers you can hear in the cold wind of the darkest places of this earth.Vierra is a young woman among her people called Kainu, a tribe of age-old traditions and ways. Hers is the grim and solitary existence of a woman cursed with greatness and destiny.Can she break her path painted in stone and find a place for herself in her tribe and in the world filled with turmoil? Or will she become, the Fargoer?Fargoer is a novel that draws its power from the harsh, yet beautiful nature and folklore of Finland. The combination of fast-paced action and wonder of the long lost worlds of yesterday borrows heavily from pulp-literature of the 1930's.",
