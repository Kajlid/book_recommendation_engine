  "description": "[College Student/Professor Lesbian Erotic Romance, 26,300 words]For the sake of forbidden love, would you risk it all? I have a confession - I'm in love with my professor, Dr. Alana Lark. All during her junior level lit course, I'd try to concentrate, but I just couldn't. What attracts me to her? Her bad ass attitude, her Irish accent, her gorgeous, dark features and hair. Honestly, take your pick. I'd do anything for her, but I just can't bring myself to tell her how I feel. It'd be so wrong. So deliciously wrong...
