It is the autumn of 1969.Casey and Pamela Riordan have fled the erupting violence of Belfast, Northern Ireland, only to find themselves caught in the politically corrupt streets of South Boston, Massachusetts. Though Pamela appears to flourish in the arena of Boston Irish politics, Casey struggles to survive in a world where his presence has become increasingly “inconvenient.” Forced into making desperate choices that bear heavy consequences, the Riordans return to an Ireland on the brink of revolution. And to an inevitable alliance with Jamie Kirkpatrick. It is here the bonds of love are tested – by the bloody price of rebellion, a past that is fraught with dangers of its own, friendships that carry a heavy price and by a secret that threatens to tear their lives apart.",
