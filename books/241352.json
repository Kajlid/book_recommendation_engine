My name is Ashryn Barker, and I’m a vampire hunter. One of the best in fact.  I also have a secret. One I can never tell anyone else. When I look someone in the eyes, I can see their deepest secret, the one hidden behind the illusion they show the world.  My name is Ashryn Barker, and I’m here to shatter your illusions.  Shattered Illusions is a paranormal reverse harem filled with vampires, hunters, and some very wrong assumptions. Shattered Illusions is the first book in the Ashryn Barker series, and is a novella. However books 2 & 3 will both be full novels.",
