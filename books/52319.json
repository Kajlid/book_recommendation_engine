  "description": "Working for a company whose slogan is ‘Sex sells and we’re very good at sex’ isn’t easy for a man with an apparently inexhaustible ability to blush. Things only get more embarrassing for Floyd when he’s sent to construct an advertising campaign for a BDSM club.As if that wasn’t bad enough, the owner of the club is Peter Ingram, the silent partner in SKIN designs, which technically makes him Floyd’s boss. If he screws this up, Floyd’s going to be looking for a new job. His only option is to set aside his embarrassment and throw himself into learning everything there is to know about leather.But, when Peter agrees to teach Floyd what submission really means, suddenly it’s not only his job that’s at risk.",
