  "description": "It started when I stole a secret I was never meant to keep.Then, “I dare you,” was whispered in the dark of night.Three simple words that changed everything.I became the one thing that Rhys Blackwood hated more than he hated himself.St. Augustine’s very own fallen angel had me in his hold and he wasn’t giving up until I was ruined.I was a snitch. A liar. A pawn.He was cruel. Merciless. The King.Together, we were fated for destruction.And where there are secrets and untruths… there are demons lurking beyond the shadows.",
