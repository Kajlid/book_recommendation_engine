  "title": "Pleasure and Ambition: The Life, Loves and Wars of Augustus the Strong",
  "description": "Augustus the Strong of Saxonyâ€™s life was consumed by two the relentless pursuit of power and the uncompromising pursuit of pleasure. From his accession as Elector of Saxony in 1694 (when his brother the previous Elector died under mysterious circumstances) he pursued political power and glory by fighting the Ottoman Turks, purchasing the Polish throne (becoming a Catholic in the bargain) and warring against Sweden. His other great addiction--to pleasure--primarily in the female form--continually distracted Augustus from the single-minded pursuit of his dynastic aim. (He was reputed to have produced an illegitimate child for every day of the year.) This is the first biography in English of Augustus, and is based on primary German sources and the dispatches of English diplomats.",
