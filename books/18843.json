  "description": "CALLING LOST AND FOUND -- HAVE YOU SEEN MY BRAIN?  Some kids lose their homework. Some kids lose their math book, or their sneakers, or their lunch.  Pleskit Meenom, first alien kid to go to school on Earth, has a bigger problem: He's lost his grandfather's brain!  Of course, that's not Pleskit's only problem. He's feuding with his best friend Tim. Someone is leaking stories about him to a sleazy supermarket tabloid. And sixth grade is turning out to be a bigger challenge than interplanetary navigation.  But if Pleskit can't find that missing brain, none of those other problems will matter, because his life won't be worth a plug skeelrag!",
