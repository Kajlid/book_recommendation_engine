  "description": "Leo Varma doesn’t need love. At thirty-seven, he’s satisfied with focusing on his career, friends, and casual hookups. Besides, getting into a real relationship would mean finally telling his conservative family that he’s gay, and possibly losing them forever. He’s convinced himself that living in the shadows is good enough... until he meets Dylan. Dylan Drake-Matthews might be a catastrophe on two legs, but he loves life. After taking a part-time job at the club Leo frequents, the wide-eyed nineteen-year-old dives into the kink scene with both feet. When his first few attempts end in disaster, Leo takes Dylan under his wing, and everything clicks in a surprising way. But secret encounters can only carry them so far. Dylan’s authenticity and personal honesty make Leo wish things were different in his own life, while Leo’s family situation keeps him from being what Dylan needs. Can Leo face his fears? Or will he let the love he never expected to find slip through his fingers? Leo & His Lion is an 80K word May/December, kitten play MM romance featuring an adorable kitten, the sexy man he calls Daddy, and superhero underwear. It is the second book in the Oh My! series and can be read as a standalone.",
