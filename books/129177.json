  "description": "Political fixer Callie Haven needs a break. After a close call with an amorous blackmailer, she decides she needs to escape the high pressure world of DC politics. Instead of a vacation, Callie's boss (and overbearing older sister) gives her another job: keep scandal prone billionaire playboy Logan Harris out of the press. What was supposed to be an easy job turns out to be much, much more. One of the nation's most eligible bachelors, Logan Harris doesn't believe in love or relationships. But from the moment he sees Callie at his father's Newport mansion, he wants her. He’s never met anyone like Callie: someone who matches his wit and energy. Intrigued, Logan sets out to win her over. Despite her best efforts, Callie can’t deny her deep attraction to Logan. At first she writes it off as a bit of harmless fun, but she soon discovers there’s more to it than that. She's falling for Logan. He's trouble personified, and everything she says she doesn't want in a man, but he makes her feel alive in a way she’s never felt before. When one of Logan's old flames shows up with a scandal that could destroy everything he cares about, including his budding relationship with Callie, he must choose between what he wants and what Callie needs. And when her feelings for Logan directly conflict with her job, will she do what it takes to be with him?",
