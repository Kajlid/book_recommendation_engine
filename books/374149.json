  "title": "Holden and Yves – The Early Years",
  "description": "Holden and Yves – The Early Years is a mini-prequel tale in the Slave Breakers saga, but is best read after the other stories in the series. Imagine a modern society parallel to our own where impoverished peasants are legally permitted to sell their children into slavery starting at age 15. The upper class households in this world demonstrate their wealth by buying the best of everything - including people. Holden and Yves – The Early Years gives us a glimpse (told through individual scenes) into the beginnings of the Slave Breakers family.  This book originally appeared as posts on LiveJournal and still contains some editing notes. The text is sexually explicit (including m/m and polyamorous situations) and is intended for adult readers.",
