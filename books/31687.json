  "description": "The dead have risen. A lethal virus has decimated millions, turning the infected into the walking dead. Society has crumbled, cities are in flames, and the human race is on the verge of extinction. Somehow, Mike McKnight has survived. So far. From his cell in a mental institution, he battled the ghosts of his past and the throngs of undead to uncover and retrieve the last vestige of mankind's hope to fight the deadly plague. Now, from the deck of an aircraft carrier, to the farmlands of the Eastern Shore and the very heart of the nation's capital, Mike carries the hope of an entire race. With him rides the only chance at fighting the spread of the virus, and turning back the tide of infection. But the undead are changing. They are evolving. Hunting in larger groups and banding together to track their prey, that are more dangerous predators than ever before. To survive, he will have to learn to adapt, and to come to grips with the most important evolution of all: his own.",
