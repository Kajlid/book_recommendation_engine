  "description": "The search for their fifth will bring them more than they bargained for.  A part of the ancient magical Order of the Akasha, four male witches await their last remaining piece... only to be stunned when a badass descendant of a voodoo priestess shows up. All five-foot-feisty of her turns their world on edge, making them rethink everything they thought they knew about enforcing the one rule in their magical world--harm none.  Despite the supernatural forces binding them together, there's one slight problem--there's never been a female Enforcer before. Sexy or not, the guys have sworn their allegiance to a tradition that calls her very presence unnatural. Their pull, though, doesn't care about 'never-beens' or 'what-ifs'.  The deeper their connection, the more their magic morphs and changes, leaving them desperate for answers and teetering into the very world of evil they promised to protect others from. Before it's too late, they must uncover the secrets of their past before the magic that brought them together destroys them all.",
