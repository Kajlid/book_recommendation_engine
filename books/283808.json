That is something I vowed to myself as soon as I was old enough to take up the yoke of ruling the Blood Court. Whether it was as a hero, or carried home on a shield, I would always come home. It was where I was born. It was the place Iâ€™d devoted myself to and sworn to defend. It was my birthright, my legacy!\nNow home meant even more. It meant her, my Fated Mate. And nothing was going to stop me from bringing her there. Not the men I had once trusted above anyone else.
