  "description": "The cold spread like anaesthetic in her veins. Fear resurged, driving deeper into every cell.\"Why would my looking in a mirror help you see me?\"\"Because I see through your eyes.\"When Zelie Taylor pulls a lost necklace out of the icy waters of the lake, she has no idea what the consequences will be. At first the pendant is just freezing cold - unnaturally so - but then she hears a voice inside her head and Zelie thinks she must be going mad. She's not. Seventeen-year-old Tamas' soul has been trapped in the silver necklace since 1918. His body is nearby, sleeping, and Zelie must help him awaken. At first Zelie would like nothing better than for Tamas' moody, enigmatic presence to be out of her life, but after a while she isn't so sure. And what is waiting for Tamas when he does emerge? It seems that the sinister force that trapped him all those years ago has returned and is growing more powerful.A hundred-year-old mystery steeped in dark magic will make Zelie question everything she thought she knew.",
