One rule keeps us from destroying each other: Share everything. So when little miss curves and confidence swings her hips into our lives... Well. The rule can't change. I already said it. We share everything. That includes Marina. Even if we help her--the only kind of help two hitmen can offer--we can't let her live. No risks. No mistakes.
