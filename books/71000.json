  "description": "Alexandria Collins learned the hard way not every man can be trusted. After her husband tried to kill her, she and her son went under FBI protection where they’ve spent the last ten years. Her trust issues with men have created a nonexistent sex life. But when they move to a small Arkansas town, she’s drawn to the biggest, hottest man she’s ever seen. Brody “Brutus” Jackson is immediately attracted to Xan when her hot little body walks into the shop where he works as a mechanic in an official capacity, and as a mercenary unofficially. He knows instantly she’s off-limits. He doesn’t do single moms—too much baggage—but more importantly, he knows her from somewhere…a dangerous sign since he only remembers the last twelve years of his life, and what he’s learned of his past needs to stay buried.He fights his overwhelming desire, but when he discovers his assignment is her protection, he realizes how easily one hot little momma can bring him to his knees…and how difficult facing who he was can be.",
