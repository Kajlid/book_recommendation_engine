  "description": "Going deep: In football it means running down the field for a long pass. You’re serious. Committed. Unstoppable. As a wide receiver, it’s a term I’m all too familiar with. It’s who I am, at least when it comes to my career. For the past decade, football has been the only thing I’ve allowed myself to commit to. That is until a beautiful, blue-eyed temptress steps into my limo to escort me to a charity function. She’s strong, independent, and quick witted. Everything I want in a woman. There’s just one problem. She’s not mine for the taking. But that’s not going to stop me from winning her heart. I’m in deep with this woman. I’m running down the field with my arms and heart open, ready for the catch. Now all I need is for her to throw the ball.",
