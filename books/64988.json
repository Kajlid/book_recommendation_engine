  "description": "Smart, sharp, and sometimes painfully honest, Pearls Before Swine mocks the flaws and shortcomings of human nature with cynical humor. Pearls Before Swine is the hilarious comic strip tale of two friends: arrogant, egotistical Rat who thinks he knows it all and slow-witted Pig who is painfully naive. Together with Zebra, the activist, Goat, the reluctant brain,  and the carnivorous Crocs, it offers pointed commentary on humanity’s pitiable plight.",
