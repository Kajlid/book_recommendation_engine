  "description": "Rye was a Confederate officer. It was less than two weeks ago that he was shipped to Mars along with other officers in order to aide the colonists against the attack of the geoarachnids, creatures that came from the depth of Mars. It was great and all except he wasn’t fond of the Colony nor its people. To make matter worse, he was paired up with Draco, a colonist pilot who crashed the battle hover with Rye on it! Stranded in the middle of nowhere, Rye had to learn to work with the injured Draco if they were to ever make it back to civilization. Finding their way home, they will instead discover a dark secret of the Colony, the origin of the geoarachnid and the truth behind the disappearance of Draco’s parents. To make things more even complicated, Rye discovered that he actually didn’t really mind having Draco around. In fact, it was quite the opposite.",
