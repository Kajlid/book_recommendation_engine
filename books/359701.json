  "title": "Mosley by Moonlight",
  "description": "Strange things are happening in the remote village of Hadley Dale. Without warning, a TV crew invades the district to shoot a commercial. Without reason, tales of extra-terrestrial sightings spring up. And without a clue, Matthew Longden's robust 'housekeeper' friend disappears -- in the same way his wife did five years ago.Assigned to find the missing woman, the unpredictable Mosley bicycles through the Lancashire countryside. Sidetracked by TV mischief-makers, cricket matches, and rumors of a buried body, Mosley is stopped in his leisurely tracks by a shocking death. By prying information from the locals and raising hackles at headquarters, deceptively brilliant Mosley soon unravels an intricate tapestry of delusions, disappearances, and death to neatly tie up a most malicious murder.",
