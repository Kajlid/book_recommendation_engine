  "title": "He's a Duke, But I Love Him",
  "description": "After five seasons, Lady Olivia Jackson has despaired of ever finding the man she is searching for -- a man who will allow her the freedom to live life as she pleases. Her deepest desires are not the typical pastimes of a lady. Using a pseudonym, Olivia puts her intellect to use writing a financial column, and yearns for a life of fun and adventure. Her mother, unfortunately, has other ideas.  Upon the unexpected death of his father, well-known rake and charmer Alastair Finchley is thrust into the role of Duke of Breckenridge. The title, however, also comes with massive amounts of debt which his father accumulated at the horse track and the gambling tables. This life of responsibility is not one which Alastair would have chosen, and he is determined to maintain his rakish ways in all other aspects.  When Olivia and Alastair renew their acquaintance, they are shocked by the depths of their desire for one another. They each determine, however, that giving in is not worth the potential consequences -- or is it?  Heâ€™s a Duke, But I Love Him is a 60,000-word romance with no cliffhangers, no cheating, and a guaranteed happily ever after! For readers 18+ due to some steamy love scenes.",
