  "description": "The Nigger Bible - \"written by an acknowledged Nigger about the experience of Niggers, addressed and directed exclusively to my Nigger people for whom it was purposely conceived.\" Thus does the late internationally acclaimed author Robert H. DeCoy introduce this explosive best-seller. First published in 1967, THE NIGGER BIBLE is universally accepted as one of the true classics of the literature of the American Black experience. Robert H. DeCoy has been praised and damned around the world for this volatile work. In his introduction of this edition, entertainer Dick Gregory calls DeCoy \"one of the literary giants of our time\" who has dared to discard the traditional vestiges of Judeo-Christianity in order to find and reveal the spiritual truths of being Black.\" THE NIGGER BIBLE has been called \"the most important book of our generation... It slashes through hypocrisy to reveal a seething, shocking truth that all men know but none has dared to express. First Printing! Los Holloway House, (1967). Preface by Dick Gregory. Cover says 'HH-150 AADC Adult Reading 95c'. Used paperback. Not a former library book. Pages are yellowed and the cover shows much age/wear and some soiling, but there is no writing. Bottom left of cover by spine is torn about 3/4 of an inch.",
