  "description": "In the mid-1870s, civilization froze in time when comets hit the earth. Instead of advancing technologically, humanity had to piece itself back together. In the 21st century, boats still run on steam, messages are delivered by telegraph, and the British Empire controls much of the world from its capital in Delhi. The other major world power is the Czar of Russiaâ€”who is preparing for global conquest.",
