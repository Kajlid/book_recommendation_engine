  "description": "\"You are the thing that keeps him human. You are what keeps him from madness and darkness. We need you, dearest.\"  The Order of the Blessed is all I have known. I keep my head down and my hair covered. I don’t speak unless spoken to. I follow the rules—mostly. But the clock is ticking. Soon, Father Joshua will name my husband and there isn’t a man here I want to touch me.  The last thing I expected was for Father Joshua to choose me for his own. I’m special, he said. I’m wicked. And I need a holy man to keep me from my own wickedness.  Now, I must escape. Even though I hardly know what’s beyond these walls. Even if I die out there in the forest.  I didn’t expect someone to catch me when I leapt. Especially four someones.  Rayner. Silvus. Jie. Thom. They’re the most gorgeous men I’ve ever laid eyes on—and they’re also merciless, vicious vampires. They’ve loved me and pursued me for five hundred years, across every life I’ve lived. And they’re ready to possess me, to show me what love is, even as I’m slow to trust. They will do anything to protect me from the Order of the Blessed—but the Order of the Blessed will do anything to protect me from them.  It’s time for me to discover just how special I really am.  TAKE ME SLOWLY is a reverse harem romance with some very possessive, obsessive, slightly twisted vampires who will do anything for the woman they love and a damaged heroine who slowly finds her own strength. Did I mention m/m? Vampires get lonely waiting to find their lady.",
