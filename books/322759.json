  "description": "Does Colorado's Grand Canyon hide an ancient city found by a Smithsonian Institution photographer?Did the Vikings beat Columbus to the New World using a fiber-optic navigational instrument?Who built a colossal water reservoir in Iowa long before the first European settlers arrived?What secret have the \"Giants of the California Desert\" preserved for more than a thousand years?These are just some of the intriguing questions posed and answered by expert researchers in Unearthing Ancient America . They go on to tackle a broad variety of archaeological enigmas shunned as too heretical for consideration by conventional scholars--a Roman figurine found off the New Jersey coast, North African gold in Illinois from a long-vanished kingdom, an Egyptian knife removed from a centuries-old tree in California, a fifth century Christian church in Connecticut, a prehistoric harbor underwater in the Bahamas, Easter Island's cultural connections with pre-modern Japan, and voyagers to Maine from Stone Age Scotland.Unearthing Ancient America contains a wealth of fresh, occasionally suppressed evidence documenting the tremendous impact made on our continent by overseas visitors hundreds and even thousands of years before Columbus. The disclosures presented here re-write the prehistory of our country and provide a dramatic panorama of the past you never imagined before.The distinguished list of contributing writers to Unearthing Ancient America",
