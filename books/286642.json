  "description": "One moment I was leaving work, the next I was entertaining a silvery-green alien intent on knowing me fully.  Their invasion of our world nonviolent, seamless.  They dress as human men, eat in human restaurants, vote, pay taxes, and are controlling every last one of us.  I don’t understand how no one else can see what I see? That their beauty is a trap.  They have come here for women, intent on creating life partners—through seduction, mental manipulation, employing muscular bodies capable of fulfilling any female desire. Shaping themselves to our wants.  Until we’ve each been claimed, marked, and changed. Assimilated.  We don't have a choice. They can make us like it. They can make us desire them. They can make us do anything they want.",
