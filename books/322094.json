  "description": "From the author of Digging Up Love comes a heartfelt story about two rivals whose passion for food and their communities brings them together in ways they never expected. After doing her time in corporate Chicago, Simone Blake returns to small-town Illinois to tackle a new her grandfather’s barbecue restaurant. The secret, as they say, is in the sauce. Simone’s plan is to sell Honey and Hickory’s signature sauce to put her hometown on the map. But she’s not the only one with a recipe and a chef Finn Rimes from nearby Springfield has a similar vision. To jump-start his dream of opening a culinary school, he shows up at the local farmers’ market with his own barbecue sauce. When Simone’s plan to outsell Finn falls flat, she auditions for a reality show to pitch her brand. But she’s horrified to discover Finn’s had the same idea. As Simone and Finn wage barbecue war on television, their feud turns into an undeniable attraction. With their livelihoods on the line, it may not be so much about making the best sauce―but finding their way to each other.",
