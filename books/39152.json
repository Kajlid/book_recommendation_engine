  "title": "Kesavan's Lamentations",
  "description": "Set in steamy, politicized Kerala, Kesavan s Lamentations in an engaging, witty romp through the complexities of a community, paralleled with the tangle which is a writer s mind in the midst of a book.Written as a story within a story - one merging inevitable with the other - the book recreates the internal and external chaos involved in the process of Keavan's writing, as he pens his book, 'Appukkuttan's Lamentations'. M. Mukundan moves effortlessly between the protagonist's creative pangs as he grapples with the impossibility of writing, the impossible straddling of his demanding family, social and creative life, and his imaginary world, charged with the energy of a cast of fascinating, eccentric characters - the vulnerable Appukkuttan, with his strange obsession with the popular Communist leader his anxious father, burdened with the reponsibility of single parenthood; and the enigmatic teacher and Communist party memeber, Amaan Sir.",
