  "description": "Max isn’t gay, but he’s about to marry a man anyway.  His little sister is counting on him, and wedding planner Connor is the best chance he’s ever had of coming up with the money he needs to pay for her surgery. All they have to do is win one little wedding competition.  As Max’s bi-curiosity gets the better of him, things get complicated quickly. He finds himself drawn to Connor, their closeness giving Max the chance to experience all kinds of things he’s never had the chance to do before and indulge his curiosity for the first time.  His relationship with Connor deepens physically and emotionally as they get to know each other, but despite growing up in a town like Hope Springs, Max isn’t sure how he feels about Connor, or whether he wants to admit it--even to himself.  With the wedding approaching and the deadline on their relationship coming up fast, Max finds that his world is suddenly moving way too quickly. Can he figure out what he wants in time to keep it? Or will Connor slip through his fingers before he can tell him how he really feels?  Something Blue is the third and final book in the Something About Him series. It can be read alone, and ends happily ever after. It contains: chocolate cake, sexy hair dyeing, several home-cooked meals, explicit sex scenes, a glitter-related mishap, a too-small t-shirt, and true love conquering all.",
