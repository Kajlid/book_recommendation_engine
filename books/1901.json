  "description": "Scottish metal vocalist Spark MacDubh wakes covered in snow on a street of his home town. His most recent memories are of dying and being jolted back to life by a force from the skies. He sets out to restart his band, which fragmented years earlier in a hail of blood rituals, violence, depravity and jail time. Finding his ex-bandmates isn’t easy, but convincing them to abandon their new lives in order to chase old dreams is a monumental task. Hearing voices he believes are celestial, MacDubh leads the band out on tour…and mayhem follows. Their trail of destruction, fornication, occult events and transcendent riffage attracts the attention of a particularly savage demon. As the voices in Spark’s head urge him down ever darker paths, his psyche is stretched to breaking point. Even with help from a Wiccan priestess, a criminal manager, the world’s most eccentric music journalist and an assortment of dead rock stars, the odds are stacked against MacDubh and his gang.Doubting his own sanity, Spark initiates a meeting with the Devil, who claims to be the band’s only hope of success. Unwilling to sign away his soul, MacDubh decides instead to put the Devil out of business. A fantastic idea but not exactly a practical one. For starters, it requires a trip to Hell. Catch-22? More like Catch-666.Enter a realm where deities and demons are muses, where the profound is hidden within the profane, and where five uncompromising Scots must put their existence on the line in defence of each other. An immersive journey loaded with hope, humour and the heaviest metal.“The Devil has all the best tunes? My arse! Metalville just got a new sheriff.”  – Spark MacDubh",
