With a joke.Two brothers—Will and Jeff—and their friend Tom are out one night at their favorite South Beach bar and decide to make a bet on who can be the first to seduce a mysterious-looking young woman drinking by herself. Pretty, dark-haired, and blue-eyed Suzy has an innocent, almost ordinary girl-next-door way about her.Little do they know the secrets she’s hiding from the outside world, particularly those having to do with the daily horror she experiences under the watchful eye of her abusive husband. Little do they know she has an agenda of her own. Little do they know their harmless bet is about to take on a life of its own, a life full of deadly consequences for all concerned.Fielding is continually praised for her “heart-pounding” (Booklist) brand of storytelling, full of “chillingly satisfying twists” (People). There’s certainly no going back once you’ve entered The Wild Zone.",
