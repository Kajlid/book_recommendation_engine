  "title": "Fallen University: Year Two",
  "description": "If I thought year one at Fallen University was rough, year two may prove hellish...What do you do when your entire magical academy is banished to the underworld?No, seriously. If you have any ideas, I would love to hear them.Because we've been cut off from humanity and the rest of the Custodians, and the admins seem completely lost, unsure of what to do or how to get us back to earth.And to make matters worse, some students seem to be reacting very... badly to being in the underworld.But the rumor that just breathing the atmosphere down here for too long will turn you evil is just a myth, right?Right?This is book two of the Fallen University trilogy, a reverse harem romance with a slightly snarky heroine and four sexy, supernatural men. It includes cursing and lots of steam and is intended for readers 18+.",
