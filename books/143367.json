  "description": "Jace Sloan has it all. He's smoking hot, a college football star with a storybook family, and he's never met a woman he couldn't charm. He's also never met one who makes him want to be a better man...until he meets Maggie. Now, this self-proclaimed geek with wild red hair and the greenest eyes he's ever seen has him thinking all kinds of crazy thoughts. Like settling down and being a one-woman man. Maggie Fielding is anything but Jace's type. For starters, her IQ is bigger than her chest size. But Jace is panty melting hot, and she's having a hard time remembering that heâ€™s bad news. If only she could stop telling him her secrets, because her answers to his questions just might have both of them falling in love for the first time.",
