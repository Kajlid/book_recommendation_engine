  "title": "China in Ten Words: Essays",
  "description": "From one of China’s most acclaimed a unique, intimate look at the Chinese experience over the last several decades. Framed by ten phrases common in the Chinese vernacular, China in Ten Words uses personal stories and astute analysis to reveal as never before the world’s most populous yet oft-misunderstood nation. In \"Disparity,\" for example, Yu Hua illustrates the expanding gaps that separate citizens of the country. In \"Copycat,\" he depicts the escalating trend of piracy and imitation as a creative new form of revolutionary action. And in \"Bamboozle,\" he describes the increasingly brazen practices of trickery, fraud, and chicanery that are, he suggests, becoming a way of life at every level of society. Witty, insightful, and courageous, this is a refreshingly candid vision of the \"Chinese miracle\" and all of its consequences.",
