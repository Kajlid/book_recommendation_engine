  "description": "Isaac is the superstitious type, and his Friday the Thirteenth is shaping up to be the worst kind of nightmare. The one good thing it brings him is Rusty, a sculptor who seems perfectly willing to buck Isaac's trend of bad luck to get to know him better. Rusty thinks Isaac needs to plan for good luck instead of bad, so he sets out to do what he can to make Isaac's life better, one day at a time. A series of catastrophic dates can't deter Rusty from his mission, but can Isaac overcome his disaster-prone ways long enough to take advantage of Rusty's care?",
