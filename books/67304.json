  "description": "Caroline O'Hara had been a published historical romance writer for over a decade, but her fan response was just not what it used to be. Her agent informed her that she would be dropped as a client unless she found a new way to sell more books. Saddened, she began to research erotica, the hottest reads that are gaining popularity every day. Caroline is enjoying her new life as an erotic author- that is, until she deals with writer's block. Unable to come up with any new ideas, she sinks into a depression. Her husband, Liam, has just the cure for it- and the night they share will be one they never forget! This is an erotic short story suitable for adults.",
