  "description": "Underland is a twisted copy of The Real that uses industrialised magic to power a weird mix of stolen technology. It’s just enough like The Real to make travelers over-confident and get them into trouble. Which is just what happened when Claire Stone accidentally falls through rushing home one night. Claire is offered a job as a Warrior, hunting down and destroying shape shifting monsters.What adventure-hungry lover of fantasy could refuse? Everything seems great, until a friend goes missing and the Warrior has to turn Hunter. “An under-London for The Hunger Games generation. Elegantly written, emotionally underpinned, and inventive.” Kim Lakin-Smith  ‘Well! When do we find out what happens next?! Was nearly late for school pick-up, served beans on toast after I burned the pasta for dinner, the dog sat by the door with his bowl in his mouth threatening to leave home and a small boy had his teeth brushed for about two seconds before we had a bedtime story in which he was thoroughly confused as it definitely not The Cat in the Hat… and all because I couldn’t put your book down :) Loved it!’ Katy O’Dowd  ‘Warrior Underland is an action-packed urban fantasy that brought Neil Gaiman’s Neverwhere to mind. Fill with adventure, magic, slick weaponry and a great cast of supporting characters (Evie is brilliant).’ Kim Curran",
