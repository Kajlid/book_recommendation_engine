  "title": "The Cat That Walked by Himself: And Other Stories",
  "description": "Originally collected in Rudyard Kipling’s Just So Stories in 1902, The Cat that Walked by Himself is one of the best-loved cat tales ever written. It is a story of the beginning of domesticated Man meets Woman and they move into a cave and set up the first household. Dog, Horse, and Cow come out of the Wild Woods and become tame. But Cat refuses, “I am not a friend and I am not a servant. I am the Cat who walks by himself and all places are alike to me.” Woman makes a bargain with Cat to allow him to come into the cave and sit by the fire and drink milk. But when night comes, he is once again the Cat that walks by himself.             The contrast between the cozy, domestic world and the cold, dark outdoors where the cat still has his freedom make this a compelling tale and a fun take on the independent feline character. This beautiful book is illustrated with the original pen-and-ink drawings by Kipling, including the iconic picture of the cat “walking by his wild lone through the Wet Wild Woods and waving his wild tail”. This edition also offers two other favorite children’s stories told by Kipling, “How the Camel Got His Hump,” ‘”The Elephant’s Child,” and “How the Rhinocerous Got His Skin.” This charming book is the perfect gift for children, cat lovers, and Kipling fans alike.",
