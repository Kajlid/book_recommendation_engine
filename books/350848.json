  "title": "The Gathering",
  "description": "The nine surviving children of the Hegarty clan gather in Dublin for the wake of their wayward brother Liam. It wasn't the drink that killed him - although that certainly helped - it was what happened to him as a boy in his grandmother's house, in the winter of 1968. \"The Gathering\" is a novel about love and disappointment, about thwarted lust and limitless desire, and how our fate is written in the body, not in the stars.",
