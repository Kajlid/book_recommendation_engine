He then shows how becoming better than rivals at carrying out those activities is what provides a business with four distinct layers of strategic competitive The first layer of advantage comes from carrying out the basic activities better than rivals.

The third layer comes from fine-tuning the way the activities are carried out to match the particular area of the economy where the business is operating. This is Strategy. And the fourth and ultimate layer of strategic advantage comes when the business connects all its different activities together in a way that generates higher levels of performance at them all. This is the Escher Cycle.

Virtuoso performance in business, as in any field of human activity, comes from focusing on exactly what is needed-no more and no less-and then co-ordinating those different activities perfectly. This book explains how to achieve that in business.",
