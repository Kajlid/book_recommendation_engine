  "description": "Welcome to Atlanta, GA and into the lives of Daisha, Dre, Chase and Tiffany. In an area where women outnumber men two to one, and educated, single straight brothers are far and few, it's no surprise that Chase has three women vying for his attention. As a co-worker to Chase, Daisha's beyond apprehensive about going there, because she has a history with dating a co-worker and that history is not pretty. But Chase was far too attractive to resist. She ditches her inhibitions and lets him in, but she quickly learns that she is in a battle for his heart that she refused to lose. One of her contenders is Tiffany Robinson. As the all grown up little sister to Chaseâ€™s best friend, they definitely have history, but will that translate to romance, especially after Dre enters the picture. Dre is gorgeous, exciting, and she has a style and personality that Chase finds irresistible, but who is the right woman for him? One click now to see what all the fuss over him is about and which one of these ladies is the ultimate winner of Chase Roberts, a Hot Commodity.",
