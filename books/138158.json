  "description": "Aleah Chalmers is constantly under stress in supporting eleven-year-old daughter Jodie and her grandmother Gram. Her work as a waitress pays enough to barely make ends meet. Wealthy Luther Christain, confined to a wheelchair, makes a proposal for marriage as a thirty-day business arrangement, Aleah overcomes her concerns, accepts, and moves the family into Luther’s enormous house. Luther is a perfect gentleman and begins to take on a role as Jodie’s father. As the days pass Aleah reflects on the strangeness of the secret arrangement, and begins to wonder about Luther’s motives. She also becomes aware that the thirty day period ends just after All Hallows’ Eve. A complication arises when Luther’s brother Garth returns from one of his long absences, and Aleah and Garth begin to develop strong feelings toward one another. Meanwhile, Jodie sees another little girl about her age that mysteriously appears and entices her to follow to a destination in the woods. As All Hallows’ Eve approaches, there is plenty of opportunity for Aleah to wonder who she can trust, and whether Jodie might be in some danger.",
