PRESENT DAY...When Lex notices an inky presence darkening Marcus’s eyes, she discovers he’s no longer what he seemed. Almost too late, she realizes that the man she has entrusted with both her heart and her life is now her greatest threat. Seeking safety, Lex is forced to draw on her god-like powers and flee…to the ancient past.  OLD KINGDOM EGYPT...Hiding in plain sight, Lex takes on the identity of the goddess Hathor as she struggles to blend in thousands of years before her own time. But the safety she sought proves elusive. If the body-snatching spirit of a dead god doesn’t kill her, her rapidly worsening bonding withdrawals will. Can she come to an arrangement with Heru, Marcus’s ancient counterpart, in time to save her life and the future? Or will the secrets she’s hiding push him away for good?  ***CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT***  ECHO TRILOGY Echo in Time Resonance (an Echo Trilogy novella) Time Anomaly Dissonance (an Echo Trilogy novella) (Early 2016) Ricochet Through Time (2016)",
