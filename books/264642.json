  "description": "Some are born to power. Others must find it within themselves.  Decades ago, a powerful enemy called the Forgers attacked their homeland, nearly destroying everything. Few remember the time before the attack, but the Forgers have not forgotten. They have spent decades preparing, gaining power, and now their plan has nearly reached fruition.  On the outskirts of the city, living within the stronghold of ancient power, Haern longs for a life beyond what he knows—and away from the long shadow cast by his father. When an attack on the city renews a decades old battle, Haern volunteers to leave the city and find the one person that can lead their people to victory. His inexperience might kill him, but his instincts might be the reason they succeed.  For Daniel, a member of the ruling family, life in the palace is easy and his path is clear. Eventually, he will rise up to sit on the council and lead the people of the city. An injury to someone he cares for changes everything for him, and he must go to the one person he despises most for help. If he fails, he’ll learn what it means to lose everything he cares about.  When their fates intertwine, they must put aside past differences. Stopping the Forgers will require strength and power that both must find within them—or more than their people will suffer.",
