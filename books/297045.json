  "description": "(This is the 1st edition. The 2nd updated edition is now available)I got out of bed 5 minutes ago, but I can't bring myself to face this day. I must have gained ten pounds overnight. And it’s all Mike’s fault! The nerve…Shaena is 31 and has just broken up with her boyfriend, Mike, a certified fitness fanatic who made her his personal project for six months. It was all fun and games while the numbers on the scale were going down, but then Mike showed up at Shaena’s office and shamed her for eating a takeaway lunch. That was the last straw.But Shaena has been binging for 12 years, ever since her mother walked out and left Shaena to care for her father on her own. Was it worse when she walked back in again five years later and expected everything to go back to normal? Shaena didn’t think about it too much - those five years were a painful blur. Much how her head felt this morning.The only way Shaena could cope was food. Glorious boneless wings from WingStop: lemon pepper, deep fried, well drained. Vanilla sheet cake with whipped cream frosting, topped with Ben & Jerry’s Cherry Garcia Ice Cream. She never purged - that could wreak havoc on your body! So instead long days of fasting followed every indulgent slip-up.Food was there for Shaena when her mother wasn’t. But now, as she struggles to fit into jeans, suppresses the urge to be sick in the mornings, and sits silently in Overeaters Anonymous meetings, Shaena realizes even food is hurting her.I Should Have Worn A Curtain follows one woman’s struggle to accept her childhood trauma, face her relationship with food with honesty and bravery, and overcome an illness that has kept her silent too long.",
