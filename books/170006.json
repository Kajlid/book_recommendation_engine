  "description": "The peace and quiet of Little Hamilton is about to be shattered. June is the month of the enormous YorkFest music festival, an annual excuse for camping, partying, merriment … and even murder. When a man is murdered in their tent, all evidence points towards his girlfriend as the culprit. She pleads innocence, and calls on Patricia Lansbury, the village’s resident sleuth, to find the real murderer. But as the mystery unfolds, Pattie is met with more questions than she is answers. For example, how is a drunken farmer involved? Could there be one – or more – murders in the heaving festival campsite? And why does Pattie’s gut tell her that the farmer’s cat is the key to solving the whole mystery?",
