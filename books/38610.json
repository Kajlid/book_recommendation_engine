  "description": "\"POWERFUL AND INSPIRING . . . [A] SUPERB NOVEL . . . The historical detail . . . is outstanding.\"--RendezvousAs the ship Charity sails from England across the Atlantic, two vastly different yet equally courageous women make the perilous journey. Strong-willed, upper class Margaret Brent has invested in Lord Baltimore's Maryland plantation because the new colony is her single chance for a home of her own. Anicah is a teenage guttersnipe who lives by her wits and quick tongue. Kidnapped off the streets of Bristol, she is transported to the New World as an indentured servant. But for both women, the future will bring love and rewards they never imagined. . . .A truly American novel of passion, dreams, and courage, MARYS LAND tells the story of two women who build a new life in a verdant country that is strange and threatening, yet gloriously sweet with promise.\"Meticulously researched . . . [Robson] has an eye for the details of everyday life and an ear for the rich and earthy language of the period.--Library JournalAn Alternate Selection of the Literary Guild(c)and the Doubleday Book Club(c)",
