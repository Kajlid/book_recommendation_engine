  "description": "Emerson is ready to reclaim her life. Her husband might have left her to juggle three kids and the family business, but enough wine and girl talk can get a lady through anything.A little more wine, and one girls’ night later, she's also armed with a very special sort of bucket list, her girlfriends insist the drought she's been in has to end, and Emerson's more than willing. Particularly when a certain handsome co-worker is involved. Armed with new lingerie, a fancy high-tech toy, and a list of things to try, she's ready to take charge. Of love, her life, and her libido. How much trouble can one well-meaning woman get into?",
