  "description": "After 343,203 online votes, here are the top nine questions posed by visitors to the Mars Hill Church website, each one answered by Pastor Mark Driscoll in his own voice.Inspired by 1 Corinthians, in which Paul answers a series of questions posed by the people in the Corinthian church, in 2008 Pastor Mark Driscoll of Mars Hill Church in Seattle polled the visitors of his church's website to determine their most pressing questions. Visitors were allowed to vote up to ten times per day, and in the end, 893 questions were asked and 343,203 votes were cast. The top nine questions are now each answered in this audio version of Religion Saves, narrated by Driscoll himself.After an introduction devoted to the misconception that religion can saves us, Driscoll tackles questions relating to birth control, humor, predestination, grace, sexual sin, faith and works, dating, the emerging church, and the regulative principle.Because the purpose of this audio book is to address commonly asked questions, all listeners will find relevant, engaging material, presented in Driscoll's distinctively edgy-yet theologically sound-style.",
