  "description": "‘Rheea Mukherjee takes her own characters by surprise. The choices they make lead to the most extreme of outcomes, forcing them to scrutinize their own lives ruthlessly. Desires surface, flaws become starker, and human instincts are aroused from dormancy. The reader is left breathless, and strangely satisfied at the lack of easy closure and convenient solutions.’ – Arunava Sinha ‘A stunning collection…evocative, nuanced, and assured’ – Prajwal Parajuly The blurring of truth and the ready acceptance of lies as two strangers meet in Changi International Airport. A teenager living with her disabled mother discovers her own sexuality and ambition in the unlikeliest way. A girl tells us of her first love, and why it will never see a future. The neglected housewife of an artist dishes out more than just delicious food to feel loved. A man battles against his own moral code and his hunger for life. Just a few of the stories that reexamine lives in South East Asia and allow bizarre urban hallucinations to float into the most mundane moments.",
