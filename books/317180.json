Goodbye, boring London life. Hello, adventure! What could possibly go wrong?Only everything.Her 'cozy' new home has no running water or electricity, the roof leaks like a sieve, and the front door is... missing. And then there’s her new neighbor – Rory. A scorchingly hot, grumpy man-bear who wants her gone. Rory has zero patience for distractions. If he can’t make Kinloch Castle profitable, he’s out of a job. All he wants is peace and quiet in the cabin he loved as a child. Instead, it’s been invaded by a one-woman chaos machine and turned into a DIY disaster zone. Worse? She’s infuriatingly attractive.Rory needs Zoe out of Scotland, and out of his life. The trouble is, she has no intention of leaving.Let the games begin… Winner of the American Legacy Award for Best Romcom and the Chatelaine Award for Romantic Fiction, Highland Games is a laugh-out-loud, standalone, steamy, small-town romantic comedy with a sunny heroine and a grump in a kilt. With no cheating or cliffhanger, you’re guaranteed a happily ever after and enough HEAT to get you all Scot and bothered!",
