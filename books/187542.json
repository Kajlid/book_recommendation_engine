  "description": "*This is a serial. The installments are not novel length and intended for readers over 17.*  Ava’s story continues with the second book in the Fifty Kinds of Dead series. Ava already knows it sucks being dead, especially when she wasn’t given any kind of handbook or tips on how to survive. But when she discovers that she may possess the kind of power that could destroy Jackson, the sexy man she fell head over heels for, she’ll be forced to consider options she never would’ve dreamed of accepting if things were any different.  With no one to confide in other than her moody ghost friend and Jackson’s sexy temptress of an ex, Ava will take matters into her own hands using less than ethical methods. Will she find a way to be with Jackson, or will she simply decide the threat of ending his life is too big of a risk?",
