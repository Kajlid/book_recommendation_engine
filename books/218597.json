  "description": "Liberty Meadows is an animal sanctuary where the animals run the show! There's Leslie, the hypochondriac bullfrog, Ralph the midget circus bear, Dean the male chauvinist pig (who really is a pig), and the beautiful animal psychologist, Brandy, among others. Liberty Meadows is a bit Bloom County mixed with pop culture satire and sometimes (but never salacious) humor. It's life and love as usual in Liberty Meadows animal sanctuary, where anything and everything can happen. See how it all began in a new widescreen landscape format with completely remastered and uncensored comic strips.",
