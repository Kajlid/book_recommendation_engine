  "description": "Caught in the wake from the accidental deaths of his paternal aunt and uncle, third-year UCLA law student, Dillon Dorin, stumbles upon evidence suggesting a possible conspiracy. As with other cases, his aunt and uncle were also winners of a sizable lottery jackpot; and similarly, by the time of their mysterious deaths, most of the funds had disappeared into a maze of offshore funds, and trail-less ghost accounts.The authorities? Baffled. But a series of bombings and violent murders keep a seasoned U.S. Marshal, teamed with an inexperienced IRS agent, tracking a trail of money, and the merciless killer. When the killer discovers Dillon’s research, friends and family are threatened. All the while, a plot is being developed by a covert international banking cartel to fix one of the nation’s largest multi-state lotto games.Greed and power are the motives; but murder and mayhem chase our young protagonist from the beaches of Los Angeles to the back alleys of storm-tossed New Orleans. Along the way he discovers what true treasure is.",
