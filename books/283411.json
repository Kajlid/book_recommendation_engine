He's been groomed to take over his family business and is on the brink of closing a massive merger. Only two wild cards can derail him.Wild Card One: If anyone learns he moonlights as a masked DJ, his credibility will be toast. Wild Card Two: Annie can’t-hold-a-job Ward.The Annie Ward he promised to help raise after her brother died. The scatterbrained girl who makes it her mission in life to drive him crazy. The gorgeous woman he’s not supposed to fantasize about, let alone kiss. Annie hates Wes’s insanely overprotective nature, and how his ridiculous bone structure makes him look like a Greek god.

Now she plans to prove Weston Aldrich has met his match.Praise for THE BEAT MATCH⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \"A friends-to-lovers and older-brother's-best-friend book that will blow you away.\" ~ Reads and Reviews ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ \"The friendship and history between the characters was so deep and heart-tugging.
