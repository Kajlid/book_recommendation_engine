  "description": "This historical novel describes the challenges faced and losses suffered by Muslims of the Indian Sub-continent during their migration to Pakistan after the Partition of India in 1947. On June 3, 1947 Lord Mountbatten announced that district of Gurdaspur was to be assigned to Pakistan but Redcliffe, Head of the Boundary Commission, conspired with Indian politicians such as Nehru and modified the geographic boundaries of the two newly formed countries in order to include the district of Gurdaspur in India’s map. As a result, the Muslim population of Gurdaspur set out in search of a safe home in Pakistan but many dangers awaited them on their journey to their new homeland",
