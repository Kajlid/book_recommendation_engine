  "title": "Self Love Poetry: For Thinkers & Feelers",
  "description": "In Self Love Poetry, Godfred explores concepts like authenticity, surrender, resilience, gratitude, believing in yourself, and of course, love, through 100 pairs of poems, each dedicated to a central theme. On the left side of the book are \"thinker\" poems that light up the analytical, more literal, left side of the brain, and on the right side are companion \"feeler\" poems that speak to the creative, more emotional right side of the brain. Combined, the poems electrify the mind, body and soul through a completely unique poetry experience that inspires each of us to embrace all parts of ourselves. This empowering poetry book will not only engage you to think and feel, but will make you feel seen, show you how to love yourself, and encourage you to seek out the hope and beauty in the world … and in yourself. It’s the perfect gift for yourself or someone you love, especially after a most difficult year.",
