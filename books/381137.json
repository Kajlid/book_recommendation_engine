  "description": "Compassionate, candid and funny coming-of-age story.School-leaver Skye plays guitar in the all-female Chronic Cramps band. Making a name in the punk/indie scene is easier than FTM (female to male) from Skye to Finn, from girl to man.Uncovering genetic mysteries about family heritage tear her family apart and Skye discovers transgender identity is more than injections and surgery, it's about acceptance.While 'f2m' is not autobiographical, co-writer Ryan has experienced the medical sequence of gender reassignment from female to male, which is less common than MTF. An international first - female to male gender transition in YA fiction - 'f2m' gives insight into a little-understood medical situation.",
