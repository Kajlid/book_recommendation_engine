  "description": "Drenched in dissension and immersed in insubordination, The Noggin of Natural is a living, breathing embodiment of everything that society hates, delicately stitched into the fabric of one Mr. Natural. Happily rebellious, the main character introduces himself to the world, using foul language, dark imagery, and excessive violence to paint a picture of what the world really A vile, corrupt utopia that he takes to make his playground. He realizes that his viewpoint of the world is not for the faint of heart, but he's The Natural, and what he says goes.",
