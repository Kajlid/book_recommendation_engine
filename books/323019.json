  "description": "Welcome to Fort Lauderdale—where the days are hot and the Knights are hotter… Vaughn: I might be at the top of my game, but a fresh start feels like the right move at this stage of my career. Joining the Lauderdale Knights has been a great decision, and I’m ready to win this city over. On opening night the crowd goes wild… and so does my slap shot. Knocking a fan unconscious wasn’t the introduction I envisioned. Especially when I lay eyes on my gorgeous victim. Problem is… she’s engaged. Juliet: Waking up with a concussion and amnesia has made me realize that when it comes to living life on my terms, it’s now or never. My big Italian family means well, but it’s time for them to stop calling the shots. Now if I could just get rid of my fiancé, quit my job, and stop drooling over the hottie hockey player who knocked some sense into me, life would be perfect. Except nothing in my life is perfect… not even Lauderdale’s newest MVP.",
