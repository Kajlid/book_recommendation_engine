  "description": "This Novella is my first work of fiction.Plot Nash is a young man full of vitality and an usually endearing charm. His vigor reawakens our main body, heart and soul. The story begins with their meeting and follows them as their lives change and become ever more entwined in one another's. \"They say that humans are social animals, and while this may be true from a sociological point of view, the deeper truth is that we are all solitary cells; trapped within the confines of our cognitive existence. We know only what our minds receive and play guessing games at the people around us based on observation and deduction. The stronger our inhibitions, the deeper our shame, the higher our sense of fear--- the more isolated and introverted we are. When we reach out to others in the world, we hide those parts of ourselves which we feel would be reviled. We place those things deep in dark corners where they fester. In some ways this can be good because those dark desires and secret needs facilitate a sense of individual self. Other times, they amplify our isolation and prevent the bonds that tie two lives together. This is why confession is good for the soul, because it stops the festering and eases the isolation.\"",
