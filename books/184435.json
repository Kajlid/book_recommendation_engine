  "description": "HERE-NOW SAMADHI is a book that brings a whole new meaning to living in the moment—there is only here and now. When we get into the flow and frequency of our lives, we give up resistance and live or vibrate on a higher plane and the result is pure magic. Here-Now Samadhi is also the place we enter when we embrace unconditional love for ourselves as well as others. This, in turn, triggers Kundalini energy—an awakening or spiritual enlightenment—which allows us to experience the truest freedom of spirit and mind where time and distance have no physical bounds.Thankfully, we don’t have to figure it out on our own. Author Akasha Rainbow guides us on the journey to heightened living, teaching us how to recognize and draw on our multi-dimensional cosmic awareness and energy. No more going through the motions, but embracing a life of unfettered joy and peace. Let HERE-NOW SAMADHI open your eyes to you…and the limitless possibilities within!",
