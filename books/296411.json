  "description": "College was supposed to be the start of something new ... and boy, was it! I saw my college experience in my head: studying for my dream job in one of the big 5 publishing houses, hanging out with my friends, being there for my sister and enjoying my new dorm room ... but nothing would’ve prepared me for my new dorm neighbor. Blue eyed, six foot pain in my butt! You think I’m kidding? Ha! Well let me tell you: 1. He plays his music too loud and turns it up when I try to study 2. He steals my favorite booth at the local diner 3. He purposefully chases away my dates And what’s worse? 4. One drunken night of weakness leads me to getting knocked up by him.  Try having a baby with someone you hate, I dare you.",
