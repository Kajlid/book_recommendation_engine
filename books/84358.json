Underneath lies much, much more, understood only by those who know it well.Three months have passed since Jill Branch abandoned a life on the streets and joined the classified crime fighting force known as The Nexus. Something big is brewing among Anterra’s criminal elite, and the department is hot on the trail. The chase will take Jill and her team into the darkest depths of the city – and face to face with the past they’ve tried so desperately to forget.",
