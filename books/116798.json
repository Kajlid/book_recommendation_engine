Will Alain come to his senses and realise he has lost the most precious thing on earth - true love? Will Maxwell f*cking Grant get closer to Rebecca? Read why Rebecca wants NO REGRETS!!!Note to Readers: My sincere apologies to readers who have been waiting for this for a while...sadly I lost more than 75% of the manuscript earlier this year due to a computer crash and its been emotionally taxing to rewrite the book - but it is under way - I promise. I don't want to release the book until I'm absolutely happy with it. I'm hoping the wait will be worth it. Thank you for understanding and for your patience.",
