  "description": "She should have named him Trouble . . . Captain is a very bad horse. Celestino, the farm hand, refuses to take care of him, and none of the barn kids will go near the little brown and white paint who kicks and rears and bites. \"That horse will never be anything but trouble,\" says Jenna, who boards her horse at the barn. \"You simply must get rid of him!\" Everyone agrees, except for Kathleen, who rescued him from the slaughterhouse and can't bear to send him away. Her best friend, Brendee, tells her to follow her heart, and Kathleen knows she has to find a way to tame the colt. Even Locket, the burro, who's friends with everyone, can't find a way to help the little horse. The farm is in chaos, and when it seems things can't get worse, Brendee gets sick and Captain is in a terrible accident and might die. Kathleen makes a difficult decision - she will stop saving horses. Can Locket and her friends find a way to help Kathleen? Or is it too late for Captain and Locket's Meadow Farm?",
