  "title": "A City Inside",
  "description": "Shifting between the everyday and the surreal, A City Inside recounts one woman s life from childhood home, to the first love that she will never forget, to the creation of the idea of herself that she can grow old with and the home that she can grow old in. Walden s follow up to the lyrical I Love This Part is a poetic exploration of the process of growing older; the journey towards finding out who you are and building a life for yourself. It is a universal story of how we don t just come-of-age once, but many times throughout our lives.\"",
