  "description": "Dexter Blackwell has the worst job in hell. He's a clerk in the Accounts Receivable department at Hades Correctional, with a real demon for a boss.So when Dexter unexpectedly gets the chance to do a bit of fieldwork, tracking a runaway soul named Freddie 'Fingers' Finnegan to 1920's Chicago, he grabs the opportunity with both hands.Assuming the identity of Johnny Black, a mobster currently at the bottom on Lake Michigan with his feet encased in concrete, Dexter quickly locates Fingers and his gang.But finding Fingers is the least of his problems. He also has to contend with a catalogue of friends and foes; Al Capone, who wants him dead and wants to know why he's still alive, Alice, Capone's mistress, who's in love with him, his ex-wife Velma who is after him for alimony, corrupt police officers, loan sharks, rival Soul Chasers, a grumpy imp, not to mention Mr. Abbadon, the second most powerful demon in Hell with a vested interest in seeing his mission fail. You're A Dead Man, Johnny Black, is a thrill-a-minute, laugh-a-minute, genre-bending adventure that you won't be able to put down.
