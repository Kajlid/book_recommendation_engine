  "description": "Sometimes God's way seems almost too hard. How would you respond if God asked you to choose between Him and your friends? your church? your family? your fianc√©e? In such a situation, there is only one right answer. That answer may seem to tear your very soul from its moorings. At least that is what Dale thought. It was 1960! From the perspective of the common man of the world, 1960 was the of times - politically, socially, financially and spiritually. From the Christian perspective, however, it was a time of catastrophe - so many people were losing their convictions and their faith. The world and the church were traveling away from God at a breathtaking pace. But the world was so fascinating that few worried about the Christian perspective. Dale and Shelia symbolize dozens of youth in many different times and places who were caught in the vortex of spiritually declining churches. By God's grace, some found their way, but many succumbed to the pressure. Live the difficult experiences with Dale and the others in the story to gain a new appreciation for the church and her leaders who stood for truth and righteousness then, as well as for those who still stand today.",
