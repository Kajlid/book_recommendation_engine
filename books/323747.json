And that spot belongs to me.But I underestimated RJ. Because he was a step ahead of me. He is always a step ahead of everyone.He went after the client I spent months chasing by introducing himself as my fiancé.One thing led to another and chaos commenced as I found myself on an island with my fake fiancé.When we spent seven long days and six nights in close proximity, hate turned to passion and snarky remarks turned into dirty talking.They say never mix business with pleasure. But it was too late. Because now, I am falling in love with my devastatingly handsome rival and his deceptively charming dimples.The million-dollar question is, does he feel the same way I do? or am I just a pawn in his well-planned ruthless game?\nNOTE - My Ruthless Opponent is a STANDALONE in The Ruthless Series.",
