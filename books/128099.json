  "description": "She Vowed To Resist Him After Miss Elizabeth Watson publishes a book about the Second Punic War, she is stunned when an elderly bachelor, an admirer of her work, dies and leaves her a fortune. Then she learns that some members of her benefactor's family resent her windfall. Is Lord Atwater--handsome, charming, and wealthy--among her opponents? Elizabeth knows she ought to be wary, but it's the debonair baron who sets her heart pounding, and who kisses her in a way that makes it very hard to remember he could merely be playing a deep and devious game... He Vowed To Win Her Julius, Lord Atwater, hasn't the least need for his late relative's money, but he would like very much to know if Miss Watson is the unprincipled fortune-hunter his aunt declares her to be. Determined to uncover the truth, Julius repeatedly seeks her out, only to realize both that he is irresistibly drawn to the lovely and scholarly young lady--and that she perceives him to be one of the enemy camp. Now his task is to convince the doubting Miss Watson that his affections, far from being the unscrupulous ploy of a foe, are very real--and very warm--indeed.",
