  "title": "Bonnie Prince Charlie: Charles Edward Stuart",
  "description": "Who was this man Charles Edward Stuart who became known to legend as Bonnie Prince Charlie? Frank McLynn pursues this fascinating question in his highly acclaimed study of the \"Young Pretender,\" whose unsuccessful challenge to the Hanoverian throne was followed by the crushing defeat at Culloden in 1746. The prince was to play out the rest of his career dogged by a sense of failure and betrayal. Yet Frank McLynn argues powerfully that failure was far from inevitable, and history in 1745 came closer to taking a quite different turn.",
