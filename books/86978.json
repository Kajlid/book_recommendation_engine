SEBASTIAN â€“ DARK BONDS (Book #2): Elizabeth struggles to absorb tragic news. Her life seemingly in shreds, she is comforted by Sebastian through her darkest days. He suggests she and Bella stay at Penmorrow for a period of healing but now Elizabeth must face not only the increasing sexual demands from dominant Sebastian ... but a darker undercurrent of malice. Who can she trust? A man who comforts yet controls her? Or his maid, Scarlett, who hints at her own dark past with her Lord. Elizabeth and Sebastian's erotic journey begins in Book One, Sebastian - Secrets, will have you on the edge of your seat in Book Two, Sebastian - Dark Bonds and reaches a dramatic conclusion in Book Three, Sebastian - Retribution. \"Forget Christian, forget Gideon, forget Gabriel, heck all those dark and mysterious alpha males - forget them all and meet Sebastian. He's going to mess with your head, he's going to make you swoon, he's going to make your pulse quicken and then he's going to make you squirm. BAM! the story hit me and got its claws in me straight away, it bowled me over and I was totally at its mercy, just as Beth is with Sebastian. You'll be laughing, nail biting and crying. The Sebastian Trilogy is a hoard of sizzling excitement and great twists.\" 5* Review, Amazon.co.uk",
