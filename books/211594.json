  "title": "The Boat",
  "description": "A dazzling, emotionally riveting debut collection: the seven stories in Nam Leâ€™s The Boat take us across the globe as he enters the hearts and minds of characters from all over the world.Whether Nam Le is conjuring the story of 14-year-old Juan, a hit man in Colombia; or an aging painter mourning the death of his much-younger lover; or a young refugee fleeing Vietnam, crammed in the ship's hold with 200 others, the result is unexpectedly moving and powerful. This is an extraordinary work of fiction that takes us to the heart of what it means to be human, and announces a writer of astonishing gifts.",
