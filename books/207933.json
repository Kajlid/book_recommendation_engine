  "description": "David  My life ended the night my father won a place in the US Congress. Not because he won the election, but because he died when I lost control of the car he, my mother, and I were riding in.  My parents both died and I was left paralyzed from the upper thighs down. There’s an operation that could fix my legs, but maybe I don’t deserve a second chance. After all, my parents didn’t get one.  But then a woman walks into my life…it’s always a woman, right?  She was once a notorious hacker, now a ruthless CEO of one of the hottest social media corporations in the world. We’re both broken, but maybe together we can find a way to fix what no longer works.  Ricki  David is everything I’ve always wanted in a man—smart, affectionate, gorgeous…  I want to trust him with my deepest, darkest secrets, but I’m not sure than I can. After all, our paths have crossed before…years ago. He just doesn't know it yet.  And it was that intersection of his world and mine that started the downward spiral of the person who meant the most to me...   Note: DAVID is the second book in the Gray Wolf Security series. You can read it on it's own, but it is highly recommended that you read DONOVAN too :)",
