Complicating matters were his unresolved feelings for former colleague Meghan Wright--the one woman he'd never got out of his system. She'd become the target of a stalker, whose proximity to Gideon's assignment was no coincidence.

Could they reveal who was responsible for what appeared to be an elaborate plan before the sizzling embers of their relationship were permanently extinguished...?",
