In fighting his way across half the planet to see her home safely, he won her love, and then her hand in marriage. Now David and Callan want nothing more than to settled down and live happily ever after...But a man can't do what David has done without making powerful enemies, and his enemies want revenge!Told in the form of a lead-in novella and a novel, SCOUT'S OATH opens with the story of a young thief who risks his life to bring David and Callan a warning that starts them on a desperate race against time to find and rescue her parents. Then, to stop the outbreak of planet-wide war, David must surrender to King Rat, ruler of the tunnels beneath the city-state of Beloren, and it falls to Callan to pull together a band of unlikely heroes and organize his rescue. Can an old pirate, a young thief, a crusty doctor, and a daring airship pilot help Callan do the impossible?SCOUT'S OATH is an exciting modern homage to the classic tales of planetary romance made famous by writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs and Leigh Brackett. If you like your heroes unabashedly heroic, your heroines feisty and true, and your plots filled with dangers and twists at every turn, you'll enjoy SCOUT'S OATH.",
