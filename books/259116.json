  "description": "Orphaned and pushed from one foster family to the next, sassy Ava’s desires for the future should have been fairly simple – to carve a place in the world she could call home. ‘Simple’ goes out the window when she learns that not only did she inherit a manor in a sleepy town called Ravenwood, but that she has inherited a pack of wolf shifters along with it. Thrown in to a world that is hauntingly familiar but long forgotten, Ava seeks the guidance of four sexy shifters who test the emotional walls she has in place – each one awakening her in ways she had never known possible. When a new and powerful task is placed upon Ava’s shoulders her life becomes even more complicated as she catches the malicious eye of the Archigos, the largest and most powerful pack on the North American continent. Determined to solidify her place in this world, Ava must choose between her heart’s desire or risk war upon them all. Divine is book 1 of a reverse harem paranormal romance trilogy.",
