  "description": "For six months, Madeline Granger has been overwhelmed by an almost magnetic pull that has kept her on the road, traveling all over the Midwest and erotically dreaming of two men… her lion kings. When she wakes up in Kansas, just outside the perimeter of a traveling carnival, it miraculously feels like coming home. But after she meets the two men who shouldn’t exist outside her own mind, it’s hard for her to reconcile that her dream lovers are two very real and sexy men, not imaginary. All she knows for certain is she wants them both. Adam Michael’s and his brother Cage, both lion-shifters, not only run Pantheros & Co Carnival, they are the stars. Making a home for his crew of misfits and outcasts was Adam’s dream. Cage was his most desperate rescue, and after a profound loss, Adam worries that Cage’s grief will drive him toward a brutality he can’t come back from. The last thing either lion-shifter expected was Madeline Granger. She might be the answer to Adam’s prayers, in more ways than one, if he can get Cage to look past his pain. But, can Adam and Cage see Madeline as more than a substitute Clary? And can Madeline rescue two Kings drowning in their own sorrow? Maddie might want The Lion Kings to rule her body, but is she strong enough to rule their hearts.",
