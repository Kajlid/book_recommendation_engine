  "description": "Weeks after its Main Street was severely damaged in a failed revenge attempt, the town of Granite Springs is in the midst of rebuilding itself-and a number of its citizens are taking advantage: some to expand their business holdings; others to exert their influence over the very nature of the town itself.Thia McDaniel is looking forward to getting her life back on track, or at least to moving forward on whatever track is now available. She is learning how to use, if not yet control, the mysterious powers she claimed inadvertently a few months ago. Her newfound friends are giving her a crash course in magic and self defense. And, while she might not know where she stands with Cormac (who does?) or what to do about the Society of Brigantium's offer to join their secret ranks, her new life has finally taken on a comfortable rhythm.She has no idea how drastically that is about to change.Fast-paced, suspenseful, and as humorous as it is poignant, The Vale of Silence is the long-awaited third book in the entertaining Wheel of the Year series.",
