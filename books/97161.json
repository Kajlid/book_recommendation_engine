  "description": "A Readers' Choice finalist from award-winning fantasy author Andrew J. Peters (The City of Seven Gods).\"This first offering in a gay fantasy series should garner a large following.\" ~Kirkus Reviews For Jacks Dowd, a college senior who feels ungrounded from school, family, and life in general, a hard-partying weekend in Montr√©al sounds like a pretty good escape. His Spring Break binge takes a detour when he meets Benoit, an admiring drifter with startling green eyes. A hook-up turns into a day, two days, and then a full week in Benoit's hostel, making love and scarfing down take-out food. But at the end of the week, Benoit demands that Jacks make an impossible choice: stay with him forever, or go back to college and never see him again. Also in the Werecat series: The Glaring (Book Two), The Fugitive (Book Three), and The Sim Ru Prophecy (Book Four).",
