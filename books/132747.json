  "description": "All this druid wants is to visit Superhero World, snag some exotic tech, and go home. Unfortunately, \nfate\n has other plans. What’s a mythological hero to do when he’s forced to become a supervillain to save his world… and himself?Colin is a druid on a mission. Namely, traveling to an alternate dimension where technology rules, to snag the tech he needs to save his friends in the Hellpocalypse timeline.At first, it sounds simple. He’ll slip through the timestreams, do a little sightseeing, and go home. Heck, it might even be fun to visit a world where actual superheroes exist.But for creation’s unluckiest druid, nothing is ever easy. When things go horribly wrong, Colin finds that his magic is almost completely on the fritz.To complicate matters, he’s soon mistaken for a supervillain, making enemies with the planet’s most powerful superhero in the process.Stranded in a world where heroes aren’t quite heroic, and where villains have no rights, the druid sees only one path forward…He’ll figure out his powers and clear his name, all while being hunted by every superhero and government agent on the planet.At least there’s an upside—things couldn’t possibly get worse, right?- - -Superhero World is the first novel in a planned superhero fantasy fiction trilogy by paranormal and urban fantasy author M.D. Massey.Written in the tradition of gritty, realistic comic book fiction, this series follows in the irreverent footsteps of works such as The Boys, Wild Cards, Watchmen, Invincible, and a long list of other trailblazing sci-fi and fantasy worlds too extensive to reference here.",
