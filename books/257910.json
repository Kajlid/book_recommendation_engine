  "description": "Calix is multifaceted. A detective. A Dom. A bartender. A member of Areion Fury MC. So many sides yet nothing defines him. He takes what he wants out of life and gives what he thinks should be freely given; he craves balance and yet he’s at a standstill in life. That is until a woman walks in and tips his balance out of control.  Tenley is desperate. A strong woman. A business woman. Born into the biker world she has fought her way to the top. And now, she finds herself following the President’s request to seek the help of the one individual who might be able to handle the betrayal and threat the club is facing. She’s thrown off balance when the one person who should be their savior, might turn into her downfall.  When betrayal from within taints the Areion Fury MC, Ohio Chapter with contempt and disintegration, the weight is on Calix to flush out the bad seed and try to save this Chapter. Even if it means leaving his own President to serve another. A fight for the gavel might be the end of Areion Fury MC, or a possibility for a new Chapter…in life.   Calix can be read as a standalone.
