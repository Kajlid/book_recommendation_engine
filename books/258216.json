  "title": "The Black Cat",
  "description": "It is a study of the psychology of guilt, often paired in analysis with Poe's \"The Tell-Tale Heart.\" In both, a murderer carefully conceals his crime and believes himself unassailable, but eventually breaks down and reveals himself, impelled by a nagging reminder of his guilt. Poe's work is always an intriging step into the dark side of human nature. Recommended by The Gunston Trust. Ages: Young Adults and Adults.",
