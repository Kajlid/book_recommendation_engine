  "description": "Flawed, I am.Cracks, I have and they run deep.But I refuse to accept that I'm damaged.Six years ago, I turned my life around; moved to a new country, and started from fresh leaving behind the demons and shame that once haunted me. Forgetting the worst moment of my life was impossible but without constant reminders, it was easy to pretend that it never happened.But then a man surfaced out of the ashes and awoke all those memories from where they'd been stowed. In an instant, the walls I built around myself started crumbling and I was forced to face the past I wanted so hard to forget. But would he be able to pick up the broken pieces, or would I lose my chance at true love?",
