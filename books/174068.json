  "description": "Book one of NEPHILIM CODE series Nephilim walk among us. Descendants of Angels who just want to live their lives without humans knowing they exist. Some of them anyway. Then there are the ones who want to rule over us. Like in the days of old, they want to be considered our ‘gods’. My name is Nova Quinn. I’m a photographer…and human. Well, I was. Now I’m fighting for my life. I wasn’t supposed to survive, but I did. Caught in a world where ‘superhuman’ abilities are normal, it’s hard enough trying to get a grip on this new reality. But when the other side shows up and wants to use my genetics for their experiments, suddenly it’s no longer enough to know Nephilim exist – I have to be one. My name is Nova Quinn. And I’m the created Nephilim.",
