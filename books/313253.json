  "description": "Two years ago, Quinton Wyatt had the worst summer vacation of his life... but Summer Break '79 looks like a winner. Quint loves his job at a local movie theater, he adores his new baby brother, and he and T.J. Shapleigh aren't just close â€” they're downright inseparable. But sometimes fate, like a desert monsoon, can roar in and wash away everything. When tragedy strikes, it tests not only Quint's relationship with T.J., but how he sees himself. My Summer Under A Crescent Moon is Book 2 in the Quinton's Curious Mind Series.",
