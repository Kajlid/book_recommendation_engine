  "description": "Taken from the swaying grass of the open savannah to the neat green fields of the West Country, Manu Wardgrave is a boy out of place. His struggle with his identity and his discovery of the reality behind the dream he had of England will decide, in fire and battle on the strange and ancient hill that overlooks his enigma of a new school, more than just his fate and place in the world.Heather Evynstone is a girl living on the margins. Ashamed of her fortune teller mother and her rough narrowboat home, she dreams that her genius for costume design will drag her into a better life. The future of the world will hang on how she deals with the darkness she finds in Darkwells.Henry Grenville carries an old and famous name. He is kind and funny and likeable and should be happy and content. He has a tragic and traumatic past and finds himself isolated and alone. He resists the apathy and nihilism that threatens to engulf him and desperately seeks the prophesied ‘key to his future’.From the wide empty wilds of the African bush to the lonely, ancient Tor in the West Country, Darkwells is a story of friendship and destiny and duty. It is about loyalty and love and how both is lost and found. It is a tale of magic and adventure, of friendship and destiny and duty. It is a novel that explores the shifting sense of self and culture that Henry, Heather and Manu have to face as they struggle with things long broken and with promises unfulfilled.Old myths and new beginnings clash in a storm of magic on England’s most magical hill. Who will emerge triumphant from the smoke and fire on the Tor?",
