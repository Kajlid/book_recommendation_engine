But with the start of school, things progress to a level of bizarre he’s never been accustomed to--he goes from zero to hero with the hottest girl in school and takes his place amongst the social elite. But the reversal of fortune makes Keegan question what’s really happening. And for some reason he’s just become enemy number one for the scariest maniac in school. The secret to his survival might just depend on the girl nobody wants him to be with.",
