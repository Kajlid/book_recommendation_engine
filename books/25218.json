  "title": "Porcupine in Freefall",
  "description": "Poetry. \"There are a lot of young writers with talent but Rainie Oet has a strange and mature vision as well, which dwells in a convergence of clarity and swerve, comedy and disquiet, privacy and sociability, tenderness, and something just a touch hard. PORCUPINE IN FREEFALL is no mere concept album, though it has got a rather original driving concept. Combining the authentic feel of seeming autobiographical narrative with surrealistic, whimsical, sometimes lyric, sometimes anti-lyric adventures, this debut is a curiosity and a delight.\"--Daisy Fried",
