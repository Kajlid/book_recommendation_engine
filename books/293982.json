  "description": "Evelyn is intoxicating. She's self-assured, mercurial, dominant and mischievous. But she's also mean, and as much as her best friends Katie and Maeve crave her approval, theirs is a threesome held together by fear.  As the girls grow up and start to look beyond their small Irish village, they must step out of Evelyn's shadow. This mesmerising debut, brilliantly evocative of rural Ireland, is a compellingly readable portrait of the places, and people, that continue to shape us long after we've decided to leave them behind.",
