  "title": "Diversity and difference in early childhood education: issues for theory and practice",
  "description": "Early childhood professionals are often required to work with children and families from a range of diverse backgrounds. This book goes beyond simplistic definitions of diversity, encouraging a much broader understanding and helping early childhood educators develop a critical disposition towards assumptions about children and childhood in relation to diversity, difference and social justice. As well as drawing on research, the book gives an overview of relevant contemporary social theories, including poststructuralism, cultural studies, postcolonialism, feminist perspectives and queer theory. Each chapter interrogates practice and explores opportunities and strategies for creating a more equitable environment. The book covers a number of issues impacting on childrenâ€™s lives, including globalization, new racisms, immigration, refugees, homophobia, heterosexism and constructions of childhood. Each chapter provides an overview of the area of discussion, a focus on the implications for practice, and recommended readings. Providing insight into how social justice practices in early childhood can make a real difference in the lives of children and their families, this is key reading for early childhood professionals, students and researchers.",
