  "description": "Harlan Ellison's suspense anthology: 15 stories and one wild, 32-page introduction. Some tales, such as \"Toe the Line\" and \"Ormond Always Pays His Bills,\" are simple pulp crime yarns; others are masterful examples of psychological terror and, in the case of \"Whipped Dogs,\" mystical fantasy. Excellent. Originally published in 1975.Contents:9 · Blood/Thoughts · in 41 · The Whimper of Whipped Dogs · ss Bad Moon Rising, ed. Thomas M.
