  "description": "Newark-NJ, District Attorney Anthony Jacobs is confident of the witnesses and associates he has gathered to testify and vows to bring to justice Bernard James, Jr.-Newark's most notorious gangster. James, also known in the streets as \"Dutch\", is noted to be the most dangerous criminal to come up in Jersey in the last 30 years. From his experience and skill as a young car thief, Dutch recognized the opportunity to become the ruler of the streets and seized it. Feared by all, and completely fearless, Dutch and his dangerous clique take over the lucrative heroine trade from the clutches of Nigerian drug lord Ojiugo Kazami. With both the respect and protection of the Italian Mafia, Dutch becomes the most terrifying force on the streets. Now he's on trial for allegedly masterminding what the press has dubbed \"THE MONTH OF MURDER\", a brutal, thirty day, killing spree where none were spared. With Dutch facing multiple life sentences and a possibly death penalty, the streets are in a mixed uproar of celebration and dread. Will this be the end of Dutch's reign of terror or just the beginning?",
