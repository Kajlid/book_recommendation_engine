  "description": "After the death of their father, Glaucia and Laon are taken to Rome to be sold as slaves to pay his debts. Glaucia is sold to Valeria, the proud daughter of Fabrizzio Gracchi, a wealthy Roman philosopher who has decided to move his family to Athens so that he can continue his study of Greek philosophy. Glaucia is grateful to be going back to her native city, but feels that the gods she has loved and served have no interest in the worship of a slave. She tries hard to adjust to her new life and to please her young mistress, but she longs to find a God who can love even a slave. Meanwhile, her brother, Laon, struggles to find her and to earn enough money to buy her freedom. Then, in the marketplace, Glaucia hears about a God who cares for slaves. As she learns more about this God, she is drawn to Him, but finds she must choose between the many gods she has always worshiped and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will not share His worship with anyone.",
