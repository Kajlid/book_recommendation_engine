  "description": "ANGEL OR SHE-DEVIL?Fanny Turner was a woman fated to destroy and be destroyed by her own angelic beauty and the demonic lust for vengeance that burned within her. The daughter of an ill-fated marriage between a proud, unbending man and a sensual woman who deserted them both, Fanny knew both the power and the humiliation of sex early. From that moment, her path was set...as she went from the corruptions of an exclusive girls' boarding school...to the legendary turn-of-the-century New Orleans red-light district where she became a girl in her own mother's \"house\"...to a tormenting marriage to a wealthy aristocratic planter who gave Fanny everything but what she most desperately needed.",
