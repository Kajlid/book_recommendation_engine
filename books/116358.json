  "title": "Rush Limbaugh: Revered, American Hero & Still Driving The Liberals Crazy",
  "description": "Okay, Revered, American Hero, a bit over the top but I like irritating liberals too, especially when they show such anger and hostility towards Rush, as they often do in their titles.About 21 years ago I was driving near Love Field Airport in Dallas where I lived at the time and was listening to AM radio. Not sure why I was listening to AM, nobody did except to hear the news on KRLD or KLIF. The station announced that starting next week they would be introducing a new talk show host named Rush Limbaugh. I had never heard of the name, it sounded like a guru from India. I didn't realize it at the time but it turns out, while I first heard the named Rush Limbaugh I happened to be driving by the broadcasting school that Rush attended in the 1960's when he was 15 or 16 years old. That school, the Elkins Institute produced the most listened to and successful broadcaster in America. I quickly found out that he was not an Indian guru but someone fun to listen to and spoke for a large number of Americans who weren't getting their voices heard fairly in the media. This brief ebook is about Rush.",
