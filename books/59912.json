  "description": "BDSM & D/s / MF / Erotic Romance / Some MM & FF~ explicit languageAs a writer, Katianna hovers at the alluring edge of bringing what she creates with exquisite eroticism into her very concealed life. Her books seduce her readers with stories taking them into extremes of erotic pleasure that have never been her own experience. That is until one night unbeknownst to herself, she confessed a secret desire she’d kept under lock and key to Trenton Leos, who’s now intent to bring her into his world of Dominance and Submission where he’s not just any Dom, he’s the Dominus. The Master of all Doms. Life with the Dominus promises to surround her with rich, somatic passions, but it also comes with danger, and she’s not sure she’s strong enough to hang on. Especially when being with him means submitting her life to Becoming His Slave.Credit and Special thanks for the editing endeavor goes to Alison Greene, Lee Brazil, Havan Fellows, Sara York and Laura Harner.",
