  "description": "Librarian Note: The latest edition with updated cover of this title can be found HERE \nA young sculptress paralyzed by past rejection A life shackled by liesA truth waiting to be discovered  At age eleven, Ria Ofor was caught in a fire that left her facially-scarred. Devastated by the apparent rejection by her father, Ria, now twenty-seven, is a gifted sculptress but lives a semi reclusive life. Avoiding art galleries and their consequent publicity, she sells her artwork online, scraping a living through online sales. But when she's hit with a repossession notice on her home, it rocks the shaky foundations she’s been living on. On borrowed time, Ria must land a gallery contract in order to survive. That means stepping out of her comfort zone and coming face to face with what she’s spent the last sixteen years trying to avoid: rejection. But competition for lucrative gallery contracts is cut-throat, and Ria soon discovers that some artists will stop at nothing to keep the spoils of London's glittering art world for themselves. Torn between the events of her past and the lies threatening to destroy her future, Ria is faced with a decision that could change her life forever.",
