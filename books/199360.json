  "description": "TWO CHRISTMAS WEDDINGS—IN ALASKA! Gold River, Alaska, isn't your average town. After being jilted by her fiancé, Caroline Myers ends up there—thanks to her matchmaking aunts, who send her on what appears to be a vacation. Not surprisingly, they have something different in mind. Something that involves spending a snowy Christmas in handsome Paul Trevor's home—as his Mail-Order Bride. There's nothing typical about Snowbound, Alaska, either. Jenna Walsh met Dalton Gray on the internet and now, a month before Christmas, she's going to Alaska to marry him. But on the flight to Fairbanks, she meets Reed Kenner, who's not impressed with her plan to marry Dalton, a man he detests (for good reason, as Jenna later finds out). So Reed decides to change her destination—and her marriage plans. Which is why Jenna finds herself at Reed's cabin in tiny Snowbound. It's currently a one-woman town (and the other woman's out of town). That leaves Reed, a bunch of eccentric old men, a few grizzly bears—and Jenna. Hmm. Looks as though Jenna's going to be a Christmas bride after all. The Snow Bride!",
