  "description": "Keith Malone is incredibly content. He loves coming around Del Fantasma… great food, great company, and a decent place to rest his soul when he needs it. Plus, it doesn't hurt that Cody lets him dust off his carpenter skills with the odd job here and there.Bailey Mitchell is incredibly nervous. He's come all this way to San Diego, following up on a chance encounter that happened months earlier, and now he doesn't know what to do. One glance and it's obvious Adam's already taken. What's a lonely Siamese shifter to do?Drake McKale is incredibly grouchy. He's sick and tired of every shifter he's run across making fun of him. Hey, duck's have feelings too! So what if he's smaller than everyone else? Spoiling for a fight he can actually win, he decides to pick on the shy, little kitty in the corner. Only, Drake never reckoned the diminutive cat would proposition him. Or that the big human in the corner would want in on the action.One part burly human, one part shy Siamese shifter and one part twinky (and kinky) duck shifter… layer together and enjoy!",
