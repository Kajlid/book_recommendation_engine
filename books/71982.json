  "description": "LGBT, Contemporary  Faith, Love, and Devotion; Previous Duty and DevotionSeveral years after the end of Duty & Devotion, Matt and Evan are living quietly in their Brooklyn home with the twins, Danny and Elizabeth. The older girls--Katie and Miranda--are off at college, Evan is about to be promoted to captain, and things are calm.Briefly.Evan accidently learns that Miranda has a new boyfriend and is talking marriage after just three months of dating. After peeling himself off the ceiling, he demands a conversation with his eldest daughter, which erupts into, as Matt calls it, “a steel cage match”.Miranda indeed has a boyfriend (Kent), a business major (from Connecticut) and they are most definitely serious. In fact, Miranda wants to bring him to Thanksgiving dinner--along with his parents, Blake and Cornelia.There is much debate but Evan agrees--mostly because Miranda's part of the bargain is that she won't get engaged or elope until the parents have met.Thanksgiving descends into madness before the turkey is cut. This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find male/male sexual practices.",
