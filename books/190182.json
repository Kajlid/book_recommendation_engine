  "title": "The Modern Traveller",
  "description": "The Modern traveller is Hilaire Belloc's satirical depiction of a three-man trip to Africa, first published when Belloc was a vivid twenty-eight years of age and of high-spirit. He had already publicly presented his sequence of comic and cautionary tales for children. Like most of these tales, The Modern Traveller bears memorable, pertinent illustrations by his friend, Basil Blackwood. The narrator (Mr. Rooter) of Bellocâ€™s tale is accompanied on the trip by his companions Captain William Blood (the leader and a high financier) and Commander Henry Sin (of doubtful non-English parentage and of cosmopolitan heritage).",
