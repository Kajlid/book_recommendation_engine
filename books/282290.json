  "description": "After her familyâ€™s California home is destroyed by a wildfire, seventeen-year-old Julia moves in with her grandmother, a foreign-born woman with a heavy accent and hidden past. When by chance she comes across an enchanted necklace in the bottom of an old trunk, the magical artifact transports Julia to Aevilen, a war-torn land from which her grandmother had escaped a half-century prior. Aevilen is far different from California, with sweeping landscapes and exotic creatures. As Julia searches for a way home, she discovers an ancient family legacy, that if fulfilled, could bring an end to the troubles gripping this mystical land. With a chance to make things right, Julia must choose between the home she loves and her ancestors' promise to the people of Aevilen - a promise she has yet to understand.",
