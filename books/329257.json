  "description": "Winner of the International Skiing History Association 2022 Ullr Award.L Company of the 86th Mountain Infantry Regiment went into action with 185 men, and sustained 156 casualties in just two months of fierce combat with German forces. Heroes in Good Company turns interviews, letters, memoirs, archived documents and more into a seamless narrative of the wartime experience of one company of mountain troops. Veteran accounts challenge the mythology that has built up around the 10th Mountain Division, replacing it with a gritty reality even more incredible. Previously unstudied battles are reconstructed for the first time. The character and camaraderie of individual soldiers shine through the horror of war. With unvarnished honesty, the human experience of World War Two is brought to life in intense and gripping detail, revealing as nothing before what it was like to be a US ski trooper fighting Hitlerâ€™s forces on the Italian Front.",
