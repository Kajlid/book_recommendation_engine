  "title": "The War for Cole's Sexual Orientation",
  "description": "Cole Lasseter, eighteen, and only recently having come out, isn't making much progress in the evangelical-based 'reparative therapy' course he has been enrolled in by his parents. When the neuro-science faculty of a small college posts an on-line appeal for subjects to take part in a trial procedure involving the region of the brain that regulates gender and orientative behavior, Cole is entered into the programme.  Dr. Lacey, the faculty head, may have uncovered the neural-nets underlying sexual preference, and be able to influence the genetic component of homosexuality. The dizzying implication - the possibility of an elective procedure to 'orientatively-reassign,' causes an escalation of protest as outside groups descend upon the campus. As the trials near, the faculty, Dr. Lacey, and Cole rapidly become the center of a culture war. The narrative is told through a chorus of voices; a succession of different perspectives – and agendas – of the activists, parents, subjects, friends and lovers involved in the momentuous events leading up to Cole's procedure.",
