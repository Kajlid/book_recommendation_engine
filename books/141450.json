  "title": "Introduction to Emptiness: As Taught in Tsong-kha-pa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path",
  "description": "Readers are hard-pressed to find books that can help them understand the central concept in Mahayana Buddhismâ€”the idea that ultimate reality is emptiness. In clear language, Introduction to Emptiness explains that emptiness is not a mystical sort of nothingness, but a specific truth that can and must be understood through calm and careful reflection. Newland's contemporary examples and vivid anecdotes will be helpful to students trying to understand one of the great classic texts of the Tibetan tradition, Tsong-kha-pa's Great Treatise.",
