  "description": "Little Archie artist Bob Bolling is considered by many comic book collectors to be Archie Comics' equivalent of \"the duck man,\" Carl Barks. It's easy to see why: his classic tales are epic in scope, as Little Archie deals with Martian invaders, secret spies, pirates, freewheeling uncles, gorillas on the loose and more! Who knew a little boy could have so many adventures? Now, some of the best and earliest LITTLE ARCHIE stories are compiled in this special volume collecting vintage LITTLE ARCHIE stories from 1961 through 1965.",
