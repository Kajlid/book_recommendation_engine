  "description": "Disasters come in threes...That's what her mother always said, and now Susan Rivers could attest to it. First her teenage brother--accompanied by his blaring radio and guinea pigs Lusty and Dusty--was thrust upon her for the summer. Then she was evicted. And when Susan finally found another Southern California apartment, the unspeakable happened: Miles Cavanaugh moved in next door.\tAssisted by several nubile young women, Miles was the instant envy of Susan's brother. But with Susan, Miles was as awkward as a schoolboy.",
