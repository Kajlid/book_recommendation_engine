  "title": "The Coca Cookbook: 35 Recipes With The Forbidden Superfood",
  "description": "Vegans, watch out and kneel! One single leaf of coca carries more calories, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, fibre, ash, minerals, and vitamins than any other plant or infusion. Between 1991 and 1995, the WHO carried out the most extensive research of coca ever, with the result, that the traditional consumption of coca leaves benefits the human health, while the concentration of cocaine alkaloid in the leaf is so little that it will not produce a serious high -nor it leads to addiction. You are reading the first cookbook that cooks with the green-tea-tasting leaves of coca. Here you will find an extensive collection of the so called Novoandina Kitchen, which seeks to continue and adapt the traditional Incan kitchen to a global world. A wide range of cooked and baked goods, even dishes can be made with coca by simply grinding the leaves into a flour called harina. Harina can also be stirred into juices, blended in smoothies, or mixed to make alcoholic beverages of all types. Keep in mind that you can mix harina in any food that requires flour, my magical recipes in this cookbook will show you how. Que aproveche and bon appetit!",
