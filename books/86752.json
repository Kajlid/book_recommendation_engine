  "description": "\"One plus one plus one equals love. \"Dr. Dylan Warren is too old to be swapping places with his twin brother, but to save a million-dollar deal, he'll play along. He never counted on a sexy, nosy male contractor being able to tell the difference between them. In order to protect his brother's reputation, Dylan agrees to meet Harper for dinner-at what turns out to be a high-class club that caters to its patrons' \"every\" need.Dylan has never made any bones about being bi, but he's never had \"two\" lovers at once. Suddenly, he's in lust with not only Harper but the hot female bartender intent on serving them more than drinks. Between Freddy, a beautiful woman who seems to know him better than he knows himself, and Harper, a man who pushes his every boundary, Dylan finds himself in that most uncomfortable of places-falling in love without a safety net. Losing a bet may lead to sex clubs, threesomes, and spankings. One sexy psychiatrist, one giant hunk of a contractor, and one cute blond bartender combine in all imaginable configurations...and then some.",
