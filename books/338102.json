  "description": "Three weeks ago, I had to make the most difficult decision of my life, thinking I knew what I was doing.Turns out, I was clueless as to what fate had in store for me still.And when I find myself a captive of the most powerful sorcerer I've ever met, I'm sure this is it. There's nobody left out there who cares about me. Nobody was coming to save me, and I couldn't save myself, either.But as always, I keep underestimating Savage Ax.Even though he saves me, things between us are not the same. He can barely look at me. Doesn't even want to talk to me. I drove a knife through his heart and twisted it, too. I'm learning that that has a lot of consequences.But I can't take it. I can't stand it when he looks at me like he doesn't care. So I do the only reasonable thing I can think of: write him a letter and leave.Except Ax is not one to leave things unfinished. And when he decides that I'm not going anywhere, there's very little I can do about it...or want to.",
