  "description": "I wouldn’t call it love at first sight, but my body definitely reacted when I saw her.Getting Faith Robbins under me became my obsession.I knew I wanted fast and done.It’s how I always did things.Looking for anything more with a woman was never in the cards.I wasn’t like the other guys in the Cerberus MC. I didn’t want more.It was physical, sating a desire.Then someone began to seek revenge, and my other instincts kicked in.Spending time with her was about protecting her, keeping her safe.Now if only I could remind my heart what the plan was.",
