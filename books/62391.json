  "description": "The battered body of an Afghan boy is found at the base of a cliff outside a remote village in Afghanistan. Did he fall as most of the villagers think? Or is this the work of American soldiers, as others want to believe? Sofi, illiterate, is desperate to learn the truth behind her son's death. Extremists move in and offer to roust the infidels from the region, adding new pressures for the small village and its women. We hear two sides of this story. One is Sofi's. The other is that of US Army Special Ranger Joey Pearson. In time, and defying all odds, Sofi secretly learns to read with the help of Mita Samuelson, an American aid worker. Through reading, the Afghan woman develops her own interpretation of how to live the good life while discovering the identity of her son's murderer and the extremists' real purpose in her village. Thriller, mystery, suspense.Publishers Weekly: \"Froetschel has crafted an exceptionally well-written tale of love, loss, trust, and greed with appeal that reaches far beyond mystery fans.\"",
