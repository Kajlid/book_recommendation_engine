  "title": "Green Dolphin Country",
  "description": "First published in 1944, this magnificent epic of love, courage, and selfless devotion set in the Channel Islands and New Zealand in the 19th century is written with Elizabeth Goudge's inimitable feeling for the intricacies of human emotions. Though the book is fiction, and the characters not portraits, it is based on fact. A stunning tale of loss and self-sacrifice, it is truly one of the most memorable love stories of the last century.",
