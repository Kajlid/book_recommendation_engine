  "description": "Exposure is a funny and poignant memoir of adventure and love with a sharp psychological edge. Joel Magarey, a young journalist haunted by both inflated dreams and obsessive-compulsive disorder, abandons his career and girlfriend of seven years for a long-imagined global odyssey - and unimagined perils. Travel tale, love story and generation-X tragicomedy, Exposure is about wanting and fearing too much, choosing too little and how a person can spend three weeks solid in Los Angeles searching for the perfect sleeping bag.",
