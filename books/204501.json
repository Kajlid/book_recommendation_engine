SO TRUE.Let me tell you, being kidnapped by aliens is not all it’s cracked up to be. Especially when the one who kidnaps you happens to be the most infuriating individual you’ve ever met in your life! Okay, so he was sexy as hell, and every part of me wanted to tear my clothes off and jump his big, alien bones. But then I found out he kidnapped me for some crazy alien repopulation program, and I was freaked out!Things got complicated. Then they got crazy. Then they got downright freaking INSANE!But it all worked out in the end. Falling for some alien who kidnapped me and turned me over to his colony’s screwed up program was the last thing I ever expected, but now I wouldn’t have it any other way.",
