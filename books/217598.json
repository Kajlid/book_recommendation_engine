  "description": "Detective Blake Hammond wants some R & R -- what he gets is \"Operation Honeymoon.\" Not only is his trip to Hawaii on hold now, but he has to deal with some stuck-up DEA agent. While the case is nothing out of the ordinary, he never thought he'd have to play house. But if sexy Veronica Carmichael wants a loving husband, he's more than willing to play the part....When Ronnie meets her new partner, she knows he's trouble. The gorgeous cop is anything but cooperative. Problem is, posing as newlyweds isn't as easy as she hoped. She has plans, though. Since this is her last assignment, Ronnie wants to do the job right...even if it means getting them under the covers.",
