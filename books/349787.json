  "description": "YOUR EMOTIONAL BOAT Lets pretend for a moment that you are a boat. So. what kind of boat would you be? Which boat would personify all of your characteristics? Your Emotional Boat utilizes the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator and pairs each Myers-Briggs Personality type with a particular \"boat\" style. All of us travel through life, but some are more prepared than others. This book prepares the reader to approach life as if they are beginning a journey. The author uses the analogy of comparing \"people\" to \"boats\" to further enhance the development of the idea of preparing for a journey. How a person prepares for the journey through life depends upon the type of \"boat\" that they are. Your Emotional Boat will lead the readers through several techniques to help them learn more about themselves and what they want to create in their lives. Once the reader understands their own personal style, and has determined what they want to create in their lives, they will be guided in the process of making a \"map\" for their own personal journey. The latter half of the book encourages readers to look more closely at their own spiritual beliefs and to discover how these beliefs affect their lives.",
