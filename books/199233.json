  "description": "If you love Sam and Dean, then you’re going to adore The Blood Sisters! Hunting demons, kicking ass and saving people is what they do.  When an evil gang spreads demon essence drugs throughout the mid-west, Jessica and Amanda Blood are hot on their trail. Until Amanda is kidnapped by demons eager to collect the bounty placed on the sisters’ heads by queen of the underworld.  Jessica will go to the ends of the Earth to find her healer sister, before Amanda is sacrificed and her pure blood used to open the gates of hell. But to get there, Jessica must ride with bad boy demon hunter Duncan Jasper and his gang. Too bad the only thing tougher than fighting demons is fighting her attraction to Duncan.  Duncan Jasper left Jessica once, on his own dangerous mission. Now he’s back, and determined to keep her safe in his arms, no matter what--if she'll let him, that is.  But with demons charging from the front, the underworld gunning from behind, and a spy in their midst, Jessica and Duncan's fight to save Amanda--and humanity--is just beginning.",
