  "description": "Lucinda Rackmore is a witch cursed...\nDesperation sends her to the last place anyone would think to find her...the small Dragon-protected town of Nevermore, Texas. To escape the wrath of her ex-lover, she must plead her case with the town's Guardian—the man her family betrayed a decade ago.\nGray Calhoun is a wizard scorned...\nGray wants nothing to do with the Rackmores, especially not the spoiled younger sister of the woman who sacrificed him to a demon lord. But when Lucy shows up at his door begging for sanctuary, he can't turn her away.\nMagic is love reborn...\nAn infamous Rackmore witch isn't the only trouble in town, either. Someone's creating demonic mayhem—and murdering citizens. Only with Gray and Lucinda working together, can they hope to defeat the dark forces that threaten Nevermore. And maybe along the way, they'll find that love is the strongest magic of all.",
