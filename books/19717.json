  "description": "We were not meant to be together… then a dark twist of fate stepped in, and we're the ones who will pay for it.  As the eldest son and heir of the Cavalieri name, I inherit a great deal more than a billion dollar empire. I receive a legacy of secrets, lies, and scandal. After enduring a childhood filled with malicious rumors about my father, I have fallen prey to his very same sin. I married a woman I didn't love out of a false sense of family honor.  Now she has died under mysterious circumstances. And I am left to play the widowed groom. For no one can know the truth about my wife…Especially her sister. The only way to protect her from danger is to keep her close, and yet, her very nearness tortures me. She is my sister in name only, but I have no right to desire her. Not after what I have done. It's too much to hope she would understand that it was all for her. It's always been about her. Only her.  I am, after all, my father's son. And there is nothing on this earth more ruthless than a Cavalieri man in love.  If you love the dark and twisted romantic suspense of Natasha Knight, A. Zavarelli, Charmaine Pauls, and Anna Zaires you will love this series! Secrets of the Brother continues the steamy, enemies to lovers drama of the Cavalieri men with Enzo and Bianca's story, and follows more of the tempestuous love affairs of Barone and Amara and Cesare and Milana.",
