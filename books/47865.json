But to live the rest of her years on earth, she must learn to overcome her past, endure familial secrets, and learn to love herself—the good, the bad, and the ugly.In the tradition of Chris Cleave's Little Bee, My Name Is Butterfly is a contemporary story that offers an educational, eye opening account into the practice of ritual servitude in West Africa. Spanning decades and two continents, My Name Is Butterfly will break and heal your heart ….",
