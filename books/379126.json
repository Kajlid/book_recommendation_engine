  "description": "\"Both timeless and timely, I believe Igniting Your Life holds the promise of being a limitless resource of hope and inspiration.\" â€“ Cherie Soria, founder and director Living Light International, RawChef.com \"Igniting Your Life is a book written by an independent thinker for independent thinkers. Or, chances are, you will certainly be one by the time you have finished reading it. John has a penetrating and comprehensive view of the numerous ways in which we can all safeguard not only our own health but also, by extension, the health of the environment and the other people and life forms we share it with. To put it simply, he knows what really matters. The huge collection of great quotations that fill his latest book are reason enough to read it, but if we choose to actively ignite our lives in the ways that John suggests, our enhanced energy and clarity will enable us to do more good in this world and also to be a lot happier in the process.\" - Angela Starks and Michael Stein, Yoga In The Raw, New York.",
