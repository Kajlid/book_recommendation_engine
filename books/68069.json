  "title": "The God Gene",
  "description": "Winner 2013 National Indie Excellence Award for Literary Fiction. At an elite Chicago university, Cancer researcher Rosalind Evans discovers that the genetic code at the center of the second chromosome spells out the Ten Commandments. Sure that her top-secret pharma project has been hacked, she launches an investigation. But that night, someone leaks the discovery to a popular blog and it goes viral. The next morning, the world wakes up to the news that there is a message from God in their DNA. Public reaction is intense: to some itâ€™s a miracle, and to others, a myth. But to a group of religious and political elites, the God Gene is a dangerous public delusion that threatens their very existence. With the media fanning the flames, Evans quickly becomes the scapegoat in a growing controversy. A pharma executive wants her fired, the Vatican wants her silenced, and the U.S. Attorney wants her arrested. A bizarre battle ensues as Rosalind Evans takes on the most powerful institutions on earth to preserve her scientific integrity, her freedom, and ultimately her life.",
