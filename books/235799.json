  "description": "What if your whole life has been a lie?  Cora’s Hollow is under threat of social disruption. The signs are written all over the buildings and the faces of its people.  The Fae have been pushed into hiding. Fear of magic has been the strongest propaganda tool offered by the human government. Whether or not the people believe is of little importance. A divided public is the easiest public to control.   Follow the story of a Freedom Fighter, a Bartender, and a Veteran as they discover their love for one another and fight against the endemic social war with little hope to survive.  DEMON HERO is a standalone contribution to the Charmed Legacy Dark Fae Hollows collection. Stories can be read in any order.
