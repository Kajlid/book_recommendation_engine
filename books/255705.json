  "description": "Wilkins a conservative soldier gets the shock of her life upon her first meeting with Johnson, an overly liberal journalist from San Antonio. Johnson is blunt, loud, and kind of cute but nevertheless, the exact opposite of quiet, rule-bound Wilkins. Johnson, who happens to be best friends with Wilkins' superior, Tech Sergeant Ian Morris, ends up falling head over heels for the modest sergeant, and upon learning the nature of Johnson's feelings, Wilkins tries her best to avoid the extroverted woman, knowing that if she gives in to the promised affection, her job title and reputation will be compromised. However, when Johnson is assigned to do an undercover story about life as an Air Force trainee and is asked to reside in the dormitories as a trainee, all chaos breaks loose. Wilkins ends up having to choose between love and her responsibility as a soldier, knowing that her choice may have a lasting effect on the rest of her life.",
