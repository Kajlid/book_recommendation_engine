  "description": "What should you do if you discover you're dead and didn't know it? I do what I've always done when something emotionally challenging comes along, I throw myself into work. That's why I'm known as D.I. Ghost. Murder detective, Kate Madding knows a serial killer is at large and she joins forces with his victims to bring him to justice. Suffering from posthumous traumatic stress when they first meet, their friendship slowly brings meaning back to their afterlife, as Kate also helps her twin sister and her family cope with her death. To quote one of the readers' reviews: \"This is the antidote to the usual serial killer detective story. The victims are feisty and funny and are out for revenge.\" And another: \"This book was a very funny read that kept me guessing almost to the end.\" And a third: \"I found myself easily hooked in with this book, looking forward to picking it up again...It is a delightful and very welcome new addition to the genre. Lauren White writes engagingly with great psychological insight.\"",
