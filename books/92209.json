  "title": "Redefining Girly: How Parents Can Fight the Stereotyping and Sexualizing of Girlhood, from Birth to Tween",
  "description": "Named one of Publishers Weekly’s Best Books of 2014 All-pink aisles in toy stores, popular dolls that resemble pole dancers, ultra sexy Halloween costumes in tween sizes. Many parents are increasingly dismayed at how today’s media, marketers, and manufacturers are sexualizing and stereotyping ever-younger girls but feel powerless to do much about it. Mother of two Melissa Atkins Wardy channeled her feelings of frustration into activism—creating T-shirts with girl-positive messages; blogging and swapping parenting strategies with other concerned families; writing letters to corporate offenders; organizing petitions; and raising awareness through parent workshops and social media.            Now, in Redefining Girly, Wardy shares her hands-on parenting and activism strategies with others dedicated to raising a confident and healthy girl in today’s climate. She provides specific advice and sample conversations for getting family, friends, educators, and health care providers on your side; getting kids to think critically about sexed-up toys and clothes; talking to girls about body image; and much more. She provides tips for creating a home free of gender stereotypes; using your voice and consumer power to fight the companies perpetuating them; and taking the reins to limit, challenge, and change harmful media and products.",
