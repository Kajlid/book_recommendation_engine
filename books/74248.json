  "description": "How much of yourself can you sacrifice before you are no longer who you once were? Is it worth it? Is winning worth any price? Is freedom? Every curse has a blessing and every blessing has a curse. When you stand face to face with your destiny, will you be able to tell one from the other? In a world filled with darkness and hate, ignorance and fear, the only answer needed should be love and light, happiness and acceptance. Well, it should be. Good versus evil, daylight over darkness, Angels or demons...the age old epic battle rages through the universe. One thing always rings true, love triumphs over all. But, what if a pure and loving heart unintentionally caused Angels to fall, demons to rise, and blurred the line between heaven and hell? Jenevier owns such a heart. An innocent, unadulterated purity that is too quick to find good where none exists. Her blind trust and radiant soul could be the answer long sought, or, it could mark the end of us all. An epic journey of love and magic, curses and trials, joys and pain, Cursed by Diamonds is only the beginning. Follow this fragile maiden; thrust upon a fated path wrought with world altering decisions, as she blindly begins A Dance with Destiny. And, this little tune may change all our lives.",
