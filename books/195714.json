And I basically dare you not to fall in love with Ringo.” Updated with new epilogues for the 10th Anniversary editions of the series.War is being waged against the Descendants and Saira Elian is desperate to stop the Mongers’ savage bid for power …Saira’s search for kidnapped mixed-bloods draws her into the Mongers’ stronghold, revealing the horrible truth behind the irresistible Monger ring and the vile plan to cleanse Family bloodlines … permanently.Under threat of a brutal massacre, Saira and Ringo travel back to Bletchley Park during World War II where they team up with Archer from the past to crack a Nazi code and expose a Monger intent on changing the course of history. They join forces with a female commando from the French resistance to hunt down an elite unit of Monger soldiers – Hitler’s Werewolves – before the terror squad can strike a fatal blow at the heart of the Allied war effort.Their manhunt drags Saira, Archer, and Ringo into the London Underground on the eve of a Nazi bombing raid where they come face-to-face with a Monger assassin on a suicide mission. With the lives of all mixed-bloods in peril, Saira must make a sacrifice that even Time may never forgive.",
