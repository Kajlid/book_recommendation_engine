  "description": "Rebecca \"Becks\" Mansfield has a boyfriend who sets her on the edge, a job catering to the whims of a cartoon vampire, and she's shortly to be a bridesmaid in the fairy-tale wedding from hell. How could this have happened to the brilliant, brash-talking, rising star of marketing? Her three best friends tell her she's \"date lazy,\" settling for the men who require the least effort. Maybe Becks isn't trying hard enough, but the \"one\" she's looking for isn't the perfect man—it's the perfect job. Of course, you can't always get what you want—a fact that's about to become crystal clear to Becks Mansfield. But sometimes you get what you need.",
