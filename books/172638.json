After her \"runaway year\" in Cornwall, another year has passed—an idyllic year spent with sexy new love Joseph Scott in the sultry heat of Florence. For best friend Penny, life has also changed. Having recently given birth to a baby girl, she’s busy embracing motherhood.  But, for the Runaways, life is never that easy...  A chance encounter with Joseph’s ex-girlfriend, Tara, has explosive consequences for the new lovers, and all three are forced back to Cornish shores. There's a secret between Tara and Joseph, and Layla can't help but fear that they're rekindling their past. Meanwhile, motherhood is not the joy Penny thought it would be—she’s heading for a breakdown and fast!   All too soon the bubble is burst, the idyll shattered.   As Penny seeks sanctuary in Cornwall too, loyalties are stretched to the limit and relationships are challenged. When Tara's secret is revealed, it threatens to tear them all apart. Can Layla hang on to new love with Joseph when his past keeps pulling him away?",
