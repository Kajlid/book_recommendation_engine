  "description": "Carla is a whiz at her she's efficient, reliable, and a total genius when it comes to putting something together at the last minute. The snag is she's single and turning the big three-oh in a few months. her girl best friend (yes, she's married just like mthe other girls in Carla's barkada) keeps trying to set her up with stable banker-types, while her guy best friend (single–the other single one) encourages her to play the field–no strings attached. Then, through no set up or extraordinary circumstances, Carla meets Dante. Hot, smug, sexy Dante. Definitely not a banker-type and seemingly too good to be true. So there's got to be a catch. There is. He's five years younger. Is the universe telling Carla to finally let loose and enjoy a fling with a younger man? Or is there a lot more to this awkward situation than she bargained for?",
