  "title": "The Claiming of Sleeping Beauty",
  "description": "This is a very dark, erotic, adult interpretation of the classic fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty. It begins when Beauty is already awake and about to become Queen. Yet, because of a series of dark and sometimes deviant sexual encounters, Beauty must be cleansed of her sins by the Maid, the Scholar, the Warrior, and the Mage before she can be forgiven. The final cleansing will require a hundred years of sleep for Beauty and her Kingdom during which Beauty will learn what service to one's Kingdom really means. Warning: This is a work of fiction that contains sexually explicit materials meant for those over the age of 18 and contains elements of dubious consent, dominant male, and submissive female.",
