  "description": "\"An engaging tale about two music lovers trying to set the historical record straight.\" – Kirkus Reviews A young man on a mission. An aging musician with a dream. Society perched over a racial divide. It’s the 1960s, and nothing reflects the cultural revolution more than music. When Kennedy Barnes, a runaway teen, stumbles upon a rock and roll song recorded by a blues musician in the 1930s, he heads west in search of the man behind the music. Willie Johnson, ex-bluesman, is a motel laundry worker with a bad hip and a dark past. When Kennedy arrives with the promise of riches, Willie wonders if he’s finally getting his shot at the big time. But is fame worth the cost of dredging up past sorrows? Sins in Blue is a novel about lost dreams, crippling grief, and the healing power of an unlikely friendship.",
