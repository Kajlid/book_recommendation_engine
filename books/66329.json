  "description": "WHO ARE YOU? WHAT DEFINES YOU? WHAT IS YOUR IDENTITY? How you answer those questions affects every aspect of your personal, public, and spiritual. So it’s vital to get the answer right. Pastor and best-selling author Mark Driscoll believes false identity is at the heart of many struggles—and that you can overcome them by having your true identity in Christ. In Wh o Do You Th i n k Y o u Are ? , Driscoll explores the question, “What does it mean to be ‘in Christ’?” In the process he dissects the false-identity epidemic and, more important, provides the only solution—Jesus. “This book will give you an unshakeable, biblical understanding of who you are in Christ. When you know who you are, you’ll know what to do.” —Craig Groeschel, Senior Pastor of LifeChurch.tv and author of Soul D et ox , Clean Livi ng i n a Cont am in at ed W or ld “I spent years in ministry for Christ without understanding my identity in Christ. I know now that I was not alone. When, by the grace of God, we understand who we are in Christ, everything else can crumble and we will still be standing. I highly commend this book to you.” —Sheila Walsh, speaker and author of God Loves Broken People",
