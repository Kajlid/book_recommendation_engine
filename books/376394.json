  "description": "The true story of the leaking of the Pentagon Papers, the event which inspired Steven Spielbergâ€™s feature film The PostIn 1971 former Cold War hard-liner Daniel Ellsberg made history by releasing the Pentagon Papers - a 7,000-page top-secret study of U.S. decision-making in Vietnam - to the New York Times and Washington Post . The document set in motion a chain of events that ended not only the Nixon presidency but the Vietnam War. In this remarkable memoir, Ellsberg describes in dramatic detail the two years he spent in Vietnam as a U.S. State Department observer, and how he came to risk his career and freedom to expose the deceptions and delusions that shaped three decades of American foreign policy. The story of one man's exploration of conscience, Secrets is also a portrait of America at a perilous crossroad.\"[Ellsberg's] well-told memoir sticks in the mind and will be a powerful testament for future students of a war that the United States should never have fought.\" - The Washington Post\"Ellsberg's deft critique of secrecy in government is an invaluable contribution to understanding one of our nation's darkest hours.\" -Theodore Roszak, San Francisco Chronicle",
