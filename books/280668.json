  "description": "Tomorrow is Christmas Day. And in the last 48 hours I have:  1) Fired two of my trusted employees.  2) Defaced the office Christmas tree.  3) Completely blown it with the first man I’ve really liked in the last ten years.  But it’s worth it, because I’m about to earn the promotion of a lifetime. Unfortunately, my former boss and mentor, Marley Jacobs, is determined to show me the error of my ways before midnight.  Except I’m not about to let anyone get in my way—even Marley.  Especially since Marley is dead.",
