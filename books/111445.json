With the support of his wife Annie, they uproot their family in an attempt to save the ones they love. Luke is challenged on all sides by his cantankerous father, his oldest son’s rebellion and even his youngest daughter’s Muscular Dystrophy. In Volume 5: Downfall, Luke Umble has to face the truth. First he faces it in the rude, condescending behavior of the Englische Captain. Then Luke learns more harsh truth from the young, but sincere, Lieutenant that has also expressed an interest in his daughter. The promise once offered by their ship, the Corinthian, seems to be falling from their grasp. Things are made worse when eight-year-old Henry decides to skip school and explore the ship. Everything collides and causes Luke to doubt his faith.The one question he asks himself is “How far would you go to keep your faith?”The only answer Luke can find lies in God’s Promise of Tomorrow.",
