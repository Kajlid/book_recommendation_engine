Shake and enjoy.Until Carrie wakes to a ring on her finger and a marriage certificate tying her to the illegible signature of a man who’s gone. It was supposed to be just one night, but now she doesn’t even know her last name.Coming home married was bad, but walking into work the next day was worse.
