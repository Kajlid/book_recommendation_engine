  "title": "A Christmas to Live For",
  "description": "It's the holiday season in New York City. Bryan Crandon, from across the room at his best friend's annual Halloween gala, has unexpectedly met the girl of his dreams.  Bryan, a clinical psychologist, finds himself fighting to balance his faith, a new romantic interest, his career, and his struggles with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.  While this story is a work of fiction, I wanted to delve into a world of disordered eating--something typically seen as a woman's issue--and weave it into a story that is told from the male perspective.",
