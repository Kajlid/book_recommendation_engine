  "description": "Dirk Raiden grew up just South of London, England. In a place and time that will not exist for two centuries. Dirk dreamed of being a fighter pilot like his father. And, when he made it into Earth Force; and then, was assigned to fly Earth Force's newest space fighter, Dirk could not have been more excited. But, nothing in Dirk's fighter pilot training could have prepared him for the challenges that would befall him that fateful day; as he and his flight of four space fighters flew up to Earth Force's Mars base. This fast paced, easy to read, action packed adventure will take you to places you have never imagined. It is a love story about a forbidden love and alliance that canâ€™t be allowed, but must happen to save us all.",
