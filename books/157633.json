  "description": "AMAZON NO. 1 BEST SELLING BOOK. Madeline is sixteen with nothing to do in the school holidays. The rural Irish town is quiet and shops are not hiring part-time staff. To keep her out of trouble she is encouraged to join a Riding Club and learn to compete. Her borrowed horse Moonrock has plenty of experience. The same can't be said for Alabama, the young chestnut mare purchased by Karen's moneyed parents. Karen is expected to succeed, even though other club members - such as Niall, a farmer boy - resent the fact that her father bought up farmland for building. Karen's only ally is Jen who works at the livery yard, training young horses. Can the young adults put aside their differences and learn to be a team - when it really matters?  From the Amazon No1 Bestselling author of Murder Against The Clock and Rodeo Finn. Clare O'Beara won the Arkady Renko short story competition held by Simon & Schuster in 2014 and judged by Martin Cruz Smith. \"Please congratulate Clare O'Beara for me for her clever short, short story 'London Calling.' I appreciate that she treated Arkady kindly, taking his age into consideration, and managed to cross the finish line with a different sort of twist.\" - Martin Cruz Smith.",
