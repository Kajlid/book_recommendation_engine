  "title": "Working in Sync: How Eleven Dartmouth Athletes Propelled Their College Sports Experience into Professional Excellence",
  "description": "Working in Sync tells the stories of eleven former Dartmouth crew athletes who went on to lead exceptional lives. They all have one thing in common: Each credits part of his success to lessons learned during college crew under coach Whit Mitchell. After a 25th team reunion, Whit wanted to find out the secret to their successes. He conducted months of one-on-one interviews, uncovering outstanding insights on life, business, and success, and saw a direct connection to his executive coaching clients. In all eleven stories, the most important lesson is that success is achieved through working together—working in sync—with colleagues, clients, and loved ones.",
