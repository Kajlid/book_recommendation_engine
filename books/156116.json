  "description": "Raine has always been more of a warrior than a diplomat, but now she must use all of her charisma to bring the rivals of Arianthem together. Her close bonds with the all-female race of the Ha’kan ensure that alliance, but negotiations with the Empire go poorly until they receive an unexpected boost from a sultry ally. The reserved elven leader of the Alfar hints to Raine of cooperation, yet also hints that sexual conquest might be her price.Events seem to sabotage the alliance as the Alfar leader kidnaps an imperial, the daughter of the wealthiest landholder in Arianthem. Raine is baffled by the strange actions of the elven noblewoman, actions that bring the entire land to the brink of war. The concord truly unravels when Skye, the young leader of the Tavinter, manifests magical abilities and unintentionally attracts monumental evil. Raine’s only hope is that her dragon lover will return from the Empty Land before all is lost and the evil that stalks Skye comes for her.",
