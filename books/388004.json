  "description": "Are you ready to kick it up a notch? Wait -- forget that. Are you ready to kick it up notches unknown to humankind? Finally, Emeril has written the book his fans of Emeril Live and Essence of Emeril have been waiting for -- a collection of his very favorite recipes from both shows.It's all here -- from cooking up Fall River memories like St. John's Kale Soup, Roasted Scrod with Parsley Potatoes, and Boston Cream Pie with his mom, Hilda, to Louisiana specialties like Creole Spiced Blue Crabs with Green Onion Dipping Sauce, Fried Eggplant with Shrimp Stew-Fay, and Blueberry Beignets.Hey, this isn't rocket science, but it's good eating, with starters like Caramelized Salmon with Cilantro Potato Salad and Stuffed Morels with Crawfish Remoulade. This isn't Kansas anymore, Toto, and these are salads like you've never had them -- Herb-Tossed White Asparagus, Fresh Crabmeat, and Grilled Radicchio Salad, Emeril's BLT Salad, and Molasses Duck Salad.Does pork fat rule at your house (and if it doesn't, why not?)? Then take your pick of the pig --- Homemade Bacon, Andouille Stuffed Jalapeqos, and Pork Burgers in Gravy with French-Fried Sweet Potatoes. And don't limit yourself to one part of the barnyard -- try Emerilized Chicken Cordon Bleu, Funky Lamb Shanks, Pan-Roasted Filet Mignon Stuffed with English Stilton and Walnuts, or Smothered Oxtails over Spinach and Sweet Corn Mash.Emeril's TV Dinners not only includes more than 150 recipes, it is jam-packed with candid black-and-white photography of Emeril behind the scenes, in front of the cameras, on tour, and really live in his New Orleans restaurants.",
