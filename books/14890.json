  "title": "Darkening the Doorways: Black Trailblazers and Missed Opportunities in Unitarian Universalism",
  "description": "On one hand, Darkening the Doorways is a tale of systemic paternalism and a prejudicial failure of vision, of squandered opportunities and good intentions turned into tragedy more often than triumph. On the other hand, it is a tale of idealism, courage, intrepid allies, dogged determination and steadfast loyalty in the face of rejection. The life stories and achievements of the African Americans you will discover in these pages are remarkable. Mark Morrison-Reed's collection of profiles and essays, supplemented by archival documents, revives their memory while pointing toward the evolving multicultural future.",
