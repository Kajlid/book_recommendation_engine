  "description": "\"My life was just fine—I had a job, my own condo, friends to share a beer with—fine. Who needed a purpose? Then I bought that damned painting and my life filled with serial killers, frustrated lovers, orphans and itinerant peddlers outrunning the law. Now, I’m dreaming other peoples’ lives; feeling other peoples’ pain, wondering whether I’m crazy or some sort of psychic freak. And then there’s Melanie—mahogany-haired, wanna-be-lawyer and the woman I want in my life. Will she want me if she knows I’m a freak? Will she stay if I follow where the dreams lead me?\" Twenty six year old Dave Peltier, a computer systems representative from Portland, finds his life intertwining with the lives of strangers that he meets only in dreams. As one object after another, purchased from the mysterious Astrella’s Antiques & Curios, reveals its story, Dave’s childhood memories and a long suppressed talent emerge. The dreams and his latent ability draw him into a future whose course he cannot imagine.",
