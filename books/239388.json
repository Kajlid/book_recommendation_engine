  "description": "Going door-to-door and collecting for charity is not the way Melody Lewis planned to spend her day off. However, her life takes an unexpected turn when she arrives at the last house on the street and meets a most interesting stranger.Konrad Steele does not like to be interrupted. Needless to say, he was irate when a persistent visitor kept knocking. That is…until he saw the beautiful creature waiting on the other side of the door.Dominant. Submissive. Control. Discipline. Trust.Who truly has a position of power? Sometimes the lines can become blurred when two strong personalities collide. Not everything is as straightforward as it seems when you’re teaching the Dom.WARNING: This story contains some very descriptive scenes of a carnal nature between a man and a woman. This story DOES NOT have abuse, torture, or anything that would cause physical harm. If you’re looking for a story where the woman calls the man, ‘Daddy,’ and punishment is inflicted with a heavy hand, you will NOT find it here. However, if you’re intrigued by the idea of a stubborn female, a sex scene involving fruit, and a very tantalizing silver fox…then I’ve got you covered. Shall we proceed? Excellent…",
