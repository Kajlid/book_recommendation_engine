The only place Charlie and his best friend, Gil, have ever known is their small, peaceful town of Paradise. They know others exist, and still, they have never wanted to leave. But one day, when they think they can become heroes by capturing a rabid cat in the nearby forest, the twelve year-old boys stumble across a hidden door that leads them to a secret military base. Suddenly, they realize that everything they have ever known is not what it seems to be. Kemma, a twelve year-old who has been trained for military combat, captures the two boys easily. But as she listens to their story, she believes that the three of them have discovered something that they were never supposed to know about- each other. As she attempts to help the boys, she is forced to leave her home and the people she no longer trusts. In their search for the truth about their lives and families, the three begin a dangerous journey that leads them through the Nevada desert to Las Vegas, and eventually to the scientist who has been watching them.",
