  "title": "The Most Wonderful Fairy Tale",
  "description": "Over 300 years ago, the Book of Tales--a magical tome that allows anything written into it to come to life--was passed from one fairy tale author to the next until the Brothers Grimm hid it away and protected it from the wrong hands. The fairy tale characters blended into society, had children, and moved on. But a war broke out for control of the book between the corrupt Blackguard and the peacekeeping Göttingen which continues to this day.For 12-year-old misfit Nevada Turnkey--or Nev, as he would prefer--fairy tales were just silly stories. For his sister Georgia, they were an escape from her dismal life in Happy Hal's Trailer Park. And for young Clover Lane, they were suddenly a harsh reality. The Blackguard has found a way to get to the book, with Nev and Clover right at the center of their plan. Now, with the help of Georgia and some new Göttingen friends, they must travel to the ends of the earth to retrieve the Book of Tales before it's too late.​The original fairy tale characters may have started the war, but this is the story of how their descendants fought back.",
