She also discovers that he lives at the top of the prestigious hotel and that most everyone in Chicago is intrigued by him.Lydia and Sebastian form a fragile friendship, but when she discovers that Mr. Marks isn’t merely a very wealthy gentleman, but also the proprietor of an infamous saloon and gambling club, she is shocked.Lydia insists on visiting the club one fateful night and suddenly is a suspect to a murder.
