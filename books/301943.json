  "description": "Mary’s Vail has a secret. Jake knows his life isn’t exactly normal. His hair is weird. His eyes are weird. He’s never seen his Mum’s face, even though she’s the one bringing him up. And he has a lot of questions too; questions he always thought he wanted the answers to, until the day Obin showed up. That hair. Those eyes. It can’t be a coincidence this boy looks so much like him. And Obin seems to know it too, clinging to Jake in this almost obsessive kind of way. Then again Obin’s apparently a kid who’s moved around a lot, so maybe he’s just unsettled. In a few months Jake will be able to look back on all this and laugh at how foolish he was, won’t he? Although he knows it’s more than just the weirdness getting to him; because Obin’s step-father is a doll maker, and Jake’s terrified of dolls… Do you want to play? Shadows Beneath The Light When you're living in the shadows, it doesn't matter if you're a demon or a demon hunter, the battle between good and evil isn't always black and white. The Doll Maker's Son is the first arc in the Shadow Beneath The Light series, introducing readers to Maio's band of demon hunters, before uncovering some of Mary's Vail's secrets. Get ready, the Sayu Sen are coming. Do you want to play?",
