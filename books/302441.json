  "title": "The High Pasture",
  "description": "The Colorado sun sparkled in the clear mountain air, but there were deep shadows for Tim. Try as he could, he couldn't push from his mind the picture of his mother lying tired and still in her hospital bed. Nor could he dispel the anger he felt when he thought of his father who didn't want him around when the boy wished so much to be there.When Tim first stepped out of the shadows and saw the wolf=like animal standing in the high pasture, he was half afraid yet half intrigued. The lonely nobility of the creature seemed to represent something important to Tim, but it took him the whole summer to gain Lobo's confidence and discover just what it was.In the course of this dramatic story, Tim learns a good deal about Lobo and himself, about animals and people, and about life itself. When Tim's time comes to face one of the inexorable facts of life, he finds that he is ready. He has gained from the wisdom of Aunt Kate and from the truths of nature, and his relationship with a wolf-like dog has helped Tim to understand a most important human relationship.In The High Pasture Ruth Harnden has come very directly to terms with a difficult subject. She handles her theme with perception, sympathy, and even humor and never loses her grip on the pace of the story.",
