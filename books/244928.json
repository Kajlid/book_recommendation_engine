  "description": "POLITICAL CORRECTNESS WON'T SAVE YOUFormer Army Ranger Jake Rivers is not your typical Kelton College student. He is not spoiled, coddled, or ultra-lib like his classmates who sneer at the \"soldier boy.\"Rivers is not \"triggered\" by \"microaggressions.\" He is not outraged by \"male privilege\" and\"cisgender bathrooms.\" He does not need a \"safe space.\" Or coloring books. Jake needs an education. And when terror strikes, the school needs Jake . . .Without warning, the sounds of gunfire plunge the campus into a battle zone. A violent gang of marauders invade the main hall, taking students as hostages for big ransom money. As a veteran and patriot, Jake won't give in to their demands. But to fight back, he needs to enlist his fellow classmates to school these special snowflakes in the not-so-liberal art of war. This time, the aggression isn't \"micro.\" It's life or death. And only the strong survive . . .",
