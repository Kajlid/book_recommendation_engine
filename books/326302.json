  "title": "Healing Your Body, Mind, and Soul: Learn to Reprogram Your Mind to Stay Healthy",
  "description": "On this fascinating, inspirational, and often humorous audio program -- recorded live -- the incomparable Syvia Browne explains how you can heal your body, mind, and soul by reprogramming your cell memory, virtually eliminating your physical, emotional, and spiritual challenges. Some of the issues she addresses are:\n  \nPhysical/emotional challenges: When it comes to healing, it's necessary to heal yourself as a complete entity \n    \nGod: Every morning when you get up, surround yourself with white light -- with God's love. Tell your cells, 'I release all negativity from past lives, and I want to live my life spiritually and unfettered.\nForgiveness: Eject your old negative tapes and replace them with positive thoughts and images. Start by forgiving yourself; allow yourself to be human \n  \nSylvia then has you join her in a powerful healing meditation. She advises you to tell your cells: 'I'm healing my mind, body, and spirit. I'm doing God's work, and all my negative issues -- even those from past lives -- are falling away.' Tell your cells to function the way they're supposed to. You are the commander of your own ship, and no one can penetrate it except God's love. Sylvia concludes the program by engaging in a lively question-and-answer session with the audience on a variety of topics.",
