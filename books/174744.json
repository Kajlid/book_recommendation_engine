  "description": "Nikole Anders loves reading a good spy novel, but she certainly never expected her life to turn into one! Nikole just wants to get through her senior year of high school in Washington DC. To say that Nikole has low expectations for her senior year would be an understatement. Then again, Nikole never counted on Daniel showing up and completely catching her off guard. After a nasty breakup, Nikole isn't sure she's ready to open herself up to someone else. But when she learns more about Daniel and why he's here, she realizes she may not be able to help herself.",
