  "description": "To say I'm having a rough century would be a vast understatement. I'm on the run, plagued by visions of death, and forced to rely on the man who killed my husband. Yeah, my life is just peachy. But when the truth shakes out, I find that maybe Rhys didn't ruin my life those many years ago. Maybe he saved it. Now, it's my turn to save us both.",
