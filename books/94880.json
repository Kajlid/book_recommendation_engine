Told from a fresh, personal perspective, these stories and poems form a warm, inspiring collection of remembrances of children,Christmas, marriage, trials, friendship, the seasons, grace, and above all, Godâ€™s love for us. Things Pondered proves Beth Moore not only to be an effective speaker and author of popular Bible studies, but also show her to be a gifted, sensitive writer and poet.",
