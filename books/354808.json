  "description": "Mary Beard's blog A Don's Life has been running on the Times website since 2006. In it she has made her name as a wickedly subversive commentator on the world in which we live. Her central themes are the classics, universities and teaching—and much else besides. What are academics for? Who was the first African Roman emperor? Looting—ancient and modern. Are modern exams easier? Keep Lesbos for the Lesbians. Did St Valentine exist? What made the Romans laugh? That is just a small taste of this selection (and some of the choicer responses) which will inform, occasionally provoke and cannot fail to entertain.",
