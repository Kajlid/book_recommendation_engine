  "title": "Floyd's India: The Book of the Hit Channel 5 TV Series",
  "description": "This title accompanies the eight-part television series for Channel 5 of the same name. In the series, Keith Floyd turns his attention to the remarkable continent of India, traveling throughout the country, comparing and contrasting the different food styles. The book depicts his journey from the green hill stations in the north of the country, through the bustling markets of Delhi, Calcutta and Madras, to the lush rice fields of the south. He cools off in the sparkling waters of the Indian Ocean and takes tiffin with sari-clad memsahibs. He uses the local specialities - the spices, mustard greens, dals, ghee, lotus seeds, almonds, and paneer - to create pasandas, kormas, koftas, bhajiyas, and all manner of spicy curries. Throughout his travels, Floyd meets the local people, shops in local markets and cooks according to local customs.",
