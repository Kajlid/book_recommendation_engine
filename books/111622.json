  "description": "At twenty-four years old, Kali Lockton struggles to find her place not only in her own world, but also a world she unavoidably resides in while dreaming. Throughout her life, she had to deal with her visions alone; that is, until she meets a handsome detective, Jared Miles. Not only does he believe her and offer to help prevent her visions from becoming real, he also knows a thing or two about her incomprehensible dreams. Consequently, she reaches the crossroads between discovery and acceptance of things she never imagined possible.When her own demise becomes the central focus of her dreams, she struggles with the courage to tell Jared. Once she resigns herself to desperation and vulnerability, she discovers things are far more abstruse than anything she could have ever prepared for. What scares her most, however, is releasing her suppressed feelings for a man she feels certain would never return her affections, a man who's not even human.",
