  "description": "In eighteenth-century Scotland, Magda McClellan, eight months pregnant, is granted one wish from Auld Annie, a wise woman accused of witchcraft. But Magda declines to use her wish because she is perfectly happy; besides, she doesn't believe in witches. Little does she know how that refusal will forever change her life. In twenty-first-century New York, Maggie McDonald and her husband desperately want to have a child. While they wait for a procedure at a fertility clinic, a Scottish nurse named Annie promises to grant them a baby â€¦ if that's their wish. When Maggie awakens, she finds herself round with child in the eighteenth century and panics. Magda has also been catapulted through time, waking up in a hospital bed in New York and she's not pregnant anymore. When she goes home with a man who claims to be her husband, she searches for clues to the identity of this Maggie McDonald, whose body she now inhabits. Why is Magda here? And why is she no longer pregnant? As the two women become familiar with their new worlds, they find themselves on emotional paths of self-discovery but will they find the way home before it's too late?",
