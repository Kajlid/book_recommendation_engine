  "description": "Riddle in Stone’s unlikely hero holds the fate of humanity in his hands in this epic fantasy from the author of the Quests of the Kings Trilogy.   Pursued relentlessly by goblin hunters for the ancient secret he knows, Edmund, the stuttering librarian, fights back in this fast-paced sequel to Riddle in Stone.   Edmund’s old, boring life is gone forever. Knowing the answer to a cryptic riddle that, if in the wrong hands, could destroy all of humanity, Edmund is hiding in a sleepy coastal town as far from the frozen mountains of the Undead King as possible. For a moment, he believes he’s finally safe. Then he learns that Molly, the woman he’s loved since childhood, is telling stories about him—stories that will get him and his friends killed. Edmund is forced to embark on a perilous journey home to confront the woman who broke his heart. If he fails, all will be lost.   “If there’s one fantastic thing about Evert’s atypical hero, its been Edmund’s journey from middle-aged, stuttering, self-doubting librarian to middle-aged, stuttering, one-eyed survivor who’ll risk his life to keep even a troll from standing in his way or hurting those he cares about.” —The BiblioSanctum",
