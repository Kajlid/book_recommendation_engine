  "title": "Camp: Queer Aesthetics and the Performing Subject â€“ A Reader",
  "description": "Camp: Queer Aesthetics and the Performing Subject addresses the multi-layered issue of camp, whose inexhaustible breadth of reference and theoretical relevance to the issues taken up by academic research in recent years have made it one of the most salient and challenging issues on the contemporary critical stage. Reassessing the role and significance of the finest essays on camp written by leading intellectuals in cultural studies, lesbian and gay studies, and queer theory, this critical anthology simultaneously 'queers' camp as an issue and offers an excellent key to rethinking the history, theory and practice of camp.",
