  "title": "Miss Kopp's Midnight Confessions",
  "description": "The bestselling author of Girl Waits with Gun brings the real-life escapades of the famous crime-fighting Kopp sisters to life in this extraordinary novel that is \"perfect for book groups\" ( Booklist ). Deputy sheriff Constance Kopp stands up to the “morality” laws of 1916, defending the independent young women in her prison against dubious charges when no one else will. From the patriotic Edna Heustis, who left home to work in a munitions factory, to the sixteen-year-old runaway Minnie Davis, these and other publicly shamed women who were packed off to a state-run reformatory find an unlikely ally in Constance, who uses her authority ― and occasionally exceeds it ― to investigate and defend them at all costs. But it's Constance's sister Fleurette who forces her to reckon with her own ideas of how a young woman should and shouldn't behave. Set against the backdrop of World War I, and drawn from true characters and events, this novel is timeless in its themes of justice and equality, and is sure to delight fans of historical and detective fiction alike.",
