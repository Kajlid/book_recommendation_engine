  "description": "Four months have passed since seventeen-year-old Hayden Wilson was forced to move to California and leave her life behind. Now she’s finally back home and ready for a fresh start, hoping to move on and leave the past were it belongs. But no one has forgotten what happened before the Summer, and all eyes are on her: someone seeks revenge, someone wants answers, and someone needs her gone for good. Thrown back in the midst of family problems, peer pressure, and unresolved issues, everyone is waiting for her to make the first wrong move. But this time she's stronger. Or so she believes. “Before we were broken” is the second book in the “Before” series, a young-adult coming of age novel.",
