  "description": "Victorian Boston is full of proper etiquette, sweet innocence and cold marriage beds. Newly widowed, Lynette Edwardmoore views another round of socially dictated marriage less than appealing.Nigel Spencer is the one man who might just change her mind. On the surface, he is polished and practiced in the gentlemanly arts but there is something lurking in his eyes that tells a much different story.Dark whispers of forbidden pleasures fuel a growing need to escape the strict dictates of her chaperones. It is a dangerous pursuit to discover what happens in those rooms where society loses its hold and nature takes over.In a sensual, highly erotic journey, Nigel opens Lynette's eyes to the pleasures to be found in sharing, where watching your partner receive pleasure at the hands of another is a scintillating pleasure few are brave enough to experience.As his lover, and perhaps as his wife, Nigel will offer Lynette a world full of erotic experiences. He has but one first and last, Lynette will always be his. If she is brave enough to say yesâ€¦ This tale features scenes with multiple partners, shared partners, spanking, and voyeurism. Not for the faint at heart, but definitely for those who want to raise their heartrate!",
