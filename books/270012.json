  "description": "Evil hides in many places and takes many forms. For indie author Frank Stewart it came to him as a child and guided him through life. Hidden away in a dust filled room deep within his brain. Watching, waiting, and guiding Frankâ€™s hands across the keyboard. Only when the lines of reality and fiction blur will the truth come out. Is it coincidence or is Frank foretelling the victims doom in his books",
