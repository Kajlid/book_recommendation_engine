  "description": "The system has been changing, the Agency flaunts its cruel practises and the balance of the realms is disrupted. Ethan’s enforcers are already stretched to the limits with policing the realms, and things get worse when partnerships develop between the worst of the Demon realms.Meanwhile on Empustat, Carolyn has spent an entire year being pampered and ‘reconditioned’, her memories wiped and replaced to produce a limited and vapid Princess. Under the constraints of the Chief, she is no longer the feared and mythical destroyer. Carolyn lives a life of privilege, expected to marry her father’s second in command and produce heirs for the realm. Her friend Mario, in contrast, has suffered hardship and humiliation at the hands of the Lilim Guard - A chance encounter between the pair is surely a step towards Carolyn’s awakening.The disabled gateway has frustrated the team’s efforts to reach Carolyn, and Ethan can barely suffer Note’s presence, but both mage and demon share the same goals. Hope rekindles by way of an unexpected source which leads to the team embarking on a plan so daring that that their survival hangs in the balance. With old and new friends from the realms, bias and loyalties will be challenged as the fight for order truly begins.",
