  "description": "This is the first volume of the long-awaited new horror manga series from the critically acclaimed creator of Uzumaki. The young couple Tadashi and Kaori are vacationing in Okinawa, but instead of enjoying their time, they bicker endlessly about such insignificant topics as Tadashi's bad breath. The source of the stench, though, may actually be something quite different. When a strange walking fish appears, Tadashi and Kaori know something's amiss. And when a Great White Shark attacks — again, walking — their mundane complaints quickly pale in comparison.",
