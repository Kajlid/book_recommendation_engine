  "title": "The John Franklin Bardin Omnibus",
  "description": "Between 1946 and 1948 John Franklin Bardin produced three quite extraordinary novels, all distinguished by a hallucinatory intensity of feeling and an absorption in morbid psychology remarkable for the period. The Deadly Percheron, The Last of Philip Banter and Devil Take the Blue-Tail Fly are unlike anything else in modern crime literature.For the first time all three have been gathered together in a single volume, and at long last reintroduce the work of a great and original writer.",
