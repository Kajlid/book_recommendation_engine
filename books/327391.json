  "description": "HER BADASS BIKERS is a contemporary standalone steamy MMMFMM reverse harem with over 112K words and a slight reverse age gap that has medium and slowburn elements, some humour and even though it's an overall feel-good read, it doesn't lack depth and dark elements. There are some unforeseen twists and turns, humour, elements of suspense and hot scenes that will make your panties go up in smoke. The book centres around a mature woman in her early 40s who is building a relationship with four bikers from Hawaii's most infamous biker gang, the Makani MC in Honolulu. Meet Jax, Liam, Mace and Snubbs, four badass younger men who are members of the Makani MC, throw in a psychopathic villain, a SWAT team at a hospital and two teenagers that keep everyone on their toes and you're just skimming the surface.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐A contemporary reverse harem that swept me off my feet.With bikers as badass as it gets, a lovely, smart and no-shit taking woman and an absolutely adorable 12 year old whom you can't help but love. Among others, that is. But I won't spoil and tell you more. For now.- The Magic Book Corner, International Book Blogger",
