  "description": "János Pilinszky is Hungary's most distinguished contemporary poet. He has twice appeared at the Poetry International festival in London; his `Selected Poems' in English versions by Ted Hughes and János Csokits was published in 1976. The poems of `Crater', written during 1974-5, show a development from his earlier poetry in the use of freer forms and a plainer style, while his central moral concerns remain as urgent. These are intense, harsh and moving poems.",
