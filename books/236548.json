What starts off innocently told through the voice of a 12 year old girl (Beatie Scareli) is the story of how the young girl tries to make sense of her life through a nickelodeon view of the world.At the same time a woman watches the young girl's past on her television. The story soon turns and twists until everything about the girl and her family becomes darkly connected to what becomes reality and fiction.",
