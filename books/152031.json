  "description": "In Tucson, twenty years ago, a psychopath named Andrew Carlisle brought blood and terror into the home of Diana Ladd Walker and her family. When Carlisle died in prison, Diana and her husband, ex-county sheriff Brandon Walker, believed their long nightmare was finally over. They were wrong. Their beloved adopted daughter Lani has vanished -- a beautiful Native American teenager destined, according to Tohono O'othham legend, to become a woman of great spiritual power. A serial killer is dead, but his malevolence lives on in another - and now the fiend holds Lani's innocent life in his eager hands. Before he snuffs it out completely, he intends to make his young prisoner -- and, more importantly, her parents -- suffer a slow and agonizing torture. For only this will avenge his friend and mentor, his dark god, Andrew Carlisle.",
