  "description": "Please note that this is the THIRD book in the War of Contractia.  Peter must defeat the most devious of foes to protect his friends, but he cannot do so alone. He will need to rely on a small group of comrades and on the advice of an ally with far more experience than he has. His own talent and power will however still prove vital.  Yu Kii, the former miko (shrine maiden) of the Kuroneko has adjusted to her life in Contractia, but those she left behind must continue their duties. Meanwhile Yu Kii and her classmates will go much further afield than just the academy. As she does so you will learn more about both Yu Kii and Contractia itself.  Please note that this series is unsuitable for young children mostly due to violent content and occasional (non explicit) references to matters of a romantic nature. There are also very rare innocent but compromising situations.",
