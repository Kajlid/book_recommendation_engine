  "description": "We all love spending a day off work and eating obscene amounts of food on our favorite holidays, but do you know the stories behind these special days? Join me as we take a journey through history and learn how our traditions came to be. Your mind will swell with knowledge as you learn things like how the customs of Halloween spur from a despicable dentist looking to make money by rotting the teeth of children, or how Hanukkah celebrates the unexpectedly decent career of Adam Sandler. You will bask in glorious wisdom while you discover how the Romans celebrated the new year by having drunken orgies, and how Cinco de Mayo was born thanks to hot dogs and an inept French cook.  You will learn all this and more within the pages of this informational text, A Celebration of the History of Celebrating History.",
