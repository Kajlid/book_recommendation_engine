  "description": "Jason Zurk is a werewolf with a soul mate named Oz, but he doesn’t want her anywhere near him. Jason yearns to give his love, and even his life, to Ashley, the vampire-dragon hybrid. Ashley barely survives on the wisp of a hope. She dreams that her own soul mate, Verloren, will somehow return from the dead. In “Phantom” C.V. Hunt completes her trilogy with a story of the fruits and frustrations of true love in an underworld of misfits. How do traditions of marriage, family, and commitment work in a world of violence and blood? How do the world’s monsters find true happiness? Where do children fit in a life where all grownups are misfits?",
