  "description": "An ancient enemy with a billion starships and a trillion soldiers is about to invade our universe‭!  A Forerunner artifact‭ ‬the size of a planet‭ ‬drifts in hyperspace.‭ ‬It‭ ‬has mysteriously gone online,‭ ‬opening a rip between space-time continuums.‭ ‬A monstrous‭ ‬race older than the stones of Earth is‭ ‬pouring through,‭ ‬planning to eradicate all life not‭ ‬its own.  The aliens‭ ‬in our spiral arm‭ ‬of the Milky Way Galaxy are in terror of the invaders.‭ ‬They want‭ ‬to use‭ ‬human‭ ‬assault troopers as ground-pounders in a suicide mission to save our universe.‭ ‬Humans are little better than beasts anyway,‭ ‬although the‭ ‬aliens‭ ‬know they can fight like hell.‭ ‬Let the unpredictable Earthlings do the dirty work and battle down to the center of the portal planet:‭ ‬closing the‭ ‬rip.‭ ‬It‭’‬s a commando raid where no one comes back,‭ ‬and good riddance to them.  Creed understands this is a screw job.‭ ‬He‭’‬s dealt with these‭ ‬aliens‭ ‬before and‭ ‬beaten them at their own game.‭ ‬But the stakes are desperately high and the‭ ‬extraterrestrials‭ ‬have threatened all humanity if he refuses to stop the monstrous invaders.‭ ‬So be it.‭ ‬Creed‭ ‬has an idea,‭ ‬a‭ ‬crazy plan,‭ ‬and if he‭’‬s right‭…‬every alien that ever lived‭—‬in this universe and the next‭—‬will curse the day they messed with Earth.",
