Now she has to deal with coming to her school as a new person, and when she’s partnered with Josh in Writer’s Craft, she finds herself developing maybe a little bit of an enormous crush.Everyone just wants to make it out of high school in one piece, but Josh and Kiki’s last year might not be so simple.Victory Lap is an own voices novel about taking the time to find yourself, even when the rest of the world screams for you to get a move on.",
