  "description": "Turning thirty and surrounded by married couples, Bethany Parks does something she never thought she'd tryâ€”reality TV dating. Although finding love would be nice, she's mostly looking for a fun distraction. Bethany thinks she's prepared for aggressive cameras and competitive flirting, but this is a show like no other. The provided wardrobe is a collection of the worst fashion trends of all time, and even more disturbing, they've brought on everyone's exes, including Todd, her most recent dating mistake. He's the last person in the world she wants to mingle with while sporting 'mom' jeans. Things aren't all bad. Her new buddy Tyson has her back, and Bethany can't keep her eyes off the gorgeous and mysterious Carter. She knows right away she'll have to protect her heart, because on a show like this, the worst thing might actually be falling in love.",
