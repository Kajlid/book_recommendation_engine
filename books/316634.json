  "description": "I never asked to be a witch, but as careers go, at least it comes with magical perks.Who knew a person could almost die from drinking? I found out the hard way when I woke up in a hospital and a nurse informed me I was legally dead for a few minutes. Shocking, but not as much as the fact I returned different.I can see things, but it’s what I can do that has people interested in me.There’s Sonja, a strange woman with powers who appoints herself my teacher.Anakin, the mysterious and super hot dude, who owns a pastry shop of all things catering to weird folk.Leslie, my furry-tailed coworker and only friend.And then there’s the bad guys determined to get their grubby hands on me.I’m not special. Just a woman trying to clean up her life and actually plan for a future. Will I have time to atone for my many sins before my luck runs out?",
