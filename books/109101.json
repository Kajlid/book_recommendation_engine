This book accomplishes what many media accounts, newspaper articles, magazine treatments, and movies have tried and failed to get into the minds of the men and women who are responsible for more lives in an hour than most surgeons are in a lifetime. 'TRACON' is a fictionalized account so accurate and chilling in its realism that it strikes people in the aviation business as a narrative summary of actual events.” — JOHN S. CARR, PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLERS ASSOCIATION",
