  "title": "ADVENTURES ON THE ASTRAL PLANE (PLAIN): ROGER CAT IS BACK IN CRAZY ADVENTURES OVER DIMENSIONS AND SPACE/TIME",
  "description": "A log of Roger Cat's travels through space/time & other dimensions comically, cosmetically and cosmically in his daily perennial quest for fresh mice, the answer to question TWO, and business on behalf of The BOSS in Moronococonut. If you work at CERN, sorry. Roger is way in front, but can leave a mouse tail as a gift for you next to his other present behind the door. Using the uptodate Fiery make travel portal and Fielder make protective shroud, Roger goes anywhere he is sent by The BOSS in space/time across dimensions at the speed of cosmic belching after a substantial galactic meal. NO- REALLY. This is happening now. In Basingstoke. In a cardboard box. On a roundabout. Read all about Roger's adventures in the first of a series of 33 logs of his travels before the second of the series arrives with some possible confusion of you don't read the first before and fail to understand the universal MM-MM language fully in creosote. Written by Ulrik Yzceniaplaus partly whilst treading the carpet of his PAPIER MACHE apartment with parsnip pulp, brown sugar and armpit yeast in the proto-russik tradition for that genuine horizontal home-brewed flavour.",
