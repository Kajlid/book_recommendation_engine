Every letter in the alphabet is represented in Bunny's journey, through what he eats (Greens), to whom he meets (Insects, Jay, Kitten, Lizard), and then a little sleep (Nap), to Tripping back to town, right side Up and Up-side-down.\" The creation of The ABC Bunny was a Gag family affair, with sister Flavia composing the \"ABC Song,\" included in this faithful edition; brother Howard penning the lettering; and Wanda writing and illustrating the story.",
