  "title": "The Moon Riders",
  "description": "Myrina has prepared for thirteen years to join the Moon Riders—learning the sacred dances, the art of using a weapon, and listening to her mother and grandmother's tales of their time spent with the Moon-maidens. Finally, the day arrives when she will leave her family and devote herself to the Old Woman, Atisha, and her tribe of fearless young warriors. No sooner do Myrina and the Riders leave camp when a stowaway is Cassandra, the troubled young princess of Troy. Myrina is skeptical of Cassandra's \"visions\" of death and destruction in Troy; and yet when her predictions begin to come true, she and the other Moon Riders have no choice but to get involved. The events that unfold as the Trojan War wages on will affect Myrina, Cassandra, and the Moon Riders in unimaginable, unforgettable ways. Acclaimed British author Theresa Tomlinson expertly brings to life the legend of the Amazons and sets it against a backdrop of one of the most mythic, imagination-inspiring battles in all of history.",
