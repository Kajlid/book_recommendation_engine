  "description": "They’re not saying I’m a gold-digger.  But they’re thinking it. And let’s be honest, some of them are probably saying it too. But I don’t run. Where I came from isn’t where I’m going. They won’t make it easy, I know that. And the most popular boys at Northlake Prep — the Diamonds — they don’t just want me gone. They want me destroyed. Child-star that’s all grown up. Trust-fund brat without a conscience. Mischievous twins who are the entitled sons of rock royalty. All of them are out to get me. Unless, I get them first. The game is on.  *****",
