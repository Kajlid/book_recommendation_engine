  "description": "Chad is a detective in a college town plagued by a serial killer who is targeting gay couples in BDSM relationships. His chief asks the handsome young officer to pose as the submissive partner in one such relationship to attract the killer. The Dom, a gorgeous college professor agrees to the charade, but warns Chad he will have to strictly obey him when they play in the clubs, or when they interact with his friends at his home. His friends know him to be a strong, experienced Dom and won't be fooled easily. In order to pull it off, Chad will have to be trained properly, and this will challenge all he knows about himself. As his barriers break down and he finds out what it means to be submissive, he learns to love his place at his Dom's feet, not realizing he's attracting the notice of a savage killer.",
