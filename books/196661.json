  "title": "I Was With Patton: First-Person Accounts of WWII In George S. Patton's Command",
  "description": "Ask a silver-haired veteran of World War II his branch of service and where he served, and hell reply, \"Navys Atlantic Fleet.\" \"Marine in the South Pacific.\" \"Army Air Force based in Italy.\" If this man is a Gl veteran of North Africa, Sicily, or the Third Army in Europe, however, his response will be a terse, \"I was with Patton.\" General George S. Patton was a larger-than-life figure whose genius for mechanized warfare and relentless pursuit of the enemy made him one of the great commanders of World War II. This coupled with his swaggering self-confidence, insufferable brashness, penchant for profanity, explosive temper, countless eccentricities, and uncanny talent for exasperating his superiors, made Patton a legend. What was it like serving under this unforgettable general? I Was With Patton uncovers the stories of the brave men and women who knew him, worked with him, fought for him, and gave their lives for him. Ranging from the humorous to the horrific, this fascinating book is a remarkable, one-of-a-kind collection of remembrances and anecdotes as told by the individuals who experienced World War II under Pattons command. Any soldier who served under the watch of General George S. Patton was shaped in his image and infused with his aggressiveness, sense of destiny, and pride. What Patton demanded of his troops and the results they achieved went beyond rational explanation. His extraordinary command and their exceptional performance set them apart, and they knew it. Inside are front-line accounts from soldiers who served under the legendary general whose hell-for-leather drive finally impaled Hitlers Germany and changed the world forever.",
