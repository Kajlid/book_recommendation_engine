  "description": "Sean Gage grew up full of hate and aggression, and losing his legs in a car accident has only made him more bitter. He was suicidal before the wreck, so now, with no legs? What the hell has he got to live for?The world has been much kinder to Paul Gill. He’s spent most of his life cushioned from harshness, first by his family, and then by his wealthy boyfriend. He knows he should stand on his own, but he can’t deny how much easier it is to just go along with their goals for him.When Sean comes to Paul’s clinic for physiotherapy, they clash. Paul’s a responsible professional, and Sean? Well, Sean’s an asshole. But as they work together on Sean’s rehabilitation, they discover that maybe they aren’t as different as they initially seem. Maybe Sean can teach Paul how to fight, and Paul can teach Sean that sometimes a fight isn’t necessary.",
