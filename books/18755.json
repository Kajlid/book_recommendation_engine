  "title": "Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation",
  "description": "In 1956, Ernest L. Norman presented a formal lesson course that was a basic introduction to the interdimensional Cosmos--all aspects of terrestrial and interdimensional life were incorporated in this lesson course. The advanced lesson course followed in 1960. These two lesson courses--now within this book--can most accurately be described as containing more information, knowledge, and wisdom than would be contained in any human precepts; answers are provided not only to today's puzzling questions in all sociologies and sciences but also to such imponderable questions on the nature of space, life on other planets, the infinite macrocosm and macrocosm, etc. Through the lecture courses the reader is introduced to principles and concepts that not only broaden one's mental horizon but actually give one a much better attunement with the higher self and a greater degree of inception of creative intelligence from the Infinite.",
