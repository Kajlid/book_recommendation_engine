  "title": "Breed of Love",
  "description": "Every story told weaves a path through various aspects of life, and the characters that it meets along the way. Every tale threads carefully around emotions and time, binding them all together.Our upcoming story, although tinged with dark and violent edges, begins with very different feelings; fear, hope … and love. These are the main stones on our path here, although it will not be as simple as I have just explained.An important question to think about here, call it a warning as well if you wish to, is this; what could happen when hope is presented to someone who has none, but then it is cruelly and mercilessly taken away? I'm afraid to say that the outcome is inevitable and dangerous; one of anger, pain, and a need that can never be quenched.Every second is henceforth consumed by the relentless attempts to regain that hope. To bring a sense of calm, of normality, of purity. It is a selfish quest, yet one that can have no diversions. Nothing else matters … nothing.When all of this is combined … when all of this occurs and it weaves and threads through and around emotions and time … they form something terrifying, something powerful … they create her.Breed of Love is a prequel to 'And the Statue Cried with Sadness' due for release 2013/ early 2014.",
