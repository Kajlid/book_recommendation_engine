  "description": "You're Only 6 Weeks Away From A Healthier Skinnier YOU! If you are like me, you HATE dieting. I just love my food too much, and fad diets are NOT the answer to serious weight loss. This book is all about burning calories, so you don't have to give up those delicious treats! I lost over 60 pounds using the techniques shown in this book...WITHOUT Dieting. In this book, I will discuss some tips and tricks of better food choices, but unlike restrictive diets, they are completely optional! Everything you need to start losing weight today is included in this book. Personal Note From The Author This book blends years of personal experience gained from my successes and failures. I show you my unique approach to running that took me from a complete couch potato to running 5K races with ease. I understand the challenges and frustrations of transitioning from being a complete non-runner because I went through it personally. I lost over 60 pounds, and I am in the best shape of my life due to the techniques used in this book. This is why I've put together this step-by-step guide to running for weight loss. I'm confident that the techniques I used to turn myself from an out of shape non-runner into a healthy, fit, and efficient runner will work for you as well! In an effort to provide my readers exceptional value, I also promise a response to all reader emails. All running related questions will be answered with a quick personal reply! I thoroughly hope you enjoy this book. Happy running! ~Michael",
