  "title": "All the Rage: Reasserting Radical Lesbian Feminism",
  "description": "Is sexuality political? Is it about identity? Is it about style or preference? These questions continue to be asked. Queer theory, sado-masochism, lesbian chic and lipstick lesbians were all the rage in the late 1980s popular culture. But these so-called glamorous trends were the superficial post-modern disguises of a patriarchal backlash against three decades of radical lesbian feminist advances. Unmasking and challenging the backlash the editors have gathered together seventeen passionate voices on sexuality, race and class, psychology, identity politics and lesbian existence. This anthology is essential reading in Women's Studies and anyone interested in gender critical theory. Contributors include, Julia Parnaby, Lynne Harne, Celia Kitzinger, Rachel Perkins, Sandra McNeill, Carol Reeves, Rachel Wingfield, Sue Wilkinson, Sheila Jeffreys, Elaine Miller, Elaine Hutton, Nicole Humberstone, Jill Radford, Rosemary Auchmuty, Audre Lorde, Janice Raymond, Julie Bindel.",
