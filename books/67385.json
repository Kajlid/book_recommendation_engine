  "description": "More than just a travel memoir, this book is a behind-the-scenes glimpse inside the antique book trade. Hurdling from one anecdote to the next, Bill Rees regales readers with his many adventures selling valuable books. From finding a first edition on a Parisian pub shelf to opening a store in Paris and trading rare titles with big names like Ian McEwan and Alan Sillitoe, this account is packed with amusing narrative. Driven by the joys and trials of the author's literary pursuit, the landscape of this quirky journey ranges from a small bookshop in Montpelier to a private library in Morocco, while the life path and story presented are a one-of-a-kind find.",
