  "description": "It was a day like any other on the ranch.Hard work and no play make for a cranky cowboy. Needing a night out on the town left me sneaking into my father’s house like a teenage boy. That was my first mistake of the day. The second was playing hero to a damsel in distress that turned out to be no damsel at all, but a sexy, snarky woman who took me by surprise.How you ask?I’d been a ladies’ man.That is until I became a father.My rebel days were gone. A six-year-old sassy daughter changed all that for me.I didn’t need the complicated, messy kind of love stuff. My hands were full.A mission into town to handle a family issue would make my life more muddled.The day I met the woman who would steal my heart.A thief.A woman on the run.A woman with one too many secrets.A woman who I had to save because if I didn’t, I feared she would disappear and take two hearts with her.I wasn’t prepared for the danger she was in and the decision I’d have to make.She’d hate me for sure.I definitely wasn’t prepared for her to leave.",
