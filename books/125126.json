  "description": "Truth. Pain. Freedom. An awakening like no other. When life is determined to buck you off, dig in and ride hard. The bull. The most dangerous lies are the ones we tell ourselves. To survive, I have to face the truth. Easier said than done when it’s not all black and white. There’s the in-between, and this murky void is where I always tend to land. The horns. Lies don’t always hurt. My lies protected me, but when they are exposed and I can no longer outrun the many shades of truth, I’ll be in for one hell of a reckoning. The ride. From the outside, my life looks like one big adventure after another. But, there is no freedom in anarchy, and that’s the way I’ve lived my life. Until now. Until Ransom. Denver Dempsey was a slut for oblivion. Now, she’s a slut for love. And it’s that kind of thinking that got her in trouble in the first place. Ransom awakens Denver in ways she never imagined, but when her true feelings send her reeling, will they catapult her into the arms of Greer—her ex best-friend-with-benefits? After never loving anyone, herself included, she now loves two. One kept her alive. One teaches her how to live. If they didn’t both love her … if hearts weren’t bound to be broken, it would be the stuff dreams are made of.Will Denver remain locked up in the bullpen, or is she strong enough to open the chute and be freed?",
