But all my scars aren’t on the outside, and the ones inside whisper that a guy like him will never fall for a damaged girl like me. Turns out Wolfe is just as broken as I am. He might be a heartless player, but that won’t stop me from playing his game.Wolfe Rebel thinks she’s invisible, but I see her... even when she doesn’t want me to. Even when I wish I could get her out of my mind, because falling for her is a complication I can’t afford. My reputation proceeds me, but Rebel is a game changer. And if I get too close, I’m afraid she’ll see right through me. Behind the person who my family and teammates expect me to be, to the person who’s been keeping secrets. With every scorching touch, every unapologetic kiss, the rules change, and the truth unravels around us. If only we could go on living this lie, then I wouldn’t risk losing the only girl I’ve ever loved.",
