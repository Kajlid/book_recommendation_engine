  "description": "At the turn of the century in Nigeria's Niger Delta, gangs and secret cults in the guise of militants hijack the struggle for equity in the exploitation of the country's oil wealth. Tonpre, suave privileged son of a judge finds himself inexplorably drawn into the clutches of such a gang. In the beginning, he relishes his new role, blind to lingering questions on the morality of the deeds of his cult brothers. Tragedy will force him to query his and their motives, and pull all concerned into a deathly grip of intrigue, murder and heartbreak. In her latest novel, Jacqueline U. Agweh wields the powers of a Amsterdam of the thriller genre to bring to her reader a satisfying story of her country's struggle with inequality.",
