It looks more like hospital visits, bloody noses, and cracked ribs.Isla Slade now works as a physiotherapist, helping athletes heal their bodies. Except for boxers. She has no interest in reliving the stress of her teen years. Dating someone in the boxing world? She’d rather snort wasabi powder.  Until she meets Preston Church. Preston manages heavyweight boxing darling Brick Kramarov. A brute who’s built tougher than his name, with a cocky attitude to boot. She wants nothing to do with either man, but her father begs her to help them prepare for a huge Vegas fight.She doesn’t expect Preston to recite romantic poems and slowly break her resolve. His fascinating mind gets under her skin, even if his star athlete reminds her how much she hates boxing. Too bad it’s Brick coaching Preston how to woo Isla, falling for her from the sidelines. Once she finds out, she’ll have to decide if she can risk loving another man who puts it all on the line for the knockout.Praise for THE KNOCKOUT RULEAN APPLE BOOKS BEST BOOKS OF THE MONTH!!“These characters are so full of passion and heart—their romance is what happily-ever-afters are made of.” ~ USA Today bestselling author Brenda St. John Brown\"Smart, sexy, full of depth with ample humorous moments, The Knockout Rule is a knockout of a book!\" ~ author Meredith Schorr\"An addictive binge read romance!\" ~ Doing it by the Book\"The Knockout Rule is raw, addictive, and soul-touching.\" ~ Unofficial Book Addict",
