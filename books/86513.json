This book is about those 120 individuals who, for more than 2,000 years, have created the works that have enhanced the human existence. It provides but a brief look into the often fascinating lives of those writers, attempting to provide a slight insight into who they really were, which is more than a name on a cover. Join us for a journey through the ages and into the pages, as we peek into the elite club of some of the most creative individuals to ever commit words to paper; The Classis Authors.",
