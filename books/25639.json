  "description": "Last night, I met the funniest, sexiest single dad on the planet.I also managed to get into the kind of co-ed naked trouble with him that involved a nurse, a shotgun, a feral turkey, and a pair of pliers. But all's well that ends well, and we already have plans to meet up again.It's early days, but I'm already thinking Drew might be The One.Then I show up to my new nanny gig and who steps out on the front porch, holding the cutest little redhead in the world?Yep, that's right. Drew is Andrew McGuire, my new boss, and he's not about to date the nanny. His daughter's happiness and stability are his top priority.Considering I just fell in love with this precious, motherless girl at first sight, I would be inclined to agree with him. If it weren't for one thing—my heart already has a Drew-shaped hole in it.I'm pretty sure I would miss him, even if we'd never met.But how to convince this amazing man that his heart—and his family—are safe with me? And that he should be my boss with benefits? Forever.Welcome to Bad Dog where the men are incredible, the animals are ridiculous, and the happy ever afters are super emotional and steamy! Boss Without Benefits is a standalone romance with spice!",
