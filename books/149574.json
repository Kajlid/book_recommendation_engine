  "title": "Orville Nix: The Missing JFK Assassination Film",
  "description": "The Nix film is the \"other\" film of the JFK Assassination. Known for years as the \"conspiracy film\", the Orville Nix film was taken from the opposite side of the more famous Zapruder film. Though many copies exist, the camera original film is missing. Why? Could the film prove there was a conspiracy to kill the 35th president? Or could it prove that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone? This book is the unflinching true story of an ordinary man, Orville Nix, swept up in an extraordinary event.",
