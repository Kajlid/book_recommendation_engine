  "description": "As the Heir Second of a multi-planetary empire, raised with proper Imperial paranoia, unable to trust anyone outside of his family, Prince Phillip Sinclair has no one he can truly call a friend, much less a lady to trust with his love. A medical emergency finds him meeting Alex Guinard, a no-nonsense, intellectually astute and emotionally troubled medic with many of the same problems and interests, including the love of a good fight and a pure dedication to the Service.Phillip and Alex become responsible for creating a sociological phenomenon that inspires the Royalty of the Sinclair Demesnes to hone their defensive skills and unite in a society of Fight Brothers. Although Alex is Low Royal, as he becomes more involved in the Imperial Family through his friendship with Phillip and romance with Sophia, he starts a game which results in Phillip finding the lady of his dreams. Talk about the best friend a man could have, by God! Even the Fight Brothers get in on the action! The return of Crown Prince Zhaiden from his diplomatic tour heralds an era of conflict that leads to his divorce. Beyond grateful for Phillipâ€™s support, Zhaiden immerses himself in the Fight Club, for he had few opportunities for training, and none for associating with men of rank, for two years. Their honor weaves bonds of loyalty and trust as they support each other through romances, deaths, assassination attempts, and political minefields to represent a new society that takes the galaxy by storm. This futuristic romance is the third book of the seven-part To Be Sinclair series. The saga continues with FEALTY and its companion volume ROYALTY, which detail the romances and political struggles of the Prince Second and Crown Prince of the Sinclair Demesnes. A few scenes describe sexually explicit behavior.",
