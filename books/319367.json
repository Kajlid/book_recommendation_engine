  "description": "Who’s going to save my skin?My FBI training never prepared me for this.First I was abducted. Then I was locked in a cage. Now I’m standing on a stage, exposed and sweating, while a crowd of terrifying aliens bid for my ownership.And the ones who end up claiming me may be the scariest of all. These guys are like nothing I’ve seen before. Purple skin, retractable claws, and a serious aversion to shirts. Their bodies bulge with muscles, and their growls penetrate deep into my bones.Yesterday I was an Earth girl with a badge and a gun. Now I’m just a little human plaything for the aliens to share.I belong to them now. I belong to the Raksha...She was supposed to be a mission, nothing more.Our orders were simple. Scour the stars. Find a human. Bring it safely back to Rak.We had nearly given up hope. Then we found her.We Raksha are a jealous species. But when it comes to the human female, we must learn how to share. Her safety is too critical to be entrusted to a single warrior. Her needs run too deep for a single male to satisfy. And her stubbornness requires more discipline than a single hand can provide.She was supposed to be a mission, but soon she will be so much more.Soon she will be our mate...~Author's Note: This is a complete epic sci-fi romance with an HEA guaranteed! While it may be read as a standalone novel, there are important connections to characters and events in Book One (Alien Meat Market). Therefore, it is recommended to read the books in order for the best experience.",
