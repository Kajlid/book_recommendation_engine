  "description": "It was all true. All the stories with magic, mages and dragons – was all true. So why, if magic existed in stories and could be used by mages, is there no magic now? The answer is simple: the mages stole the magic from this land and used its power to create a new one. This new land was an island, Mornisle, set in the sea off the east coast of England. They drained the land of all magic and hid their new Isle behind a protective bubble, forged from magic and known as the Shield. No one knew the Isle was there; boats could pass by or through it, with no awareness of its presence. As the old world moved on and technologies advanced, planes could fly over it and satellites could scan the sea, but no trace of it would ever be seen, so strong was the magic protecting it. And it is still there today. Veyla has lived all her life on the east coast of England, always believing that she was born there, and was normal teenager. The day a stranger arrives and tells her the truth of her birth, her ancestry and her legacy, changes her life forever. She is a princess of one of the most powerful royal families on the Isle, brought to this world by her father in an attempt to protect her. But her father has disappeared, and so she returns to the place of her birth, with just her father’s groom as her guide. She must meet her family and overcome the centuries of mistrust of the Oldworld that has been bred into them; she must try to find out what has happened to her father; and, perhaps most important of all, she must find out why her father took her off the Isle in the first place.",
