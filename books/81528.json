  "description": "At nineteen John Banks decides to board a ship bound for America—oblivious of who he'll find when he arrives.Having grown up on a large indigo plantation, the expressive and possibly overdramatic, Carolina Ellis can hardly wait to see what the gentlemen of Charleston will be like. But alas, they were not what she'd been hoping for. Ball after ball and dance after dance, Carolina is disappointed time and again.Then she sees him...Boston and Philadelphia held no appeal to John, so on a suggestion from a friend, he headed south to the booming town of Charleston, South Carolina. Not meaning to become the center of attention, John becomes exactly that when he walks right into the largest social event of the year dressed like nothing more than a poor drifter.So what is a penniless man to do when in such a situation? The only thing he can do: rely on his sense of humor to extinguish the tension.Immediately, Carolina takes a shine to this unusual man and his equally unusual humor and is determined she will do whatever it takes to marry him—Southern aristocracy be damned.",
