  "description": "Private Investigator Van Trillo is also a ventriloquist. He uses his wooden partner, Sam Suede, to interrogate suspects. This tends to unnerve and disorient them, causing them to divulge information unwillingly and unwittingly. Trillo is about to leave England for his native New York City when he gets a desperate call for help from his old flame, the beautiful yet struggling English actress, Chloe Lake. She has received anonymous death threats, and is terrified. Trillo and Suede soon find themselves stranded with Chloe in an old, remote, creepy inn, located near the village of World's End, England. One by one, several of the various eccentric guests at the inn are murdered during the stormy night. Each of the surviving guests quickly becomes a suspect when possible motives are brought to light under Trillo and Suede's clever ventriloquial questioning. Through all this, Trillo is struggling with his suspicion that his ventriloquial skills have breathed life into Suede, who now seems able to talk without Trillo's assistance. Strangely, though, Suede only seems to do this when he and Trillo are alone. Will Trillo and Suede catch the crafty, mad and elusive murderer before they are murdered as well - and before Trillo goes totally mad himself?You can watch a four minute Intro Video to the Trillo & Suede characters here...http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkVlkI...",
