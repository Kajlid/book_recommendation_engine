  "description": "‘Heroic and absurd, scurrilous and profound, Who Killed Mister Moonlight? charts the descent of four intelligent young men with faces like rubyeyed dimestore skull rings into a glittering and very modern maelstrom. Fast, compelling, and disarmingly honest, this is an invaluable account of a strange and spectral cultural twilight era that we shall almost certainly never see again. Highly recommended.’ – Alan MooreBeginning with the creation of Bauhaus’s seminal debut hit 'Bela Lugosi’s Dead', David J. Haskins offers a no-holds-barred account of his band’s rapid rise to fame and glory in the late '70s, their sudden dissolution in the '80s, and their subsequent and often strained reunions. In between, he explores his work as a solo performer, and with acclaimed trio Love And Rockets culminating in the devastating fire that ripped through the sessions for their 1996 album Sweet F.A. He also delves deep into his exploration of the occult, drawing together a diverse cast of supporting characters, including William S. Burroughs, Alan Moore, Genesis P-Orridge, and Rick Rubin.Bristling with power and passion, music and magick, Who Killed Mister Moonlight? is a rock’n’roll memoir like no other. This revised and updated edition adds an extensive Bauhaus timeline, plus a selection of rare photographs not included in the original book.",
