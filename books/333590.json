They weren’t the only ones eager for my return, and by the time we found out, it was too late.I’m an Anchor, a damaged one that wields magic unlike any other female Changed. Despite that, the Conclave is determined to pair me with a ‘suitable’ Sept, meaning one that would solely be advantageous to them.But I refuse to be a pawn in their game. I will follow their rules for now, but once all the pieces align, I will soar like the phoenix I am named after.I am Ember, the Anchor for the Changed, and the fire within me will not be smothered.** Lost Ember Found is book one of a series and as such does end with a cliffhanger. It is a slow burn, medium build reverse harem novel, meaning the main character will not choose between love interests. There is sensitive content, please read the warning before starting the book. Your mental health is more important than pages read. **",
