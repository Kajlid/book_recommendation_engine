  "description": "By day, Mercy Thompson is a car mechanic in the sprawling Tri-Cities of Eastern Washington. By night, she explores her preternatural side. As a shape-shifter with some unusual talents, Mercy’s found herself maintaining a tenuous harmony between the human and the not-so-human on more than one occasion. This time she may get more than she bargained for.Marsilia, the local vampire queen, has learned that Mercy crossed her by slaying a member of her clan–and she’s out for blood. But since Mercy is protected from direct reprisal by the werewolf pack (and her close relationship with its sexy Alpha), it won’t be Mercy’s blood Marsilia is after.It’ll be her friends’.Adapted from the novel and produced with a full cast of actors, immersive sound effects and cinematic music!Performed by Khaya Fraites, Gregory Linington, Rayner Gabriel, John Kielty, Holly Adams, Christopher McLinden, Shanta Parasuraman, Jonathan David Bullock, Sheree Wichard, Kay Elúvian, Michael Glenn, Jon Vertullo, Taylor Coan, Steven Carpenter, Danielle Cohen, Todd Scofield, Andrew James Spooner, Bradley Foster Smith, Jonathan Sleep, Nanette Savard, Daniel Llaca, Lydia Kraniotis, Martin Dickinson, Steve Wannall, Eric Messner, RJ Bayley, Keith Richards, Jameson Hunt, Joey Sourlis, Mike Carnes, Renee Dorian, Elias Khalil, James Lewis, Laura C.
