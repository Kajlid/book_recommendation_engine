  "description": "On Sunday, Danny was asked to clean the basement of his new home.  By Friday, he was New York City's last, desperate hope against total nuclear annihilation.  That's a lot for one week, especially when it's also the first week of sixth grade.  Danny's amazing adventure is told by a mysterious Uncle who is babysitting his young nephew, Tommy. An otherwise ordinary eleven year old boy from Brooklyn, Danny discovers a long-lost secret formula that grants him incredible superhuman abilities. To Danny, this is the most awesome thing that has ever happened to anybody. But this ultimate dream-come-true begins to turn into a nightmare, as Danny must contend with well-connected class bullies, hostile media, and the sinister organization that is attempting to seize the formula for its own nefarious purposes. All this, while keeping his true identity safe from his annoying and nosy little sister! Will Danny have what it takes to overcome these challenges, as well as a terrorist threat that threatens to flatten Manhattan? Or will the forces arrayed against him prove too much for his inexperience to overcome? Find out, together with the spellbound Tommy. But there is one part of the story that the Uncle cannot reveal to his young nephew - and is left for the readers to discover on their own!",
