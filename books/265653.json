  "description": "\"I'm going to be a hippie. In Maine.\" Marie isn't sure what a hippie does, precisely, but she knows one thing; Her life is dull. It is no fun at all to be a divorced widow, or possibly a widowed divorcee, with kids who have left for college never to be seen and a job that pays well but isn't interesting anymore, if it ever was. Brody has worked as a chef in big cities all over the country, and it has left him with nothing but a bitter taste in his mouth and no life. Not sure what else to do, he moves home to a small town on the coast of Maine and takes over his uncle's worn down restaurant, hoping that things will improve. He isn't depressed. Not at all. He just doesn't remember how to laugh anymore. Waterfront Café is a story about a small community, a pink house, a few lobster subs, and two people looking for more, each trying to move on from something that wasn't bad. It just wasn't all that great.Please note: This book contains crude words and somewhat explicit adult scenes. If this isn't your thing, then this book might not be for you.",
