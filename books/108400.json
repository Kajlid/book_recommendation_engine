  "description": "Set in 1990s Southern California, \"Birds on a Wire\" explores the complexities of courage and secrets amongst three teenage boys - sons of Mexican immigrants, a generation of house painters and a single mom - as they head toward a heated confrontation. During the final seventy-two hours of junior year, Miguel wrestles with a decision to tell Jesse about his girlfriend's indiscretions while he harbors his own escapades from years prior, and Matt spies Ruby and Nate sharing a kiss in the library. Before Matt does anything, Ruby lets him know what she saw between him and the star basketball player. The boys don't realize Jesse already knows about Ruby, and he's headed for a breakdown with his uncle's drugs. Hoping to deflect Jesse's anger, Ruby tells him and Miguel all about Matt's encounter at the library. The two friends must come to terms with their own judgments and prejudices about love, friendship and loyalty. Ultimately, someone will die, someone's dream will end, and a new secret will spill out that threatens to break a bond forever. Mulholland explores the challenging path boys take into manhood and suggests how far they might go to protect the ones they love. \"Birds on a Wire\" takes the reader on a journey inside the passionate and self-doubting hearts of teenage boys.",
