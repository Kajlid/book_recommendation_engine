  "description": "Sixteen-year-old high school student Jocelyn loves blood; she lives for it. She's a blood addict. But that's not all that's going on in her life. Strange dreams haunt her sleep; she can read minds; and she hears voices in her head. And she discovers that J.B.--her twin sister--and their friends Sadie and Nikki all have similar powers. She learns that all of them a part of a group known as the Genetic Race. But their powers and existence are threatened by another group known as the Others, and their only hope lies in traveling to Transylvania, where they must locate a special blood-filled amulet. On this trip, with the help of the very attractive Adrian, Jocelyn will discover that the very substance she needs to survive may have become her new and very deadly addiction.How about a Sneak Peek from the Author?! :-FÂ I don't know this man's name, and it doesn't really matter... right? I mean he's just dinner. I was trying to find a reason to feel sorry for what I was about to do. Really, I searched and picked my way through his mind to try and find something that told me, \"I have something to live for!\" He hated his parents, and being an only child meant that there were no other siblings to miss his existence. It's not like his friends would blink an eye at him. They were never there for him, just for the latest parties and hook-ups. The only thing that was worth loving to him was his girlfriend, and to my knowledge, she was already being killed.",
