  "title": "The God Chasers: My Soul Follows Hard After Thee",
  "description": "What is a God Chaser? A God chaser is an individual who hunger exceeds his reach. A God chaser is a person whose passion for God's presence presses him to chase the impossible in hopes that the uncatchable might catch him. A child chases a loving parent until, suddenly, the strong arms of the father enfold the chaser. The pursuer becomes the captive; the pursued the captor. Paul put it this way: \"I chase after that I may catch that which apprehended me\" (Phil. 3:12). Job was a God chaser. He said, \" Oh that I knew where I might find Him!\" David was one; he said, \"My soul followeth hard after Thee.\" Paul was one too: \"That I may know Him....\" The passionate paths of God chasers can be traced across the pages of history from Moses the stutterer, David the singer, and Paul the itinerant preacher, to contemporaries like A.W. Tozer, Leonard Ravenhill, and countless others who share one common bond: an insatiable hunger to know their Lord. These are people who relentless, passionate pursuit of Christ often made them appear foolish in the eyes of others. Yet, having tasted His goodness and glimpsed the invisible, they could be satisfied with nothing less. \"I must warn you, this is a dangerous book. If you are comfortable and complacent and want to stay that way, don't even open its pages!\" -Cindy Jacobs, Co-founder, Generals of Intercession \"The God Chasers is not for the fainthearted but for those who, in pursuit of God, are willing to die in the process.\"-Ken Gott, Revival Now!, Sunderland, United Kingdom",
