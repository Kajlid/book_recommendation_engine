  "title": "Sub-Saharan Africa: Architectural Guide",
  "description": "Despite the growing interest in Africa, the continent’s built environment is still largely unfamiliar in many parts of the world. The seven volumes of the Sub-Saharan Africa Architectural Guide form the first comprehensive overview of architecture south of the Sahara that does justice to the region’s wealth of buildings. In 49 chapters, each focusing on one country, richly illustrated texts by more than 350 authors from Africa and across the globe come together to produce a superlative work. On the basis of 850 selected buildings and over 200 thematic articles, the continent’s building culture is elucidated and contextualised. The diverse contributions paint a multifaceted picture of Africa’s architecture in the twenty-first century, a discipline shaped by traditional and colonial roots as well as today’s global interconnections and challenges. An introductory volume on the history and theory of African architecture provides essential background knowledge.1 Introduction: History and Theory of African Architecture2 Western Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Sahel3 Western Africa along the Atlantic Ocean Coast4 Eastern Africa from the Sahel to the Horn of Africa5 Eastern Africa from the Great Lakes to the Indian Ocean6 Central Africa from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes7 Southern Africa between the Atlantic and Indian Oceans",
