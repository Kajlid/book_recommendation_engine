  "description": "\"I warn you that what you're starting to read is full of loose ends and unanswered questions....Now if you don't like that kind of story, I'm sorry, and you'd better not read it....\"\nOn a quiet fall evening in the small, peaceful town of Mill Valley, California, Dr. Miles Bennell discovered a horrifying, insidious plot. Subtly, silently, almost imperceptibly, alien life forms were taking over the bodies and minds of his friends and neighbors, the woman he lovedâ€”the world as he knew it. First published in 1955, this classic thriller about the triumph of the human spirit over an invisible enemy inspired two major motion pictures.",
