  "description": "Love or Finding Oneness in a Me-First World  by Sandy Meadows and Stan Wenck, Ed.D.The purpose of Love or Die is to urge you to discover your true self - your divine Self - and to allow it to shine through to enlighten your whole being. You will then KNOW beyond doubt your eternal worth, your essential wholeness. And you will realize you are connected with all that is. Love or Die raises our awareness to two false beliefs that contribute to so much of the suffering and violence in the world   the beliefs that 1) we are separate , and 2) we are incomplete .  Once the reader understands that every action he takes affects the Whole, since we are all connected as part of that Whole, he will realize that extinction awaits us if we continue to be self-indulgent at the expense of others or the environment. To destroy any part of nature is to destroy apart of ourselves!  We must awaken from our self-destructive ego  consciousness, move into higher levels of awareness, and begin functioning with cooperation rather than competition. Failing this, our quality of life will rapidly deteriorate, and humans will go the way of the dinosaurs. We must learn how to love or we will perish . This is the message most urgently needed at this time in our history.",
