  "description": "“No touching, beautiful. I warned you. Tonight, I’m only using my mouth.”As the NHL’s sexiest, surliest bad boy, Kyle “Henny” Henderson basically wrote the book on awkward morning-afters. But nothing prepares him for the hat trick of waking up naked, hungover, and hard as hell with his face between a luscious pair of breasts he doesn’t recognize…Because those soft, oh-so-lickable curves belong to his completely off-limits best friend.After a devastating breakup, Bex Canfield moved home to Buffalo to put her life back together, not cause another train wreck. But that was before. Before the hockey fight that led to Henny’s suspension that led to the tequila that led to… Oh, God.Bedroom? Trashed. Dignity? Obliterated. Best friend? He’s… wow. Seriously packing.Looks like last night was one to remember, but neither of them has a clue what happened. So maybe they should try it one more time—sober—just to get it out of their systems. Okay, two more. Three tops. Because nothing says train wreck like a wild, uninhibited, toe-curling, wall-banging sexcapade with your oldest friend… Except for maybe falling in love.Down to Puck is a hilarious best-friends-to-fuck-buddies-to-enemies-to-lovers standalone hockey romance that’s so hot, when it’s over, YOU’LL need a cigarette!",
