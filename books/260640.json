  "description": "Passover and Easter are pivotal events in Christianity that have divine connections. In Passover: The Story of Easter from the Beginning you'll be taken on a journey that explores the coherency of God's plan of redemption from creation to the resurrection. In a theologically rich, yet easy to read manner, the Passover and Easter will be traced through some familiar connections such as Abraham, Isaac, and the Exodus, to many less known connections such as Joshua, Rahab, and Ruth. The result is a deeper understanding of both the Passover and Easter that will lead to a sharpened view of redemption and its transformational nature.This perspective will enrich the redemption story that you think you know with new depth and appreciation. In essence, the goal is that “the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:7). Often we already have an understanding of the individual stories, but, when woven together as one, the complete story provides a new peace that transcends the parts",
