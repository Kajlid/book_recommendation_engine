  "description": "Miss Rachel Goldberg had no idea a knight in shining armor was about to enter her classroom. A Chicago firefighter was expected, an everyday city worker come to tell fourth graders all about his job in 30 minutes or less. But when Vic Koski lifts Rachel to demonstrate the firefighter's carry, she is--literally and figuratively--swept off her feet. Love leads to a happy marriage and home for just the two of them, but after a few years Rachel's inner clock begins to tick. As months go by, her longing for a child becomes a consuming passion. Though Rachel tries not to question God's plan for her life, the answer she receives from Him is one she could not have anticipated.",
