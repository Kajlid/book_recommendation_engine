Along the way, he clarifies the murky history of the war and the role that journalists played in altering its course.The Cat from HuÃ©i> has earned passionate acclaim from many of the most renowned journalists and writers about the war, as well as from military officers and war veterans, book reviewers, and readers. This book will stand with Michael Herr's Dispatches , Philip Caputo's A Rumor of War , and Neil Sheehan's A Bright, Shining Lie as one of the best books ever written about Vietnam-and about war generally.",
