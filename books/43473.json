  "description": "This fun-filled, action-packed, and apathy-busting novel is replete with a swirl of horror, humor, and insight into our darker cupboards and pantries. It isn't always the monster under the bed that we fear the most. But if it is, we certainly have a ton of them in Southern Fried Monster! The story is a hilarious and deliciously twisted exploration into the real horrors that scare us through the eyes of Guy Sayonara, a hapless paragon of mediocrity who has but one dream - to become a world famous chef. The only problem... well, aside from the fact that he is a hapless paragon of mediocrity, is the alien invasion – mustn’t forget that. Can a lovable \"average guy\" win the day? You will find out in the pages of Southern Fried Monster!",
