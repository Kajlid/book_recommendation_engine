  "description": "\"I love this book.\" —Lena DunhamEdgar and Lucy is a page-turning literary masterpiece—a stunning examination of family love and betrayal.

When Edgar meets a man with his own tragic story, the boy begins a journey into a secret wilderness where nothing is clear—not even the line between the living and the dead. In order to save her son, Lucy has no choice but to confront the demons of her past. Profound, shocking, and beautiful, Edgar and Lucy is a thrilling adventure and the unlikeliest of love stories.",
