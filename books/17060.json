  "description": "The dare should have been simple, but it turns into a life-altering journey. This inspiring book is deep investigative thinking, disguised as chic lit.In just one month, Willow transforms from routine-oriented postal worker to try-anything-once adventurer. “I dare you to spice up your life,” her best friend urges – so Willow complies, not realizing the ripple effect subtle changes create.A simple weblog listing her new activities quickly turns into an introspective exploration of who she is, where she’s going and the route she’s going to take. All her life, Willow has ambled without purpose, never straying from her chosen path. The moment Willow decides to take the stairs in her apartment building where she runs into Sawyer, the dreamy-man-voice, something in her psyche shifts. She is propelled into the adventure that is her own life with twists and turns that could only come from losing her inhibitions and making risky decisions.Each new event becomes a catalyst in the development of Willow’s relationships with her friends, co-workers, siblings and love interests. Forced to look beyond what is presented on the surface, she discovers the truth of what lurks below, including an unpleasant display of her own chaotic emotions. By the end of her month of new discoveries, Willow loses her indecisiveness, her inhibitions and most importantly gains self-confidence and self-respect.",
