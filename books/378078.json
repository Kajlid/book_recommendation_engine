  "title": "Gladys Aylward: The Little Woman",
  "description": "A solitary woman. A foreign country. An unknown language. An impossible dream? No, God's call on the life of Gladys Aylward. With no mission board to support or guide her and less than ten dollars in her pocket, Gladys Aylward left her home in England to answer God's call to take the message of the gospel to China. With the Sino-Japanese War waging around her, she struggled to bring the basics of life and the fullness of God to orphaned children. Time after time, God triumphed over impossible situations, and drew people to Himself. The Little Woman tells the story of one woman's determination to serve God at any cost. With God all things are possible!",
