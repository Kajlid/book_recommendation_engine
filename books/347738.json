  "description": "The Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors (CCC0) is in the business of peacemaking. It provides essential information for young men and women who become conscientious objectors after enlisting in the armed services, and it serves as a resource center for young men who may have moral reservations about registering with Selective Service. The CCC0 also collaborates with other organizations to encourage nonviolence as an alternative to military confrontations. In 1987, at the height of the US involvement in several \"covert\" wars in Central America, the CCC) enlisted some of the nations best comix authors and artists to produce a volume that would tell the stories of Vietnam veterans who'd been traumatized their war experiences, enlisted personnel in the services who'd successfully sought CO status, and civilians victimized by US-funded Central American dictatorships. The result was this masterfully drawn and written volume, Real War Stories. \"The Elite of the Fleet,\" the narrative of an African American Navy CO by Mike W. Barr.
