  "description": "'All right, I will share my deepest, darkest secret. I loved my father... like sons love their fathers, I loved mine too. And aren't sons forever following their father's footsteps? Even if those footsteps are blighted...?\"After Umer's father leaves to join the jihadis, the family is pushed to the brink of poverty and desperation, but his mother will have nothing to do with her husband. The government and charities working in Kashmir, in their better wisdom, believe it is best not to offer sustenance to the children and the widow's of militants. Isolated by society and trapped in adversity: will the mother's determination to turn her back on violence crumble? Will Umer go his father's way? What choices will the family make?Weed, a follow-up of the award winning No Gun at My Son's Funeral, is a hard-hitting exploration of uneasy questions that keep raising their insistent heads in the 'war against terror'. Complex issues are examined through the innocence of a child caught in a web he never spun.",
