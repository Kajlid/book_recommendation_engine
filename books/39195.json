  "description": "The world's most elite counter-terrorist operators....A cyber-security guru suddenly getting shot at and blown up rather more than usual....And nuclear-armed terrorists rolling with impunity through a lawless and brutal virtual world....The year is now. Islamist terrorists hack into America's most sensitive defense networks, launch chemical weapons attacks on Western cities, and stage a raid on vulnerable nuclear weapons storage facilities in Pakistan. They are using a massively multiplayer online video game (or \"virtual world\") as a platform for planning and rehearsing their attacks - forcing a squad of supremely elite Delta Force operators (reinforced by an info-security expert from the Department of Homeland Security) to go inside the game to fight them.But the fight only begins there. Get ready for breath-stealing action in every known battle space - clockwork urban safehouse takedowns, combat helicopter assaults, brutal ambushes in the trackless mountains, waterborne SEAL team ops, precision close-quarters battle sequences, and CheyTac Intervention sniper rifle systems that can kill you from a mile and a half away.These weapons, tactics, tech, and 21st-century warriors will be unlike anything you've ever heard of before.",
