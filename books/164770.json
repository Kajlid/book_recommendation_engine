  "title": "Shivers for Christmas: An Anthology of Crime, Mystery and Horror Stories",
  "description": "Long winter nights are the perfect setting for horror, crime and mystery stories: the crackling fire, the wind in the trees, a softly sleeping neighbourhood. With content from some of the finest writers - including Arthur Conan Doyle, Wilkie Collins, and the undisputed master of the Christmas Eve chiller, M R James himself - this chilling anthology peeks behind the curtain of the festive season to surprise, entertain and unnerve.",
