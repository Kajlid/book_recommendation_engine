  "title": "Pregnant Mail Order Bride and her Brave Sheriff",
  "description": "Leaving an abusive husband is hard, but loving a new partner is harder…  Daughter of a woman of the Iroquois tribe and a white settler from New York, Kateri Hodges finds herself drowning in the debts of her abusive husband after he dies.  She feels like a broken woman. What decent man would want her?  Christopher Fellows is the new sheriff in town. He loves his work but longs for companionship, and a mail order catalogue with the picture of Kateri caught his attention.  Fate has it for Kateri and Christopher to come together, first as companions and then as something more…  Just when Kateri finally feels free, she realizes that she is carrying her late-husband’s child.  And little does Christopher know that his life is in danger, and now, so too is Kateri, from vengeful outlaws seeking to take out the sheriff.  Kateri will do whatever it takes to protect her unborn child. But can Sheriff Fellows offer his new family the protection they need?  Can these two very different people find their ways back to each other when they need one another most?",
