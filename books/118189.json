  "description": "Vincent made his fortune during the Great War. Wealthy, powerful, well-travelled and ruthless Vincent is a man who knows and gets what he wants. He's a business man whose only weakness is fine, racehorses, and his only interest is the acquisition of valuable commodities. Vincent isn't in the market for a new horse until a young salesman in Shanghai tells him about a special kind of racehorse for sale down in the depths of the foreboding and exotic pleasure district. Vincent is intrigued and finds himself drawn into the world of ponygirl training with his latest acquisition (a beautiful ponygirl he names Jade). The price is high for both pony and master, but the rewards are well worth it...in the end.",
