  "description": "Poetry. African American Studies. Drifting from New Mexico with lawman Elfego Baca to Ricardo Molinari's Buenos Aires all the way back to ancient Alexandria, GROUNDINGS offers an erudite and at times dizzying exploration of our mortal limits. Metaphysical in both content and manner of metaphor, these poems are in constant dialogue with the physical sciences, mathematics, and number theory. The result is a startling, quixotic, and truly original poetry.",
