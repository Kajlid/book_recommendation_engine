  "description": "When a man like Finn O'Grady wants something, no one, not even God, will deny him his desires.  FINN  I've wanted Aoife since the first time I heard her name. So Irish. So traditional. Then I saw her photo, and I had to have her.  In my world, a man like me is never denied, and Aoife's no different.  I'll have her in my bed, I'll make her want me, and when I'm done, that's it. Game over.  Well, that was the plan.  My curvy cail√≠n is as addictive as she is sweet. With more secrets than even me, she's a sinner's paradise, and I might just be willing to repent if it means keeping her in my bed.  For as long as we both shall live.  SCREW YOU is the 65k first part in A SCREWED duet.",
