  "description": "Harold Pinter has long been acknowledged as one of the most influential playwrights in contemporary theatre; his arresting and original works have left a lasting imprint on the development of the stage and screen while delighting audiences around the world. This, the first of four volumes, contains his first five plays, including The Birthday Party (1958), his first full-length drama; as well as two short storiesThe Black and White and The Examinationboth written before Pinter turned to the theatre. Pinter's exacting and complex use of language and the features that mark his \"comedies of menace\" are clearly realized in these plays and stories. His speech Writing for the Theatre introduces the volume and establishes the context for these early years.",
