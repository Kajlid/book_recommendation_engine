  "description": "Darlene Coopersmith, a twenty-one-year-old allergic to restraint, stupidity, and Cyndi Lauper, has had a horrible week, and it's only three days in. Good sense tells her the universe isn’t through with her, and right she is. At first, she thinks the horrendous itching, lapses in memory, and overall body’s-been-put-through-a-meat-grinder feeling is due to an illness, but her assumption couldn’t be farther from the truth. \tNo, according to Darlene’s sister and best friend, the reason for Darlene’s discomfort is the Change: a process Wers go through to shift between their two forms. The news floors her. She isn’t human, and the two closest people to her have known for years. Her trust shaken, Darlene can’t help but wonder what other secrets they’ve kept from her. \tAnd the secrets they have, especially Darlene’s sister, Mariah. When Mariah’s biggest secret rears its ugly head, everyone Darlene loves faces death. Like always, Darlene hurls herself into the danger, fists ready and thirsting for blood.",
