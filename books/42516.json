  "description": "According to Leanne Payne, there is if homosexuality is seen for what it really is, and is then dealt with in light of Scripture - as a condition to be repented of, forgiven, and healed through Christ. Written with the author's usual depth and compassion, this book brings a message of hope to those who suffer from homosexual neurosis and teaches those who minister to them how to pray effectively for their healing. Leanne Payne uncovers the root problems of homosexuality, reveals the major barriers to inner healing, and tells how healing prayer is the key to experiencing Christ's forgiveness and recovering a true sexual identity.",
