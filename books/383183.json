  "title": "Doctor Brodie's Report",
  "description": "At the age of seventy, after a gap of twenty years, Jorge Luis Borges returned to writing short stories. In Brodie's Report, he returned also to the style of his earlier years with its brutal realism, nightmares & bloodshed. Many of these stories, including Unworthy & The Other Duel are set in the macho Argentinean underworld, & even the rivalries between artists are suffused with suppressed violence. Throughout, opposing themes of fate & free will, loyalty & betrayal, time & memory flicker in the recesses of these compelling stories, among the best Borges ever wrote.",
