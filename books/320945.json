As much as she loved Sunnyville, California, something stopped her from ever feeling at home there and twelve years later, following her father's death, she has questions. With nothing left to lose, Maddie returns to her home town to dig into the events that sent her family fleeing for their lives all those years ago. Kaden Kemp's life was torn apart the night he witnessed his father's murder. A corrupt police force ensured no one paid for the crime but he always knew exactly who was responsible. With no choice but to get on with his life, he thinks the events of that night are behind him, until the killer's daughter returns to Frost Ford. Kaden is determined to finally get justice. If he can keep his hands off her, that is. The spark between them is undeniable as sworn enemies are forced to work together to uncover a deadly secret. Will they survive?",
