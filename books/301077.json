It only takes a moment to change a life.In a matter of seconds, an unexpected and devastating injury shatters Holden Cramer’s chances of ending his nineteen-season career on a high note. That brief moment in time not only irrevocably alters who he is, but also his relationships with everyone and everything around him. Yet one look can jump-start another.Tamryn Miller worked hard to get where she is: one of the youngest and most successful female injury management doctors in the league. She knows what goes into ensuring the players’ welfare, and what happens when those needs aren’t met—her past guaranteed that. With one look at the incredibly handsome quarterback as he lay writhing on the turf, Tamryn knows exactly what she needs to do…even if she has to ignore the burning attraction between them to do it.Forced together by fate and pain, Holden must learn that he’s not an island, and sometimes, all you need is a little help from your friends—especially when those friends are ones you want in your life forever.",
