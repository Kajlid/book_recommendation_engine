The only way he can do it is with the help of Tim Kelly.Tim isn’t thrilled to see Jake back in Las Vegas, and he doesn’t trust a word coming out of his mouth. But Jake’s offer of a big score that would legitimize his business dealings is too good to pass up. They head to Alabama for the loot, and on their way back, they end up in the Louisiana bayou. Neither of them bargained for the small-town sheriff and the crooked prison warden. They’ve been sentenced to five years hard labor on a chain gang. No one knows where they are, and no one’s going to come looking. Escape is the only thing on their minds.",
