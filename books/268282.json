It’s time for Cora to become alpha of her own pack, but no one knows what this will do to her bond with Kirsten. Will Cora get enough energy from her wolves so she’s in control of the bond? Or will Kirsten own Cora and the pack?  A night of explosions all over the South, a week traveling with Ryan, a few trips to Faerie, Bran saves her life (again), and she nearly has to battle Abbott (again). Oh, and she’s still dealing with the evil European vampires and their politics.  Strap in and get your popcorn, because the ride towards the big battle is picking up speed.
