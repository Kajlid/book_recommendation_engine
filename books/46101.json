An unstoppable plague kills one in ten. A new race is born: golden-eyed and wild, they reject their mothers and live apart, speaking no recognizable language. Alienated from society, lupans are even hunted for sport.For thirty years Linella Sienkiewicz has taken in climate refugees. She has protected lupans from captivity and death. But the Scottish government, responding to public xenophobia, plans to imprison the refugees and destroy the lupan colony. The only man who can help her is Scott Maguire, a lawyer on the run. Infected by plague he has taken shelter among the lupans. He is confronted by a society both fascinating and impenetrable, destined to take up the evolutionary torch from the human race. Even as he is healed, and transformed by living with them, he uncovers a secret that could spell salvation for humanity — but at a terrible cost.Against impossible odds, Scott and Linella must stop the approaching army. If the lupans are destroyed the last hope for the survival of the human race will be gone.“Gaia’s Children” is the first book in a series set in near-future Scotland. The second will be, “Song of the Earth.”",
