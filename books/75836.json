  "description": "Ex Ireland rugby player and now successful businessman Jim O’Connor is shot dead, point blank range, in the car park of a restaurant where he is hosting a family celebration. DCI Percy Peach is brought back from holiday to head up an investigation that has got nowhere. It seems Jim O’Connor had some rather unpleasant business contacts, many with the motive to get rid of him. However, when law-abiding Dominic O’Connor is also killed, within days of his brother, Brunton CID can only assume there must be some link between the two murders, so should they really be looking closer to home for the culprit. . . ?",
