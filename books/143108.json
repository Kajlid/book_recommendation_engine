  "description": "Wheelgun Press proudly presents: Whiskey and Wheelguns: Foreshadows. This is a collection of six short stories all set in the Whiskey and Wheelgun Universe. You will recieve a first class introduction to the stories that will be keeping you up at night for the next twelve months.  Each series will explore a dark corner of the weird west as envisioned by the addled minds of the contributers. They will dazzle you with the grit of the desert sand, the gristle of sixgun wielding protagonists, and the intestinal fortitude required to subdue a werewolf lightskirt.  Twenty-four stories of dubious literary merit by six of today’s most vaguely groomed and semi-coherent authors, which will shock and amaze, dazzle and impress, and floor the reader with outright awe for the massive amounts of facial hair required to bring a project like this into the bright desert light. Be sure to tune in May 5th when the stories get to rollin’ and follow along cause the wagon won’t be stoppin’ until they strike fool’s gold.",
