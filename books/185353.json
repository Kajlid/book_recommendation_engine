Book 2 in a series. **NOT A STANDALONE** Book 1, Forbidden, must be read first. **Raven**I may have made a mess of my life. I turned my back on a boy with a bright future, for a man who doesn’t even see a future for us. He says he’ll wait for me but will I even make it to my birthday? Between Lonnie gunning for me and getting caught in the crossfire of Gage’s criminal lifestyle, it may be a matter of who gets to me first. I should stay as far as I possibly can from Gage Hunter. I should run, right? But why do I keep running right into his arms? His pull is too strong, my body too weak. He’s sexy as sin and infinitely more tempting than the apple in the Garden. I hope he doesn’t turn out to be the serpent.**Gage**She tempts me more than any woman I’ve met in my entire life and I’ve never wanted any other as much as I want Raven. I’ve had more than my fair share so that’s saying a lot. She’s the relationship type and I’m not but staying away from her is physically impossible. Every second I spend with her makes me want her more but I’m not a good man. My life is complicated and she’s not safe around me. I should stay away from her. I tried leaving her alone and only ended up deeper under her spell. I have to have her. Every cell in my body craves her and I need to satisfy that craving no matter the cost. I hope I don’t destroy her in the process.",
