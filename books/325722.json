He's seen how they can ruin lives and tear families apart. All for \"the truth.\" Too bad the stunning brunette stealing his attention at press conferences is one of them. And her quest for the truth just landed him on a date, with no way out. But the more he gets to know her, the more he starts to wonder if he wants one.Theo Kappas is smart, tenacious and doesn't let Britt's prickly demeanor or continued no's keep her from what she wants. And what she wants is exclusive access to the team that everyone is talking about. The Atlanta Rising Football Club. The fact that she has to outwit her long term crush is irrelevant, even if it does make her heart beat faster. She's determined to not let her attraction get in the way—she's a reporter first, a woman second.After Cowboy reluctantly gives Theo the access she wants, the two are forced to work side by side, and realize there’s more to the other than they thought. But can a reporter and a man who hates them be on the same team?",
