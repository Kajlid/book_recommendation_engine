  "title": "More All-Of-A-Kind Family",
  "description": "Sydney Taylor's beloved All-of-a-Kind Family series chronicles a Jewish immigrant family at the beginning of the twentieth century. The richly drawn characters, based on Taylor's own life, include five sisters—Ella, Henny, Sarah, Charlotte, Gertie—and their mischievous brother, Charlie. The second book in the series, this YA classic presents a vivid and humorous portrait of life at the turn of the century, as WWI approaches, a single uncle finds love, and a new friendship blooms among latkes and the library. Born in 1904 on New York's Lower East Side, Sydney Taylor was one of the first authors of children's books centered on Jewish characters, and is especially known for the immensely popular All-of-a-Kind Family series. The Sydney Taylor Book Award is given each year by the Jewish Association of Libraries to a book for young people that authentically portrays the Jewish experience.",
