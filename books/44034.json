With Livvy Hutchins, an irrepressible transfer into D.C. LLE, and Louie, a neuro-enhanced dog, he faces the most challenging case of his 75-year career. Together they must work in secret to uncover the dark plans of a wealthy sociopath allied with a doctor of Frankensteinian talents. As always in LLE work, the secret must be kept - or they risk disrupting the knife-edge balance of civilization's opposing idealologies.",
