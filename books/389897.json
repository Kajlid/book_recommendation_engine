  "description": "The first book of The Twelve Houses, Mystic & Rider , was hailed as “spellbinding” ( Publishers Weekly ), and introduced readers to the troubled land of Gillengaria. Now, national bestselling and award-winning author Sharon Shinn continues her epic tale, as a beautiful shapeshifter finds that intrigue and danger can be found even in the safest of havens… After joining an unlikely band of soldiers and sorcerers to rescue the regent Romar Brendan from a cabal of rebellious minor lords, the shiftling Kirra returns to her home of Danalustrous—and learns that her half-sister, Casserah, has been proclaimed heir to the land. Though Casserah is obligated to attend a circuit of social events held by the great Houses of Gillengaria, she obstinately refuses to go. So Kirra shapeshifts into her sister’s form and makes the rounds for her. In the royal city of Ghosenhall, she unexpectedly joins up with her steadfast compatriots from her previous adventures, and together they embark on a tour of the Twelve Houses acting as guardians for the enigmatic queen of Gillengaria and her alluring daughter. The motley group of mystics and warriors faces many dangers in their travels. But Kirra places herself willingly in peril when she falls in love with the irresistible—but already married—Lord Romar. Revealing her true identity to him, Kirra begins a tempestuous affair that places them both in mortal danger, and leads them both into the stronghold of the devious lords of the Thirteenth House…",
