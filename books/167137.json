But nothing prepared me for the lengths I’d go to for my baby.  Which is why I’m going to go home and deal with my family issues once and for all. I can’t move forward without resolving my past.  Running from the fight is not an option. Especially when I’m so close to having everything I never knew I wanted in my life…  Layla At this stage in my pregnancy, the only thing I should be doing is preparing for the arrival of our baby.  Too bad someone from my past—someone who was there eighteen years ago when the course of my life was irrevocably altered—won’t let me relax.

And when we’re done, maybe we can finally settle into the happily ever after we both so richly deserve… A Father’s Fight, book 5 in the Fighting series, is an emotional, angsty, contemporary, steamy, sports/MMA romance novella with a guaranteed HEA (or rather, a continued HEA).
