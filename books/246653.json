  "description": "When Nickolas Valadon, nephew of the High Lord of New York, goes missing amidst other vampire abductions by the Human Order of Light, the task of finding Nick goes to Remare. Known as a ruthless, but sexy investigator, Remare contacts the Elemental, his former lover, Miranda Crescent, to assist in the hunt. As they work together, his desire increases to the point where he will defy the devil himself to have herâ€”despite the punishment that will be meted out, death. Having been forsaken because of Remare's fealty for High Lord Valadon, Miranda distrusts the dashing vampire she once fell for, even though she still yearns for his sensual touch. During their search, Miranda will discover secrets about her Elemental origins and ancestry that may threaten her status at House Valadon. However, burning desire is not easily denied and feelings long buried intensify to searing heights. In a world turned chaotic by the HOL, Miranda and Remare will risk the vengeance of the High Lord to be together and discover a world of passion neither has ever known before. But passion comes with a price and secrets, no matter how well-guarded, never stay hidden for long.",
