  "description": "For years, the truth has been concealed from Grace, masked cleverly by coercion, denial and fanciful stories. She'd always felt that there was a part of her that didn't resonate with this world, as if she were a square block in a round hole. When her father died, it was her mother's unconditional love, Wade's fatherly presence, and Angela, Grace's quirky neighbor that gave her strength. United, they were her beacon, the lighthouse that guided her in from the storm. That was until she learned the truth â€¦ And the truth, Grace discovered, regardless of what she'd been told, does not always set you free.Make no mistake, the Grigori is the Original Vampire, and regardless of what you believe, they are here, walking among us, and they intent to stay.",
