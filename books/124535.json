  "description": "The year 2000 brought in more than a new millennium. With it came The Melding, which returned magic and fairytales, both light and dark, to the world. Seven years later, Discord Jones has gained some control over the psychic abilities she received, though they continue to grow and change, challenging her to adapt. Yet her new \"normal\" is anything but, as a family outing leads Cordi into a maze of curses, life-altering changes, and the sure knowledge that gods walk the earth. If that weren’t enough, Cordi is quickly losing her anonymity as well as neutrality in a world full of politics and intrigue. Except that mortal politics rarely end in death. In the Supe world, it’s practically a requirement.",
