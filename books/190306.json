Having characteristics of her own, it is terrifying to know the telling tales from stories big or small. In each such poem, there is beautiful display of some enigma. It is important this voice be formed.Should I be reborn as a flowerso fragile and so beautiful tothe trembling heart its each petal,if drop, if not drop.The regeneration is another process but gradual silence has never been forte. Thus Footprints is an endeavor of becoming an inspiring audible voice, the voice herself.",
