  "description": "SHE WAS BORN OFF-LIMITS. BUT HE WAS BORN TO BREAK THE RULES.  Bad Boy Bikers, Book 1Ram:  Nobody screws me. I take who I want, when I want, and I always leave them wanting more. I want more too. Hurt this deep doesn't heal. After meeting June, I know she’s the fix I need for the pain. Her family’s full of cops? So what? All I want is her. Those luscious curves, the lips that won't quit, hips that make my heart pound like a drum. My outlaw brothers say me and her together will tear this whole town apart. I don’t give a damn.  June:  I never wanted to come home. There’s nothing here but old wounds too bitter to heal. The day I returned, I met Ram. He’s an outlaw biker built like a god, but there’s nothing divine about his desires. When he tells me he needs an old lady to stay in his club, we start a dangerous charade. He gets a woman and time. I get my sheriff dad off my back. Breathing room. But every breath around Ram is lightning hot and undeniable. I can’t be with him for real. He’s every kind of wrong there’s ever been. Unless we’re careful, we’ll rip our lives apart. But what’s happening between us feels too right to ignore, no matter the cost...",
