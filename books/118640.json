  "description": "A Young Indiana Jones with a splash of Percy Jackson.  Twelve-year-old Devin Reed is your average kid from Manhattan. That is until he inherits a 400 year old book and amulet necklace from his recently deceased grandfather. With book and amulet now in his possession, Devin discovers that he is the protector of a centuries old secret hidden in a cave deep beneath Central Park. It's there that he awakes a world he never knew existed. And it's there that he learns of his quest to save a sacred scroll from destruction. In the end, Devin becomes an unlikely hero as he battles evil spirits and a ruthless bloodline destined to destroy the scroll.  Basically, forget everything you learned in school about the purchase of Manhattan. Because Devin’s adventurous and magical quest will change the history of the Island forever, and along the way reacquaint you with some of this country’s most famous historical figures.  'BOOK ONE' of the Devin Reed fantasy/adventure series.",
