She is married to a fantastic guy, is mom to an adorable two-year-old with another child on the way, has a posse of girlfriends, and recently landed a new job. The spiritual practices she has made a centerpiece of her life—yoga, mindfulness, meditation—are becoming second nature. But four months into her pregnancy, Lorna learns there may be something wrong with her unborn baby, a prospect that throws her life and her inner peace into turmoil. Over the next few months as a diagnosis awaits, Lorna is helped along by breathwork, family yoga, appreciation exercises, crystal-bowl relaxation, Ayurveda, chanting, spiritual reading, and more. Will all this be enough to get Lorna through the months of not-knowing—and possibly a devastating diagnosis?",
