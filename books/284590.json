  "description": "A love like ours was never meant to exist.It pushed every boundary. Broke every rule. My heart couldn't deny what I felt for him, and my body couldn't ignore his touch.  He was my step-brother and what we had might be real... but it was also forbidden. Dear Reader,Falling for the Forbidden is the first part of Ben and Lauren's story. It's emotional, full of angst, has plenty of steam and will leave you wanting more!This is also the first book in my new Forbidden series which is a spin-off from my Falling series but can be read independently from that series.xo",
