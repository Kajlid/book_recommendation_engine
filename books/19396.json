  "title": "Another Space in Time",
  "description": "A second life in a parallel dimension, or an astronomical distance from Earth. No one knows how the connectivity works, only that one can get another chance. After assassination in his own home Rodwell awakes to eventually discover that he is on another earth-like world. He is soon framed for murder, and finds himself alone, on the run pursued by terrorists and police alike.Fast paced in parts, this is also a book that takes a look at many aspects of every-man philosophy. This is a full length novel, intended for all who have reached a sufficient reading level. There is some adult content, but I, the author, have no problem with classing this book for general readership. I would welcome feedback on this and any other issue. I describe this book as speculative fiction, rather than science fiction or fantasy.",
