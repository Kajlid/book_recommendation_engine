  "description": "Peter Quill might have been born on Earth, but he’s been away a long time. And now that the Guardians of the Galaxy have gone and gotten themselves stranded on terra firma, how does a man go from soaring through the stars as the legendary Star-Lord to living with his feet planted firmly on the ground? What kind of job options are available for a guy whose résumé mostly consists of “guarding the galaxy”? And with all the dangers he has faced and survived, could anything prepare him for…community service?! Maybe Daredevil can help out with that. Or, would you believe, the Shocker? One thing is certain: Earth has a new guardian. Also, a new bartender. Peter Quill — the legendary Bar-Lord!Collecting: STAR-LORD #1-6 and Annual.",
