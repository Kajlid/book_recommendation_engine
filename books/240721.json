  "description": "Rainbow Award for Best Lesbian Young Adult Novel of 2018. Trixie McQueen, called Sixteen by her friends, is a street girl from New York who, in an attempt to get out of her stifling family and social situation, finds herself in the wild Florida Everglades—on the run from sleazebags and petty crooks who are not pleased that she has discovered their poaching operation.Luckily, Sixteen is rescued—not only from these low-lifes, but from alligators and snakes—by a group of odd swamp-dwellerss—a philosophy professor, a carny geek, a voodoo practitioner, a fishing guide, and a couple of ex-marines. And last but definitely not least, the alluring Raven, who Sixteen gets an immediate crush on. Together with her new friends—who really, really, don’t like criminals in their neck of the woods—Sixteen becomes part of a dangerous and unusual plan to shut down these wildlife-destroyers for good.",
