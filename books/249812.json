Though she’s just survived a revolution that will finally put a queen on the throne, she faces yet another challenge: acceptance by the MacQuinns. But as Queen Isolde Kavanagh’s closest confidant, she’ll have to balance serving her father’s House with serving her country. And then there’s Cartier.Aodhan Morgane, formerly known as Cartier Évariste, is adjusting to the stark contrast between his pre-rebellion life in Valenia and his current one as lord of a fallen House. During his castle’s restoration, he discovers Tomas, a young boy whose past is a mystery. So when Brienna is as taken with Tomas as he is, Cartier lets his mind wander—what if he doesn’t have to raise him or his House alone?However, Brienna and Cartier must put their love aside and stay focused on the most vital tasks at hand—the Lannons' trial, forging alliances, executing justice, and ensuring that no one halts the queen’s coronation. But resistance is rumbling among the old regime’s supporters, who are desperate to find a weakness in the rebels’ forces. And what makes one more vulnerable than love?In this epic follow-up to The Queen's Rising, Rebecca Ross weaves political intrigue, complicated relationships, and undying love to create a story that readers won't be able to put down.",
