  "description": "What would bring you happiness in a world that was suddenly empty?  For Lucy Crane, the answer is simple: her daughter. When her husband is killed in a tragic accident, Lucy loses her desire to live, but only one thing keeps her going – her unborn daughter. Focusing on being a mother helps Lucy cope with her loss, but kids grow up and they leave home, eventually. Eighteen years after losing her first and only love, Lucy is faced with the opportunity to find the happiness for which she’s always longed. Her own fears become her worst enemies as she learns how to embrace love once again.  Evan Donovan is also facing his own struggles. Forced to retire from the FDNY because of lung damage caused by 9/11, Evan moves to upstate New York where he hopes to find a little peace and quiet. Old habits die hard, and Evan’s hero complex and survivor’s guilt constantly remind him of how difficult it is to be vulnerable. But for the first time in his life, he’s tired of being alone.  Drawing strength from one another, Lucy and Evan discover how beautiful it is to let love be a part of their lives.  ***Though this is part of a series, it can be read as a standalone. Unlike the previous books in the series, this is NOT a New Adult & College Romance; this is a contemporary romance featuring characters who are more mature / not in their twenties).
