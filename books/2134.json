But an accident brings her life crashing down around her ears. She is cast down amongst the lowest of the low, little more than a garbage collector.Who did this to her, and for what sinister purpose? Her quest to find out will take her to parts of the city she never knew existed, and open the door to a world she could never have imagined.",
