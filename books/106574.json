  "description": "This book is no longer for sale or available for purchase.From #1 New York Times bestselling author Lauren Blakely comes a steamy romance that follows Kennedy as she falls for Noah . . . even though she shouldn't.When I first met him I resisted.Like any forbidden love, I told myself he was a crush, and it would pass.That was a lie. It never faded.And I never expected he would fall for me just as hard.There were so many reasons that should have kept us apart, least of all, the decade that separated us.Growing up in New York City, I learned early on that love is a double-edged sword.Love broke up my parents, love took away my friends, and love — the big, intense, never-been-like-this-beforelove — landed me in therapy.Now I'm heading to college, and it's time to give love a clean slate again. But, can I really start over when he's still in my life?Because the one man I've always wanted, and also the only guy I absolutely can't have...And he wants me just as fiercely.Can I settle for anything less than the love of my life?",
