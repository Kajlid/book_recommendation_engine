  "title": "Change Has Come: An Artist Celebrates Our American Spirit",
  "description": "The black and white images throughout are personal reflections, uniquely felt and rendered by award winning artist Kadir Nelson. They are accompanied by the uplifting words of Barack Obama and commemorate the movement and the moment that have changed our history. It's a celebration of the power of inspiration. It's a celebration of how far we have come and how determined we are to look ahead. It's a celebration of pride, hope and joy personally felt and publically shared. Most of all it's a celebration of the 44th president - a new president and a new chapter in the American story.",
