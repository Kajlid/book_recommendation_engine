Like another who came before him, the powerful kingpin, whose scars and demons mirror my own, desires what he'll never have.⁣My territory and submission.⁣To protect myself, I should end him. Quickly. He's a threat to everything I have. Everything I am. But for so long, I've been dead inside. Completely empty.⁣ And when in the arms of the enemy, I feel.More so than I ever thought possible.⁣Regardless, I need to remember that Alejandro is the male version of myself: merciless and calculating. If I don't, he'll steal what I locked away long ago. The very thing that will ensure my downfall, destroying me.⁣My cold, black heart.⁣",
