  "description": "An intriguing new Brother Athelstan historical mystery - December, 1380 . When the corpse of Sir Robert Kilverby is discovered in a locked room, Brother Athelstan accompanies the Kingâ€™s coroner to investigate. For Sir Robert had in his possession a priceless relic, a sacred bloodstone, which has now disappeared. Did Sir Robert die of natural causes or was he murdered? Athelstan is sceptical of rumours of a curse hanging over Sir Robert, but when it is discovered that a second old soldier has been gruesomely slain on the same night, the rumours no longer seem so far-fetched . . .",
