  "description": "It’s a night like any other for punk rock band Green is the Enemy. Having just completed a gig in their hometown of Seattle, they pile into their van, headed for San Francisco to open for their idols Peroxide and with any luck, get signed to Withering Skin Records. Unfortunately, things don’t go exactly as planned. They travel no more than a few blocks when an 8.5 earthquake strikes the city, tumbling buildings and opening streets, and sending the van crashing down into a huge crevasse. Beneath the city of Seattle is another long buried city, known to locals as The Underground and it is here that the band find themselves, trapped and somehow vastly…changed. Join Ro, Pawn, Dose and Whey as they fight to make it back in time for their gig, encounter strange creatures called Kreepkins, a surfer-dude warlock, a vengeful demon and a Metal Priestess who holds the key to their escape from the bizarre subterranean nightmare that is now their lives. \"It's like a fucked up version of The Wizard of Oz, with punk rockers.\"—Carlton Mellick III, author of Satan Burger and Punk Land \"I found Chemical Gardens to be a delightfully interesting read. Every time I thought I had the story pinned down it changed shape and went in an entirely unexpected direction. I can't wait to see what Gina does next.\"—Kevin Dole 2, author of Tangerinephant \"From the start, Gina Ranalli's Chemical Gardens does two things…makes you laugh and brings you along like you are a roadie for Green is the Enemy. After Mother Nature rocks out with her own musical style, Ranalli plops us smack underground where it's pretty clear that you aren't in Seattle anymore! A creative and funny, yet dark and \"kreepy\" twist to a familiar favorite.\"—Nicole Del Sesto, author of All Encompassing Trip",
