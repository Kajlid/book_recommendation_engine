  "title": "The Wrinkly: An idyllic early retirement. Well, that was the plan.",
  "description": "Mike Lewis wants 'out'. Out of his meaningless career in broadcast sales, out of his shallow relationships with materialistic women, out of the youth-centric, big city rat race. Unfortunately he has no idea where 'in' is, until he discovers an idyllic retirement community in Florida that promises a peaceful, sunny life of golf and hobbies. On a whim he signs a contract for a house, and only afterwards does he read the small print: he has to be over 60 to join the enclave. Trouble is, he's 39. Painted into a corner, he engages the help of a movie-makeup artist and a gerontologist, and cons his way into the club. But, once inside, he finds that this particular paradise comes with a whole new set of problems... This tale of one man's ridiculous attempt at early retirement and his unexpected encounters with lust, drugs and cosmetics was written by Paul Collis, a Londoner now living in California. He adapted it from his screenplay of the same name.",
