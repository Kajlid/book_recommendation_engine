  "description": "Holly Wallace has spent her life in a supporting role, managing her brother’s career and keeping her family together despite the craziness that is Hollywood. When he has a mental breakdown, she finds him an unorthodox program: an asylum in the truest sense, to let him take a step out of society and rediscover himself. But when Holly finds herself attracted to the therapist caring for her brother, she once again has to put her family’s needs above her own.Following the tragic death of his sister, Ben Crawford developed a program based on a nineteenth century treatment that allowed patients to heal themselves holistically. When Holly brings Adam to Ben, Adam’s status could be the boost his program needs. Ben could help even more people, except he comes to see Adam isn’t the only Wallace he wants to help: he’s falling in love with Holly.Ethics is the one line Ben can’t cross, but if he doesn’t find a way to save Holly from herself, he could lose her to the Tall Shadows of her past.",
