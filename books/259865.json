I couldn’t put it down.\"★★★★★ \"I was intrigued by the blurb for the book and it did not disappoint. I really like how each character gets to give their point of view. Tension, laughter and building a bond make it a great book. It feels like the start of a new fave series.\" This is not a reverse harem story.",
