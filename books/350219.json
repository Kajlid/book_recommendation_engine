  "description": "Strange things are happening in the village of Stagtree Knoll. Ever since Bethany's parents moved here they have developed an unhealthy obession for the local sausages. Not to mention the bizarra soap opera they watch every night without fail, a soap opera that seems to have hypnotised everyone in the village. Everyone except Bethany, that is. Determined to find out what's going on, she sneaks into the mysterious Stoames Mansion and discovers something very strange indeed: a hotel for ghosts, spirits and non-material beings. But Bethany is not a welcome guest here and if she hopes to escape and save her parents, she must face the sinister power at the heart of the hotel, and break the spell it has cast over everyone.",
