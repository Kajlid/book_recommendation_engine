  "description": "This is a story about love and forgiving, mostly, it is about understanding. About the ability to look behind what is plain to see, and gazing into someone's true soul.  Daniel has been working for the family business since the day he was born. His father hadn't been kind to him; he raised him to do as he was told, or else. Since his father's death Daniel has been running the family business just like his father taught him, but he longs for something different, something sweet and innocent, the opposite of what he sees every day.  Sandra is an American foreign exchange student in Switzerland in her last year of school. A month before graduation a new teacher arrives, shaking up the school with his strict punishments. She doesn't understand why the new teacher seems to be singling her out, which he does often. He is different with her, gentler. When he accompanies the class on their Senior trip instead of their normal teachers everyone groans. When they find out that they have all been kidnapped Sandra is separated from the other girls. She doesn't understand why she has to share a room, and a bed, with the teacher. Can she learn to love him despite all of his faults? Can she see the man who needs her behind the facade?  Warning: This book is for ages 18 and up. It contains severe punishment scenes as well as sexual content. If such things offend you do not buy the book.",
