  "description": "This, the biography of Pastor Les Deane begins with the overview of his 1950s childhood in rural Lancashire. Les' parents were poor but his father was a hard worker and provided well for the 11 children, who had to sleep 4 to 5 in a bed. It tells of a family bound together with love until one day they are split apart due to the continual struggle by their father to stay in gainful employment. These early years deeply contrast the next twenty or so years of his life. He becomes a member of one of the most ruthless gangs of 1960's London, and as a consequence, of his dealings he spends time in various prisons and remand centres where he receives vicious beatings from numerous prison officers. Soon after his release from Norwich Prison, whilst totally disillusioned by all he has experienced, he drops out of society to become a tramp. The next five years are spent living on the streets, each day a struggle to survive. At times, he trudges the streets, having not eaten for a week, existing in the soaking wet and biting cold. He becomes an alcoholic-this is the only way to block out the cold on the long winter nights. This part of the story shows the dignity and humanity of street-people, who were once someone's baby, warm and loved. Now they are homeless, treated with contempt and even rejected by parts of the Church. After five years on the streets, his health failing, he's finally taken in by a family whose love and care help him become a reformed character, eventually finding his faith in God and becoming a Church Minister. Today, he is Pastor and Manager of Freshfields Christian Music Ministries, a music group which ministers at various Churches throughout the country.",
