  "description": "Carol and her two lifelong friends, Aimee and Suzanne - all single now - couldn't very well show up at their high school reunion dance without escorts, so Carol proposed a plan: they'd find dates...somewhere. Suzanne invited her plumber, and Carol asked a stuffy colleague from the office, but Aimee balked. She'd go alone, thank you!But the reunion proved to be filled with surprises. The class nerd had aged as gracefully as a fine wine; he was the handsomest man there. Suzanne's plumber, in a well-cut tux, made more than one heart race. And Carol's stuffed-shirt colleague was a far different animal outside the office. The evening wouldn't end the way anyone had planned, but it began to look as if changing partners might lead to a brand new chance for Carol, Suzanne, and Aimee....a chance to love again!",
