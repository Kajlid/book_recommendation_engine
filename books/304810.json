  "description": "I never expected to spend my days as a dancing girl… but it beats the alternative. In the window of a filthy space station cantina, I gyrate my hips and hope for better days.When I’m bought by the most intimidating alien on Three Nebulas Station, those better days are on their way. Zakoar of the Broken Back is a cyborg who deals in black market prosthetics. He’s terrifying to look at, with a metal jaw and a fearsome demeanor. He intimidates everyone in the galaxy… except me.Zakoar doesn’t want my name. In fact, he doesn’t want anything from me… except a little bed sport. In exchange for my willingness, he’ll take me to a human-friendly planet where I can live unafraid.Love isn’t part of the bargain, but every moment that I spend with him, I learn more about the male beneath the metal……and I’m suddenly dreaming of a very different happy ever after for myself…",
