  "description": "Dove Walker was born with Dragon Eyes, the marker for all humans that have dragon mates. She was also born into the Church of the Silver Sons - the most notorious anti-Dragon cult in the country.  Raised hearing horror stories about what dragons do to their mates, Dove prays she never meets hers. Her prayers are answered when she’s engaged to one of the most highly regarded men in the Church.  But before she marries, her Dad gives her her first and last order: go undercover as a prospective Dragon mate at the Birthday party of four Dragonlords.  It seems easy enough until she falls right into the laps of her four sexy mates.  Forced to choose between what she’s been raised to believe and the men that claim she’s theirs, Cora needs to make a choice - or she isn’t the only one who’s going to get burned.",
