  "description": "Fourteen months ago, Tara Olu-Browne quit her well paying job to follow her heart: Become a full time romance writer. Her decision is paying off, until she agrees to write for Black Desire, a new romance publisher that is set to turn out books that will appeal to a West African audience . Black Desire is headed by business mogul, Jimi Akintaylor and while he says he enjoys Tara’s previous works, he is heavily critical of her current manuscript calling the love scenes improbable. Tara is left with two choices: Quit writing for Black Desire or suck up her pride and request pointers from Jimi on how she can improve on the love scenes. She chooses the latter, and realizes too late that she’s just signed up for some very practical lessons in love.",
