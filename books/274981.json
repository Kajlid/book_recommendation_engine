  "title": "Paradigm Found: Leading and Managing for Positive Change",
  "description": "Millions of people are frustrated by the lack of innovation and accountability undertaken by the government and other organizations, but they don’t know where or how to begin making changes. Paradigm Found is a primer for creating or reshaping institutions and businesses to be run on principles often voiced but rarely learning, equality, tolerance, consensus, empowerment, generosity, and hearing and acknowledging all voices. Providing examples from her own rich experience, Murray shows readers what one individual can do to implement change from within, and how to do it. She encourages others to take risks, start organizations, and judge when it is time, and how, to move on. Full of practical suggestions for giving life to values and engaging stories of what works and what doesn't, Paradigm Found demonstrates that it is possible to walk the talk, even when it isn’t easy.",
