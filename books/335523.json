  "description": "The Swann Sisters Chronicles, Book 1\n How do you ditch your Fairy Godmother?  As her 25th birthday approaches, mild-mannered Philomena Swann lives in terror of her annual birthday wish. Sure, she has a disinterested fiance and a misogynistic boss, but from experience she knows wishing both away could result in disaster. Why? Because she and her sisters are one-eighth fairy. Not enough to give them magical powers, but enough to qualify for a fairy godmother from hell. All Phil wants is, just once, to have the courage to speak her mind. She blurts out her wish and suddenly finds she can't stop. To her friends. Her boss. Her Nana. And her best friend, hot and hunky co-worker, Josh. Before she can do any more damage, she begs for the spell to be reversed. And it is with a vengeance. Now everyone else is compelled to tell her the truth. Including Josh. But the fairy godmother's not done. One more wish could change Phil's world forever if it doesn't ruin her life first. Warning: Hot book, erotic sex.",
