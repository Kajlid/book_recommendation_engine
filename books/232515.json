  "description": "On a random night out with her girlfriends, Taye experiences something she hasn’t before. Instant attraction. Between vodkas and dance moves she probably shouldn't be doing in public, never mind on a podium, she meets him. She’s never had a one night stand before, and to have one is on her list of things to experience in her life. Not only that, but the chemistry is off the charts. Decision made. She’s going home with this man, and she’s not going to regret it when she leaves him in the morning. Or at least that’s what she thinks.",
