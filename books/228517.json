  "description": "SHE CAN BE ANY WOMAN, FULFILL YOUR EVERY WISH. THERE'S JUST THIS TEENSIE LITTLE CATCH ....She was a goddess, a fantasy come true in a tight red dress. The kind of woman that turns every head when she walks into the room. That night, every man in the place wanted her. Why she chose him, he hadn't a clue.Still, she had her issues. He had to admit, he found her just a tad bit, shall we say, peculiar for his liking. But tolerating her quirkiness was just a small price to pay for the companionship of this sexy enchantress. Besides, she was just supposed to stay the night and be gone come morning. Just a no-strings-attached fling and they'd both be on their merry ways. Well, that was his plan anyway. Unfortunately, it wasn't hers.She was no stranger to the game. She'd played it a lot longer than he had, and she'd never lost. She knew exactly what it took to make a man's wildest dreams and his darkest desires come true. She would make sure he enjoyed every wicked second of their time together. The biggest difference in his plan and hers was that he would never see the coming of morning.But then again, things sometimes don't always go as planned. And that's something both mortal and immortal are soon to discover.The Devil in the Detail is a lusty, naughty little tale that takes you on a wild ride of supernatural decadence. If you are easily offended and blush at high-octane erotica, this may not be the story for you. But if you don't mind stepping outside the box for a few pages ... with an ending you'll never see coming, buckle up and hang on tight! It's going to be quite a night!",
