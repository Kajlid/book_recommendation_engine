  "description": "Cody Manywounds's intentions are good, but it seems that every time he makes one little mistake, he gets caught. He got into some serious trouble with his friends a while ago, but since then, things have been looking up -- his grades are good, his girlfriend is hot, and the escape to university (and more girls) is just around the corner. Then it all comes crashing down with a single text \"I'm pregnant. Call me. :)\" When Cody's girlfriend decides to get an abortion, he finds himself dealing with conflicting emotions -- and discovers how little a say he is given in the matter.",
