  "description": "For every rise there is a fall; for every victory, a defeat.The people have their saviour, but he does not yet sit upon the holy throne. The enemy has been thrown down, but not yet destroyed.The north rots! Nothing grows as it should. Where the enemy have slept, so their poison has sunk into the land; as the land decays, so the heart of the world falls into shadow. Jealousies are awoken, plots ripen and secret counsels are taken.Evil does not sleep, it merely bides its time. So the war begins again and the words of the seer come to pass - the order of the world is overturned and all roads lead down into the darkness.",
