  "description": "Josie wanted a change…and moving to paradise sight-unseen seemed like a reasonable way to go about it. That is until she stepped off the airplane and straight into a holiday season heatwave!  From the humidity to the local residents (and not just the two-legged kind), Josie is in for a wake-up call. Luckily, her lovable new landlady Esterline, and the surprisingly charming local dive shop owner, Nate, are hoping to convince her that living in paradise is worth it if she’ll just give it a chance. With his laid-back Margaritaville attitude, Nate embarks on a mission to show Josie that Christmas in Key West is just as magical as the snowy holiday season that she's used to. But is Christmas in the Keys more of a change than she bargained for? Will the aftershock of her rash decision to move have her retreating to familiar territory? Or will her quirky new friends win her over, helping her give this fresh start a shot? Grab your sunscreen and sail on down to the tropical shores for some sandy white Christmas fun —Key West style! AUTHOR'S This is a sweet, contemporary stand-alone short story with an HEA ending! The story is a clean romance with no offensive language.",
