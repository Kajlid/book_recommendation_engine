I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot.\nUnderestimating demons is a bad idea, and it’s a mistake that may cost me not only my own life, but the life of a missing child.If I can swallow my pride, and allow Agent O’Shea to help me find a way to deal with the demon, we might be able to save the child.With this salvage, it’s a race against time, a test of trust, and a temptation that I'm doing my damnedest to ignore.If only swallowing my pride was that easy.",
