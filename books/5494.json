  "description": "I began these books of English history with the hope of carrying the series forward, under the general title of The Pageant of England to a much later period than the last of the Plantagent kings. Pressure of other work made it impossible, however, to produce them at the gait I had hoped to achieve. And now the factor of time has intruded itself also. Realizing that my earlier objective cannot be reached, I have decided to conclude with the death of Richard III and to change the covering title to A History of the Plantagenets. This has made necessary some revision in getting the four volumes ready for publication. The first five chapters in the inital book, which began with the Norman Conquest and covered the reigns of William the Conqueror, William (Rufus) the Second, and Henry the First, had to be dropped. The first volume in this complete edition of the four begins with the final scenes in the reign of Henry the First whose daughter married Geoffrey of Anjou and whose son succeeded in due course to the throne of England as Henry the Second, thus beginning the brilliant Plantagenet dynasty. The title of the first volume has been changed to The Conquering Family. In addition to the deletion of the early chapters, a few slight cuts and minor revisions have been made throughout the series. Otherwise the four books are the same as those published separately under the titles, The Conquerors, The Magnificent Century, The Three Edwards, and The Last Plantagenets. Thomas B. Costain",
