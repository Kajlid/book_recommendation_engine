The only chance of protecting the other people involved is to flee New Orleans, the only home she has ever known, for the quiet solitude of Summer Island.Summer Island, Maine (population 202) is not the tranquil escape Ana imagined.

As the storm worsens, the St. Andrews brothers learn there are other, more sinister forces at work closer than they ever imagined.With no help from the outside world, they must find a way to protect themselves from both the storm, and the growing darkness that looms across the island.",
