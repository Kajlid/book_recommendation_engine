  "description": "Avery Patterson’s literally not the girl she used to be.A past that haunted her for years turned out to be based on a lie. Her father was not an evil man. He loved Avery enough to die for her, and now she’s determined to live for him. She owes him that much, and so much more. Ever since she was fourteen, Avery’s been running and hiding from every challenge she’s faced with, but this time she’s determined not to run. She’s going to fight for the broken boy who not only helped to unveil the truth about her family’s past, but also showed her there was hope for the future.The only problem is that winter is over. Spring is almost through, and Avery’s New York Cop has turned in his badge and taken up his guitar. It’s been three months without contact. Three months without a single word.Where on earth is Lucas Reid?It’s amazing how quickly your life can change. One minute you’re patrolling the streets in one of the world’s craziest cities, arresting felons, and the next you’re singing something you came up with in the shower to fifteen thousand people. It’s easy to forget what life was like before. Easy to blur out the events of a childhood that feels like it happened to someone else.But it didn’t happen to someone else. It happened to him. Luke knows that in order to move forward with Avery, he needs to come clean. But how best to do that, when his demons are so dirty?It’s easy to write a song. It’s easy to make a crowd chant your name. But finding the right words to tell a horrible truth?Nothing’s ever been harder.",
