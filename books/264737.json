  "description": "Told in a series of vignettes from multiple viewpoints, Kekla Magoon's Light It Up is a powerful, layered story about injustice and strengthâ€”as well as an incredible follow-up to the highly acclaimed novel How It Went Down.A girl walks home from school. She's tall for her age. She's wearing her winter coat. Her headphones are in. She's hurrying.She never makes it home.In the aftermath, while law enforcement tries to justify the response, one fact remains: a police officer has shot and killed an unarmed thirteen-year-old girl. The community is thrown into upheaval, leading to unrest, a growing movement to protest the senseless taking of black lives, and the arrival of white supremacist counter demonstrators.",
