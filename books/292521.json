  "title": "The Ninth Child",
  "description": "A spellbinding novel of a young doctor's wife, Isabel Aird, struggling to make her childless life meaningful, unaware that the sinister Robert Kirke is watching her every move, by the Sunday Times bestselling author Sally Magnusson.\n\nLoch Katrine waterworks, 1856. A Highland wilderness fast becoming an industrial wasteland. No place for a lady. \n But Isabel Aird, denied the motherhood role society expects of her by a succession of miscarriages, is comforted by a place where she can feel the presence of her lost children and begin to work out what her life is for. No matter that the hills echo with the gunpowder blasts of men tunnelling day and night to bring fresh water to diseased Glasgow thirty miles away - digging so deep that there are those who worry they are disturbing the land of faery itself. New life is quickening within her again. While her husband is engaged with the medical emergencies of the construction site, Isabel can only wait. But someone else is waiting too. The man in the dark coat, watching for the right moment with a huntsman's eye . . . By turns spellbinding and heart-pounding, The Ninth Child is set at a pivotal time in the Victorian era, when engineering innovation and new ideas flourished but women did not. Through the dual lens of history and folklore it captures a woman's struggle to make her life matter, and a compromised man's struggle with himself.",
