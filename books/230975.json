  "title": "The Autumn Man",
  "description": "Milton is a small, industrial Northern England town where nothing ever happens... but all that is about to change. When grieving schoolteacher, Megan Vervain, rents her spare room to enigmatic loner, Amon, she starts to suspect something about her lodger is odd. He spends his nights studying maps of the town, looking for something in its ancient past. Soon, bizarre events occur: people go missing, graves are robbed, and a terrifying beast stalks human prey at night. Another stranger has come to Milton-the lustful, murderous Von Daniken. For centuries, he and Amon have been searching for the same thing-the mystical Cure for the terrible disease of lycanthropy that afflicts them both. Only one can win. Whatever the outcome of their apocalyptic final battle, the town of Milton will never be the same again.",
