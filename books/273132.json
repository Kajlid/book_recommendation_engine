  "title": "Jeretta's Judgment",
  "description": "Jeretta Ardoin knew all too well how false accusations can hurt, having seen her beloved partner slip away because of it. So when the Free Spirit Connection approached her to become an arbiter – trained to look into complaints of misconduct and determine the best response – she jumped at the chance. And while she attended this workshop, she might as well meet her long-neglected erotic needs with other Free Spirits there: Millie and David, Justin, Miguel, and Cole. She’ll come away prepared to serve a vital role in the Connection. And, perhaps, the possibility of a more intimate bond in the future.",
