  "description": "I entered into a bargain—choosing my mate over my freedom. But I underestimated the crowned prince who took me. His touch like venom. His vengeance lethal. He craves a power I no longer hold, and he’ll sacrifice every part of me until he gets it. But I don’t belong to him. I belong to his brother. His brother who will come for me, consequences be damned. My fate is entangled between two princes—one who craves my power, the other who covets me—and I have more to lose than I ever imagined. War rages in a game between queens, and I have become their pawn. But I will fight for my life, for my mate, and he will raze kingdoms to get me back.",
