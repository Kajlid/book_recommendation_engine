  "description": "Lady Juliet De Mar is a confirmed bachelorette and a member of the exclusive London Literary Club, a secret sex club for the more libidinous of the London ton.  After taunting her childhood friend and wealthy sea captain, James Wakefield, with the club's bondage games, she finds herself once again longing for him to be something other than he is—a prude with no interest in sex. At least not with her. Tired of his annual visits that always end in rejection, Juliet decides to kidnap him and bring him to his knees—and to the altar—or end their acquaintance forever. But her plan backfires when she’s kidnapped herself and taken to the docks. Blindfolded and shackled, she becomes the property of a notorious pirate, the murderous Captain Black, purchased for his pleasure.  When her deepest, erotic fantasies become a dangerous reality, will Juliet be forced into submission?  Or will she learn what she needs to know to master James?",
