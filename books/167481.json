As Ash digs deeper into the case, she becomes entangled in a violent and unforgiving underworld, forcing her to adapt or die. DYING FOREVER (BOOK 4) As a down-to-earth professor of American folklore, Alison Bailey teaches her students that legends are a function of cultural memory, based in collective fantasy and fear.
