  "description": "Sex, The Illustrated History: Through Time, Religion, and Culture, Volume Two continues a daring exploration of human sexuality from the ancient to the modern world. This volume explores the sexual beliefs and practices of the peoples of Asia, Australia , Africa , The South Pacific, and the Indigenous Americas. Revealed are sexual practices and beliefs previously omitted or obscured from all historical telling. This work explores complex relationships between Eastern spirituality and sexuality. The author continues the exploration of religion’s control over sexuality, and the projection of women as both goddess and chattel.  The Illustrated History traces sexual attitudes from the transcendent to the bizarre, throughout the worlds’ cultures.These pages share graphic erotic artworks as well as explicit literary excerpts painstakingly culled from the hidden treasure troves of cultures throughout history. The often explicit illustrations are linked by historical and anthropological content, inviting the reader to experience sexuality through varied and often shocking cultural lenses. Each volume contains over 250 erotically -themed images that have been gathered by the author, in his travels and studies of world cultures. An encyclopedic tour of the sexuality of humankind!",
