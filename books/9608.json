  "description": "Falling in love is easy; staying alive long enough to enjoy it just might be impossible.Javan Rhodes, the hard-drinking, disreputable captain of space freighter the Kypris, took a mission to save himself from hitting the bottom of the food chain. Transporting Sola, a beautiful young aristocrat, from Earth to an unknown destination on the outer rim of the colonies is lucrative, but also highly illegal.As tough as it is to evade both the law and the lawless, the hardest part of the job is not falling in love with his irresistible cargo. Just as he decides that he will never be able to hand her over to the warlord she must marry, he discovers that Sola has been playing a very dangerous gameâ€”one that could not only cost them their lives, but could also affect the balance of power in an increasingly dangerous universe.",
