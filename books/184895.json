  "description": "When bad boy Jaxxon Slade comes back to his hometown to take a position at the local high school, the last thing he expects is to become entangled with his new stepsister. Not only is she too young, she’s his student and damn near family, all taboo. He’s trying to repair his image, though not too hard, but she isn’t making it easy for him. Brianna has her own agenda. She takes one look at the hunky new familial addition and decides to come out of her shell. Life has been mean to her lately, with her parents getting divorced and her dad moving on with a new family. She sees Jaxx as her escape. There’s just one thing she hasn’t told the man she’s given her innocence to, she’s on a mission to get bred.",
