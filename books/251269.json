  "description": "In Paul Greci's The Wild Lands, Travis and his sister are trapped in a daily race to surviveâ€”and there is no second place. Natural disasters and a breakdown of civilization have cut off Alaska from the world and destroyed its landscape. Now, as food runs out and the few who remain turn on each other, Travis and his younger sister, Jess, must cross hundreds of miles in search of civilization. The wild lands around them are filled with ravenous animals, desperate survivors pushed to the edge, and people who've learned to shoot first and ask questions never.",
