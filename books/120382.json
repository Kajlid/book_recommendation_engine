  "description": "*THIS BOOK IS FOR AUDIENCES 18 YEARS AND OLDER. NOT SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN* \"She was one horrible mess. Always looking over her shoulder and avoiding becoming too friendly with the neighbors. That anxiety stemmed from a horrible place. Always fearing that someone would recognize her face, she kept to herself and didn't go out much. When she did, no matter the season, she wore some kind of hat or covering on her head, enough to shield her face. Walter never understood why she was such a loner, avoiding people at all cost and just being very anti-social outside of the house. Houston was originally her home, not his, yet she didn't even want her own family and friends to know that she had returned. The only person she found herself being able to really open up with was Walter. And although she tried to make him feel otherwise, he knew that there was still a huge wall up that even he would never be able to see over or climb.\" Marisa had a secret and if it was ever revealed, it could cost her her life and her freedom.",
