  "description": "My name is Poppy Kramer and I am in a rut of epic proportions...I used to pride myself on being the epitome of an accomplished, independent woman. I had a thriving business, a handsome fianc√© and the delusional belief that everything was picture perfect. Happily ever after was on the horizon and my horse was saddled up and ready to go.Fast forward approximately 365 days later and my seemingly perfect existence has morphed into a state of severe self-pity, sprinkled with the bitter dust of apathy and an assortment of processed snack foods. Cue \"the proposition\"....My friend Kyle needs a girlfriend. I need to hit the restart button and end my self-imposed exile into craptown. An all-expense paid trip to Hawaii seems like a good way to start. And that's when things begin to get just a tad complicated....The Beard is a contemporary standalone romantic comedy. This is not an erotic romance but contains adult content and language and is recommended for 18+. Included in The Beard are two short stories, The Book and The Bet.",
