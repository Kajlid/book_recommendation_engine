As their prospects deteriorate, the League has no choice but to make a final stand against its foe and the army that supports him.“The Crimson League” is the first in a trilogy of novels about Herezoth and its magicked inhabitants, as they struggle to make names for themselves, or simply to survive, against prejudice and evil.",
