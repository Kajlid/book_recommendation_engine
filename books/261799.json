Now, the crew of the Aela Sunrise prepares to carry out an assassination against the King of Taria. Fadis and the Leaves of Saelmark have an impossible task, and it relies firmly on Kirla, the once mistress now turned rogue, and her very particular skill set.  At the same time, Evurn and Aeveam race to secure the lost city of the vampires with a host of elves and rangers before the rise of the Black Moon. The armies of the west are gathering but the cunning Vampire Lords have fought elves once before and what truly awaits them is a horror unlike any they have faced in the ages of the world.  The West tumbles towards its own destruction but can a few brave souls prevent the cataclysm?",
