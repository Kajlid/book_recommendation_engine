  "description": "Women, fighting demons, good food, and more women! That’s all Nephilim enforcer, Gemariah Slater cares about. That is until he meets a feisty little blonde that turns his world upside down. Like him, she has an unsavory past. Like him, she fights for those that can’t defend themselves. But when the similarities end, the claws come out.  Social worker, Nicole Summers, is trying to help the world one child at a time, NOT be swept off her feet by a tall, gorgeous yet overbearing, and conceited jerk. Conflicted with what her heart and her head tell her, she tries to keep her distance, but Gemariah won’t let her. Drawn to each other by a bond neither can explain and kept together by circumstance, they are not prepared for how their bodies or their hearts react to one another. As the two battle their desire, little do they know that unforeseen forces are resigned to see them suffer and fail. Will the two be able to protect what is theirs, or will they eventually succumb to the vengeful voice inside them?   Contains adult language and mature situations.",
