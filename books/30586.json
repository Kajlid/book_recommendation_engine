  "title": "Songs of the Pogo",
  "description": "This book contains words and music of 30 songs, suitable for as many occasions -- birthdays, clandestine trysts, medical checkups, elevator rides, evenings at the public library, police raids, music-to-pay-last-year's bills by. For the meaning and mystery of the words, as well as the introductions to each song, Walt Kelly shoulders the responsibility. Most of the music (it is arranged for piano but will also serve comb-with-tissue-paper, fife, and gong) was composed by Norman Monath. Kelly's drawings, all of them in color, are meant to explain Monath's music, whereas Monath's music has somewhat the purpose of explaining Kelly's text. It is the intent of this book to make people leave the TV sets of bars and grills to gather, singing once again, about the old family upright, and then soberly to return to the bars and grills and think things over.",
