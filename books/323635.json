  "description": "A decades-old pact offers a group of college friends the chance to throw each other “living funerals,” in the next poignant and humorous novel by the bestselling author of The Guncle. The night after one of their own is tragically taken away from them, a group of five college friends form a pact: a promise to reunite every few years to throw each other \"living funerals,\" constant reminders that life is worth living, if not for them then for their late friend.  Now, twenty-eight years into the hard-worn lines of adulthood, their \"funerals\" only remind them of all the opportunities they missed. But when one member of the old gang receives an unexpected diagnosis, the pact takes on new meaning, and each friend is forced to confront old secrets, and weigh their now-middle-age lives against the idealistic dreams of their youth.  A deeply honest tribute to selfhood and the people who keep us going, The Celebrants, coupled with Steven Rowley's signature humor and heart, is a moving tale about the false invincibility of youth, and all the beautiful ways in which friendship can transcend our deepest losses.",
