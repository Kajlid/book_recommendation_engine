  "title": "The Trials of Arthur",
  "description": "Looks like a tramp. Says he's a King. Meet Arthur - Warrior, leader and Druid. An ex-squaddie and biker turned spiritual leader and parliamentary candidate. The bearer of the Sword of Britain. Once voted the tenth most outrageous man in Britain by Loaded magazine, following an incident where he was naked in the Royal Courts of Justice. He is also - some would say - the legendary King Arthur, returned at last, fighting to revive the Wasteland and renew these islands. Don't believe him? Come with him on adventures and quests, through fields and forests and sacred places, to the mythical Britain behind the facade of our empty consumer culture. Regardless of whether you believe he is who he says he is, one thing is he's the best Arthur we have. \"Am I alone in thrilling to the sight of this noble throwback to the age of Celtic romance? Our Prime Minister is a grinning, charmless twerp; our Archbishop of Canterbury has as much spiritual charisma as a raw potato; and the House of Windsor is Dullsville. I'd dump the whole lot of them tomorrow and replace them with a single Royal, Spiritual and Political leader - King Arthur.\" A.N. Wilson, Evening Standard 1997 \"A haunting elegy to all those people who refuse to accept that they cannot make a difference in a world they know must change.\" Deborah Orr",
