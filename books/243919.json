  "description": "The most definitive volume on guerrilla warfare during the Civil War features a foreword by the distinguished scholar Bruce Catton and 22 photos and maps. Gray Ghosts introduces a cast of daring and dashing Southern John Singleton Mosby, Turner Ashby, and Harry Gilmore, among others. These men used irregular troops and even more irregular methods against the invading Union Army. A fast-paced narrative describes daredevil acts performed by these small, bold bands of fighters, and shows how, over and over again, they managed to thwart Union efforts. Defiant to the end, the “gray ghosts” and rebel raiders resisted surrender after Appomattox and continued to fight until all hope was gone.The most definitive volume on guerrilla warfare during the Civil War features a foreword by the distinguished scholar Bruce Catton and 22 photos and maps.
