  "description": "Sometimes going back home requires a big leap forward.Carrie Anderson---truth seeker, storyteller, journalist-at-large---is bad at social media and great at getting herself into trouble. When she’s fired from her dream job for an ill-advised tweet, she has no other choice but to return to the town where she grew up with her head hung low. It’s temporary after all. She can work at her family’s bed and breakfast, fix her finances, and get back to her life and home in Los Angeles.There’s only one not-so-little problem…the grouchy ex-NHL star making her rethink what home means.Jake Turner---great at hockey, bad at people---is not a happy man. Haunted by his past, all he wants is to disappear into obscurity, to get away from the scrutiny of the press he’s been under since going pro at nineteen. But when the press finds him, disappearing is no longer an option. Worse yet, the same journalist he’s trying to avoid is making him reconsider whether being forgotten is what he really wants.",
