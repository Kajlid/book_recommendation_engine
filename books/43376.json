  "description": "Faheem Kobi-Wynn watched a film on a large screen. The child star was Valencio Durano, Italian. The black-haired waif turned big eyes to the camera, looking pathetic in rags, but then shot a mischievous grin at a companion and was next seen bolting after stealing a wallet.Faheem Kobi-Wynn wanted to try a boy, and this was the most beautiful boy he’d ever seen. He nodded to the servant, approving the choice. In due course, the boy would be brought to him, untouched until he could have him. Meantime, he wasn’t sure what he wanted, but wandered to the Enclosure and asked that there be a line-up.‘Valencio’s Story’ is no simple adventure or romance. There is heartbreak and despair. There is also courage, friendship, and loyalty.",
