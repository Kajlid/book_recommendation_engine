  "title": "Broken Pieces and the God Who Mends Them: Schizophrenia through a Mother's Eyes",
  "description": "The onset of schizophrenia is often sudden and bewildering and something the church can seem ill-equipped to address. Yet, this condition is more frequent than most people imagine. Simonetta Carr shares her story as the mother of a son with schizophrenia and offers suggestions to others who find themselves in similar situations. Her hard-won insights are augmented with wisdom from psychiatrists, pastors, and people who successfully live with this condition.",
