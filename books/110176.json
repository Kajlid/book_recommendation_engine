  "description": "'It wasn't his heart she was after, she wanted his soul.' Could Scott Harper really be alive? This is a question plaguing beautiful and powerful Wren Poe. Is all the stalking and cryptic messages being sent by ghosts from her past or forces in her present who have something even more sinister in mind? When independent Wren signed up to join the commanding Talon Greenlee's state-of-the-art facility, she had no clue the past they secretly shared would lead them both to a future filled with mystery, danger, and possibly death. While their past continues to plague them, Wren discovers their story is not limited to her hometown but bridges from Seattle to San Francisco. Talon, a confirmed bachelor finds that Wren is not like other women and she intrigues him right into her tangled web. They soon both find themselves embroiled in an impassioned affair that makes it increasingly hard to focus on a possible future when the past has such hold on them. The more Wren tries to push Talon away for fear of her true feelings, she comes to the realization that there is desire and need...she needs and desires this man to fulfill her. Once she succumbs to her innermost feelings, she feels liberated and ready to take this man on. Despite all of her reservations and doubts, Wren knows one thing for certain. Without Talon to lean on, she would find the past all too ready to bury her. As they find themselves getting closer to the truth the more other forces try to come between them. When finally they have no choice but to face their demons.",
