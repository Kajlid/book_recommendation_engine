  "title": "Holding You Close",
  "description": "After serving a decade long prison sentence for an accident that resulted in my husband’s death, Noah Reid returns. Even if he was my childhood best friend and the first man I secretly loved, I refuse to make it easy for him. But the heart never forgets and those old repressed feelings quickly bubble to the surface.Loving him is a dangerous game but one I’m willing to play. Flirting leads to falling between the sheets, and I’m forced to deal with the guilt of what we’re doing. Viciousness towards Noah runs rampant and while revenge trickles through the streets of Lawton Ridge, I realize there’s more on the line than just my heart. While I’m afraid that my son and I will be caught in the crossfire of those who want to hurt Noah, I can’t walk away. Secrets are revealed and revelations are made, but losing him again isn’t an option—especially since I’m pregnant. HOLDING YOU AWAY is a slow burn, angsty friends to lovers romance with lots of small-town, Southern drama. It's book 2 in the Noah & Katie duet and must be read in order.",
