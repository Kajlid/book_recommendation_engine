Welcome to planet Earth, where a once-dominating species is defeated and outnumbered. Humans no longer rule the world. In fact, they're all headed for certain extinction. A new superhuman race, known as Suprans, has taken over. It has been eighteen years since the last human birth--children only live in the memory of survivors, and every remaining human is enslaved or in hiding. Yes, welcome to a new planet Earth, where Suprans are superior to humans in every way.  Twenty-one-year-old Deandria Hannah lives in a hidden mountain facility, along with hundreds of other human rebels. Together, they work to survive, fight back, and save their own kind, but a chain of events will lead Deandria to question all she believes in--including her feelings for Clinton, the only good Supran she has ever known. Deandria's enemies have killed nearly everyone she loves, but holding on to the past could be her biggest downfall.",
