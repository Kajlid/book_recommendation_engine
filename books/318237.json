  "title": "Red-Handed: How American Elites Get Rich Helping China Win",
  "description": "Peter Schweizer says that in his quarter century as an investigative journalist, this is the scariest investigation he has ever conducted.It's hardly surprising that the Chinese government is seeking to infiltrate American institutions. What is wholly new, however, is the number of American elites who are eager to help the Chinese dictatorship in its quest for global hegemony.Presidential families, Silicon Valley gurus, Wall Street high rollers, Ivy League universities, even professional athletes -- are all willing to sacrifice American strength and security on the altar of personal enrichment.In Red-Handed, six-time New York Times bestselling investigator Peter Schweizer presents his most alarming findings to date, revealing the secret deals wealthy Americans have cut to help China build its military, technological, and economic might. Equally astonishing, many of these elites quietly believe that the Chinese totalitarian regime is superior to American democracy.Schweizer and his team of forensic investigators spent more than a year scouring a massive trove of global corporate records and legal filings to uncover the hidden transactions China's enablers hoped would never see the light of day. And, as Schweizer's past bombshells -- such as Profiles in Corruption, Secret Empires, and Clinton Cash -- all made clear, there are bad actors on both ends of the political spectrum.Exhaustively researched, crisply told, and chilling, Red-Handed will expose the nexus of power between the Chinese government and the American elites who do its bidding.",
