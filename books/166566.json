  "title": "The Evidence for God: The Case for the Existence of the Spiritual Dimension: A Case for the Existence of the Spiritual Dimension",
  "description": "There is a level of being that is deeper than the physical universe, writes Keith Ward. It has purpose and value, and we can sometimes feel it and find in it resources of strength, hope and inspiration. Through an exploration of six areas of human experience – the arts, morality, philosophy, science, religion and personal experience – Ward demonstrates the existence of more than simply physical facts. His evidence builds to an impressive argument for a ‘sense for the spiritual dimension’ that is beyond and yet expressed in and through physical facts. Keith Ward is Regius Professor of Divinity Emeritus at the University of Oxford and professorial Research Fellow at Heythrop College, London. He is a Fellow of the British Academy and has written many popular books on philosophy, religion and Christian heology.",
