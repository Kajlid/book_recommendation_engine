  "title": "The Carpet People",
  "description": "In the beginning, there was nothing but endless flatness. Then came the Carpet...That's the old story everyone knows and loves (even if they don't really believe it). But now the Carpet is home to many different tribes and peoples, and there's a new story in the making. The story of Fray, sweeping a trail of destruction across the Carpet. The story of power-hungry mouls - and of two Munrung brothers, who set out on an adventure to end all adventures when their village is flattened. It's a story that will come to a terrible end - if someone doesn't do something about it. If everyone doesn't do something about it...This is a fantasy co-written by Terry Pratchett, aged seventeen, and master storyteller, Terry Pratchett, aged forty-three.",
