  "description": "A classic fantasy quest about finding the truth and finding yourself.Ariel has always been curious, but when she and her best friend Zeke stumble upon a mysterious old telling dart she feels an unexplained need to figure out what it means. Magically flying great distances and only revealing their messages to the intended recipient, telling darts haven't been used for years, and no one knows how they work. So when two strangers show up looking for the dart, Ariel and Zeke realize that their discovery is not only interesting, but very dangerous. The telling dart and the strangers lead them on a journey more perilous and encompassing than either can imagine, and in the process both Zeke and Ariel find their true calling.The Farwalker's Quest is a beautifully written, well-paced fantasy that fans of The Edge Chronicles and Nancy Farmer's The Sea of Trolls will enjoy.",
