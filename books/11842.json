  "title": "Golden & Grey: The Nightmares That Ghosts Have",
  "description": "When you have a ghost as an Invisible Friend, like Tom Golden does, you quickly learn the benefits. Grey Arthur supplies Tom with pens in class, grabs Tom's lunch when he forgets it on the kitchen counter, and generally helps him out as any best friend would do. It's just that, in this case, no one else can see him. But right as Tom is settling into a comfortable routine, his world is turned upside down once again when Grey Arthur starts a school for Invisible Friends -- drawing ghosts from near and far who are looking to learn the newest job in the ghost world. Before Tom knows it, he's being followed by a group of Invisible Friends in training as they watch his every move, practice their new skills, and do their best to fit in. Meanwhile, ghosts are mysteriously, silently disappearing, dangerously disrupting the balance between the human and ghost worlds. When some of their closest friends go missing, Tom, Grey Arthur, and the Invisible Friends in training jump into action to discover what's going on -- not only to rescue their ghostly friends but also to protect Tom's parents from losing their home. Louise Arnold's distinctive voice comes shining through in this brilliantly funny novel, a treat for established fans of the Golden & Grey series as well as those just joining the fun.",
