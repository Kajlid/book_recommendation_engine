  "description": "If Samantha’s Baker’s life were as simple as one of the movies she produces, when she – a latte-loving city girl - gets banished to the country and fights with the local hunk cowboy soon afterwards they’d fall in love. But everyone knows the movies aren’t real life! (And just FYI, Mr Cowboy, it’s not gonna happen!) Travis Hunt knows what it’s like to miss the city. He’s given up everything to take over the family ranch and become mayor of Emerald Creek. He has responsibilities. But how does he convince a gorgeous, hot-shot executive like Samantha to swap her stilettos for cowboy boots and her Friday night cocktails for country dance competitions? Small town life just can’t compete with all the hustle and bustle of New York City.   But what if it’s not  where  you are that you call home… What if it’s  who  you find while you’re there?  An opposites attract, fish-out-of-water rom-com perfect for fans of Sarah Adams and Abby Jimenez! Please note that this title was originally published as  Sweet Love and Country Roads.",
