Or do you take a chance and believe in her, and allow yourself to be swept up in an extraordinary adventure?This is the beginning of the dilemma that Arthur, a young San Francisco architect, is faced with when he discovers Lauren in his apartment.Arthur is the only man who can share Lauren's secret, the only one who can see her, hear her, and talk to her when no one else so much as senses her presence.

For, after all, it is only her love that can save him.A heartwarming love story that's impossible to forget, an adventure that is by turns breathtaking and hilarious, \"Just Like Heaven\" is a captivating tale that evokes the essence of romance and our boundless capacity to believe.",
