Still, he wonders if she was real or a dream spun of moonlight.Alexei might well be a temptation Pamela cannot resist...And Miss Pamela Effington is no dream. Certainly, succumbing to the prince's seduction was madness. Now she's come to her senses and is thankful their paths will never cross again. Even if they do, he had never truly seen her face.But they are both in for the shock of their lives. For back in London, determined to lead a blameless life, Pamela finds Alexei occupying her home—a townhouse she's only recently inherited—and he refuses to leave. A feigned courtship seems an excellent idea, and soon the mystery and temptation begin all over again.",
