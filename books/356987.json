  "description": "God never gives up on us. He remains steadfast in His desire to bless us, even when many of us are tempted to doubt His love. The great tragedy is that so many of us spend our lives trying to earn something we already have, the gift of life which God freely gives us when we decide to follow Christ. This amazing devotional from best selling author Neil Anderson will give readers back what the enemy is trying rob from them, an understanding of their special place in God’s family. Here are 36 readings and prayers based on scriptural passages that assure us of God’s love and our security and freedom in His kingdom.",
