  "title": "And Then There Were Nuns: Adventures in a Cloistered Life",
  "description": "Bestselling author Jane Christmas decides to enter a convent to discern whether she is, as she puts it, \"nun material\". But just as she convinces herself to take the plunge, her long-term partner, Colin, surprises her with a marriage proposal. Determined not to let her monastic dreams get sidelined, Christmas puts her engagement aside and embarks on an extraordinary year-plus adventure to four convents, one in Canada and three in the U.K. Among these communities of cloistered nuns and monks she shares, and occasionally rails against, the silent, reverent, pared-down existence she has sought all her life. With insight and humour, she provides a glimpse into a seldom-seen lifestyle.",
