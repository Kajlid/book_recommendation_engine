  "description": "Every night for thousands of years, he has been murdered and sent to the fires of hell… Cursed by the gods, bound to a rage-filled spirit he can barely control, Maddox has all but forgotten his humanity – until Ashlyn Darrow comes to his prison in Budapest seeking help. Maddox finds his anger is soothed by her presence. But he can’t help question why a beautiful innocent has come looking for the Lords of the Underworld. Ashlyn is tortured by voices from the past – and her knowledge might be enough to free Maddox from his death-curse. When an extreme sacrifice is demanded, will Maddox’s superhuman strength be enough to save them both?",
