Fifteen years ago, prom queen Carlee Kruger vanished. When Carlee’s mother asks Morgan to investigate her death, the clues seem as convoluted as the coils on a fossilized ammonite. The local newspaper editor joins the hunt to uncover the past, while the rock shop’s mascot donkeys and an elderly cowboy chase after a Sasquatch look-alike. Whoever knows what happened to Carlee will do anything to keep the truth buried. In book two of the Rock Shop Mystery series, amateur sleuth Morgan Iverson digs into gemstone prospecting to solve a Stone Cold Case.",
