In \"Mind and Body\" Glenn tries lying still, but his mind — The Wanderer — keeps thwarting his plans! In \"Getting Things Done\" he gives up trying to get to sleep and tries to get some things done...until the cops show up! All executed in Huizenga's strikingly crisp, lovely two-color \"clear line\" style.",
