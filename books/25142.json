  "title": "Lovesick Blossoms",
  "description": "In a small Kentucky college town in 1953, two married women desperately fall in love with each other, until a moment of indiscretion threatens to destroy both their lives. In her new adult novel, award-winning author Julia Watts creates a compelling, emotional queer tale of power and passion. Colleagues and neighbors of Samuel and Boots are more than willing to accept their married status, even though Samuel “dresses like a boy” and the pair’s relationship is one of convenience that will never be consummated. But when Samuel meets a new professor’s wife, Frances, at a faculty party, she soon falls in love, and learns the difficulty of discretion in a small town—with tragic consequences. LAMBDA award-winning author Julia Watts ( Needlework, Quiver ) returns to adult fiction in this heartbreaking, yet hopeful novel. Highly recommended for fans of Lauren Groff, Rosie Walsh, and Alexandria Bellefleur.",
