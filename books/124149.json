  "title": "Fly High, Fly Low",
  "description": "Fly High, Fly Low, a Caldecott Honor book, tells the story of two San Francisco birds who hatch some eggs in a very unconventional place--the letter \"B\" in the sign on top of the Bay Hotel. But what happens when the sign is taken down? Told with Freeman's typical humor and simplicity, the book features breathtaking vistas of San Francisco. Will's Quill tells the story of Willoughby Waddles, a goose in Shakespearean London who longs to be useful. When he befriends a young playwright named Will, Willoughby may have found the perfect way to help out--by giving up some goosefeathers. Could these feathers--and this friendship--be just what the playwright needs?",
