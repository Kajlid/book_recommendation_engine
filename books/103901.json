  "description": "After Luke sees the treatment the other prisoners receive as they travel to the mine, Jagger’s ownership is more critical than ever.Jagger has his harsh side, but considering the care he's shown, he’ll surely back off and stop pushing the one thing Luke isn't keen on. He's happy to serve in every other way, so why does it matter if he can't stand a certain, public activity?Guards have rules too, and they aren't to break the system they’ve grown among themselves. They expect each other to put their wants first, and a guard has to be careful about how much affection and care they show. Jagger can’t have a pet who refuses to fully submit. To protect them both, he'll break Luke to get rid of that last defiant spark, but can he do it without destroying Luke's spirit?Luke is sure he's ruined what they've built so far, and his only chance to keep their relationship might be to swallow his pride.",
