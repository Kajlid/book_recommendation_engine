  "description": "The year is 1895. Imagine an alternate Steampunk history where ghosts and demons are a normal part of life. Families known as the \"Great Houses\" control the economy of the Great States of America and the middle- and lower-class Irish's sole purpose is to not only serve them, but to rid their lives of supernatural beings. This is the story of an ex-Pinkerton detective, a spirit photographer, and a genius scientist who work together to battle these supernatural forces. They are the Boston Metaphysical Society. Wish them luck. They are going to need it.",
