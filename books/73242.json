Still, Kate’s betting that one day her scruffy horse will be a champion. Together they’ll win blue ribbons. They'll beat Angela Dean once and for all, despite the fact that Angela's now being coached a trainer who's as unscrupulous as she is.But can Kate do it? Even her best friend, Holly, is doubtful, especially when Angela spreads the rumor that Kate’s horse might be stolen property.",
