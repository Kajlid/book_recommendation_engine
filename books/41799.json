  "description": "Persephone didn't ask to be the guardian of Hades Dagger, an artifact Hades forged to turn demons into daywalkers and wants back. She didn't ask for the demon blood running through her veins that allows her to touch the thing, either. And she definitely didn't ask for Jax, a cocky Warrior, to barge into her life and proclaim himself her bodyguard. Suddenly, she has to deal with all three, along with an increase in demon attacks and the fact that members of the Order of Zeus keep turning up dead. When demons tell Persephone that she's one of them, she's appalledâ€”and a little intoxicated by the power she feels when they call her their queen. Telling Jax about her demon side might turn him away from her forever, but something bad is brewing, and if Persephone doesn't figure out something, and soon, she'll be responsible for unleashing Hell on Earth.",
