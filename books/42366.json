  "title": "The Woman Who Loved Jesse James",
  "description": "\"I never meant to fall in love with Jesse James, but I might as well have tried to stop a tornado or a prairie fire. The summer that sealed our fate, when we saw each other with new eyes and our love began to grow, Jesse was all heat and light, and I was tinder waiting for a match.\"Zee Mimms was just nineteen in 1864-the daughter of a stern Methodist minister in Missouri-when she fell in love with the handsome, dashing, and already notorious Jesse. He was barely more than a teenager himself, yet had ridden with William Quantrill's raiders during the Civil War. \"You'll marry a handsome young man,\" a palm reader had told her. \"A man who will make you the envy of many. But . . . there will be hard times.\" Zee and Jesse's marriage proved the palmist right. Jesse was a dangerous a loving husband and father who kept his \"work\" separate from his family, though Zee heard the lurid rumors of his career as a bank robber and worse. Still, she never gave up on him. And he earned her love, time and again.Cindi Myers is the author of more than forty novels, both historical and contemporary. Her work has been praised for its depth of emotion and realistic characters.",
