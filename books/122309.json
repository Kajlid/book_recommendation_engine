Addan is not only a Brazilian millionaire, he's the Latin lover who's haunted her dreams for years and who blames her for his brother's death! Expecting a confrontation, Ellen is amazed when Addan offers instead to show her the island. But how long can the truce last -- and where will their encounter end -- when the emotions between them go from hate to passion in a heartbeat?",
