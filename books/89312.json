  "title": "Owls",
  "description": "Owls command our attention. They are the quintessential emblem of darkness, evoking strong cultural responses. Northern Europe's 12 owl species range from the huge Great Grey, with a round head as large as a child's, to the tiny Pigmy Owl, possessing a strength and ferocity that belie its size. For Jari Peltomaki and David Tipling , two of the world's finest bird photographers, owls have become a passion. This book, Owls , explores the fascinating lives of owls, accompanied by riveting diary accounts from the authors' adventures photographing in Europe's wildest places. Encounters with owls are often fleeting - the hoot of a Tawny Owl emanating from a church yard or the white ghost-like flash of a Barn Owl momentarily caught in the headlights. Owls reveals their secret lives in spectacular pictures, many published here for the first time.",
