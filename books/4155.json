  "description": "The third volume in Nicholls's critically acclaimed fantasy finds Maras Dantia drowning in war. Stryke, head of the renegade orcs, and his warband have found the long-lost relic they need--but still do not know how to use it. And, while they try to figure it out, enemies hunt them from every corner. Worse yet, the three sisters are close to forming an alliance that will overturn history. Time is running out to save the world. Nicholls's masterworks are the first to tell the story from the other side--from the point of view of the orcs, the villains of Lord of the Rings.",
