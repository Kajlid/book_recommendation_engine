  "title": "Fear of Flowers",
  "description": "Determined to conquer his longtime and paralyzing fear of water, Sam signs up for swim lessons at the community pool. But a computer glitch has put him into a class of 5 year old beginners. To add insult to injury, his instructor, Lilly, is adorable and pushes all his buttons. But she wants nothing to do with him. Lilly has learned the hard way that loving a handsome rich guy is the path to heartache, and she knows for a fact that he sends flowers all over town. NO flowers for her. Can Lilly get over her \"fear of flowers\"? And can Sam get over his aquaphobia? Will they both learn that letting go and trusting is the key to intimacy and love?",
