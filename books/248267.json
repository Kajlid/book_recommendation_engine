  "description": "*** Top 10 Book ***Past-life regressionist Dr. Wallace McTavish leads a simple life but appearances can be deceiving. In addition to being a brilliant, successful psychologist, McTavish is also a self-healed man, and his funky Brooklyn, NY home doubles as an office, where he investigates past-life crimes and passions. Twenty-four year-old Laura Tsvetkovsky has long experienced such passion. Her refusal to live in the present with the outside world, her sycophantic mother, and struggling family leaves Laura to her pathological dreams of becoming a dancer. Dreams that will never come true. Were it not for her pills and mysterious friends, Lauraâ€™s life without the use of her legs might be hell, but Dr. McTavish reveals there's another way to heal past and present with hypnotic regression.Creating suspense regarding the origin of Laura's pain, we journey to 1592 Catalan. Laura's past life joy with Marko is contagious, until the Spanish Inquisition sets terror loose in her Romani community and propels this soul from past to present in a heroic tale toward its hopeful, compelling conclusion.",
