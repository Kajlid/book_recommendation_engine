  "description": "From flooded refugee camps in Thailand to posh gourmet restaurants in Maryland; from corporate boardrooms to cholera camps in Bengal; from US Naval bases to Maya ruins in the jungles of Central America; Vampire Chimeras carries you along on its tense roller coaster plot. How will Dr. Diana Rigsby, a seasoned medical researcher and physician, stop a rampaging hemorrhagic fever threatening the lives of those she loves....especially if it arose out of something she may have created. Not just a medical thriller, Vampire Chimeras is filled with cutting edge science, backing plausible plot twists, spun out as a multiply layered moral play, providing lots of points of debate. It's filled with metaphors forcing the reader to ask, who/what are the real Vampires? The Chimeras?",
