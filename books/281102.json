But David is determined to survive, protecting the one thing the rise hasn't taken from him—his adopted son, Salim.When Salim goes missing, taken during one of Messinger's raids, David is desperate to get him back—even if that means facing the wrath of Messinger and the Australian Defence Force.But he won't be fighting alone.",
