Sky is a nurse and after two attempts on her life, moves to South Padre to live with her baby sister Cassie, a brilliant prodigy, in hopes of eluding her stalker. Cassie is in over her brainy head when a local heart-breaker and fire fighter, Javier Rios pursues her. He is attracted to her natural innocence and beauty but thinks she is only a restaurant delivery girl. He falls hard for the geeky, Masterâ€™s degree wielding Marine Biologist. Sky tries to fit in and be patient when she realizes that she is falling fast for Zach but he is on the rebound and cautious. When the storm comes ashore and the island is evacuated, Sky and Cassie are trapped in the fortress-like hospital with a woman in labor, a heart attack victim and the stalker. Locked out, Zach and Javi use their own unique talents to breach the impenetrable medical facility, each sacrificing something of great personal value in the process. The easy going Zach is forced to step way outside his comfort zone and fight to protect the woman he loves.",
