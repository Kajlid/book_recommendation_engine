  "title": "A Time of Protest: Suffragists Challenge the Republic: 1870-1887",
  "description": "We have “greater cause for revolution than the men of 1776” radical suffragists contended as they demonstrated, risked arrest, committed civil disobedience, refused to pay their taxes, ran a woman for U.S. president, and petitioned for their rights as citizens of a republic. They illegally presented a Woman's Declaration of Rights at the Centennial celebration in 1876, protested the Statue of Liberty as a mockery at its unveiling in 1886, and claimed the Constitution didn't represent them in 1887. These principled women did it, they said, for the women 100 years later. The empowering story of feminism's legacy of nonviolent civil disobedience is brilliantly told for the first time by a pioneer movement activist/historian, Sally Roesch Wagner. A founder of one of the country's first Women's Studies programs, and one of the first women to receive a Ph.D. for work in the discipline.",
