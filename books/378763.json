  "description": "Pastel colors and deceptively simple rhymes soothe and calm as wonderful, magical polar bears serve tea, or picnic on the moon. Why is it so pleasant in the company of bears? The Bears always see the real you, and treat you special. No need to pretend anymore, just be your real self. Warm fuzzies, over-sized book, museum quality illustrations.Winner of a Benjamin Franklin Award.",
