  "description": "It’s taken years for Dawson’s band, AudioLock, to finally ‘make it’. Okay, maybe they hadn’t made it yet but they were invited to perform on the big stage at Rocktoberfest. Driving the beat of the band warmed his soul but Dawson really wished there was someone to warm his heart and bed. Ben Williams’ passion for music and theater is all-encompassing but he doesn’t have a talented bone in his body. However, he does have the mind and personality to manage everything that happens when the curtain goes up. His ultimate goal of being a stage manager for a major rock band is in sight. He didn’t think anything could change his focus until a certain drummer appeared on Ben’s stage. Dreams within reach, are Ben and Dawson willing to change so they can sync rhythms together? Syncing Rhythms is part of the multi-author The Road to Rocktoberfest 2022 series. Each book can be read as a standalone, but why not read them all and see who hits the stage next? Hot rockstars and the men who love them, what more could you ask for? Kick back, load up your kindle and enjoy the men of Rocktoberfest!",
