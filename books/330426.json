It's crowded with two families in one small apartment, but Rebecca is happy to share everything with Ana, even her clothes! At school, Rebecca is determined to help her cousin learn English and keep up in class, in spite of the other kids' teasing. But when the teacher tells her to include Ana in a special performance, Rebecca panics--Ana's broken English will ruin the show! Rebecca realizes this is one thing she does not want to do with her cousin. But how can she explain this to Ana?",
