  "description": "After waking from a frightful nightmare, Abigail Lingston is alarmed to find that she is no longer herself. Her body is no longer under her control, and her mind is now inhabited by another entity, something terrifying and spiteful and heartless. After a tragic accident that leaves her roommate in critical condition and Abigail questioning her own sanity, Abigail finds herself in a new world, Fosha. At first glance, Fosha seems flawless?a perfect haven. However, shadowy manifestations of emotion, nicknamed Reefers, haunt its corners and alleyways, terrorizing citizens with feelings that should have died long ago. Only an elite few, guarded with resistance and armed with artificial purifiers called ?Facultas?, can hope to destroy them. Yet the holder of the true, pure Facultas is Fosha?s only stranger, and with the burden of an entire world on her shoulders, Abigail is unsure of how to handle the pressure?",
