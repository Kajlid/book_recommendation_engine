  "description": "When the spare heir finally bails, he finds his royal flush in the most unlikely place.Cavanaugh Michael Barclay, the oh-so-charming spare prince of Mardelvia, has ditched his royal duties to start anew in a quirky little North Carolina coastal town called Sailfish Banks. Everyone knows him as Cav, the oddly accented guy who's now the proud owner of a rat-infested fixer-upper. He may be out of his princely element, but he's all in for a fresh start without the royal pressure.Maxine Waddell is a force to be reckoned with - a sledgehammer-wielding single mom who's the total opposite of any woman Cav has ever known. She's fiercely independent, unapologetically herself, and has him completely captivated. With every swing of her hammer, she knocks down walls he didn't even know he had. She's the kind of woman his royal family would never approve of, but that only makes him fall harder.As their undeniable chemistry heats up, so do the hidden secrets that always seem to find their way to the surface. Will the people of Sailfish Banks embrace a prince in their midst, or will they hold fast to their small-town traditions? And is Cav truly ready to trade his crown for a chance at love and a new life in the land of sweet tea and Southern charm?",
