Carren, 25-year-old African American, a low income earning single mum living a neighborhood with the highest crime rate in Brooklyn is going through a big crises in her life. She’s faced with the uphill task of finding a job that will help her earn a steady income to take good care of her son’s welfare to prevent social services from taking him away.  After several failed attempts she’s downcast and nearly gives up when her friend, Minaj helps her find a decent job as a waiter in a popular restaurant in Brooklyn.  But as things start to turn right side up, she comes in contact with Johnson, a rich super star player in the NHL and her son’s role model.  Johnson Brown, a player for the New York Islanders, nearly murders her happiness when he accidently under the influence of alcohol knocks her son unconscious. He doesn’t take responsibility for his action immediately in attempt to save his public reputation.  Ironically, instead of filing charges against the rich superstar and getting settled in a whooping amount of money, she finds herself falling in love with him instead to the displeasure of her friend.
