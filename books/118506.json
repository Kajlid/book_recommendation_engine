  "description": "Sass is like a little sniffer dog for bastards. So after her sixth successive break-up, she makes a decision.No men. No sex. No problemo.Right? “The Dating Detox really delivers the laughs. Gemma has a brilliant way with words. The dialogue was sparkly and sharp, the situational comedy well observed, and the various bastardos (in particular, Rick) total comedy brilliance. This book is slightly left of chick lit. While it contains all the elements of the genre, it does so with a fresh, unabashed take on the lives of women. I loved it. I’m pretty sure you will too.” – Novelicious.com",
