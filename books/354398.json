  "description": "In The 10 Rules of Rock and Roll Forster takes readers on an exhilarating trip through the past and present of popular music from Bob Dylan, AC/DC and Nana Mouskouri through to Cat Power, Franz Ferdinand and ... Delta Goodrem. To accompany Forster's acclaimed writing for The Monthly, there are some stunning new pieces 'The 10 Rules' and 'The 10 Bands I Wished I'd Been In' and an appreciation of Guy Clark as well as a reflection on The Velvet Underground, a short story about Normie Rowe and a moving tribute to fellow Go-Between Grant McLennan. Funny and illuminating, The 10 Rules of Rock and Roll shows a great critic at work.",
