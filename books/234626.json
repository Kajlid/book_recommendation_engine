  "description": "Chloe has been waiting for this night for a long time, saving her virginity so that she could share it with her future sorority. Delta Delta Phi was an elite sorority, it was worth the frustrated nights and angry boyfriends. * * * * * “You need to be blindfolded, but don’t worry, I won’t let you out of my sight. Is that all right?” Emily whispered into Chloe’s eager ear. “Yes please,” she remembered without pause this time. The room was so dark, she only realized she was being blindfolded as the cloth teased her eyes. Feeling the material press against her face as Emily made sure it was securely tied; Chloe felt vulnerable, which she realized was the point. “There are two other women in this room,” Emily spoke softly as she began to lead Chloe forward. “We are going to help show you the potential for pleasure that your body is capable of.” A finger that was not Emily’s reached out and began to wonder along Chloe’s thigh, making little circles as it slowly roamed. Heart racing, Chloe couldn’t take full breaths, she had only been intimate with a small number of people and now a stranger was running her finger along her inner leg... * * * * * This story has a passionate FFF lesbian scene with hints of BDSM. As well as a dominating MMMF group scene. Interracial female and male scenes",
