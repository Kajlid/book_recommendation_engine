  "description": "Zoe's life is pretty dull. She works at the town library and lives in a small, peaceful neighborhood. Her only problem is a man who can't take no for an answer. Savage has always been a solitary man and likes it that wayâ€”until he comes upon a woman being attacked. He steps in and messes the guys up. His first look into Zoe's beautiful eyes ignite emotions he never knew existed. But it's her courage that makes him want to claim her as his own. Zoe puts herself on the line for him and the club. Savage's never had a relationship in his life, but he's damn well keeping this one.",
