  "description": "After San Diego firefighter Jake Rawlins is injured in a heroic, high-profile rescue, he decides to hide from the media and recover in solitude. So he retreats to the Blue Flame, the Arizona guest ranch he inherited from his father. The remote oasis under a clear azure sky might seem like a bit of heaven, but Jake finds himself longing to return to the city, where he can be lost in a crowd instead of alone with his thoughts--or-his spread's tempestuous manager.Callie Hayes has put into the Blue Flame her heart and soul--both of which are shaken when her wildly sexy employer returns, rekindling memories of the stormy past they shared. But Jake's a different man, and soon he's setting off sparks that could lead to a love hot enough to change both their lives.",
