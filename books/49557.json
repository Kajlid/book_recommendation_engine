  "description": "The epic, final installment in the Asylum Trilogy. Sanity is a funny word. Sanity. Sanity. To be sane. To have clear thoughts. To be able to distinguish the difference from fantasy and reality. I used to think that my sanity was still intact. That all of my marbles were still in the bag known as my mind. That I would never—EVER—let Oakhill get the best of me. Now, I’m not so sure. Now I’m not sure if I really am sane… Or if I’ve lost my mind once and for all. There will be two spin off novellas for Aurora just so you know. And the first one will be up soon so keep a look out!",
