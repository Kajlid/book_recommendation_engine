  "description": "Julia Dupre was once the proudest beauty of the New Orleans social circuit and known as a belle all over the state. With her flowing blonde tresses and piercing amber eyes, she commands the hearts of men to bow before her, despite her indifference to their flattery. But Captain Rudyard Thorpe is a different sort of man than she is used to...his arrogant self-confidence angers her, his disrespectful impertinence enrages her...yet he is the one man who understands the storms that rage inside her. Drawn into nefarious plotting with the Captain, whom she so despises, she winds up a penniless orphan and is forced to wed him against her will. Their passionate relationship escalates, leading her into a life of danger and decadence. But to quiet the conflict within her, she is forced to admit the feelings in her own heart.\"",
