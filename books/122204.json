  "description": "“The Price You Pay” unravels in mid-1970s Jersey City, a crumbling town where violence and coercion reign. Young Mickey Wright is thrust into a world controlled by a powerful Teamster local associated with the Genovese crime syndicate. The man who puts him in jeopardy: his father, a free-wheeling policeman well-known to Jersey City's politicians and drug dealers. When a Black trucker is murdered, Mickey is forced to choose between loyalty to family, the Teamsters, or to values he shares with Debbie Olsen, the love of his young life.“The Price You Pay” is rich with vivid details and the kind of propulsive yet compassionate storytelling that defines Fusilli’s career as one of today’s most admired mystery writers. As in his novels “Narrows Gate” and “The Mayor of Polk Street,” he proves once again that he knows how danger can explode when the mob, police, and politics are intertwined. As for Mickey and Debbie, there is a way out. Will they survive to take it?",
