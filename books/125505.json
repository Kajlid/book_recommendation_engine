A brilliant work of original creativity with a voice all its own. Bravo!\" — Amazon reviewer Tildy Sullivan is the middle child in an elite yet fading Manhattan family.

After her mother’s death, she’s persuaded to abandon Ireland and the love of the local boy, Aiden.When Tildy volunteers for a lucid dreaming experiment, it gives her all she wants – a life lived for her family during the day and a secret, perfect Ireland of her own at night. Will she face reality, or succumb to the ease of her dreams? As featured on Writer's Digest, Fresh Fiction, The Irish Echo, and more, The States is a modern reimagining of Jane Austen’s Persuasion, a story of love, obligation, and second chances.",
