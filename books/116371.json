  "description": "Ty had heard her voice while photographing the beautiful Windsor Ruins, and then, amazingly, at sunset, he saw the ghostly home among the surviving columns. Just as he recovered from that shock, the owner of the voice calling his name stepped into view. After days of desperately trying to see the house again, he happened upon a portal to the real life post Civil War home, and Callen stood before him, calling him by name. How did she know his name? Why did he feel such a connection? Could he get back to his brother and be the only parent his brother knew, or was he trapped in time? Did he even want to go back? Falling in love with Callen only made his decision harder. But first, he had to find the portal again to see if he could even return to the 21st century.",
