  "description": "Because of mature content this book is intended for ages 17+  The saying \"You got handed the short end of the stick\" didn't even apply, I'd never even seen the stick, let alone the short end. Ashton Becker has lived her entire life being trapped in a nightmare she can't wake up from. For as long as she can remember her parents have abused her both physically and mentally. She knows there has to be more to life than this and she finds it when she gets accepted to boarding school hundreds of miles away from everything she has ever known. She jumps at the opportunity to finally get outâ€¦ Charlie Ingram is the town's golden boy. He's handsome, a promising hockey star, and student body president. To everyone around him his life looks picture perfect and he's set on the path for greatness. The only problem is he hates the robot-like person he has become. What happens when these two meet? Will their paths lead to each other or will they both be too focused on Getting Out?",
