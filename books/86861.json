  "description": "Bailey Glicks, an accountant, is all too aware of her asset value. She’s pretty but not beautiful, smart but not a genius, and certainly she thinks she is more than enough for her fiancé. All that changes when she catches his cheating ass in a lie. Needing to get away and start anew, she heads to New York to stay with her best friend and start a new job. Her life becomes complicated when the assets in audit she’s working feel like they’ve been tainted with fraud. However, that’s not her only complication. New Year’s Eve, she meets a sexy stranger at a ritzy hotel. By all accounts, Kalen Brinner with his implied wealth and attractiveness shouldn’t be interested in her. But their combined sexual attraction sparks off like fireworks. Can they survive the heat or will they combust in the flame of their own passion? Circumstances make one of them appear less than trustworthy. And if she’s not careful, she could lose big. One her heart. The other her job. Warning ~ This book contains adult language and sexual situations.",
