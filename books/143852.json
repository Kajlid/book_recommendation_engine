  "description": "\"The most bizarre financial mock-epic of our age. Read it open-mouthed; wonder and shudder.\" - \"Independent\". This is the story of the largest corporate take-over in American history. With a stake of $25 billion, the battle for the control of RJR Nabisco during October and November 1988 became a symbol of the greed and power-mongering of the eighties. This gripping narrative reveals the truth behind a Wall Street gamble that sent shock waves through the international business world. The rules were never pay in cash - never tell the truth - never play by the rules. \"All the suspense of a first-rate thriller - one of the finest, most compelling accounts of what happened to corporate America and Wall Street in the 1980s.\" - \"New York Times Book Review\". For their coverage of the RJR Nabisco take-over, Burrough and Helyar received the prestigious Gerald Loeb Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism.",
