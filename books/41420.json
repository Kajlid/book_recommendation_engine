Twenty-six-year-old Annika has it beauty, money, a great career, and a wealthy husband who seems to adore her, or perhaps obsesses over her, might be a better description. She sacrifices everything to escape. Now her husband wants his sex slave back, or he wants her dead; either one will do.Annika is running for her life when she encounters Ray O'Brien, the man she once loved with all her heart, and the man she holds responsible for a terrible deed. He seems to have it all, including a Derby contender. Now Annika has a frightening choice to make. Does she let Ray just walk away, or does she sacrifice her own hard won freedom in order to get revenge?",
