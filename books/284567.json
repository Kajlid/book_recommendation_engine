  "description": "I've always been told I can't have my cake and eat it too. But when celebrity baker Michael Godwin wants a piece of me... how can I deny him?\nSam Davis has been fan-girling over Michael “The Cake King” Godwin for years. So, when she receives a letter from Godwin asking her to compete in a private baking competition where the prize could pull her (and her adoptive family) out of poverty, how can she say no?There’s just one problem: Sam is an amateur baker from a no-name restaurant in a tiny town nobody’s ever heard of. How is she supposed to hold her own against some of the country’s best up-and-coming pastry chefs?She’ll have to dig deep and discover what she’s really made of if she wants to win because the prize here isn’t just first place. It’s The Cake King’s heart.This RomCom is a silly but very sexy take on baking competitions, billionaire romance, and sugary sweet happy endings. Full of bawdy jokes and brilliant besties baking their way to a happily ever after, each of the Sugar and Spice novellas are meant to be devoured in a couple of hours and--taking place over the same two weeks--they can be read in any order.",
