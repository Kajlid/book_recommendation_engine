  "description": "The iconic writer's travel log from the uncharted shores of West Africa. Leaving Europe for the first time in his life, Graham Greene set out in 1935 to discover Liberia, then a virtually unmapped republic on the shores of West Africa. This captivating account of his arduous 350-mile journey on foot - a great adventure which took him from the border with Sierra Leone to the Atlantic coast at Grand Bassa - is as much a record of one young man's self-discovery as it is a striking insight into one of the few areas of Africa untouched by Western colonisation. Journey Without Maps is regarded as a masterclass in travel writing.WITH A FOREWORD BY TIM BUTCHER AND AN INTRODUCTION BY PAUL THEROUX'One of the best travel books this century' Independent",
