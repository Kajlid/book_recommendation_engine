And no restraints… Professional football player Bryan Townsend is sidelined for the next two weeks while he recovers from a knee injury. The upside? He'll get to attend his sister's wedding. The downside? He's not sure he'll have a spot on his team when he returns. So when he's confronted by a sexy blast from his past the night of the bachelor party, he sees an opportunity to seduce the very stunning maid of honor. But Bryan had no clue Jill St. John was still a virgin. Or that she was merely looking to expand her sexual repertoire without having to trust anyone with her heart. But with every encounter, Jill can't help but fall for the man Bryan's become. The clock is running down. If he's to win it all, Bryan must make the biggest play of his career—choosing between his team…or the woman he's always wanted.",
