What’s more, she’s put on a few pounds lately...Sharing a house with three gorgeous girls doesn’t help. Her sister Gail got more than her fair share of the good genes, Keisha is an ice-cool man-magnet and Bronwen is so hip it hurts. With competition like this, is it any wonder Alex feels so inadequate?

Never one to choose the easy option, Alex realises she needs to up her game if she wants to stay in it...",
