  "description": "“Downie’s attention to day-in-the-life period details, judiciously doled-out twists, and dry British humor make Incognita one hell of a toga party.”—Entertainment Weekly Following her widely acclaimed, New York Times bestselling debut, Ruth Downie sends beleaguered army doctor Gaius Petrius Ruso to the uncivilized borders of the Roman Empire, where the Roman-controlled Britannia meets the independent tribes of the north. Ruso, unwillingly pulled into the murder investigation, is appalled to find that his slave T illa is spending time with the prime suspect. Soon both Ruso’s and Tilla’s lives are in jeopardy, as is the future of their burgeoning romance.",
