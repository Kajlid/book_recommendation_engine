  "description": "The Back-Up List has only ever been a joke- that's it. Madison Grey has a celebrity crush list of possible replacement husbands ready with the off-chance her husband might inexplicably vanish. Clearly, Madison was not prepared for- A. her husband's untimely death and B. Calvin Hunt, rock god and top man on her Back-Up List to begin crushing on her. Talk about your cruel cosmic ironies. It has only been six months since her entire family was killed in a tragic accident and he's looking to her for a hook-up! Really? Calvin Hunt, rock icon, is living the dream of any womanizing man-whore- that is until he spots the first unavailable woman he's ever met. What the hell? Is she gay? He's busily seducing her with concert tickets and exotic getaways, all while he's touring. There are plenty of obstacles he'll have to overcome to be with her and he'll need all the help he can get from his stoic bodyguard, his nosy Oprah-channeling brother and even Madison's bizarrely quirky friends who are all fighting to cross his name off of Madison's Back-Up List.",
