  "description": "In an increasingly tumultuous world, knowing God is by your side can make an enormous difference, bringing strength, comfort, and peace. In Searching for God, the Precious Treasure, in My Daily Life, Rev. Peter G. Vu helps you see God’s presence in everyday events and find the encouragement necessary to thrive in times of challenge. Through prayer, acts of charity, and interactions with others, you will see that God is before you, behind you, and all around you, a benevolent guiding force to help you walk the path of the righteous.My name is Rev. Peter G. Vu, a Catholic priest of the Diocese of Grand Rapids, Michigan, for twenty years. I was born in Saigon City (currently Ho Chi Minh City), Viet Nam. I was a young boy when the Viet Nam War ended. I witnessed the war and the end of it with great horror and deep appreciation for peace. I had to grow up with the communist government system and endure lots of hardship with them for over a decade. What helped me and many of my countrymen tremendously during those dark days were our faith and prayers. Hence, my love for prayers and meditations was able to blossom. Also, I was able to learn and exchange new ideas of prayers and meditations with many of my Buddhist friends. We got along quite well in spite of our different faith traditions.“A portion of the proceeds from book sales will benefit the American Red Cross and the Catholic Relief Services, in addition to other charities”.",
