  "title": "This is me",
  "description": "This is not a story about cutting off body parts to survive, or going to brink of existence in an unforeseen twist of fate. This is an adventure born from watching old movies and programs of people living and travelling in the Alaskan/Canadian wilderness. It is a story of a solo quest to get to Alaska by kayak with very little experience, surviving in the wilderness along the way; it’s a story of learning to believe in yourself when some others think you’re crazy, of putting one foot in front of the other each day, and of trusting your wits to get you out of a situation if it all goes wrong. Some describe it as crazy, some say it’s a spirit quest. All I know is that I needed to do it, so I did.",
