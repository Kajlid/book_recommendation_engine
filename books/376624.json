  "description": "Over one million copies sold! Those simple yet extraordinary events in your life happen for a reason. A coincidence—sometimes a silly little thing—changes the course of your day or even your life. Is it chance, or is God communicating with you? A surprising answer to prayer comes at just the right moment. Could God be showing you that He cares about the details of your life? Bestselling author SQuire Rushnell says these silent little miracles are godwinks —messages of assurance that no matter what is happening in your life or how uncertain things may seem at the moment, God is with you and will help you move toward certainty. When God Winks at You is packed with true stories demonstrating that God does communicate with us, making incredible things happen in our lives every single day. As you read the riveting accounts of everyday and famous people—including Tim Conway, Billy Graham, and Don Knotts—you will begin to recognize the godwinks in your own life, both past and present. Through these tangible signposts from God, we receive personalized messages that reassure us, stop us from worrying, chart our path in life, and help us keep the faith. With delightful warmth and familiarity, SQuire has masterfully crafted a timeless collection of inspiring and faith-building stories that can be enjoyed again and again.",
