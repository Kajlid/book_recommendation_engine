  "description": "“I bet I can get married before you, Eloise Sanders.” That was the challenge that my best friend, Bryce Hawkins drunkenly issued to me on the evening of the day I’d moved in and become his roommate and told him that I had a plan to get married within two years.Bryce has been my best friend since Kindergarten and we’ve both suffered through each others crazy relationships. In a nutshell, we both suck at love. However, now that I’m back from teaching English abroad, I’m ready to focus on meeting my Mr. Right. Only Bryce doesn’t believe that I have what it takes to be in a long-term relationship and I’m so ready to prove him wrong.I’ve always known that Bryce is a womanizer; with what seems like a different woman every month, so I’ve no worry that I will win the bet. But things in our friendship have started to get weird: seeing him without his shirt on has suddenly made me see him in a different light and sharing his bed to watch movies at night has me thinking naughty thoughts. Not to mention that he’s been oddly confrontational and rude about the dates I’ve been going on.I want to win the bet, but now I’m wondering if the man I want to marry has been under my nose all along.",
