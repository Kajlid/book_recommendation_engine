  "description": "Forensic facial reconstruction artist Matti James tries to mend a troubled relationship and learn how highly placed her neighbors are within the Russian mob. Two horrific homicides near Las Vegas teach Matti the hard way that killers don’t want victims identified. Worse than that, the female victims are mad as hell they’re dead. After Matti completes the two reconstructions, she realizes she’d spoken to both women shortly before they were murdered. Did her questions inadvertently cause these Russian hookers to die— or is something more sinister involved?",
