  "description": "These poems are at once tender, vulnerable, biting, heartbreaking, and hilarious. One moment you are laughing, the next moment drying your eyes. Edward Hirsch, judge of the Four Way Books 2002 Intro Prize says of Buddha’s Dogs, \"There’s a ruthless authenticity—a deep cherishing—in Buddha’s Dogs, a splendidly mature first book of poems that is filled with moments of Proustian recall, with the comedy and the anguish, the beauty and the burning of lived experience.\"",
