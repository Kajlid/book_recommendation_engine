  "description": "From Fire, Walk With Me:Looking back, it’s easy to see that my world had changed from what it once was. But what happened, and how it happened, that is the mystery. Some say desire is like a bright sun beating down through holes in an old rusted tin roof, but it isn’t like that at all. Not until you feel the blunt force of what you want, or what you think you want, it isn’t yours to hold. And soon, I found something that pierced the armor of my heart.Perhaps it was the smell of his sweat that had my heart beating so fast that I thought it would lodge in my throat, I don’t know. The music was loud, so loud that the bass thumped like a metronome in my chest. The smoky haze of lights shone upon his dark hair and eyelashes. There was no talking, but conversation wasn’t what I wanted anyway. I went with one purpose - to find someone. Someone who wouldn’t text me the next day, making me regret they existed. Lasting relationship? No thank you. Not again. Never again.Show More Show Less --------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
