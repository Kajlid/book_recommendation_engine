  "description": "It is close to the winter solstice when Maeve Lewin’s simple trip to Scotland to re-unite with her mother throws her headlong into a dangerous world.A prophecy written centuries before seems to describe her as ‘the one’, and despite Maeve’s insistence that this couldn’t possibly be true, her mother and grandmother both agree that it is. What Maeve doesn’t know is that her boyfriend, Harold, is part of her destiny, mentioned in the ancient text as ‘the one of noble birth who will stand by her side’. But Harold’s only plan is to join Maeve in Scotland for the New Year before the two of them fly home to the States. The night of the winter solstice brings Maeve face to face with a terrifying reality, but it’s Harold’s arrival that forces her to come to terms with the truth. He seems to have lived in this parallel world before and his part in future events has been sealed as surely as hers. With dark forces hunting her relentlessly and confronted with a fate she didn’t choose, Maeve must come to terms with her future and somehow find the strength to fulfill the perilous task set before her.",
