  "title": "Return of the Sleeping Warriors",
  "description": "It is a world where magic once ruled. Where mystical beasts and power-hungry magic-wielders fought for control. The balance ever shifting between order and anarchy. It is our world and the struggle is all but forgotten. Old legends whisper of the battles once fought, folklore gives hints of the dangers that still exist, but it all happened such a very long time ago. And you cannot believe every old fairytale you read, can you? Michael has been dealing with a lot lately. A creepy family moving in next door. A relaxing family holiday where a strange discovery leaves him anxious and unnerved. And now he’s having recurrent nightmares. Nightmares shared by his sister Dana. With an ancient evil starting to unlock its powers, Michael must accept his family’s legacy and come to terms with their emerging abilities before their quiet Melbournian street is turned into a warzone.",
