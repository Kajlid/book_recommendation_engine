  "description": "Shakespeare believed there was always humor in tragedy and tragedy in humor.My life proved his theory as fact.At eighteen I was a single parent moving to this small town to be with the man I loved. The one who was supposed to love and cherish me in return.Finding out he had a wife was tragic.Remaining in love with him in spite of her was more tragic.My mom and best friend setting me up on a long string of blind dates was an ongoing tragedy.Nine years later, I’ve learned to see the humor in most situations.My mom and best friend setting me up on disastrous blind dates.My son’s jokes.The fire alarm going off each time I cook.My constant bright spot always adding to the humor was my son, Hayden. But when Hayden had a life-threatening allergic reaction, the man who came to help my little boy became my own savior. His laugh, his smile, and the way his eyes lit up when he spoke to my son made him a beacon of light in both our lives.But I wasn’t the only one who noticed him.When I began having feelings for the man my best and only friend had fallen for, I knew following my heart would once again lead to a fresh round of heartbreak.Love led me to this town.Lies kept me there.Would history repeat itself?Or had life just thrown me another Curveball?",
