  "title": "Twirling Naked in the Streets and No One Noticed: Growing Up With Undiagnosed Autism",
  "description": "Jeannie grew up with autism, but no one around her knew it. Twirling Naked in the Streets will take you on a journey into the mind of a child on the autism spectrum; a child who grows into an adolescent, an adult, and becomes a wife, mother, student, and writer with autism. This is a gripping memoir of a quirky, weird, but gifted child who grows up never quite finding her niche. It took 38 years to discover that all the issues, problems, and weirdness she experienced were because she had Asperger's Syndrome (AS), a form of high-functioning autism.The tale begins at age three and takes us all the way through her diagnosis. Along the way she explains autism in a way that will have fellow \"Aspies\" crying tears of joy at being understood, and \"neuro-typical\" people really starting to grasp the challenges that autistic people face every moment of every day.",
