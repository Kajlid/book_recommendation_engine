  "title": "Theodora: Empress of Byzantium",
  "description": "Theodora's meager beginnings as the daughter of a bear-keeper could not have foretold her astonishing future as the wife of Justinian, the powerful ruler of the Byzantine empire. With a gift for performing, Theodora became an actress in burlesque theater as a young woman. By all accounts, fans of her bawdy act were legion, and she leveraged her popularity in whatever way she could. She eventually caught the attention of Justinian, who was no doubt charmed as much by her beauty as by her cunning.Justinian and Theodora ruled the empire together from their rich and bustling seat of power in Constantinople, making decisions and strategic maneuvers regarding the fate of their kingdom that would reverberate for years to come: they waged battles against the Goths and Vandals, quelled nationalist unrest in Egypt and the Middle East, and suppressed a rebellion at their doorstep by mercilessly slaughtering 30,000 in Constantinople's stadium. Theodora's wisdom and counsel to the emperor saved Justinian's empire -- and their place in history -- time and time again.Hailed by European reviewers as \"Book of the Year\" upon its publication in Italian, Paolo Cesaretti's book gives the reader a balanced portrait of an intriguing figure who, in the face of those who tried to defame her, rose from the ranks of the poor to build an empire at the side of her ambitious husband.",
