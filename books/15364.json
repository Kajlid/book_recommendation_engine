He had learned long ago to hide his feelings behind laughter and his desires behind snark. Until Regina. There was something about the lovely doctor that went way beyond having a little fun. She brought out things he didnâ€™t know how to deal with and made him face a past he thought dead. Remy decides it is definitely time for some therapy, and he knows just the doctor to see.",
