  "description": "Roxana (1724), Defoe's last novel, is the autobiography of a woman who has traded her body, at first for survival, and then for fame and fortune. Many consider Roxana as a proto-feminist character who criticizes an eighteenth century patriarchal society, claiming, for instance, that \"the Marriage Contract is [...] nothing but giving up Liberty, Estate, Authority, and every-thing, to the Man\". This edition uses the rare first edition text, with a new Introduction, detailed Notes, textual history and a map of contemporary London.",
