  "description": "The New York Times bestselling author of Dark Torte and Double Shot delivers another knockout novel featuring Colorado caterer Goldy Schulz. Goldy Schulz is thrilled to be catering a holiday breakfast feast for the staff of the Aspen Meadow Library. But her merriment goes cold when she spots a woman lurking in the stacks—a woman with a striking resemblance to Sandee Brisbane. The Sandee Brisbane who shot and killed Goldy’s ex-husband, the Jerk. It sure looks like her, but it can’t be because Sandee is dead. Or so everyone believes. But the holiday madness is only just beginning. Soon the body of Jed Borholtz, a former district attorney turned high-end map dealer, is found in a corner of the library—with a map worth thousands of dollars hidden in his clothing. Goldy is convinced the allegedly dead Sandee Brisbane is involved. Now all she has to do is prove it—if she can stay alive that is. . . .",
