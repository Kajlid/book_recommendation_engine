  "title": "Caught Mediochre-Handed",
  "description": "Things are not looking so good for the nation of Mantically Aware Britain. The politician in charge is corrupt and inept; the outside world is willing to enact some pretty drastic measures to retain some semblance of order; and when a number of exceedingly-dangerous criminals get accidentally released, any control anyone might have had on the situation quite rapidly dissolves. In the kind of turn of events that amateur dracologist Charlotte Johnson is pretty-much used to by now, it transpires that, once again, the course of events from here on out may rely significantly on the actions and experiences of her mentor Mediochre Q. Seth. Trouble is, the actions and experiences of Mediochre Q. Seth are starting to look increasingly suspect as the ghosts of his past catch up to him. And Mediochre Q. Seth has an awful lot of past for those ghosts to come from. Telling the good from the bad is becoming more difficult, and Mediochre might not be holding together so well this time.",
