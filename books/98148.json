  "description": "Troy York’s smart, easy going, controlled when needed and never loses his **** over anything. That is until he met the exotic Alana. Alana Spencer was an up-and-coming model. Gorgeous, witty but swore off men for the time being. When her first boyfriend—who went on a business trip then came back in love with another woman—broke her heart, she vowed then not to have sex until she’s married. Troy and Alana become acquainted, friendly almost—until Troy wagers a bet. If he wins, Alana has to spend a whole month with him. Monday to Friday are date nights, and weekends she has to spend them in his apartment. Troy plays to win. Alana will do everything to make him lose. What happens when things become too intense for any of them to handle?",
