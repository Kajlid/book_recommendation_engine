Through the chaotic aftermath, Juvela leads the hopeful to safety within a set of mysterious ruins, but are they already claimed? Whilst leading them, the divine addiction is taking root within her, something she's triggered in her flight from doomed Ossard. The deep hunger of soul feeding has overwhelmed and enslaved every god it has touched; how can she, only newly into her own godhood, possibly beat it? And if she can't, what of the divine war she was born to trigger? Yet hope remains... Ossard's Hope follows the unique tale first begun in The Fall of Ossard.",
