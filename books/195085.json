  "description": "Hester Trueblood can’t deny having an ancient, Sumerian goddess in her head has its perks.She enjoys her new strength and fighting abilities, things that would have been useful when she was a soldier. And the two handsome men dedicated to serving and protecting her are a nice bonus too.On the other hand, there are drawbacks. Having Inanna’s voice inside her head 24/7 can be annoying, and the constant threat of demons and monsters is a dangerous nuisance. The bitchy goddess and the evil hordes are problems Hester can handle, but the adoration of a demigod has Hester off balance. None of that matters when an old secret threatens to destroy Hester’s family. To battle the goddess of witchcraft, Hester will need all of Inanna's powers along with the help of her devoted soldiers--and even a love-struck demigod--if she wants to survive.",
