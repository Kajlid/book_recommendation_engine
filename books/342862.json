  "title": "Tiny Tyrant",
  "description": "Welcome to Portocristo, its clear skies, sandy beaches, bustling streets--and its spoiled rotten, six-year-old king. The little despot is grouchy, whiny, outrageous...everything you'd hate to find in a boy on a throne. But here in Portocristo, anything he says goes, no matter how bizarre or harebrained. Sit back and watch young King Ethelbert swap his country's kids for Ethelbert robots, test his bodyguard's mettle by putting a price on his own head, shrink the world down to his size, bring a dinosaur back from the past...And that's only a tiny taste of the zaniness ahead. Trondheim's deliciously inventive writing, coupled with artwork evoking the classic, wacky styles of Mr. Magoo and Pink Panther, ensure an experience as memorable as kangaroos bouncing on pogo-sticks.",
