  "description": "Raven has certain unique skills, and they've helped him to survive on the fringes of a civilization that has no place for his kind. When he uses his powers to do more than merely survive, however, he unwittingly thrusts himself into a world where it seems that most people want to control him, and use his skills for their own ends. Forced into the shadowy realm of spellcraft, runes and ancient magic that lies just behind the thin facade of the modern world, Raven struggles to navigate the narrow road between warring factions of sorcerers, delving deeper into his unknown past, discovering the true nature and scope of his unusual talents, and learning how to wield them - not only to survive, but to shape his destiny, and that of the world around him.",
