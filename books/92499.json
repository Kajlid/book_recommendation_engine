  "description": "Jack's heart started pounding. His hands were slippery from sweat as he twisted the grips on the bike. He couldn't help but glance back at the approaching sedans, his gaze drawn toward the danger like a moth to a flame. Jack almost jumped off his bike when he heard a voice through his earpiece. 'Incoming call.' Jack answered, and the same female voice from earlier whispered in his ear. 'Run, Jack.' Tom can't remember to match his socks and may be hopeless with women, but he is undeniably brilliant. His intellect is about to be put to the ultimate test his older brother, Jack, has been kidnapped, and it's up to Tom to rescue him. The all-powerful Originalist government rules 2041 America with an iron fist. Armed checkpoints and vast ghettos dominate the country. Before Jack was kidnapped, he stumbled upon an explosive secret that could start a bloody revolution, but he managed to pass a message to Tom just in time. Will it be enough to save him? When Tom discovers his family is part of a covert political movement, he must put all his hope in the Fourteenth Colony.
