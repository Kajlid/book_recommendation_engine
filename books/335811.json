  "title": "Lies My Liberal Teacher Told Me: Debunking the False Narratives Defining America's School Curricula",
  "description": "A college professor debunks the false liberal narratives which define much of America's school curricula.In 1995, James W. Loewen penned the classic work of criticism, Lies My Teacher Told Me, a left-leaning corrective that addressed much of what was sanitized and omitted from American history books.But in the more than two decades that followed, false leftist narratives--as wrong as those they supplanted--have come to dominate American academia and education. Now, in the spirit of that original book, Professor Wilfred Reilly demolishes the academic myths propagated by the left. In Lies My Liberal Teacher Told Me, he offers fresh angles on \"established\" events, turning what we think we know about the nation's history on its head.Reilly explains how there actually were communists in Hollywood; how the cultural stereotype of Native American culture as completely peace-loving is both untrue and patronizing; and how, while history was almost always bad for Black Americans, history was much worse for everyone than we realize.Smart, irreverent, and deeply researched, Lies My Liberal Teacher Told Me will revolutionize our understanding of America's past while offering a refreshing way to teach and think about history.",
