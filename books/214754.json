  "title": "I, Richard",
  "description": "Hailed by The New York Times as “a master of the British mystery,” award-winning author Elizabeth George is one of our most distinguished writers, cherished by readers on both sides of the Atlantic. Her first collection of short stories is an extraordinary offering that deftly explores the dark side of everyday people—-and the lengths to which they will go to get what they want most....In five tantalizing and original tales, George plumbs the depths of human nature-—and human weakness—-as only she can. From the chilling tale of a marriage built on an appalling set of lies that only death can reveal...to the story of a squabbling set of Anglophiles saved from a killer thanks to Inspector Thomas Lynley...to the final, title story about a penniless schoolteacher whose ambitions turns murderous, I, Richard is filled with page-turning drama, danger, and unmatched suspense.Ironic, revealing, and undeniably entertaining, this imaginative collection proves once again why Elizabeth George is one of today’s best-loved authors. I, Richard belongs in the library of each and every mystery devotee.",
