  "description": "The older men in a small mining town all long to have sex with the young preps from Zayre College, but not one of them will ever give the older guys the time of day. Then they encounter Danny, by far the best looking Zayre boy of them all. He is every top's dream. He is sweet, adorable, and he never says no. Danny is new to sex, and he's just discovered that his deepest desire is to please older men and do whatever they wish. But it's far too risky for someone as gorgeous as Danny to let every man have him, and Danny doesn't know how to stop. Who will rescue him?",
