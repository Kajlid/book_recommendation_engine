  "description": "Nate Pritts' Big Bright Sun probably feels so thoroughly lived because reading it feels so like living in it. Robert Creeley wrote that for him in poems \"the world came true.\" In these poems the world comes true. And how! All this sky glued to the trees and the world surface by the resin of sun-soaked American speech! You can feel this book poised listening to itself and all the light, sound, thought and feeling passing through it. Passing through on its way towards all its directly addressed others, us readers included. \"Let's be everlasting today,\" this book, at one point early on, proposes. Let's. -Anthony McCann",
