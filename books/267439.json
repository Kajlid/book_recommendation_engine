They must avoid uncontrollable fires, unstable buildings, and deadly fallout contamination. Dakota knows of a place to ride out the coming chaos--a safe house deep in the Everglades. If Logan helps her rescue her sister, she'll take him with her. But Dakota's past has caught up to her. Amid the radioactive ruins of Miami, someone is hunting her. And he won't stop until he has her...or they're both dead.
