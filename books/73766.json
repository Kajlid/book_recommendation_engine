  "description": "In 2009, Betty Slade painted an oil of Mary Magdalene titled “Mary, Do not cling to Me.” She said that the eyes in this portrait haunted her and she felt Mary Magdalene had something to say. \"I saw her pain and her yearning to tell me about her redemption. From a life snatched away in childhood to an unbearable demon possessed existence, she buried her inner self. She flaunted her pride and lost her dignity. When she came to herself, she turned from the seduction of lies, blew out the red candle, and wrapped her soul in the promise of redemption.\"Mary Magdalene struggled with many of our present-day issues. The answer she found was in plain sight. Love is the fulfillment of every soul, and it comes in the morning light begging to be let in. History will do as it wishes. It confuses truth, compounds guilt, and shackles reality, but love is stronger than history.Spirit of the Red Candle: Journal of Mary Magdalene is the first in The Scarlet Triangle Series. Mary Magdalene yearns to be free from the seven demons clutching her soul. Her journal chronicles her life in Magdala and her struggles to break free from demon possession. Mary Magdalene's life unfolds from bondage into belonging.From the Journal of Mary Magdalene:The red stain of the pomegranate on our lips will linger through the night, but his words have been etched in my heart. I will travel with him. I will taste the strange new fruits from the lands he will show me. The chill of the wind cooled our mounting passion but not before I captured his heart.",
