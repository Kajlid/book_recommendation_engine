In 1943, a boy who lived in the home vanished.Caleb hears the stories about what may have occurred so many years ago, but he passes them off as folklore until one day hes alone in the woods and hears the faintest whisper. Did someone in the distance just call his name? And what about his discovery in the hayloft? Could there be something to those old stories after all?The initial need to dismiss everything as coincidence becomes a soul-searching journey into the past where Caleb is determined to uncover the truth about what really happened to the missing boy. And in the process, he learns even more about himself and whats really important.",
