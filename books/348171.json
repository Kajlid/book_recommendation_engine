  "description": "Since THE SCREWTAPE LETTERS was first published in 1943, half a million copies have been sold in the United States alone.This edition includes a substantial new preface from the author who tells the reader something of the writing of the book, and answers the question often raised as to whether he \"really believes in devils.\" The answer involves discussion of devils and angels in literature, art and life. \"My symbol for hell is something like the bureaucracy of a police state or a thoroughly nasty business office.\" The edition also includes a new Screwtape piece, \"Screwtape Proposes a Toast,\" and should find a new generation of readers for the wittiest piece of writing the 20th century has yet produced to stimulate the ordinary man to godliness.",
