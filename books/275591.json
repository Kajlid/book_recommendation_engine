  "title": "The Power of Persuasion",
  "description": "Beth Durban is persuaded to write a letter to the editor's page of a national Sunday newspaper in response to a film critic's prejudice against adaptations of Jane Austen's novels. When she receives an unexpected visit from the newspaper's critic, F. William D'Arcy, she is bemused but, after several sightings of the inquisitive journalist, she's neither pleased nor amused. Beth is so distracted by the unwelcome interest from such an arrogant man she fails to see that a close work colleague is falling in love with her. As a scientific researcher in a Scottish University, she has led a varied life travelling the world, spending time in New Zealand, Canada, Australia, America, Singapore and Israel. With such a full life, she has had little time to form any serious, romantic attachments that might lead to a permanent relationship. When she decides to take driving lessons, Beth opens up new opportunities for herself and realises that perhaps she isn't too old to find love after all.",
