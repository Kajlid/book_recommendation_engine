  "description": "An outcast among his own kind, Rat has always withdrawn from others and lived life by his own rules. Rejected and shunned so many times, he’s resigned to the fact that he’ll always be alone and almost convinces himself that he’s happier that way. That all changes in one instant when he receives a call from a lost shifter named Keegan. Scared and on the run from Ravens, Keegan is in hiding and Rat knows if doesn’t go rescue the man, he’ll be dead within hours.What Rat doesn’t expect though is to fall instantly in lust with the lost shifter as soon as they finally meet. That’s the last thing either one of them needs or wants though. Not only is Keegan still adjusting to the fact he’s a shifter, but there’s also the fact he’s the feline leader’s younger brother. Which means the man is off limits. But as they face more danger and get closer, Rat knows he’s powerless to fight his growing attraction to Keegan. Will Rat finally be able to go of his past to embrace a future with his new lover, or will he forever be destined to live life alone?",
