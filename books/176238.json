  "description": "Colm Herron could be described as different. He gave up writing at the early age of 21 and came out of retirement over thirty years later to produce For I Have Sinned , a Joycean journey of the mind that he says wouldn’t let go of him till the last word was written. His first story-telling career began when he was seven. At that time he wrote stories on discarded exercise book sheets and sewed them together on his big sister’s sewing machine before selling them to classmates at a penny apiece. Three years later he was telling cliffhangers every Saturday to the denizens of the local gambling and snooker hall. Colm’s abiding memory is that these big wasters seemed to enjoy this weekly break from misspending their lives. When he was 14 he had a play on BBC Children’s Hour and at 21 he was bringing his short stories to Brian Friel, a near neighbour and emerging playwright. Friel told him, \"This stuff’s better than what I was doing at your age. Keep it up\". But Colm came away from these meetings unimpressed and remembers thinking, \"This guy’s going nowhere. I don’t know why I came to him at all\". Colm gave up writing and decided to live instead. Meanwhile Brian Friel took off and while his plays were showing worldwide for the next thirty years and more, a story was kicking and turning in Colm’s head. Now it’s been told. Now it can be read.
