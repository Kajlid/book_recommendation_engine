  "description": "This is the story of how I died…repeatedly. J has been cursed for all eternity. In her very first life on Earth, she made the mistake of falling in love with her sister’s betrothed… and it was all downhill from there. In revolutionary France, J and the other members of Marie Antoinette’s court are forced into hiding, desperate to escape a wild uprising out for their blood. From there, she is reincarnated in America in the late 1800s, where she disguises herself as a man in the Confederate army and is surrounded by carnage and blood. In Austria in the 1930s, she became the only hope for her Jewish friends’ survival against the Nazi storm. Now, as a 21st century teenager, she faces mountains of extracurricular volunteer work and a ruthless bully all on her quest to get into a competitive college. Talk about a bummer. Beside her in each life, Sebastian finds himself on the wrong side of every battle. Always a soldier, he makes it his mission time and time again to rescue J with the hope that maybe someday they’ll get the chance to be together, if only that were possible. They say that everything happens for a reason, but can J and Sebastian find a way to break their curse and finally make a life together?",
