  "description": "In this second story of the Rough Boys series, Abe finally finds Ty, but is he too late? Is Ty too broken to be fixed? Admitting to himself that he’s gay and in love with Abe may be the key to Ty’s salvation, but his father’s cruel abuse has conditioned him against the love of another man. And his father isn’t finished with him yet.Dani’s faith is put to the test when he feels abandoned by Nigel. Is he brave enough to listen to his heart and put the pieces of their romance back together?Sean falls hard for Kaeden, but the beautiful, exotic femme is not interested in a drug addict who isn’t wealthy enough to support him in the lifestyle he craves, even if Leather’s drummer has a heart of gold and superstar talent. Kaeden’s rejection could just be Sean’s ruin—and his own as well.Publisher’s Notes: This story is the second in a series. We recommend reading Rough Boys: Runaway first. This story contains content which may be offensive to some readers: extreme violence, substance abuse, offensive language, and detailed descriptions of M/M sex. No underage sex.",
