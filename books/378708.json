  "description": "A Killer Without A Conscience.The crimes are barbaric. The victims are found in desolate rural areas, naked and impaled on long wooden stakes. There are no clues. No DNA evidence. Just a message, etched over and over again on one broken body: \"I have returned.\" Without Control. FBI Agent Sam Markham's last investigation ended with a serial killer's death and Sam's promotion. But back then, Sam had luck on his side. This time, the murderer's methods are evolving too fast, his bloodlust growing too swiftly. This time, no one is safe. Without Limits. With each mutilated body, new depths to The Impaler's brutality are revealed. And as the clues finally slip into place, Sam will discover how easy it is to cross the line from hunter--to hunted. . .",
