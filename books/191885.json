  "title": "Two Alone, Two Together: Letters Between Indira Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru 1940-1964",
  "description": "Such a fusion of the public and private worlds confers on these letters a distinctive quality. Sonia Gandhi Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter Indira Gandhi were eloquent and prolific letter writers. The letters in this volume, selected from the extensive correspondence between the two over more than forty years, are like conversation on paper but more revealing , as Sonia Gandhi observes. Intimate, articulate and unreserved, they provide illuminating new insights into the character and personality of two of the most towering figures of modern India. Remarkable for their honesty, sensitivity and humour, and replete with vivid descriptions of major personalities and events of their times, the letters chart Indira Gandhi s development from a shy, frail schoolgirl into a charismatic political leader; they reflect the love of nature and books that father and daughter shared, and reveal their candid views on a variety of subjects, ranging from family and friends to issues of political and national importance. Above all, this volume reflects the depth and tenderness of the relationship between Jawaharlal and Indira, and the formidable moral and physical courage that was the hallmark of both personalities.",
