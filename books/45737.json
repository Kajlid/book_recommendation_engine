  "description": "Tor Baker is a builder. A person that creates the magic that makes the kingdom of Noram function. At least he will be one, if his first project hasn't failed miserably, and if he manages not to be expelled from school for taking unscheduled time off to try it. What Tor doesn't know is that his innocent little project has caught the attention of some very powerful people, and the world he thought he knew his whole life, is a lie.Between his own innocence, and a world filled with royalty and power, the humble little baker's boy from the backwoods is going to have to scramble if he doesn't want it to all fall apart, or end up in the gallows for making a few simple mistakes.",
