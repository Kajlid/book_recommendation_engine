  "title": "How Trump Is Making Black America Great Again: The Untold Story of Black Advancement in the Era of Trump",
  "description": "Explore the unappreciated benefits African Americans enjoy thanks to Donald Trump.The election of President Donald Trump has been portrayed in the mainstream media as a doomsday event—especially for America’s racial minorities. And yet, reality has proven quite the contrary. Not only are African Americans employed at a greater rate than any other time since the late 1950s, black business formation is at an all-time high. In this groundbreaking book, longtime academic and political commentator Horace Cooper explains how Trump’s economic policies—including lowering taxes, eliminating stifling regulation, and renegotiating trade agreements—are producing an unforeseen boon to Black America. This book provides a philosophical framework through which Trump’s presidency can be viewed as a benefit to Black America, rather than a stumbling block.",
