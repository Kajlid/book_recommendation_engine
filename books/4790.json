There was no liner fast enough to escape it.Against incredible odds, the British Navy set out to hunt down the ship that could change the course of World War II...C.S. Forester, the creator of the immortal \"Hornblower\", spent months of research before he wrote this book. It is clear, dramatic, fast-paced and full of suspense.
