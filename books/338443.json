  "description": "This book is a collection of stories. The carnival is coming to town. Not any ordinary type of carnival, but Carnivale Diabolique, the only barrier humanity has against the demon portals. In Monica Jackson's \"Fire Song\", Lyric Adams is unsure of what's happening to her. A strange power within her is budding and she senses evil unlike ever before. She is a delicate, fragile-human, but is discovering that she was born to oppose, fight, and kill demons. Is it cruel fate that that the love of her life is a demon? In Seressia Glass's \"The Sharpest Edge\", Anaru, the Weapons Master of the carnival, must find the woman who can unlock the time capsule buried beneath to reseal the portal. Camryn Lowell's nightmares have been increasingly filled with terror, but when she is attacked she decides it's time to run. Luckily for her, she runs right into Anarua's strong tattoo-covered arms. But will his desire for her be enough to keep her safe? In J.M. Jeffries's \"The Mistress of the Beasts\", Delki Okello, the new, untried Mistress of the Beasts, is tracking a Shohar demon. Her search leads her into the arms of the very handsome, charismatic Detective Lee Townsend and his young son, who has become the demon's next target. Will Delki be able to do her duty or will her growing love for a lonely man and his fragile son be her undoing?",
