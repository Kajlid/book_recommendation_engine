  "description": "One, Two, Family is a children's book also suitable for toddlers. It tells the story of one family comprising of a mother, a girl and a boy. This particular family is very much like most, in which more often than not there are two parents and one or more children, but it differs from most in that this is a single parent family.Michal Keidar is a clinical social worker and psychotherapist, a graduate of the psychoanalytic psychotherapy program in Bar-Ilan University, and a single mother to Ella and Iddo. The book, written privately for her children and called Ella and Iddo's Mother, answered some of their and other children's recurring questions. Since other children and parents enjoyed the book and read it again and again, it was decided to publish it in the hope that it would be interesting and useful, and bring joy to others as well.Nurit Yuval is an Illustrator and editor, whose pen and brush have produced many books for children and youth. She is married, a mother and a grandmother.",
