  "description": "Cast out of his native California, \"relocated\" to an armed camp, and made a victim of almost unbearable family loss, Billy Fujita finds himself in the coldest reaches of Massachusetts in the closing months of World War II. A spirited widow, Margaret Kelly, has helped secure his release in the hope that Fujita, a horticulturist, will turn her barren land into a working farm. Together with Margaret, a war widow named Livvie, and her damaged young son, Garvin, Fujita becomes a reluctant participant in an impromptu family. Providing a profound new perspective on the Japanese-American experience, What the Scarecrow Said is the story of how even in the harshest soil the roots of love and family can survive.",
