  "description": "80 years ago the worst war in human history began. 10 years ago it ended. At least that's what the history books say. But everyone knows; history books lie. The war never ended. It's still going; there just arenâ€™t enough people alive anymore to dispute it. My name is Kalina. My father is chief of my people, the Forgotten. The rebel scum, you may know us as. Pirates and swindlers. But we're not. We're just people fighting together to make a stand against injustice. Making a stand for our freedom. But it's not that simple though; freedom and justice. Who chooses what is and what isn't right? Who chooses who lives and who dies? Someone once asked me, who are we to stop a war? I ask you, who are we not to?",
