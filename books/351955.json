  "description": "The daughter of a powerful sports agent, Melissa McKnight has harbored lust-filled fantasies for Dominic DiMarco ever since she was an awkward teenager, when the San Francisco Outlaws' gorgeous wide receiver became her father's superstar client. Now Melissa's a beautiful, tenacious associate in her father's firm, and being around to-die-for hard-bodies is all in a day's work...until tangling with Dominic at a photo shoot blindsides her with passion.  Dominic has built a flawless career by being in control -- on and off the field. And despite his intense desire for Melissa, he's not about to seduce his agent's daughter -- until Melissa stages a power play to break free from her domineering father and winds up at an edgy bar on the wrong side of town. Dominic thinks he's rescuing the innocent Melissa he met years ago...but one night of sizzling passion reveals a woman with no limits -- including a penchant for hot sex in public places. If anyone's breaking all the rules of seduction, it's sexy, irresistible Melissa.  But Dominic has a secret from years ago -- one that could ruin his sterling reputation and take Melissa along with him. Will his bad-boy past bind them closer together? Or will they crash and burn?",
