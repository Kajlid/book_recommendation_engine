  "description": "They were just friends out for the occasional drink together at the local wannabe British pub. The kind of guys who don’t really fit in with the older gents, but kind of wish they could. Five the skeptical unimaginative money man; the belligerent bore; the one with the shady past; the typical family man; and the bookish glasses wearing geek. But then the boys met Jack, an abrasive old drunk with a penchant for storytelling. And Jack could tell a tale, he’d suck you right in. Tell you a story so real, you’d swear it was true. And therein lies the problem, because Jack really does know the truth, he can read it off of you. He can read you like a book.the plausible narratives is an engaging read. Told through script dialogue, short stories, and a first person narrative, the book explores relationships and morality. The novel centers on the incredible possibility that for everyone one of us, there is a book being written. A book that will go into a library after our deaths… for anyone to read.",
