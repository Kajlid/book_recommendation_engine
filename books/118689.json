  "description": "Every day, we witness a church full of people professing to know God. There are those who feel the need to let others know how long they’ve been members of their congregation. “I’ve been here since the foundation was laid. I know more about God than you do.”…“I was born in this church, so you can’t tell me anything about how ‘we’ should run it.” The idea of what God wants from us has been lost for so many generations. We think that our membership at a particular church makes us saved and automatically makes us righteous. But, oh, how wrong we are. God’s Word came to set us straight. Religion is not what He came to teach. He came to teach love, faith and repentance. Let’s go back and establish a foundation for our Christian walk. Let’s go back to the basics!",
