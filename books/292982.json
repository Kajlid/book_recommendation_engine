  "description": "It was just supposed to be a fling. It would end and we’d go our separate ways. I should know by now nothing in my life is ever that simple.  When Jamie Miller knocks on my door ten months after we ended our … whatever it was, I promptly punch him in his smug face, for no other reason than I feel like it and he deserves it.  It’s probably not the best way to handle things, but I’ve never been good at doing things properly.  When he tells me he’s my new landlord, my whole world is rocked.  But Jamie? He wants to prove to me he’s more than an egotistical jerk and for some reason he’s decided he wants me.  I don’t think love is in the cards for me, and definitely not with Jamie, but he’s determined to prove me wrong.",
