  "description": "I’m not a good man, but I’m damn good at what I do.I was raised to be ruthless, and as muscle for the Petrov mafia, that’s all I am.Then she got caught in the crossfire, and when it was over, she was mine - given as a temporary gift. Once a mafia princess, now just a bargaining chip, she wasn’t a part of my plans.She’s scared, alone, and has the most perfect, innocent baby blues that beg me to protect her.There’s not an ounce of good in me. I don’t deserve her, but I want her. I want her sweet submission and tempting curves, at any cost.Even if I have to kill every f*cker who stands between us.This good girl belongs to me.This is a standalone, full-length mafia romance with a filthy-mouthed, possessive bad boy. Dark mafia themes throughout. Guaranteed HEA.",
