  "title": "Travelers' Tales: The Road Within: True Stories of Transformation",
  "description": "The Road Within is a very different kind of travel book, a venture into the hidden territories of the human spirit and heart. It is a book of transformation, of lessons learned, maps drawn and burned, and spiritual blessings bestowed by that great and hard teacher: travel. It will show you what the great mystics and saints have always known - that you are closer to yourself, the world, and God, than you can possibly imagine, and that wondrous things await you on your journeys.",
