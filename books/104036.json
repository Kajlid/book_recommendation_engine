  "description": "http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00ED5WTAWHow differently would we live if we knew that every aspect of our lives was part of a beautiful and purposeful design by our Heavenly Father? Our lives would be much more fulfilling if we fully understood that the temptations and hardships that come into our lives are permitted by God to help us grow closer to Him.  Author Jacob Kodesh unveils the biblical reason why God permits Christians to go through tough situations in their lives. Relationship issues, finding a job, and finances are areas that we all have struggles in from time to time. Why is that?  While we are going through those tough and uncomfortable situations we pray, but God doesn’t seem to be listening. We trust Him, but it appears He’s letting us down. We believe His Word, but His promises are coming up seemingly empty for us.  All our lives we've been taught and prepared for the times when God is speaking to us and blessing us, but we aren't as prepared for the times God seems silent in the midst of our need. It’s in these times of desperation and temptation when our faith is tried.  Hope is on the horizon, God has not and will never leave you nor forsake you especially in times of crisis in your life. This book discusses in depth God's divine purpose for trials in the life of the Believer and what we must do in order to be blessed once we come out of the tough situation.",
