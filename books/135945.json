  "description": "Finding happiness is just as easy, and difficult, as letting goâ€¦  The only good thing Gabe ever had in his miserable life is Malcolm. Having met in college, they were dorm mates, friends, and now business partners in a marketing web design business. Except from day one, Gabe has had feelings for Malcolm that go way beyond the best friend line. Until one night a moment passes between them, and suddenly Malcolm starts seeing Gabe as more. But Malcolm is from an upper-class political family and Gabe grew up moving from one foster home to the next. Where Malcolm is light, Gabe lives in darkness. Pain is his only indicator that he's still breathing. Yet Malcolm begins to strip away Gabe's hurt, layer by layer, until the choice becomes his to accept happiness, or to stay with the path that has always kept his heart safe.",
