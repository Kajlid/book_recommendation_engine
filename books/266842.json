  "description": "Once upon a time, I was the daughter of an aristocrat. The girl who had everything. Now, I’m a man’s property. Stolen for his pleasure, I live in a tiny room in one of the world’s most extravagant castles. Here I sit day after day as he does what he pleases with me. I long for the life I once had, but I must remain strong. He may take from me, but I will never give him anything. His brother, Alexandr Edwards, the black sheep of the Royal Family is the only one in the palace who has actually seen me as more than just His Majesty’s Slave. He came to me in the night just once. Instead of him taking me, I gave myself to him. Then he disappeared. Now he has returned. And there will be hell to pay.",
