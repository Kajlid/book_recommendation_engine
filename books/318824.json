  "title": "The Sailing Snailor : A Rhyming Mermaid Tale",
  "description": "The sailing snailor is a captain on a nautical ocean adventure as he battles a giant octopus with his starfish sidekick, Sam. He's no Jack Sparrow, Blackbeard, or scraggly pirate, but he must save the love of his life; a mersnail (mermaid) that waits to be rescued from the bottom of the sea. Sam and the Snailor save the helpless mersnail by removing a sea spiny urchin from the giant octopus's bum. After the damsel in distress is released, she swims to the Snailors side and they live happily ever after as they watch a beautiful beach view sunset.This book has a rhyme on every page, which is catchy for young children and enables memory through phonics. Phonics is a method of teaching people to read by correlating sounds with letters or groups of letters in an alphabetic writing system. Teaching phonics and rhyming to a child develops their phonological awareness skills â€“ which play an important part of becoming a good reader.",
