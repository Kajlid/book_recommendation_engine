  "title": "Dear Jo: The story of losing Leah ... and searching for hope.",
  "description": "Maxine and her best friend Leah used to have so much fun chatting with boys online. Their other friends were jealous of their new relationships, and their parents were oblivious to all the love notes being emailed back and forth. So what if Max and Leah lied about their ages and where they lived ... it was just a website ... just for fun. But when Leah disappeared, Max realized that they weren't the only ones telling lies online. Now Max must help the police find her friend and catch an internet predator ... a predator who had come dangerously close to Max. Through her daily journal entries, Max shares the horrible feeling of betrayal, the crushing loss of Leah, and the struggle to move on after all that has happened.",
