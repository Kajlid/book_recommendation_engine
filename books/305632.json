  "description": "Praise for Between Bites Memoirs of a Hungry Hedonist\"An incredible journey of gastronomy by one of America's greatest journalists. Wow!\"--Chef Emeril Lagasse\"For anyone interested in disciplined hedonism, this gripping book reminds us where real style comes from and how it is sustained.\"--Jeremiah Tower\"This is a wonderful book for all to cherish and enjoy--those who love gloriously meticulous writing, wit, the joy of good food from French to Southern, the love of friends who truly accept them, and the pleasure of dispute, which I intend to keep doing with Jimmy as long as he will let me. Bravo!\"--Barbara Kafka\"The more stubborn, persnickety, demanding, and shocking Jim Villas's opinions become in his memoirs, the funnier, more informed, and commonsensical they seem. His appetite for the good life has never flagged, and his ability to convey the highs and lows of dining out makes this book as tantalizing as a mess of spiced crabs. Like A. J. Liebling and Waverley Root, Jim Villas is not really a food writer but a great writer who revels in the joy of living well.\"--John Mariani",
