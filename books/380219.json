  "description": "The Lottery, one of the most terrifying stories written in this century, created a sensation when it was first published in The New Yorker. \"Power and haunting,\" and \"nights of unrest\" were typical reader responses. This collection, the only one to appear during Shirley Jackson's lifetime, unites \"The Lottery:\" with twenty-four equally unusual stories. Together they demonstrate Jackson's remarkable range--from the hilarious to the truly horrible--and power as a storyteller.",
