  "title": "Sir Foolhardy & the Misfits of Mushwood Forest",
  "description": "In the deepest darkness of the forest of Mushwood, a strange pair of fellows live out their days. Sir Foolhardy, a knight in name only, longs for the glory that belongs only to the conqueror of a great quest. Spurt, on the other hand, lives for the simple pleasures: a pipe, a drink of birch beer, and a foot rub. When Foolhardy decides to seize his chance for honor, he drags Spurt along for the ride. You're invited to join Foolhardy, Spurt, and the merry band of misfits they meet along the way, as this unlikely group departs the forest. As the group seeks adventure, castles, riches, and, of course, true love, with these two leading the way, how could anything go wrong? Did I mention Spurt's a dragon. . .",
