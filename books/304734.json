  "description": "Kyle Astley likes his life just the way it is but the people close to him don’t seem to get that. All of his friends are now either married with kids or in a serious relationship, which means they don’t have the time to hang out like they used to.Kyle panics when the girl he has been secretly sleeping with on and off for years gets engaged to someone else and he stupidly tries to steal her away with the promise of a commitment. But Kyle is scared of commitment and has never even had a girlfriend before. When he meets Alice’s cousin at her engagement party, suddenly his plans to win Alice back don’t seem all that important anymore.Jessica Miller has recently been dumped by her boyfriend of three years. She’s stuck in a rut and can’t seem to move past him. When her cousin’s former casual hook up shows her attention at her engagement party, Alice comes up with the brilliant idea that Jessica should sleep with Kyle so that he stops trying to win her back and the distraction should help her finally get over her ex. That all seems easy enough until a few months down the track when Jessica starts to fall in love with him.Will Kyle ever be able to get over his commitment issues and have a real relationship with Jessica or will his fear of the word girlfriend, drive them apart for good?A Life Changing Encounter is the seventh and final instalment in the For Keeps series but can be read as a standalone. Due to its explicit content, bad language and graphic sexual content, A Life Changing Encounter is recommended for mature readers of eighteen years and above.",
