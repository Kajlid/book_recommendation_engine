  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Sage Hannigan wants to get back to her own time, preferably one that hasnâ€™t been destroyed by an underworld plot brewing in Edwardian-era South Carolina. How hard can it be?All she has to do 1. Learn to use newly acquired warping skills to bend time to her will.2. Take out a few rogue vampires.3. Join an ancient secret society.4. Figure out who is putting the time stream in jeopardy.5. Find and maim whoever invented the corset.Sage never asked to be chosen by the Druid Priestess, Amerach, to become a Warper and she never asked to have the future hanging on her shoulders or to warp a hundred years into the past. She certainly never asked to meet Dr. Aldwin Blake, who would make her question her desire to get back to her own time. But if she fails her mission, people will die, history will change, and the present she wishes to return to will be no more.",
