  "description": "The four Qurilixian Princes have no problem with commitment. In one night, using the power they were born with, they will meet and choose their life mate in a simplistic ceremony involving the removing of masks and the crushing of crystals. With very few words spoken and the shortest, most bizarre courtship in history, they will bond to their women forever. And once bonded, these men don't let go.... Out of the fire. Intergalactic thief, Olena Leyton is one of the best space pirates in history. Sailing the high skies in search of adventure is in her blood. When her crew is scattered in a run from the law and her ship crashes, exploding into a ball of flames, the injured Olena is forced to find sanctuary on a Galaxy Brides ship. Posing as a blushing 'mail-order' bride to elude the bounty hunters that pursue her, Olena finds herself heading to the primitive planet of Qurilixen. But, being a bride isn't something that Olena takes seriously. Into the flames. Prince Yusef of Draig, Captain of the Outpost, leads a simple life away from the palace. He knows from the first moment he sees his fiery temptress that he will possess her and make her his bride for all time. However, Yusef learns that playing with fire will always leave a man burned. But, with passions as powerful as this dark Prince's are, he is not willing to give up his bride without a fight. Rating: Contains graphic sexual content, adult language, and violence.",
