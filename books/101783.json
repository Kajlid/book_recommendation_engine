There is something about her though. Something that pulls at his protective instincts and calls to his tom. Ronni was the daughter of traders to her pride, an outcast, the Undesirable. Used and assaulted by the princes, the King has demanded that she marry the rival pride's prince and kill the Ventana Prides ruling family. Only, when she meets Prince Masen, his possessiveness over her and the adoration he showers her with sings to her heart. When Prince Edwin steals Ronni, Masen will do anything to get her back. He had promised to protect her and keep her safe from her old pride. Masen Cartwell won't let anything happen to what is his, and will stop at nothing to have his Queen back.",
