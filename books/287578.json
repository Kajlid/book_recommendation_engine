  "description": "Marshmallow. Every kid gets a nickname. Marshmallow was mine. And like the squishie confectionary, it stuck. As did the extra pounds that inspired the nickname in the first place. But that was OK, the plus-size revolution gave me confidence in my curves. I learned to love my body and even show it off for the world to see. #bodypositive was my ticket to Insta-stardom. It was also what attracted him...  Carter Reeves. A model who graced the covers of several of my favorite romance novels. He messaged me with an opportunity. I couldn’t say no. Imagine my surprise when in the middle of a photo shoot, he pressed his lips to my ear and told me he wants to eat my marshmallow. Holy Mother Of god Carter Reeves wants me. Me. He has abs of steel and I have thighs of thunder. Is he serious?  Warning: this quick read contains over-the-top declarations, insta-love and molten hot moments between a curvy girl and a deliciously sinful man who’s even sweeter than the marshmallow he’s after.",
