Precious summers with her children on the barrier island are Lovie’s refuge from social expectations and her overbearing husband’s philandering. Here, she is the “Turtle Lady,” tending the loggerhead turtles that lay their eggs in the warm night sand and then slip back into the sea.Then, in the summer of ‘74, biologist Russell Bennett visits to research the loggerheads.

Until this autumn, this time of winds and tides, of holding on and letting go…",
