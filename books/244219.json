Glick presents six short stories straight from the pages of his notebook. From Glick's chilling imagination to his first book, stories will grab you and pull you into the mind of madness or genius. You decide. The stories include youthful stupidly and the horror of man's best friend gone bad. So take that seat, and let us begin! Welcome the new kid on the block of horror.",
