  "description": "WINNER: 2022 Lesfic Bard Award for Lesbian FantasyPersephone Gwilt lives with her mother, Alice, and their horses on a small farm in rural North Florida. Alice had intended to wait until Persephone turned 18 to reveal to her that their real home was a magical place called Equidona, which they had fled because Alice was being hunted by Rogue Wizards. But, when Alice is killed several months before Persephone’s birthday, the 17-year-old finds herself whisked away to a world that uses magic instead of technology and where the management and training of horses is the main enterprise.But the Rogue Wizards are still on the hunt—this time for Persephone. So together with a small band of her new friends, Persephone sets out across Equidona on horseback, following the steps that her mother had taken twenty years earlier. She learns that Alice was once a member of the Pathfinders, seven wizards and witches who had banded together to search for ancient magical powers. She also finds that she can communicate with the Old Ones—gigantic, almost-mystical horses that still roam Equidona.Armed with this newfound knowledge, Persephone begins to discover that it is she who must undertake a bold and very unlikely plan to defeat the Rogue Wizards before they can subjugate and forever destroy Equidona.",
