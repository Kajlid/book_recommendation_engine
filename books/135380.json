  "description": "Have you found yourself cringing each time you see a pile of dishes, an overflowing laundry basket of clothes or grimy bathroom sinks and toilets? Up until a few years ago, I was cringing all day long as cleaning tasks crossed my path. I got tired of the battle, so I decided to do a little experiment. I told myself I was going to use my cleaning time to dream about the things I wished for in life. I allowed myself to explore and feel what it felt like to be in certain desired circumstances. As I kept practicing this meditation, I discovered what I truly wanted; not only in my dreams but also in my relationships. I kept cleaning and The Cleaning Solution was born. After it was all said and done, I obtained a clarity of mind and purpose and removed all aversion to cleaning my home. The cleaned home is secondary to my cleaned up mind. I love and relish my clean house, but now, I know the clean house is the result of my meditation. I feel a relief and a relaxation when I approach a sink full of dishes, knowing this time is to get to me, the real me. The Cleaning Solution was written in verse style to inspire, uplift and entertain, while finding a new perspective on taking care of home.",
