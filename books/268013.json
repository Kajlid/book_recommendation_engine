  "description": "John only went into the cafe to have a brew and wait out the storm. He didn’t expect to find love at the same time.  And it really is love at first sight. Chris is like nobody John’s ever known, and John is caught from the start. All he wants, from that very first touch, is to never let go. But John is badly burned from his last relationship and in no fit state to try again. When Chris asks him out, he ought to say no.  But what if he says yes instead?",
