With luck, that will be soon. For your eighteenth birthday is coming, and I intend to be there, like I promised . . .For years, a trumped-up charge -- and a Central American prison cell -- kept Jax Winchester from claiming the girl he loved. Now he was a free man. Or was he?For only the memory of Kelly O'Brien -- and the letters he'd composed to her -- had kept him going. But once he was released, he knew he was still a prisoner -- in a jail of his own making. The way out this time? Keep that promise he'd made to Kelly all those years ago -- and claim her for his own . . .",
