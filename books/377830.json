  "title": "The Sword and the Grail",
  "description": "A brash and naive Sir Perceval (here winning the title of Red Knight but bearing a close resemblance to Chretien de Troyes' hero), after several misadventures due to following his mother's advice too literally, learns his true identity from the prophecies of a \"loathly damsel.\" Armed with a reforged Golden Sword and the wisdom of his uncle Pelles, he makes his way to the Grail Palace and heals the Fisher King who has been suffering since Perceval's father wounded him years before with the Dolorous Stroke. Hieatt's Perceval plays a more important part in the Quest than his counterparts in the Malory-inspired collections of Arthurian legend (e.g. Picard's Stories of King Arthur and His Knights, 1955), and his impetuous exploits have been refined into a poised and polished morality tale which demonstrates the power Of good intentions when guided by the hand of fate.",
