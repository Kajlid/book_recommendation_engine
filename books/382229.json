  "title": "Sailing Between the Stars: Musings on the Mysteries of Faith",
  "description": "The foundation of Christian belief is death is the beginning of life, foolishness is the pathway to wisdom, the meek conquer the strong. Everywhere we look we see mysteries piled upon mysteries, and for all our efforts to fit God into a box that makes sense, Christianity is not founded on common sense.  Author and storyteller Steven James navigates this magical journey through the \"uncommon sense\" of faith in Jesus. Through his captivating style and arresting stories, James helps readers become more comfortable with a faith full of truth and mystery. With breathtaking writing, he shows readers a God who is illogical, unreasonable, unrealistic, and incredibly and unmistakably true.",
