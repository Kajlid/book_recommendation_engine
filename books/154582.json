  "description": "Twisted is book 5 in the Blood & Roses series. Make sure to check out Deviant, Fracture, Burn, and Fallen before reading this instalment!   Sloane  How many times can a person fall down and still get back up? How many times can things go wrong before you just give up?  I’ve lost everything. My home, my job, my purpose in life—everything has been turned upside down. But while life hasn’t exactly turned out the way I would have liked it to, I wouldn’t change a thing. If things were different, I wouldn’t have Lacey. I wouldn’t have Michael.  But most importantly, I wouldn’t have him.  I’ve realized what I feel. He knew it before I did. Only one question remains:  Is he capable of feeling the same way?    Zeth  Secrets are a prison, and I have been behind bars for years. Sloane Romera has been turning keys in all of my locks, throwing light on corners of my mind that I thought would forever be shrouded in darkness. Or at least I had hoped would be.  I have done so many wrongs in this life, and yet this woman has forgiven me. She’s done something I never thought possible—she has learned to understand me, and she hasn’t run. She’s amazed me. She’s saved me. She’s fallen in love with me.  If it’s within my power, I’m about to do the same for her.",
