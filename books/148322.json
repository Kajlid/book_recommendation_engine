  "description": "In the eyes of society, I’m the perfect man. Charitable, kind hearted…a role model to all. For the ones seeking death, I’m their salvation. They think when they come to my door that I’ll assist with the one thing they’re afraid to do alone. Die. Little do they know, I have a lot more in store than a one way ticket to heaven or hell. Four weeks of being my slave and I’ll grant their suicidal wish…or so they think. When Death sought Diane, I wasn’t leaving her a choice to seek out my help. Her pain and determination was more than I’d ever seen and I knew I was the only one who could save her. Even if it meant becoming the hell she was so desperate to escape. But will it be enough to make her choose life? Will I be able to let her go when she gets better? Or will the Master in me deny freedom to the perfect slave?WARNING: THIS IS A DARK EROTIC ROMANCE AND CONTAINS DISTURBING SITUATIONS, DUBIOUS CONSENT, EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT, AND VERY GRAPHIC LANGUAGE. (Also includes knife play/blood play, consensual cutting, and breath play. If you are not comfortable with these situations, DO NOT read this book!Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Unbearable-Erot...",
