  "title": "Dongshan's Five Ranks: Keys to Enlightenment",
  "description": "The first in-depth English commentary on the Five Ranks—-a core text of the Zen tradition that teaches what can't be taught—which contains new translations of all of the key texts of the Five Ranks cycle.We imagine ourselves and the universe to be distinct, but within us glimmers the suspicion that we are in fact intimately connected and inseparable from all that there is. The dawning and expansion of such awareness is called enlightenment. In his masterwork -- a suite of dialectical works known collectively as the Five Ranks -- Dongshan, a Zen master of Old China, approaches enlightenment from five angles, using paradox and poetry to lay out a multifaceted path whereby we might discover enlightenment within this very moment.Ross Bolleter Roshi assembles and provides commentary on all of the core texts of the Five Ranks, including the precursors that inspired it and works inspired by it. Approaching the Five Ranks from a rich and sophisticated koan perspective, Bolleter Roshi augments his explanations of the works with liberal doses of humor and storytelling, bringing this esteemed classic to life. Each part of the Five Ranks focuses differently on the relationship between the timeless realm of our essential natures and the contingent realm of life and death. They encourage us to transcend naive individualism and to bring our best qualities of compassion and wisdom intimately into our daily lives. In this regard, Dongshan's Five Ranks lays out the path that every student of the Way must traverse on the journey to becoming a teacher.",
