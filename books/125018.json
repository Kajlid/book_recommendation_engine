  "description": "The crew had warned my father that it was bad luck to bring a woman on board. I didn't believe the superstition, but as more shouts and noisy clashes of metal against metal filled my ears, I was beginning to. Jake Sullivan, the captain of the Great Fortune, has come for me. A few cities ago, my father lost a bet to him and he has come to collect his prize.Although I was raised among Pirates, I've never seen one as beautiful as him. He's deadly. He's strong and he knows exaclty what he wants. He'd be perfect lover material if he wasn't such a greedy, selfish & an unashamedly over-confident pirate.\"I know treasure when I see it.\" He brings his mouth closer to mine. I expect to smell beer and stale bread, but I'm overwhelmed by the scent of crisp apple and burned wood. \"How lucky for me that it comes in such a tall, fine and undoubtedly delicious shape.\"Jake Sullivan owns me. He controls me, but I never comply to any of his wishes without a fight. He grows tired of my games, but he can't hurt me. I'm the precious treasure he plans to sell to Captain Redbeard for a hefty price. I'm stuck. On a boat. With the most arrogant, self-riteous and absolutely terrifying man I've ever met...not even God can help me now.",
