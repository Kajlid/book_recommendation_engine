Now, all these years later, Damian shows up at Jake's father's funeral. After a reunion night of making love, Damian is hoping for a renewed relationship with Jake, but when a woman from Jake's hometown sees them together, a still-closeted Jake panics and leaves Damian with only a note once more. Now, when Jake's small town turns against him and his life goes from bad to worse, he realizes he needs to take a chance with the man he has never stopped loving.
