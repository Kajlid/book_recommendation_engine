  "description": "Businessman bad boy Mick Sinatra is at a sweet spot in his life. His business is flourishing, the Feds are off his back, and Rosalind Graham, his African-American girlfriend, is making her own way in a cutthroat Philadelphia marketplace. He still worries sick about her, but he respects her drive and determination. He and Roz even find time for a reunion in Jericho with his big brother, Big Daddy Charles Sinatra, and meet a family filled with love, grace, and inspiration. But when his son is nearly killed in a drug-deal-gone-wrong scheme, and Roz is targeted in a snatch and grab, Mick finds himself in a war he didn’t know had been declared. He didn’t start it, but he knows he has to finish it, before it finishes him. Mick Sinatra 2: Love, Lies, and Jericho, is the second book in the Mick and Roz interracial romance series.",
