  "description": "When a man is found dead near middle-aged beekeeper Alice Townsend's beehives, it sets the town abuzz! \nWhen middle-aged beekeeper Alice Trentwell installs some hives in Christchurch's red zone, she looks forward to her bees pollinating the bounty of fruit trees in the area. Instead, after just one day, a dead body is discovered nearby covered in bee stings. Now the police believe that a killer used her bees as a murder weapon. Desperate to keep her hives safe from destruction, and the bees safe from police officers on the hunt for evidence, Alice sets out to solve the murder. Between an argumentative wife, a neighbor embroiled in property disputes, and a potential stalker, she's soon in over her head. As if having a potential murder conviction hanging over her hives wasn't enough of a worry, Alice's dog Chester is also feeling under the weather. Trouble just seems to be making a beeline to Alice's door. \nThe Honeybee Mysteries are quick 1-2 hour reads perfect for filling in time waiting for appointments, commuting to work, or when your significant other insists on watching the show that makes you roll your eyes! \n\nThe stories contain no swearing, no cliffhangers, and no graphic scenes but are chockablock full of bees.",
