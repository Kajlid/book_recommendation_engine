  "title": "War Imminent: The Scrolls of Caed",
  "description": "In the land of Thalis, the Kingdom of Faren is threatened by the evil king of the Darkum, a warrior race bent on domination and conquest. The Farenians are forced to seek help from the Order of the Blood Moon, a sect of witches and warlocks from the Kingdom of Phyronecron. Aranwen is one of the most powerful witches of the sect and, as she attempts to retrieve the hidden scrolls of Caed before the Darkum finds them, her path crosses with that of the Farenians. Their pleas do nothing to move her. Finding the scrolls is far more important since they contain powerful spells that could be used by the Darkum to facilitate the conquest of all the kingdoms in Thalis. Throughout her quest, Aranwen is accompanied by her most faithful friends, a dragon and a wolf, and she encounters unexpected love and a web of conspiracies and betrayal.",
