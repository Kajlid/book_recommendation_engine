  "description": "Mitzy Neuhaus had an easier time selling her condo before the mystery buyer \"bought it\" on her patio. Mitzy stumbled over the body and knew she had to get involved in the case—if only because the corpse was a dead ringer for herself. At first it seemed like a clear case of mistaken identity and Mitzy feared the Mafia wasn’t done with her yet. But digging into the life of the dead buyer uncovered a peculiar little dress shop where nothing added up. Can Mitzy untangle the mystery before she ends up with her own case of buyer's remorse?",
