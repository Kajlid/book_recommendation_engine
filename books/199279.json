  "description": "A spine chilling ghost story to keep you up at night.  Jack Brannan thought the fifth floor apartment in New York City would be a great place to finish his latest novel. It seemed like the perfect arrangement, free room and board in exchange for looking after the rambling old apartment building while its owner was out of town. He soon comes to realize, however, that there is much more to the former Roosevelt Hotel than meets the eye, and that nothing is ever free.  A frightening haunted house tale that you will want to read with the lights on.",
