  "description": "Readers who have followed the fortunes of Daja and her foster siblings in Tamora Pierce's Circle of Magic and The Circle Opens sequences will not be disappointed by this continuation of Daja's adventures as a smith-mage.As her foster siblings, Sandry and Briar, struggle with their reluctant apprentices (\nMagic Steps\n, \nStreet Magic\n), Daja and her teacher, Frostpine, settle into the northern Namornean city of Kugisko for a restful winter break. Not surprisingly, their illusions are promptly shattered, as Daja discovers that the twin daughters of her host have \"ambient magic.\"As the discovering-mage, Daja is obliged to teach the fidgety girls the rudiments of magic. Meanwhile, Kugisko seems to have fallen into the hands of a ruthless arsonist, and Daja is determined to help her new firefighting friend, Bennat Ladradun, get to the bottom of the mystery. As always, Pierce's writing is both personable and thrilling. Daja, a strapping, dark-skinned 14-year-old, is tremendously genuine; her powers seem to reflect inner strength rather than an arbitrary gift. An excellent, many-layered read.
