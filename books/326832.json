  "description": "Thrusting their arms into the air with clenched fists they shout, \"The Six Macs\". Scruffy MacTuffy had no ideas that his nightmare was about to almost come true. Meeting for a fishing trip could have been a bad idea after their biggest catch got away, but what was it that got away? The Six Macs explore the opposite side of the river after a daredevil bridge crossing where they find a long dark cave leading to a journey of danger and something a little bit on the scary side. That evening they tell their parents what they saw, but they think their stories are a bit too imaginative. So a second trip is arranged for the following day with their parents coming along. The parents keep joking about the Six Macs' story but they will soon believe every single word they said.David J Dawkins has been writing stories for his son for many years. It's only recently now he is older that his son suggested that he should get them published.",
