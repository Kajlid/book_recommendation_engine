  "title": "The Language of Bears",
  "description": "The peaceful life of 17th century New England Puritan farmer Adam Green is ripped apart when he finds a television set in the woods. Horrifically deformed animal skinner Obadiah Broke, driven insane by an accident with tanning chemicals, becomes fixated on obtaining the malodorous black water seeping onto Adam’s property. A coup d’etat instigated by Obadiah leads to a death sentence for Adam for witchcraft. A hairsbreadth escape from the pillory enables the young farmer to discover the incredible truth behind the peculiar land he lives in. Now it is up to Adam, a hunted fugitive reviled by all, to find a way to defeat the monstrous forces threatening his home and the rest of the world. There is no hope unless he can learn…the language of bears. \"Witty, serious, and original, this stunning tale should attract anyone who delights in an intellectually stimulating read.\" - Kirkus Reviews",
