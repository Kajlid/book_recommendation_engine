  "title": "Cancer as a Social Activity: Affirmations of World's End",
  "description": "This is the long awaited first official collection of writings by notorious performer/songwriter Michael D.Williams, the lyricist for New Orleans metal/punk legends EyehateGod, whose prolific recorded output has gained a mighty cult following since its inception in 1988. Mr. Williams has been long cited as \"a decadent pioneer\" and \"a Hardcore blues prophet.\" The one true mouth of the disinfranchised underground scene. His fragmentary hallucenogenic outlook has been described as an illegitimate coupling of the downtrodden gutter-life beauty of Charles Bukowski, crossed with William Burroughs' cutup cerebral style. A voice of the voiceless, brutal realism metamorphised into uncompromising, startling images of gorgeous, wistful daily life. Long championed by dead end kids who KNOW, Williams is now prepared to take on whatever the mainstream literary world has to offer with this collection of nearly two hundred works.",
