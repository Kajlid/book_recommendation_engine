As a Greater Demon, she understands what reality really was. It's one of the defining traits of her kind.Only now the entire world is changing, in ways she never would have guessed it could. It seems that Demon's aren't the top of the universal food chain after all, which can really set a girl back. That means Keeley has to learn some hard lessons fast, and do some things that she probably can't survive, or all of reality itself might just not make it.Like it's her job to save it?That's obviously a mistake, but it seems that someone very important thinks she's just the right person for the job.",
