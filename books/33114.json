  "description": "When Hudson, an adventurous (and adorable) Norwich Terrier, moves to Paris, he loves the new sights and smells. But when he tries to make friends, he is surprised to discover that Parisian dogs only speak French. Nobody told him about this part. Though initially disheartened, little Hudson’s desire to make friends and thrive in his new environment is so strong that he learns a new language. Hudson becomes a Paris-Chien! (A pun on Parisien.) Hudson’s successful experience will be meaningful to any child set down in any new country, city, or school. Beautifully illustrated with gouache paintings of Paris parks, markets, cafes and dogs, Paris-Chien is one of those books that’s enjoyable for both the reader and the read-to. French words appear in the illustrations, so you’ll even learn a little French!",
