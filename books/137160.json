  "title": "James Munkers: Super Freak",
  "description": "James Munkers' world is changing. New town. New school. New hallucinations of bright blue animals wreaking havoc. And when you add a leather-clad maniac who haunts the back garden, the loopy girl at school with her messages of doom, a cryptic prophecy and a bunch of shadowy strangers intent on murder, it looks as though James won't even make it to Christmas. The sensible thing to do would be to run. To hide. To generally escape. But James Munkers can't hide. He can't escape. Because James Munkers is different. James Munkers has a destiny. But James Munkers would rather forget all that and go back to playing God of War.",
