  "description": "\"We all have a label...a title that defines us. The problem is, we don't get to choose it.\"On the outside, it's just a high school. To many on the inside, it's the best years of their lives. But to a silent minority, it is a living hell. Then one night, a teenager takes his own life, and suddenly the bullying problem is no longer silent. Nielli, Aaron, and Sheridan don't know each other, but tragedy will bring them together in an unexpected way as they try to survive from day-to-day, and the school continues to sweep the real problem under the rug. This powerful young adult novel will tug at your heart as you see what life is like through the eye's of these very different, yet equally victimized teens.\"I'm Sam, or Justin, or Andrew, or even Eduardo. Whoever he wants me to beâ€”whoever he is. So far, no one has ever wanted me to just be Aaron.\"",
