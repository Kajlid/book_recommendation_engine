  "description": "Teaching Kids to Share and Show Kindness Brown Bear awoke from hibernation to the tempting scent of pears in the air. It was spring, and the forest was buzzing with life. He could see Owl, Rabbit, Squirrel, and three little mice. “Good morning, all,” said Brown Bear. “I'm on my way to pick some delicious sweet pears, ten, twenty, thirty if I dare. I will eat them all without care.” “That wouldn't be wise,” said Owl. “Your belly could turn sour and pass gas that is foul. Instead of eating them all without care, do the right thing, and share.”  BROWN BEAR WON’T SHARE is a book about a selfish, greedy bear. Brown Bear is so selfish and greedy he won’t even share with his friends. Now that’s one selfish bear. Brown Bear soon realizes that he needs his friends and being unkind to them is not the way to go. A Note From The Author Thank you for your support!
