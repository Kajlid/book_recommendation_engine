  "description": "Once the belle of her village, life took a dark turn for Adelaide upon her parent’s death. Plagued by lingering grief, there was not a soul who didn’t turn their back on her. They called her angry and spiteful… Hell, they called her a monster.  One fateful day Adelaide finds herself alone, lingering on the edge of The Perished Woods--a cursed and evil place. Without warning, an orc army attacks.  Her village ablaze, Adelaide races into the Perished Woods, seeking refuge in a place of nightmares. With orcs at her heels, she’s desperate to escape. But when the young woman crosses an aging stone bridge in the middle of the cursed forest she’s met with an even more fearsome enemy. A troll… one who is determined to save her.",
