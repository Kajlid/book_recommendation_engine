  "description": "My life has always been in the spotlight. Born to two famous parents and then quickly rising to \"super\" status in the modeling world ensured that I, Astoria \"Tori\" Bell, would always have my image plastered across newsstands. Unfortunately, adoring fans weren't always magnanimous and now I have a stalker on my hands.Oddly enough, the tall, dark, and all-too handsome bodyguard hired to protect me seems more harmful than the threatening notes from the stalker. As well as his plan to flush out the danger by proposing a fake engagement.The lines between pretend and reality blur and I have to shore up my resolves. Baggage from my past means I can't let myself be vulnerable. But the way Marcel Fox treats me has me thinking otherwise. With a new rock on my finger and the man who put it there by my side, happily ever after seems like a possibility or is that as fake as my public persona?The Truth About Fame is the second book in the Christian Chick Lit series: Faith & Fortune.",
