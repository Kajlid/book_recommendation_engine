  "title": "The Analysis of Defense: The Ego & the Mechanisms of Defense Revisited",
  "description": "Anna Freud's 'The Ego and the Mechanisms of Defense,' first published in 1936, has become a classic. The present work updates the original by means of discussions, primarily between Joseph Sandler and Anna Freud, which throw light on many obscure portions of the original work, indicated changes in Anna Freud's thinking, and amplify many of her initial statements. Joseph Sandler, whose formulations are at times at variance with those of Anna Freud, and the other participants provide an exciting springboard for the discourse.  'The Analysis of Defense' is a sentence-by-sentence reconsideration. In response to many searching questions by Sandler, Anna Freud clarifies her position in current psychoanalytic thinking.",
