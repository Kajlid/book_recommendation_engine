  "description": "In this thoroughly satisfying and completely disorienting audiobook based on a story line by Douglas Adams (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy), Terry Jones has created an unforgettable tale of intergalactic travel and mishap. The saga of the ship that cannot possibly go wrong sparkles with wit, danger and confusion that will keep listeners guessing which reality they are in and how-- on Earth-- to find their way out again. At the center of the galaxy, a vast, unknown civilization is preparing for an event of epic proportions, the launching of the greatest, most gorgeous, most technologically-advanced starship ever built-- the Starship Titanic. An Earthling would see it as a mixture of the Chrysler Building, the tomb of Tutankhamen and Venice. But less provincial onlookers would recognize it as the design of Leovinus, the galaxy's most renowned architect. He is an old man now, and the creation of the Starship Titanic is the pinnacle achievement of his twenty-year career. A night before the launch, Leovinus is prowling around the ship having a last little look. With mounding alarm he begins to find things are not right. Unfinished workmanship, cybersystems that are not working correctly, robots that are colliding with doors. How could this have happened? Something, somewhere is terribly wrong... And our story has just begun!",
