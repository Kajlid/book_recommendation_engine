  "description": "In Another Quiet Stories of Life in Laos, Brett Dakin takes you through the corridors of power and into the living rooms of Laos. Among many others, you'll meet Brett's boss, a wealthy general who strikes fear into the heart of all who hear his name; an aging prince pining for the French colonial past; an American pilot who left home to fight and never returned; and a new generation of Lao who have more money than they can use, but still search for happiness. It's a sympathetic yet irreverent glimpse of one of the world's few remaining communist nations â€“ and a way of life that is fast slipping away.",
