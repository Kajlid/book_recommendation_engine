  "description": "Merrick Albright, a former military officer, is now a salty sheriff’s deputy who is frustrated and sickened by the current state of the United States and its ongoing political soap opera. He feels helpless to effect change on a national level and focuses on bettering his community by putting one bad guy behind bars at a time. After a series of coordinated nationwide terrorist attacks, the United States drifts into chaos. Police and other first responders scramble to keep control, but the divided and frustrated nation sinks lower as cities riot to the point that crime can’t be contained. What can Merrick do when law and order are a thing of the past? He must fight to keep those he cares about alive, but he cannot do it alone. “This story will disturb and inspire readers, and open their eyes to the world around us through the safety of a fictional character who seems so real.” Deirdra Eden, Best Selling Author of The Watchers Series.",
