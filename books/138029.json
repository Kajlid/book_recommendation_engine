  "description": "Wife and mother Nadine Washington woke up that morning, hoping a wish she'd cherished for nearly twenty years might be finally realized. Later that day, she'd discover that her desire wasn't meant to be. Instead, she was facing a profound crisis in her life although one faced at some point by all women. Her first husband Johnnie had been killed in the war before he'd even known he would soon be a father. Johnnie's best friend Phillip was there to help her make it through those early times but he fell in love with Nadine. He was there at the hospital the night daughter Kelly was born and held her as his own. Nadine found solace over the loss of her first husband every time she looked into Kelly's eyes. She wanted a child with Phillip too, a child to see his eyes in, but it was not meant to be. A series of events leads her and her family to embark on a path that may potentially tie this family together in a way that in the eyes of some, might be unthinkable. Content Warning: This story is intended for mature readers. This story is a departure from I. M. Telling's tales of erotica although explicit elements are portrayed.",
