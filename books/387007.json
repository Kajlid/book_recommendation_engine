  "description": "Would you like to play a game? \nShifting Reality, Book 2\n Saint is half human, half demon…all trouble. With his roommate Thomas mated to Margo, and Mac on one of those long, lonely, feeling-eternally-sorry-for-yourself vampire vacations, Saint is on his own and restless.  A lovesick shifter’s request to locate a woman isn’t exactly his idea of fun—he’s no matchmaker—but he agrees. And finds not only his quarry, but a whole lot more than he bargained for: a top player in his own online game that, until now, has somehow escaped his notice. A woman so tempting that when she touches the keyboard with her fingertips, he can feel it right down to his bones. Housebound for the last few years due to an accident, Ume’s only distraction from the endless physical therapy sessions has been an online role-playing game. When she logs in this time, though, something is different. She finds herself lost in the game—literally—and falling for a mysterious warrior on her way to face the Demon King in his lair. And that’s before it gets weird. Warning: Explicit sex. One sexy, smart-mouthed demon, an adventure game, and more than a touch of kink. Sex online and then sex ONLINE. Spanking, silk ropes, a blindfold, one wild threesome between a Mystic, a Warrior and a Kitsune…and every online gamer’s dream come true.",
