  "description": "When Ayana moved into her first home in Charlotte, North Carolina, she thought nothing could be more perfect. The quiet little street was a sharp contrast to where she’d come from, and she loved it. What made her wonder though was when the ladies in the neighborhood speculated on whether Ayana would be competition. The verdict wasn’t favorable. Just when she began to question what kind of community she’d moved into, Ayana discovers that her home is snuggled right in the middle of two sexy men on both sides of her. And to the annoyance of the women on the block—including the local slut—she is the object of Reece’s and Blaine’s desires.Reece and Blaine have a secret. They are not quite human. Ayana might be afraid to accept their ménage relationship, but they’re sure of what they feel about her. She is their mate, and they have no problem sharing the mocha beauty. The only thing left to do is convince Ayana that her new life isn’t complete until they are a permanent part of it. This fiesty heroine pisses off every single and married woman in her quiet neighborhood by carrying on a sexual relationship with two hot bear shifters.",
