  "description": "IMAGINE you discover that your wife was not only in love with another man, but this man was her PIMP, and she was his MADAM and PROSTITUTE. IMAGINE you learn that your wife married you for the sole purpose of stealing your assets, that to her, you were JUST ANOTHER TRICK, one who instead of paying “up front” was expected to pay at the end, when she divorced you. IMAGINE you learned that your beloved wife was running her segment of a multi-state, multi-million dollar prostitution ring, right from your bedroom, ON YOUR WEDDING NIGHT, by calling her pimp, the man she was ACTUALLY in love with, THREE TIMES, after you had fallen asleep. Folks, in my case, NO IMAGINATION WAS NEEDED. As unbelievable as it sounds, this happened to me. - Paul T. Goldman",
