  "description": "From the moment Eve woke devoid of memories on Dr. Whittaker’s exam table her heart beat with a steady rhythm that screamed only one thing—survive.Set in the abysmal landscape of what was once the southern United States, The Quandary 902 follows Eve, the first successfully rehabilitated female subject for the New Order. Conscripted at a young age by the External Cognitive Emotional Repression Program, Eve was transformed into the deadly Alpha 902—a creature engineered to be a remorseless killing force. Eve emerges from the control of EXCERP to find herself caught in a lethal game of cat-and-mouse with the director of the rising New Order.Surrounded by those who barely consider her human and struggling to reconcile with a violent past, Eve grapples for sanity even as the New Order demands she assume command of their uprising. But when Eve starts uncovering one lie at a time, how can she be sure the New Order really operates in the name of good?No longer the girl she was when she was captured, nor the pitiless Alpha 902, Eve is set on a long path to creating a new identity in a world that seems intent on demolishing it.",
