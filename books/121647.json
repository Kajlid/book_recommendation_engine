  "description": "From the Wall Street Journal bestselling author of 44 Chapters About 4 Men (inspiration for the Netflix original series Sex/Life) comes an immersive romantic suspense trilogy with a dark, dystopian twist.No getting attached. Leave before you get left. Supplies. Shelter. Self-defense. Survival above all else. I’ve lived my life by a strict set of rules—rules that have kept me alive, rules that have kept the nightmares of my past at bay. But the moment I met her, I crossed all of them out with a giant X and scrawled the words Protect Rainbow Williams next to them in murderous block letters. That’s all I cared about. Keeping her safe. Keeping her—period. But Rain doesn’t need me to protect her anymore. The danger is still out there—it’s everywhere—but she has her little found family now, a roof over her head, food on the table … him. And I have nobody to blame but myself. In my world, rules aren’t made to be broken. They’re made to keep you from breaking. A mistake I won’t make again. Because without Rain, there won’t be anything left of me to break. * Previously published under the title Fighting for Rain. ** A comprehensive CW is available on the author’s website.",
