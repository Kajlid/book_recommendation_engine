  "description": "Freya's on her own, lost in a new city. Being of royal blood, every male shifter would kill to have her as a mate. Staying in hiding is her number one priority. When hunger leads her to the rear of a night club in search of food, she comes across a human who arouses a new desire within her. Once inside the club, she's caught skipping out on her bill and forced to deal with the club owner and bartender, both sexier-than-sin shifters. Will she be able to submit to the three men? Can there be a future with a human mate?",
