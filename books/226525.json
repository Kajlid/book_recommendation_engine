  "description": "No place like home. But what if home is unsafe and violent? Fifteen year old Simone is lured by her new boyfriend with promises of a better life in a big city. On the run from a dangerous environment and her drug addicted sister, she arrives in Palmino with stars in her eyes and hope in her heart. Reality check? Okay. But what is reality when her boyfriend turns violent, the other itinerants brand her an intruder, and home becomes a drain or a squat? Simone's story is the story of a society in which no child was going to have to live in poverty: a land of milk and honey, which for some people turns sour and is filled with despair. 'The way it is?' Not necessarily. With someone to tell it straight and someone to listen, this can be a story called Back on Track.",
