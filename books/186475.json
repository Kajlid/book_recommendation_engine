  "description": "Healing Hasan's Heart is the story of a thirteen-year-old boy whose mother and father have been executed for their belief in the Bahai Faith. Traumatized by this ordeal, young Hasan is brought by his uncle to his aunt's home, where he will live with his aunt's family. At first, Hasan is fearful and resentful of his new family, and he does not understand how they can be Bahais and why his parents were willing to sacrifice their lives for their beliefs. As he befriends more members of his aunt's family, however, he learns about the principles of the Faith, including the spiritual education of children, the sanctity of marriage, and the nature of God. As his relationship with his new family grows, Hasan becomes more confident and is able to heal from his past. Finally, he meets with Abdul-Baha, the son of Bahaullah, the Founder of the Faith, and he embraces his new family as well as his own spiritual beliefs.",
