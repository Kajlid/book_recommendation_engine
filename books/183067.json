  "description": "He was supposed to be the man I loved – forever. He shot that fantasy to Hell. He broke my heart and shattered my soul. I was moving on – or it looked that way to those on the outside looking in. I’d moved to Chicago and landed myself a killer job. I was making friends and then out of the blue he was there – and all over again I felt myself falling. This time, it wasn’t an easy fall. I fought it hard. But one night with Kade Wright can never be one simple night. I should have known. I’ve been here before. From the very beginning, Mr. Wright Now was always Mr. Wright Forever.",
