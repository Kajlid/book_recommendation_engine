  "description": "Brian Walker’s two comprehensive guides to American comics, The Comics Before 1945 and The Comics Since 1945 , are combined here in one beautifully designed omnibus edition, The The Complete Collection . Cartoon authority Brian Walker has amassed over a century of strips—more than 1,300 images—including rare examples provided by the artists themselves. Featured cartoonists include George Herriman ( Krazy Kat ), Walt Kelly ( Pogo ), Charles Schulz ( Peanuts ), Bill Watterson ( Calvin and Hobbes ), Scott Adams ( Dilbert ), Patrick McDonnell ( Mutts ), and many more. Organized by decade, with biographical profiles and analysis of the different genres, The Comics is a graphically stunning, and terrifically priced survey of American newspaper comics.Praise for The Comics :\"The strips . . . are beautifully reproduced and carefully annotated.\"-The New York Times\"As a detailed and informed one-volume history of the newspaper comics, Walker's The Comics is the best book we have.\"-PW Comics Week\"[The Comics is] excellent at conjuring the feeling of feverish joy that comics can provide.\"-The Washington Post\"This is a terrific collection both for novices in need of an overview and for aficionados looking for new discoveries.\"-A.V. Club“a bountiful treasury of an underrated 20th-century art form at its best, one bound to amuse and enlighten”— The Palm Beach Post\"This is a book to be savored, enjoyed a page at a time, perhaps the perfect coffee-table tome.\"-The Plain Dealer",
