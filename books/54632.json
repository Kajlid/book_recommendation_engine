But as she tried to observe Jewish rituals, and even considered a call to become a Rabbi, she felt increasingly drawn to Jesus. Confessions of a Prodigal Daughter is a story about the struggle to reconcile two seemingly contradictory sides of yourself. It's a story about leaving what is comfortable and familiar, sacrificing some relationships in the process, in order to find one's true purpose.",
