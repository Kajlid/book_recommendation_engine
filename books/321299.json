  "description": "Twins Dawn and Dusk Rosenberg live for hockey and worship the Montreal Canadians. But their dad hates the game, and their crotchety, foul-mouthed grandmother thinks the twins should be doing homework and chores instead of wasting their time shooting pucks. When Dawn and Dusk's dad gets the family tickets to the next Canadians game, they can't believe their luck. They're even more psyched when they hear about the million dollar contest. A randomly chosen fan will get the chance to shoot a goal to win one million dollars. Could this be the beginning of a dream come true for Dawn and Dusk-or the biggest humiliation of their lives?",
