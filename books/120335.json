  "title": "The Four Noble Truths of Wealth: A Buddhist View of Economic Life",
  "description": "The way we think about wealth and livelihood affects our personal experience and our world dramatically. Yet we rarely contemplate the heart of prosperity, which may be why it feels like we are struggling personally and globally. The Four Noble Truths illuminate the foundation of a wealthy outlook, which makes economic life more workable and creates a better world at the same time. Layth Matthews is a Buddhist economist who thinks you can afford to cheer up right now! With humor and practical examples he will confirm your hunch that economic life is miserable, but not serious, and materialism is an endless detour from richness of all kinds. This book provides the essential DNA of sustainable business, sustainable economics, and mindful leadership.",
