  "description": "Corduroy has been on the department store shelf for a long time...Yet as soon as Lisa sees him, she knows that he's the bear she's always wanted. Her mother, though, thinks he's a little shopworn—he's even missing a button! Still, Corduroy knows that with a bit of work he can tidy himself up and be just the bear for Lisa. And where better to start than with a quick search through the department store for a new button!Corduroy, with his unaffected simplicity and childlike emotion, is one of the best-loved bears in children's books. His story has become an irresistible childhood classic, as basic and appealing as a small bear's desire for a home and a friend and the perfect fulfillment found in the devotion of a young girl.\nDon Freeman\n was born in San Diego, California, and moved to New York City to study art, making his living as a jazz trumpeter. With this loss of his trumpet on a subway train, Mr. Freeman turned his talents to art full-time. In the 1940s he began writing and illustrating children's books; his many popular titles include Beady Bear, Dandelion, Mop Top, Norman the Doorman, and his follow-up to Corduroy, A Pocket For Corduroy. At the time of his death in 1978, the Los Angeles Times wrote: \"Ingeniousness and humor, theatricality and commonality, humanity and beauty: these elements survive in his picture books.\"Edition MSRP: U.S. $16⁹⁹ / CAN. $21⁰⁰ (ISBN 978-0-670-24133-0)Reinforced Binding.
