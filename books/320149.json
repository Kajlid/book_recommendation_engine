  "description": "I’m a man who’s in control, at all times, even when I feel urges inside pulling me into uncharted territory.I see things in her that I like, although I’m not about to spill my guts like a lovesick teenager, because I’m anything but.But this little Lolita is peeling back layers like I’m an onion she is preparing to throw in a boiling pot of soup. That. Cannot. Happen.She’s stripping me bare, making me completely vulnerable.Of course I’m going to resist. And more importantly, when it comes to me, making a real connection with another human being is…impossible.At least I thought it was impossible.But I can’t let these new feelings get in the way of the man I’ve built from the ground up. Or can I?Even when she’s perfect for me. Even when we both know she belongs to me, that she’s mine.Will my need for control ruin what we could have together?Will I self-sabotage, letting the only girl I’ve ever wanted, my angel, slip through my fingers?There’s no way I’m letting her get away. Not now. Not ever. She’s mine, and I’m going to do whatever it takes to control the situation to get the outcome I demand…a ring on her finger and my baby in her belly, because she belongs to me. Forever.",
