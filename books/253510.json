  "description": "This is a dystopic coming-of-age graphic novel about two brothers trying to discover the secret of their father’s diary. Two pre-adolescent brothers scavenge a post-apocalyptic landscape for anything that might help each other and their father exist for one more day. Although their survival hangs in the balance, the boys are obsessed with only one thing―the diary their father keeps. They’ve never been taught to read or write, but they have a hunch that the scribbles might answer their questions. Land of the Sons is Gipi’s most artistically accomplished work to date.",
