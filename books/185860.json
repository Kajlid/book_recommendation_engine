  "title": "Weighing in on Love and Life",
  "description": "She just wants people to accept her for the kind, caring person she is—to look beyond the outside and see what’s inside…Kylee Rose Williams, RN, has lived with taunts about her full figure or her generous frame—or whatever the words du jour were for a woman of her size—all her life. Humiliation seems to accompany Kylee everywhere she goes. People talked about her gorgeous green eyes or her stunningly beautiful face, but these things aren’t said with sincerity or admiration, only as a pointed insult to offset their cruel remarks about her obesity. Then Dr. Duff Robertson enters her life and shows her how glorious it can be. But Kylee’s insecurities and inability to trust push him away. Can she learn to accept herself and trust that others can too, or will she lose her one chance at happiness through her failure to understand that there are more important things in life than numbers on a scale?",
