It is about a girl very sweet whom every heart wanted to meet and a guy who was just simple and shy. For each other they used to care and everything happening in their lives with each other they used to share. But then what happened ahead is a mystery--did their feelings blend or did everything came to an end? It is a common man's story that was made uncommon. Hope it will touch your hearts and make you feel that \"yes it has happened with me too”. Some stories end never and I am sure if you read mine, it will stay in your hearts forever.",
