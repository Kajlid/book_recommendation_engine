  "description": "I didn’t turn up uninvited. He asked me to come.He didn’t need to ask twice. He knew I’d agree. Kind Laura. Obedient Laura. Laura the soft-spoken schoolteacher with the faded cardigans and flat shoes. Nobody ever suspected someone like me would appeal to handsome, charismatic, happily married Ralph. I think even he was surprised by his choice. But I’m used to people underestimating me.But then maybe I underestimated Ralph too. Because I never thought he’d be capable of doing what he did. It wasn’t only dangerous, it was very, very wrong. And I’m not talking about cheating on his wife.As I said, I didn’t turn up uninvited. He asked me to come. The last thing on my mind was killing him.A compulsively unputdownable domestic thriller about secrets, lies and how no marriage is ever what it seems from the outside.",
