  "description": "Keep your friends close...And your enemies closer.I knew Leilani Hart was trouble from the minute she stepped foot into our small town. With her big city ideas and hotel heiress reputation, I know she’ll turn our picturesque island into a tacky tourist trap if given the opportunity. She’ll have to go through me first. From our first meeting, we’re like fire and ice, and I can’t help but wonder what it would be like to pin her down and melt some of those frigid layers right off. I’ve never believed in love, but for her, I just might be willing to risk it all. Even if it means falling... for the enemy.",
