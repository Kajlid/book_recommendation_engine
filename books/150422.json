  "description": "It turns out that a real alien invasion is nothing like the Sci-fi shows 14-year-old Gracie loves. Not when it’s your own family who are swallowed whole by those big silver ships. Not if it could be you next.In her search for her family, Gracie meets Brandon, a high school dropout who would never have been caught dead hanging out with a dork like Gracie before the world ended. Gracie isn’t too crazy about Brandon either, but he has one thing she doesn’t: A plan.Brandon’s uncle has a cabin up in Maine, and If Gracie and Brandon can survive long enough to get there they can hide out until the Space Men pack up their ships and leave.Until the army guys come to rescue them, says Brandon.Brandon is big into army guys.Gracie has to admit that Brandon’s Awesome Plan probably would have worked out great if wasn't for Jake.They found 5-year-old Jake, laying half-dead under the remains of someone’s ranch house. He’s a good kid, even if he won’t-or can’t- talk.But Jake has a secret, and when Gracie finds out what it is, the fragile new life they’ve started to forge looks set to break apart.When the people you’ve been counting on to put the world back together start hunting you down, alien invaders are the least of your worries.",
