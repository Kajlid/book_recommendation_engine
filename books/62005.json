  "description": "Money isn't everything...In the astonishing follow-up to Agents of Change, the Agencies of Influence and Justice have been effectively rendered powerless, and the world, for the time being, is safe. While this turn of events remains unbeknownst to the human race, the agencies are none too happy about it. Left as the only soul imbued with the Arrowhead of the Seminole’s power, Calvin Newsome has paid a heavy price for his heroics, but knows not of true suffering until now.Under the direction of their executive directors, each agency has hired separate, highly-trained bounty hunters to run a high-stakes race to capture Calvin, now an elusive yet impaired target. While one of those mercenaries is familiar to him, the other is not, and each has their own secret agenda, proving that money isn’t everything.As he attempts to return to a state of normalcy, Calvin must utilize his abilities to evade both bounty hunters while further staving off global devastation and saving those closest to him. Unfortunately, each destructive encounter raises Calvin’s profile as a domestic terrorist while a lurking, more shocking danger threatens to bury him and the world that sits tenuously upon his shoulders.",
