  "description": "What Happened to David provides a new twist on what it’s like to be bullied. It tells the story of what it’s like to stand up for yourself and then get sent to an alternative school because of it. In What Happened to David, 15-year-old Mary is victimized by an obsessive, love-struck teen gangster and then sent from a magnet school to a tough alternative school where she meets David, another victim of an unfair system.While reflecting on stupid car thieves, bad tattoos, and other foolishness, as well as the hard luck stories of the students around them, David helps Mary to view herself and her new school as an opportunity rather than just a punishment or an embarrassment. Their love grows as they adapt to their new school. Just as she starts to feel safe, Mary’s past returns with tragic consequences. This is a story about young love, obsession, belonging, violence, survival at school and coping with tragic loss.",
