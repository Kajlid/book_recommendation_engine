  "description": "I fell in love once.  It was amazing. She was amazing. Life was amazing.  I lived for each time I could see her, and nothing else mattered, not that our families were enemies, our time together was forbidden, or we had to meet in secret.  Our love could conquer all.  Until it didn't.  So I was ripped away from the love of my life and shoved into hell, forced to continue without her.  It shattered me, broke the best parts of me, left me permanently damaged. Or so I thought.  Years later, I swear history’s trying to repeat itself because she’s back in my life, and I’m just as drawn to her as I was before. But I'm older and wiser now, and I know she should stay away from a worthless piece of ex-con like me.  So, I will not let her in. I absolutely refuse to hurt her. I will keep her away.  Then again, sometimes risking your greatest fear to get to a smile makes everything worth it, and besides, I’m not sure I can resist her, anyway.  This is the story of how Felicity Bainbridge changed my life forever, starting one summer day long ago after I was forced to change a dirty diaper...  --Knox Parker",
