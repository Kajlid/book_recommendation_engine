  "description": "By teacher mom on December 14, 2010 Have you ever begun a series with great hopes, only to be disappointed by future installments? That is not the case with The Alcott Legacy. I heartily recommend purchasing all 3 books together, because the minute you finish one, you will want to immediately begin the next! The Tapestry is a wonderful combination of history, drama, and romance. What makes the stories even more beautiful is that they are connected by the thread of faith. However, it does not ever sound forced or even \"preachy.\" Rather, the author manages to weave it throughout the story in such a natural fashion that her words illustrate the title itself. You will find yourself utterly captivated by the Alcott family, particularly young Ethan. I hope to find more series such as this one.",
