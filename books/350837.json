  "title": "Mismeasure of Woman: Why Women Are Not the Better Sex, the Inferior Sex, or the Opposite Sex",
  "description": "When \"man is the measure of all things,\" woman is forever trying to measure up. In this enlightening book, Carol Tavris unmasks the widespread but invisible custom -- pervasive in the social sciences, medicine, law, and history -- of treating men as the normal standard, women as abnormal. Tavris expands our vision of normalcy by illuminating the similarities between women and men and showing that the real differences lie not in gender, but in power, resources, and life experiences.  Winner of the American Association for Applied and Preventive Psychology's Distinguished Media Contribution Award",
