  "description": "\"I fell in love with a brown-eyed angel in the middle of a football field, and I hadn't even talked to her yet. All it took was her laugh.\" - Mason Connor  Professional football player, Mason Connor, had the perfect life. Blessed with good looks, crazy skills on the field, and more money than he knew what to do with, it never occurred to him something was missing. Not until he saw her.  Looking out over a field of green, he saw his future and knew his world was about to change. He just had no idea his Angel would put up such a fight.  A fight he planned on winning.  \"I don't want to like you, Mase, but I'm afraid I already do and that scares me.\" - Joanna Welch  Joanna Welch had two relationships in her life, both with the popular-sexy-jock type.  Neither ended well.  So when the attractive and cocky Pursuers quarterback began pursuing her, she wasn't interested in experiencing a three-peat.  However, the more time she spent with Mase, the harder it was to pretend he was only a sexy smile and hot body. He was funny, charming, and smart, too.  Fumbling her stay-away plan, her heart's in danger of being intercepted, and Jo's worried she's about to get sacked. Only Mase wasn't just looking to score...  He had another kind of championship ring in mind.  This is a full-length, steamy, contemporary romance. While Pursuing can be enjoyed as a stand-alone, it is part of a series started with Alluring and contains some spoilers. ***Due to sex and language, it is recommended for persons over 18.*** HEA",
