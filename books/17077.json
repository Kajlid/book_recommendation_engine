  "description": "Thirty-seven writers. One rule. Each story must be told in the first person. In this nice fat collection of original stories, some of the most daring writers on the American literary scene take up that slim little word 'I' and use it to poke around the darkest, funkiest corners of their very own minds. Here you'll find J.T. LeRoy, Alvin Orloff, Kevin Killian, Dennis Cooper, Inga Muscio, Eileen Myles, Jayson Elliott, Thea Hillman, and a couple of dozen of their fellow travelers sending dispatches from the fringe.And, oh, the people they'll bring into your personal space: speed freaks, scat freaks, cybersexualists, sober virgins, beatnik groupies, punk-rock shoplifters, gender benders, Tourette's syndrome fetishists, gloomophiles, glamazons, and even a naked butoh dancer. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel soiled and disturbed. You may even be inspired to have a few perverted adventures of your own. Please do!Clint Catalyst is the Southern-fried, sissified, Goth-damaged, punk-spirited, hyper-hyphenated, degenerate author of Cottonmouth Kisses.Michelle Tea is the author of the memoir Chelsea Whistle, the Lambda Award-Winning dyke drama Valencia, and The Passionate Mistakes of One Girl in America.",
