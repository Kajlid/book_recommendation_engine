In the SPECTER KEY magical hero Bran Hambric must choose to save his friend Astara, his father―and himself, if he possibly can. Bran Hambric believes that the Farfield Curse is over with. But when he discovers a safe-deposit box in his dead mother's name―in the very bank vault where he was discovered as a boy―Bran's past comes rushing back. Now he's on a frightening path that puts everyone he cares about in danger.
