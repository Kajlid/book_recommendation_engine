  "description": "In Stone Boat, Kristen Wittman draws on both her rural upbringing and her experiences as a lawyer to create a deft poetic biography of a man who has lost all to the modern world.\"Kristen Wittman gives us the haunting voice of Franklin, a prairie farmer who struggles with the memory of family tragedy, his failing health, and the death of the family farm, all in order to accept the inevitability of his own end. Stone Boat is a long poem evocative of poetry's beginnings.\"--Clarise Foster, author of The Flame Tree",
