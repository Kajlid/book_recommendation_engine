  "title": "Coming Home",
  "description": "Coming Home evokes memories of a simpler time. Told from the perspective of Carly, a child of the 1940's who is thrust into self-awareness by the early death of her mother, the tale conveys her understanding of the adult world she must navigate simply to grow up. Her keen-eyed depictions of life on a struggling Missouri farm and observations about small-town society resonate with people who lived in post-war rural America. Who should read this book? Anyone who listened to Harry Caray call a Cardinals game, sold Cloverine salve, went to a Toby and Susie tent show, visited Little Bit o'Heaven, dialed Central on a crank telephone, waited for radio installments of \"Stella Dallas,\" attended Merry Makers or Grange meetings, hunted for morel mushrooms, belonged to 4-H Club, swam in a \"swimmin' hole,\" made a quilt, milked a cow, churned butter, stoked a woodstove, or rode a horse. Who else should read it? Anyone who has no such experiences!",
