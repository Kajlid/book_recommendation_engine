  "description": "YOU is the art of letting go in poetry book form. Full of powerful affirmations for the present moment, poet Jasmine Farrell teaches us that the only way we can actualize our dreams is to release what no longer serves us: those self-limiting beliefs, naysayers, and haters. In turn, that gives us the space we need to blossom into our best possible versions. By the last page, the reader will embrace their authenticity unapologetically and ultimately heal.",
