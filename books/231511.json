  "description": "To say that Rowen Greensmith has a large family would be an understatement. The Greensmiths are a large clan and a tight-knit bunch. Sure, her grandmother is in prison for a crime she committed decades ago, but even without her, the family has stuck together through the toughest of times. And some trying times are certainly ahead of them now.  Normally, a couple of adult women moving out on their own wouldn’t be cause for alarm. In the Greensmith household, it’s tantamount to a travesty. Rowen’s cousins are striking out on their own, spreading their wings, and leaving the nest. Her aunts are just beside themselves and tensions between cousins are running high.  With all this drama in her personal life, a murder was definitely not what Rowen needed! Unfortunately, this being Lainswich, it’s what she gets. When an inmate collapses at Lainswich Correctional, a poisoning seems to be to blame. But why was this woman murdered? And was she even the intended victim?  At least Rowen’s grandmother is another inmate at the prison and always ready and willing to help the family in whatever way she can. Now Rowen just has to get her cousins to stop bickering long enough to solve this thing. Never mind that their rivals at Channel 2 News are making life as a bunch of journalists harder for them. Being a Greensmith is great and all, but geez is it stressful.  Eighth Volume of the Lainswich Witches Mystery Series. Approx. 50,000 words in length. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
