  "description": "Lady Pia Brooks only ever loved one man. But… unfortunately, he died before she could tell him.  She could not forget the man who’d caused him pain. But… when Pia’s path crosses the gentleman’s she always thought was her enemy, it is not hate that blooms between them.  Lord Sirius Hayes never thought he’d see Pia again. When she needs his help, he’s more than willing to be the man she needs. Yet the past haunts them both and while Sirius’ secret may hold the power to help Pia trust him, it also holds the power to ruin the lives of many.  All is not what it seems.  There is a war building in the shadows of England, and Pia is in the middle of it. Only Sirius and his friends can stop it from taking more lives than necessary.  What will happen when Pia discovers that the boy she loved isn’t dead? What will she say when she finds out it’s been Sirius all along?",
