  "description": "On Halloween, you're supposed to dress up and have some naughty fun, but Sabrina's costume has invited more wickedness than she expected. The guy at the bar seemed so nice until he got her out in the alley behind the bar and his friend joins in. That's when she knew there was no escape.  Dante and Porter have been watching the little witch at the bar all night. They've decided to make her their toy for the evening, but she has no idea. They've been waiting for this moment, and now’s their chance.  This Halloween ménage is packed with filthy goodness and dark desire. Hold on to your broomsticks, and enjoy the ride!  BONUS BOOK: Taking What's Her's will be at the end of Taking What's Wicked as a bonus book for the first two weeks after the release of Taking What's Wicked",
