  "description": "Since 1996, the Colorado Springs Fiction Writers Group has been helping local writers improve their craft. In 2012, CSFWG took the next step in encourging creativity and drive in their members by publishing the first bi-annual anthology, taking the best stories on a particular theme from its members. This is the third anthology published by the CSFWG. It contains eleven different stories ranging in genre from paranormal fantasy and science fiction to horror and ghost stories to literary and romance. Each story takes the reader into an author's unique vision of Colorado thus the name of the anthology, Colorado State of Mind. Stories include works by Carrie Vaughn, A.M. Burns, Nicole Godfrey, Jason Dias, R.E.D., Todd Walls, T.B. Ray, Fatma Alici, Stanley Griffin, Jazz Feylynn, and Erik Johnson. Edited by Kari Wolfe.",
