  "description": "Twenty Three year old Sophie Farrier has everything a girl could want; the perfect job, the perfect flat and the perfect set of friends. As a travel writer, Sophie gets to fly around the world, meet new people, see new places and most importantly buy more shoes! When she is home her life speeds past in a blur of boozy nights, girly lunches and maxing her cards in her favourite shops. There are only two problems in her otherwise blissful life; dealing with the curse of being the clumsiest person alive, and the man she is obsessively in love with, Dan Shorely, already has a perfect girlfriend. The one aspect of Sophie s life that is not perfect and never has been is her love life. After years of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, are things about to change? Will she ever find and catch her perfect man? Or will the dream of a happy ending and the dream man always be that... just a dream?",
