Any second thoughts he has about his new life are erased when he meets Lily Joplin. Their connection is instantaneous.Lily is a talented singer, but her struggles with drugs and bipolar disorder hit too close to home for Payton’s comfort. And when her issues become all-consuming, he wonders if his music will be enough to carry him through.",
