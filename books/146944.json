  "title": "From His Lips",
  "description": "Troy Heathgate has it all - brains, brawn and the kind of smile that just begs a ribbon. Everything but the woman he loves. But now he’s back and determined to possess her. There’s just one catch - she’s married to another man. This short story (90 pages) contains spoilers. It is meant to be read after the full length novel, 53 Letters For My Lover. For readers who want more from the hero's point of view. From His Lips (53 Letters #1.5) expands on some of the crucial scenes, and includes a few new ones.",
