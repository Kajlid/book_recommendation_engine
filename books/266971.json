  "description": "To rid himself of the unrequited love he feels for one of his clients, Warren Melbourne thinks it’s best to keep his distance and avoid her calls, but he soon finds out it’s easier to plan than it is to execute. He has no defense against her. He cannot refuse her. He lives for the sound of her voice. If only she would acknowledge him—just ONCE! But how can she when she’s always in the company of her husband? God forgive him, he likes the husband, just not for her. Cassandra Corwin thinks she’s happily married to her college sweetheart until she hires Warren to design some furniture for her new project. He is shy and retiring, but she gets the distinct impression that he’s putting on an act, that underneath that easy-going attitude is a sleeping tiger. She senses it in him every time he comes near her, but try as she might, she cannot get him to let his guard down. She should let sleeping dogs lie, but the devil in her wants to poke him to get a rise out of him. And then there’s her husband. Everyone thinks they’re the perfect couple, but are they?
