  "description": "Ever since that fateful night Gabi Saw her first demon, she’s been questioning who and, better yet, what she is. When given a chance to find the answers she seeks, she seizes it, even if it means putting herself—and her beloved friends—in danger. From upstate New York to the streets of Manhattan, Gabi chases after the truth that has, until this point, remained out of reach. But when her whole world shatters, Gabi wonders if it would have been better to remain ignorant. Because once you know the truth, there’s no going back. In the final installment of the Silver Moon Saga, the stakes are higher than they've ever been for Gabi and her friends, and no one's guaranteed a happy ending. Will Gabi triumph or will the shadows claim her for their own?",
