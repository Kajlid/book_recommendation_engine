  "description": "In Best Lesbian Erotica 2011, women find love and lust in all the right places - kitchens, cars, dance clubs, dungeons, and even a flowerbed. This year's guest judge is the anything-but-shy Lea DeLaria, the multi-talented writer, stand-up comic, singer, and actor. She has selected work from some of the best-known writers of lesbian erotic fiction as well as debuts of startling new talents. A 1958 Mercury Park Lane rides like a sexual time machine in D.L. King's \"Walk Like a Man.\" In Betty Blue's \"The Garden of Earthly Delights,\" a lost boi encounters a firespirit on a romantic celestial plane. In Kiki DeLovely's \"The Third Kiss,\" a woman discovers it's not a good idea to tell your crush your dreams about her - unless you want them to come true.",
