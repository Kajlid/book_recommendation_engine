To boost the sagging economy, Mayor Thomas Orthell brought in a new tourist attractionâ€”an ancient town abandoned for almost a century. The Forgotten Place is rumored to be cursed and to hold the threat of death for any who enter. Now, the town and its curse have made their way to Ravens Cove. As mysterious deaths, legendary entities, and folklore come to life, the town is hurtled into a spiritual battle with a familiar nemesis. q",
