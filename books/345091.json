  "description": "The sequel to Amber Allure’s Best Seller October Trick of Silver... Darren Sumner spent fifteen years hunting werewolves, a member of the elite organization Argenti. But one night of betrayal sent him from his Argenti family to the arms of werewolf Aden Richter—one of the most powerful Alphas in Washington D.C. Neither can deny their passion or their hunger for the other, but as Darren tries to find his place in this new world, he wonders whether desire can be enough. Rumors of an upcoming power struggle between the packs bring the question of Darren’s role to the forefront. Is he Aden’s partner and a leader of the pack? Or is he nothing more than Aden’s lover, placed outside his family? Darren struggles to prove himself as the tensions between the packs mount and Aden’s ex-lover puts a plan of vengeance into action.
