  "description": "Quiet, yet discontented Hadley Town is about to wake up to a nightmare. Fourteen-year-old Jawan hadn’t been allowed to see his parents in eight years after the powerful Earth mage apprenticed him, and now he never will. They’d been struck down by the deadly purple plague that ravages Hadley Town. When his master’s magic fails to find a clue to this mystery ailment, Jawan embarks on his own search, and finds himself trapped in a world one billionth his normal size. In the world of Nanosia, where Queen Quanta is queen of the Quantum Realm, subatomic particles have a life and culture all their own. Jawan knows he doesn’t belong in this world. He’s desperate to return to his own world, but he has to find a clue to the plague and stop the dastardly Lord Elveston whose machinations threaten both worlds.",
