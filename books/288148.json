  "title": "The Dark Voyage and the Golden Mean: A Philosophy of Comedy",
  "description": "Professor Cook develops his philosophical exploration of comedy from the ideas of the probable and the wonderful. These two profoundly different approaches to human experience imply the related poles of rationalism-idealism, society-individual, concept-symbol, and reason-imagination. In discussing the implications of these symbolic attitudes, Professor Cook casts new light on the nature of both tragedy and comedy, their subjects, goals, and techniques.",
