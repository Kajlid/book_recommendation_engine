  "description": "If you change but your partner does not, something happens inside you that drive you until you understand it - this can be described as the feminine journey. Written FOR MEN ABOUT WOMEN this book guides the female reader to understand and express her emotions and unconscious needs. The book addresses men, and invites them to support what might seem like irrational and unreasonable women. The experience the book creates will guide the reader to change their existing perceptions about their own relationships and its true purpose. From deep within a women's private thoughts real life examples will create compassion for women's issues. Based on real life drama in relationships, the book addresses values and integrity in relationships for both men and women. Other similar books with a spiritual approach to relationship behaviour, described as conscious relationships, were written by Gary Zukav, David Deida and John Gray. Unlike previous books on the subject written by men, this book stands alone because it was written from a women's perspective to invite men into the previously forbidden creative world of women.",
