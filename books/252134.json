  "description": "The time is the late 1640s, the place, the New England coast. A young woman has been found dead, stripped naked and thrown in a river. Her husband has mysteriously halted his legal proceedings against the most likely suspect, who has disappeared into the wilderness. Based on an actual unsolved murder that took place in colonial New Hampshire, Robert J. Begiebing's THE STRANGE DEATH OF MISTRESS COFFIN is at once a spellbinding mystery and a fascinating evocation of life in early America. \"Unusual and mesmerizing. A striking and original work by a gifted writer with an extraordinary feeling for the past.\"--E. Annie Proulx, The New York Times Book Review; \"Begiebing illuminates 'the dark and wonderful intricacy' of the human heart.\"-- Yankee. A MYSTERY BOOK CLUB MAIN SELECTION and a LITERARY GUILD SELECTION.",
