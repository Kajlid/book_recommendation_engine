  "title": "A Country Doctor's Journal: Amazing Stories from Incredible Situations",
  "description": "Three women go into labor at the same time, and there's only one doctor in town. A man with a chainsaw nearly cuts off his nose, and the nearest plastic surgeon is 150 miles away. It sounds spectacular to us, but it's all in a day's work for a country doctor. This collection of true tales is a compelling read, and it illustrates the hard work and dedication of the men and women of medicine. Anyone who likes to read and especially fans of TV's popular medical dramas will love this book!",
