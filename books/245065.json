  "description": "A hair-raising ambush. A malfunctioning ship. A distant, uncharted part of the Universe.  Calexa Acura and her crew of misfits are lost, and their ship is in desperate need of repairs. When a massive spacecraft appears in their radius, they're helpless to resist its magnetic pull.  The terrifying ship is bigger than any craft she's seen in her life, and somehow, she doubts its occupants will turn out to be the friendly sort.  First Encounters are always better when they're amicable, but if necessary, Calexa and her crew will fight.  It's what they've always done.  Destroyer is a full-length science-fiction romance novel (95,000 words), and the first book in a new series. It contains violence, swearing, explicit sex scenes, and aliens! Warning and minor spoiler alert (for those who don't like surprises): this book includes MFM (male/female/male with \"two\" heroes). I wanted to let you know in case that's not your jam, but if it is, read on!Oh, and it's definitely recommended for readers aged 18 and over.",
