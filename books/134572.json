  "description": "If love was enough, April’s husband wouldn’t have been killed just days before his tour of duty was completed. All April has ever asked of God was for Adam’s safe return. Every day she sent up the same request, but now it is the day of Adam’s funeral and she wonders if God ever heard any of those prayers.  In an answer to April’s question of faith, God sends a very special angel. Is love enough? Yes, if it’s God’s love.",
