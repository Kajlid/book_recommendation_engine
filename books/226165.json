  "description": "Dandy Dan McCracken is a rogue wandering around eastern Pennsylvania and living by his wits in the middle years of the American Revolution. Through circumstance, he becomes a spy. Wounded and on the run from a sheriff, he’s rescued and nursed back to health by the lovely ward of Benedict Arnold’s procurement officer in Philadelphia. McCracken is enamored of the girl, but when her husband returns from the American front, he flees and falls in with a band of British spies. He switches sides again when he discovers his conscience as a result of falling in love, and not because he favors one side over the other. His actions now – not through choice but again through circumstance – make him a hero.",
