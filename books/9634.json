  "title": "Poirot: The Complete Battles of Hastings, Vol. 1",
  "description": "A brand new Agatha Christie omnibus, featuring four of the eight novels in which Captain Arthur Hastings appears alongside the world-renowned detective, Hercule The Mysterious Affair at Styles, The Murder on the Links, The Big Four and Peril at End House. Captain Arthur Hastings is well-known as Poirot's trusty sidekick, the perfect foil for the great detective and his 'little grey cells'. Yet although Agatha Christie wrote 33 novels about her famous detective, only eight of them actually feature Captain Hastings. Considered by many to be some of the very best Christie stories, the distinctive Hastings novels are distinguished by being recounted in the first person, just as Dr Watson wrote for Holmes. This omnibus volume brings together the first four Poirot and Hastings novels, including the very first book, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, the international adventures The Murder on the Links and The Big Four, and the ingenious Cornish mystery Peril at End House.",
