  "description": "Life was nothing but a game.People existed for her to manipulate.The first time pop singer Zephyr steps into Shadow's mani-pedi parlour, Shadow sees right through Miss Little Perfect's glossy pink smile and shiny doe eyes. And while Shadow lets her contempt show, sweet smiling Zephyr doesn't...until Shadow feels the singer's vengeance in the form of spilled acetone razing her skin.It's easy for Zephyr to retaliate; to inflict pain without raising a finger, though the hotel manicurist, Shadow, is her first victim to see right through her. Still, who cares? Zephyr's just toying around; life is merely a game.Yet the longer Zephyr stays in the decadent yet unsettling five-star Obsidian Hotel, the more she'll find that while navigating this place and its endless secrets remains a game, she is no longer the gamemaster, but a player just as much as her toys...Welcome to the Obsidian Hotel.",
