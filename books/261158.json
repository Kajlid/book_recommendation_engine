  "description": "Love is a four-letter word. So is jerk.   The only thing worse than a guy sneaking out in the middle of the night is finding he left a fat stack of cash as his only goodbye. Well, Leo Baxter can take that blue-blood money and whatever connection we had and shove it where the sun don’t shine.  It’s time to focus on hunting down my jailbird cousin, saving the family business, and keeping my uncle from taking a one-way trip to crazy town. Luckily, I’ve got some help from an unexpected source. I’m gonna wrap this up, tuck my heart away, and get back to real life… not the fairytale I was stupid enough to start believing in.   It shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Being used and exploited for my name and position is, unfortunately, not a new experience. But I thought Ruby was different—which is what makes her deception cut so deep.  Now it’s time for damage control and for Malcolm and me to go home and attend to our duties. Life is less complicated when you stay on the straight and narrow. Too bad those winding backroads are calling my name, and there’s only one person my heart wants to travel them with.  Blue Bloods and Backroads is the full-length follow-up to Between a Rock and a Royal and concludes Leo and Ruby’s steamy, laugh-out-loud story.",
