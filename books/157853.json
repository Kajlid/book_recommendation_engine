  "description": "THIS IS ISSUE 7 (BDSM Series)This is a true story of a FBI unsolved case involving missing DEA agents in the Caribbean Islands in the summer and fall of 1982. It was such an embarrassment for the United States government, that to this day, they deny the existence of this operation. All the dead and missing DEA male agents were found, yet the status of the female agents were never solved. My name is Jack Kane, and this is my untold story. Some scenes contain gratuitous sex.",
