  "description": "When all anyone ever sees is a quintessential southern bell, they miss the mark on who I really am. That was just the face I shared with the world; I kept the hell I truly endured to myself, because here in the south, secrets and the truth are best left unsaid.When returning home to Savannah after my mother’s passing, I had everything a girl could want: a new house, a handsome suitor, and the job of my dreams as an antique dealer. Little did I know that the choice to move on with my life would be the last decision I’d ever make.My name is Jorja Graham and my story is proof that not every romance has a happy ending ... especially once demons, witches, and angels get involved.",
