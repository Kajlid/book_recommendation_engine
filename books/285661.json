  "description": "The heartwarming true story of a greyhound named Bailey, the woman who rescued him, and the miraculous healing power of love . . . . One night, in the middle of a rainstorm, Barby Keel found an unexpected gift at the gates of her animal sanctuary: a poor little greyhound, shivering and wet, abandoned under the cover of darkness. Barby had never seen a dog in such pitiful condition. He was scarred with burn marks, and so malnourished that every rib showed through his patchy fur. Barby was determined to help this unfortunate abused animal—if he managed to survive the night . . . The dog—who she named Bailey—not only survived, he displayed a fighting spirit and loving nature that took Barby by surprise. She herself was facing health issues of her own, a personal battle which threatened the future of the entire sanctuary. But thanks to Bailey—and the powerful bond that humans and animals share—they found the strength to heal their bodies, hearts, and souls . . . together. Told with deep affection, honesty, and compassion, Will You Love Me? is an emotional and joyful story that reminds us that, in rescuing others, we rescue ourselves.",
