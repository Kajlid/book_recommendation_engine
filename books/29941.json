  "description": "A group of entities (Guides, Angels, and relatives) on the other side of the veil came together for the specific purpose of dictating this material to Sherri through automatic writing. \"The purpose of this book is simple. It is to help people make it through the Shift with as little stress and drama as is humanly possibleâ€¦\" This Shift is an extraordinary event of cosmic significance. It is something, the extraterrestrial beings are gathering from all corners of the universe to see. It is something that entities would give there 'soul teeth' to be part of because it is so juicy and so new and so historic. Being on this side of the Shift and having to worry about weather changes and storms and disasters isn't fun. But, the coming Shift that will move us to the other side will be an entirely different thing. The messages here will help each of us move through the Shift with less drama and pain in our daily lives. Part of Cortland's message here is that each of us has been chosen to live through this evolutionary period. And that each of us has a great responsibility--to each other and to the planet--to do everything in our power to put out positive energy and \"to bring and hold the light.\" This is a book filled with cosmic insight and hope. A guidebook for those getting ready for the next step in evolutionary consciousness.",
