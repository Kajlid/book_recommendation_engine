  "description": "When falling in love is the punchline . . .Farley Jones is being forced to date Meyer Harrigan, the man she has come to love, in order to make all of her stand-up dreams come true.It's agony-a tragedy, even. In lieu of flowers, please send cash . . .Meyer and his daughter Hazel have been everything to her since they came into her life three years ago. So, all joking aside, the stakes are especially high when it's not only her career, but both of those relationships on the line.A former stand-up star himself, Meyer has been vital to the trajectory of her career since he began managing her . . . Since he became her closest and most treasured friend, in the process.This friendship is the only reason why, when the biggest opportunity of Farley's career includes thrusting him back into the spotlight to stir up publicity, he agrees-in spite of his grumpiness, his protectiveness over Hazel, and his disdain for public attention.It doesn't take long for their act to bring all those other funny feelings out into the open, and, like most matters of the heart, it quickly begins to feel like anything but a joke.",
