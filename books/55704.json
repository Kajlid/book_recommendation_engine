  "description": "Welcome to Haver-Towne. The sedate colonial resort is the perfect place where Stew Fanshawe can get away from it all for a while. But instead of finding tranquility and self-reflection, Stew finds something much more unique: a town that was once steeped in a quagmire of witchcraft, satanic debauchery, and centuries-old occult science. Indeed, Haver-Towne has a most colorful history:A warlock who sires children with his own daughter, children to be used for something far worse than sacrifice. A witch whose carnal abandon and sheer diabolism stagger even the most demented imaginations. And a 300-year-old mansion in whose walls are embalmed the infernal secret of…Witch-Water.“What the hell is witch-water?” Fanshawe asks himself that first day he’d heard the macabre word, but when he finds out, he’ll wish he never had. His curiosity unlocks one morbid secret after another, and reveals a history of erotopathic witches, depraved covens, sick-in-the-head sexuality, and the most grotesque method of execution ever devised.Join Edward Lee in his over-the-top modern-day tribute to classic horror scribe M.R. James, a novel of immemorial curses, demonic lust, and absolutely unmitigated evil.",
