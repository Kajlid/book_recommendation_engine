  "description": "Farideh finds herself in the midst of a fast-paced murder mystery rife with political intrigue In the wake of the war brought on by the Sundering, Farideh’s adopted father Mehen has been called back by the clan that cast him out—and twins Farideh and Havilar mean to go with him. Just as Mehen confronts the head of his former clan, a clutch of young dragonborn is found in the catacombs. Not only have they been brutally murdered, their bodies lay near an infernal summoning circle—one that looks all-too-familiar to Farideh. Charged by Mehen's aunt to solve the mystery, Farideh, Havilar, and Mehen set out to find whoever—or whatever—is behind the murders. Meanwhile, on the other side of Toril, tensions escalate between Dahl and his newly-rescued family when the agents of a criminal organization show up at their home. Ashes of the Tyrant is the fifth book in the Brimstone Angels series.",
