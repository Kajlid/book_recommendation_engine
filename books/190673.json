  "description": "After her mother dies, a transgender teen is ripped from her father, and forced to live with her aunt and a homophobic preacher in the deep South. Her father finds an older Southern transgender woman who gives him a place to stay and helps him fight in court for his daughter. The girl makes friends with the star football player at the religious academy she is forced to attend. He's poor and an outsider too. They grow to be more than friends as it dawns on him he loves her no matter what she is or becomes. The preacher gets violent as he blames the girl for the loss of his wife, his job, and his effort to adopt the boy. The preacher practices his form of religious discipline, which is nothing but torture. He becomes more crazed and almost kills the girl and the boy. In the end, they come together. Their families are together. The girl realizes there was never anything wrong with her, it was the world surrounding her that was wrong.",
