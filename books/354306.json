  "description": "Titles in B.E.S. Dog Bibles present veterinarian-approved advice and information on specific dog breeds. Written especially for first-time buyers of a given breed, each title in this series describes the breed's traits, history, behavior characteristics, and recommended training methods. Prospective owners are advised on what to look for when choosing a puppy, how breed-specific traits influence the relationship between dog and owner, and potential health problems to look out for in specific breeds. They'll also find information on grooming, exercise, nutrition, health maintenance, training, and play activities. Interesting sidebars present fun facts, helpful hints, and quick tips on training. A hidden spiral binding ensures that the book will stay open and flat at any desired page. The DVD enclosed with each book presents an informal dog training course for new owners. It describes housetraining methods, walking dogs on a leash, and teaching obedience using hand signals and vocal commands. Each book is filled with attractive color photos. Pomeranians are the subject of this title. These small, friendly and playful dogs are long-lived and make wonderful household companions.",
