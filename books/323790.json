Free from the dismal research lab that has been her home as long as she can remember, she is taken in by a kind family, and finds in their daughter, Amanda, something she’s never had: a friend. For the first time, she feels happy. However, she quickly realizes that things are not as perfect as they seem... The local reverend and his followers begin to single her out, and violently conspire against her. Memories she’d long forgotten come back to haunt her.A shadowy figure with no eyes stalks the darkness and wants to claim her for its own dark designs. As these forces work to break Oumou down, her only points of solace are her new friend, and a bitter reporter with a strange ability of his own. They’ll have to fight together to stave off the encroaching darkness both of, and out of, this world.",
