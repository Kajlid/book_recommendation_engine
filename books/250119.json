  "title": "Lady Jane Grey: Nine Days Queen",
  "description": "For most, the name of Lady Jane Grey means the \"nine days queen,\" the child who was used as a pawn in the power politics of the Tudor realm by both her parents and the Northumberlands. This volume tells the tragic story of Jane's life and death, but also reveals her to be a woman of unusual strength of conviction with an intelligence and steady faith beyond her years. It also provides insight into the least known of Henry VIII's wives, Katherine Parr.",
