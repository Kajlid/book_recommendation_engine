  "description": "When Hurricane Katrina bore down on the city of New Orleans, I did not even consider leaving. The reason was simple, really- I did not have enough heroin to leave without facing the impending doom of withdrawal. Come walk with me, through the waist-deep flood water surrounding the neighborhoods in the heart of New Orleans. Feel the water sloshing in your shoes, ducking down darkened alleys, searching the desolation for my next fix.",
