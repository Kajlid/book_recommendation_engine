  "description": "I thought I had nothing left to give. It took two dirty bikers to prove me wrong. From USA Today bestselling author, Misty Walker, comes a dark, MMF MC romance. Cameron Bixby was in her third year of residency at UMC of Southern Nevada when her entire world was stripped from her. She was given a new name, Petra, and for two years, she was made the property of the worst kind of men who abused her until she was nothing but an empty shell. Then the Royal Bastards MC stepped in and saved her. Sly, club treasurer and resident hacker, and Moto, road captain and gearhead, were tasked with finding out who she was and what they should do with her. The woman was skittish, fragile, and addicted to God knows what, so luring information from her took… unique tactics. But as they coax her to health, they realize she’s so much more than the timid dove they rescued. She’s strong, intelligent, and sexy as hell. Suddenly, they aren’t sure if making her remember is the best idea. Because Petra belongs in the world of an MC, but Cameron Bixby doesn’t. *Petra's Biker is the 5th book in the Reno Chapter of the RBMC. Each book stands alone but has interconnecting characters .
