  "description": "Julianne Finnegan lives in the shadow of her adored but wildly successful brother, Michael. Her professional life is a disaster, she has no sense of herself outside her family, and she can’t face another Monday. A chance encounter with Oliver, a handsome young actor, gives her the courage to leave her job and prove her real potential. Julianne’s confidence soars as she meets the challenges of revitalizing the failing community theater. The time she spends with Oliver opens her eyes to a certainty she’s never known before, even in her successful brother. But as she starts to open her heart to Oliver, an old crush returns. Gavin, a famous movie director, has been Michael’s best friend for years and loved her as a little sister. The excitement and passion Julianne has developed for the theater shocks him into realizing she is a child no longer, but a beautiful talented woman who has captured his heart. Julianne is faced with some difficult choices. Will she choose glitz or a steadfast love?",
