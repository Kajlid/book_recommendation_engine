  "description": "Catweazle was a magician who lived in the eleventh century, but however hard he tried, his spells hardly ever worked. Then one day was different....the only trouble was that the magic had caused him to fly through Time instead of Space. Catweazle ended up at a place called Hexwood Farm, nine centuries later, where everything he saw appeared to happen by magic.",
