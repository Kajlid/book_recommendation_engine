  "description": "A Houseful of SuspectsIt’s the end of the summer, and prodigal daughter Maggie Crozat has returned home to her family’s plantation turned bed-and-breakfast in Louisiana. The Crozats have an inn full of guests for the local food festival—elderly honeymooners, the Cajun Cuties, a mysterious stranger from Texas, a couple of hipster lovebirds and a trio of Georgia frat boys. But when the elderly couple keels over dead within minutes of each other—one from very unnatural causes—Maggie and the others suddenly become suspects in a murder.With the help of Bo Durand, the town’s handsome new detective, Maggie must investigate to clear her name while holding the family business together at the same time. And the deeper she digs, the more she wonders: Are all of the guests really there for a vacation, or do they have ulterior motives?\nA Cajun Country Mystery",
