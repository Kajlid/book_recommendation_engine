  "title": "Richard Wagner and the Nibelungs",
  "description": "The four operas of Richard Wagner's epic opera cycle, the Ring, are among the greatest and most influential works in the genre. While their music has been the subject of lengthy discussion and analysis, there has hitherto been little scrutiny of their libretti, which Wagner wrote himself based on the German Nibelung sagas. This book reveals the resurgence of interest in saga and myth in Wagner's day, and, in establishing an authoritative bibliography of Wagner's Nibelung reading, shows how contemporary editors, scholars, and poets influenced the shape of Wagner's libretti. The resulting study sheds fascinating new light on these musical masterpieces.",
