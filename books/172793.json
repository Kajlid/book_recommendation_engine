  "description": "After rescuing Markus and Brian from the clutches of the sadistic Councilwoman, Shanna Crystal, the Mad Dogs are forced on R & R. None of them are happy and none of them want or need 'rest & relaxation' but they have no choice. The campground, Dad T's, is a gay soldier's wet dream for R & R but the Dogs barely have a chance to enjoy all it offers when everything they know about the supernaturals that inhabit the world is turned upside-down. A leisurely run in the Ocala National Forest turns their R & R into a mission. A mission that almost takes out the Delta Unit. Permanently.",
