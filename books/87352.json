  "description": "How much trouble can two third graders and one pint-sized alien get into? Plenty, as well as plenty of slapstick fun!It's just an ordinary school day when third-graders Lexie and J.P. see an unusual sign on the bulletin board. In silver letters that seem to float on the paper it Alien for Two Gugentocks Per Hour. Definitely weird.Before Lexie and J.P. can find any aliens, Bruce, the fifth-grade bully, finds them. When he tries to punch J.P., Bruce freezes in mid-swing, glows green, and floats off the ground. What on Earth is happening?The answer is not actually from Earth. His name is Bork, and Lexie has accidentally rented him for the price of two gugentocks--a.k.a. Twinkies. Just what other \"good deeds\" has Bork done for Lexie? And how will they undo them? Anything is possible when a junk food-loving alien comes for a visit!",
