I think a piece of me will always love you.But it all came crashing down when I realized you didn’t keep your promises to me.I refuse to take any of my days for granted. I learned that the hard way.So I’m sorry. But I can’t keep my promises to someone who didn’t keep theirs.XOXO,-Brooklyn Sanders",
