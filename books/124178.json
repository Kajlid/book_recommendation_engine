  "title": "Queen: The Life And Music of Dinah Washington",
  "description": "•Based on extensive family interviews and newly discovered documents •Intriguing story of a black woman pioneer in recorded music Dinah Washington sang pop, jazz, R&B and gospel, but most of all she sang the blues—\"Maybe I’m a Fool\" and \"I Wanna Be Loved\" and Muddy Water\" and (of course) \"What a Difference a Day Makes\" and countless others—all in a distinctive honey-and-vinegar voice that made everything she sang unmistakably her own. Dubbed both the Queen of the Blues and Queen of the Juke Box, Dinah Washington had songs, shows, lovers, and husbands. Controversial to the critics of her time, vastly influential to the next generation of singers, Washington will always be remembered for a life that was, first and foremost, music.",
