  "description": "Pinky is a recluse who rarely leaves the suburbs. When her husband, Pasha, goes missing-everyone assumes the worst, but she sets off to find him. In her search, she encounters a dream-like the ancient interior of the city she was born in; the bright farms and fields of Pasha's childhood and the dark wilderness of the mountains, she must finally confront her fears.Still Life is an experiment with visual storytelling, using pictures and words to create a world that is unsettling and extraordinary. Part road trip, part existential thriller, it seeks new ways to look at love, isolation, memory and loss, asking what connects us to each other and to the natural world, and how we are governed by impulses we barely understand.",
