  "description": "Jack Lantern, a pumpkin headed P.I. has his work cut out for him. Ever since Mia Lannigan fell from the sky, and lived through her own death, she has been getting Jack into more and more trouble. Strange, vile, people are coming out of nowhere to get their hands on her, cut her head open, and steal her brain. Worse still, Mia canâ€™t even tell Jack why, because she has no memories. Now, with time running out, Mia is beginning to sense that sort of dying did more to her than she thought. If Jack can help her survive long enough, working together, testing the limits of their magic, they may yet figure out exactly what happened and reunite her with her family.",
