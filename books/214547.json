  "description": "The magical properties of the birthstone Men-an-Tol are legendary. When Jo and the Bolithos crawl through it, the world on the other side looks very different. As they settle into their holiday cottage on the Cornish coast, Lola begins to grow younger, behaving with all the abandon of her volatile ancestor Lola Montez. Her son races towards senility, though not too fast to prevent him from responding to the sexual enticements of both women. But this is nothing compared to the behaviour of Jo, whose demonic alter egos interrupt her life with absurd, erotic and often violent results.",
