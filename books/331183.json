  "description": "Secrets are revealed, and I’ve never felt so betrayed. We had a plan, a good fucking plan, and with one explosion it all went to shit. Only, it wasn’t the bomb I set off that left destruction in its wake, it was the truth about my men. They've been hiding details about my life, and until they decide to share every last truth, they're choosing to live life on the edge of my blade. After all, secrets are dangerous when you're keeping them from me. At least I can count on one thing never changing—my love of killing.",
