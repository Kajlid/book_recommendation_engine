  "description": "Eighteen is hard. And so is Mateo Alesci. Hard to read, hard to predict, hard in every way that counts. He wants things from me. Dirty things, nasty things, forbidden things. And I have to give in. His attention is completely inappropriate, but I can’t say no. The way he looks at me… the way he watches me through my bedroom window… the way he drags me deeper and deeper into his completely forbidden fantasy just… turns me on. He knows it turns me on. He holds all the power. He holds all the cards. He holds my entire future in his hands. And I have to give in. Because Mr. Alesci is my teacher. And I need everything he’s offering.",
