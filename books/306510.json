The billionaire and the frugal queen are on a quest.Only one will win.And on Christmas evening, after we're stuffed silly, sung out, the kids fall asleep and the adults break out the bizarre presents and the alcohol, it'll be showtime.Because there ain't no competition like a McCormick competition.But the Jacoby family has a trick or ten up its sleeves, too.Declan and Shannon are back in yet another hilarious Christmas family saga in Julia Kent's New York Times bestselling romantic comedy series.It's a competitive Yankee Swap - what could go wrong?
