  "title": "Seeing Reality As It Is",
  "description": "\"Seeing Reality As It Is\", written by Joseph L. Giovannoli, is his second book describing biological processes that influence how we perceive reality. His first book, \"The Biology of Belief\", published in 2000 was recommended reading in college courses at a number of universities. Thus far, “Seeing Reality As It Is” has been favorably reviewed by Kirkus Reviews. In \"Seeing Reality As It Is\", the author examines why we have very different views of things such as climate change, political polarization, and reality in general. He cites research showing that our brains adapted to aid our survival and not to enable us to see reality as it is. He explains that the biases and brain traits we inherit, which he coined as our “genetic chaperones”, aid our survival by chaperoning our behavior with false perceptions of reality. Ego enhancing biases that build confidence are an example. He further examines how cognitive hackers use social media data about our chaperone profiles to create false realities by triggering our chaperones with propaganda. He also describes neurological processes that make it difficult for us to recognize our false perceptions and how our perceptions can be verified.",
