  "description": "My new motorcycle riding soulmate is half-demon, half-witch and all douche.  A douche who hates my other three soulmates. He’s a tattooed bad boy with a bad attitude, and he’s definitely not into thrice-married me with four kids under four. He’s also in desperate need of an erectile dysfunction spell. Seems the dickhead can only get hard when I’m around.  Owning a potion shop, running a coven of witches, and spending time with my four kids and their half-vampire, half-werewolf, and half-fae fathers is a lot--even for a superwoman like me. But if I have to give the demon asshole what he wants to get him to help with a spell for my cursed mother, I’ll do it.  Even if it means my family will never be complete, that the Oracle’s prediction of me having four soulmates, four husbands to share a life with, is all a lie … I’ll do it. And I’ll do it with my witch’s hat tipped, my little black dress pressed, and my broom in hand.  THE FAMILY SPELLS (THE FAMILY SPELLS #1 of 3) - this is a full-length, reverse harem, paranormal romance novel with a 'why choose' ending, meaning the main character gets a happily ever after with more than one man. It contains naughty scenes, magic, witches, demons, vampires, faeries, and werewolves as well as four unruly kids, spells for just about everything, and plenty of cursing.",
