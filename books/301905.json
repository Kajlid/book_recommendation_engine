  "description": "Who knew one small mistake—that just happened to go viral—would result in being exiled from my family and shunned by my coven?Not me. Yet here I am, in nowhere, Alaska, armed only with a laptop and my Pomeranian.But even witch magic can’t prepare a girl for the freezing temperatures, murderous moose, or the abundance of hot men.Jack, Ty, and Aiden walked straight out of the freezing ocean like some mythical gods, water sluicing from their broad shoulders. What starts as burning attraction quickly turns into searing kisses and hot nights between the sheets. But something isn’t right in this tiny Alaskan village. There aren’t any tourists. There’s no internet, and the locals shoo their children away when I walk past in the streets. There are secrets here I long to uncover. But not if that means the risk of exposing my own. Tempted is a ‘why choose’ paranormal romance perfect for readers who enjoy sassy heroines, sexy sea dragon shifter heroes, and enough steamy scenes to heat up even a cold Alaskan night. This is the first book of an ongoing trilogy.",
