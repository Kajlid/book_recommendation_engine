  "description": "Can a “plain Jane” tame a hot as hell cowboy?  Curt Tucker is used to melting hearts, having romanced his way through town, but what he really wants—the only woman he’s ever truly loved—she’s long gone. Jane Carpenter fell hard for the sexy cowboy, but his bad boy ways caught up with him, breaking her heart into a million pieces.  Now… years later… they are face to face again… nothing having changed. Curt, rugged and handsome, is even hotter than she remembered, weakening her resolve not to fall for him again.  He let her go once, but now… nothing will stop him from making her his forever.",
