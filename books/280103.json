  "title": "Birds Like Me",
  "description": "Birds Like Me collects odd moments of clarity found on dog walks and long drives, while working with students, and even while shopping for groceries. Like snapshots from a working mother’s life, the poems spring from conversations, fragments of memory, sudden lightning strokes of ideas, or snippets from longer stories. Maryland’s Eastern Shore offers the settings of Assateague Island, sleepy rivers, country roads, the Chesapeake Bay, and Ocean City’s inlet. Bared to full exposure, poetry also hides in the shadows waiting for release. Each piece is all truth and utter lies.",
