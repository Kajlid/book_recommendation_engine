  "description": "Emma Jameson is pretty darn happy with her life. She has a good job, a loving family, a decent social life, and a dog who simultaneously adores her and keeps her yard free of squirrels. But with the help of fate and her irresponsible older sister, she gets tossed into the middle of a mess, and comes out on the other side married to Mason, a stranger who makes a cement block look emotional. And let's face it, while her new husband is hot, that doesn't even begin to make up for the fact that he doesn't like dogs, and shows an equal aversion to all things messy and disordered. Too bad Emma named her beloved dog Chaos for a reason, and if she's moving into her new husband's house, the dog is moving in with her.While Emma is learning to live with an incredibly sexy but detached man, she's also faced with the disappointment of her martini-swilling grandmother (who dreamed of a wedding for Emma with a white dress and an open bar), a disapproving mother-in-law (who is convinced that Emma is a heartless gold-digger), and the kid next door who desperately wants to be a vet but finds himself next-in-line to take over his father's meat-distribution company. And Mason, God bless him, is slowly learning that order and serenity are less appealing than he'd once thought, particularly when love and Chaos are on offer.",
