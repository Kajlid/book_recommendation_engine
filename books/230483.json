  "description": "I’m the first Vampire human hybrid. Someday I will reclaim my father's throne. Until then, I’m stuck in freaking high school.\n No one knows I survived the attack on my royal family all those years ago. I owe my life to my guardians, two ancient Vampires who would give their lives to protect me.   I might have unspeakable powers of night, but right now? I need to pass AP calc, make a couple of friends, and try not to drink the sweet, young blood of my classmates. Being in hiding means pretending I’m a nice, normal, human teenage girl, and that’s the hardest part. I couldn’t be less interested in football games and prom dates.  Enter Dylan.  Dylan’s got gorgeous blue eyes, the body of an underwear model, and a laugh that turns my insides to mushy goo. He makes me want to be normal, to stick around this town for longer than a few months.  The craziest part? Dylan means that staying hidden is the last thing I want to do. He makes me want to go to prom. Prom!  So here I am, teenage Vampire Princess and cheerleader, pompoms and all. Trying not to drink my boyfriend like a juice box. Young love is complicated, amirate?",
