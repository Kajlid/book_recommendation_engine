  "description": "Here are fifteen stories-never before collected- spanning 36 years of Joe Haldeman's award-winning writing...tales that tread upon familiar Haldeman territory, as well as explore the outer reaches of his phenomenal imagination.  From the first short story Haldeman ever sold, \"Out of Phase,\" to \"A Separate War,\" which revisits a character from his classic novel The Forever War, to his personal favorite, \"For White Hill,\" based on a Shakespeare sonnet, this collection will take readers on a journey through a writer's growth from struggling artist to one of the premier voices of his generation. And notes on the stories at the end of the volume gives first-hand insight into the wit and wisdom that went into each of Haldeman's works.Contentsix • Meet Joe Haldeman • essay by Connie Willisxv • Introduction: The Secret of Writing (A Separate War and Other Stories) • essay by Joe Haldeman1 • A Separate War • [Forever War] • (1999) • novelette by Joe Haldeman36 • Diminished Chord • (2005) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman44 • Giza • (2003) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman49 • Foreclosure • (2005) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman61 • Four Short Novels • (2003) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman69 • For White Hill • (1995) • novella by Joe Haldeman111 • Finding My Shadow • (2003) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman127 • Civil Disobedience • (2005) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman135 • Memento Mori • (2004) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman139 • Faces • (2004) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman152 • Heartwired • (2005) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman155 • Brochure • (2000) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman157 • Out of Phase • (1969) • shortstory by Joe Haldeman173 • Power Complex • (1972) • novelette by Joe Haldeman215 • Fantasy for Six Electrodes and One Adrenaline Drip • shortstory by Joe Haldeman261 • Notes on the Stories (A Separate War and Other Stories) • essay by Joe Haldeman270 • Copyrights",
