  "title": "A Ghostly MÃ©nage",
  "description": "Jenna, desperate for change, buys a repossessed home on a whim. The townsfolk claim it's haunted, but Jenna's pretty sure all it needs is some filler to stop the drafts. Before long, even she has to admit, there's more going on here than the vagaries of an old house. Can it be ghosts making her panties wet and her dreams hot? Derrick and Mark, werewolf twins, are stuck in their house as disembodied spirits, all because of an evil witch. When their fated mate suddenly becomes the new owner, they end up taking haunting to a whole new erotic level.",
