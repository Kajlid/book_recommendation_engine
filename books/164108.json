  "description": "From Bestselling SANCTUARY, TEXAS series! Sexy vampires, dragon shifters, and werewolves! See how the scintilating romance and the exciting saga continues! Fire and ice don't go together... or do they? When the beast within wakes, her desires burn with a fire she can't escape. She won't let anything stop her, not even the fact that she has no memory. She doesn't know who... or what she is, but also can't shake the feeling that she's something more than human. Dragon shifter twin brothers, Miles and Eli Blackmoor, are exiled Drakonae kings. A thousand years ago they lost their soul mate, Diana Karlson. Betrayed by their own people, they spent centuries on earth searching for a way to reclaim their birthright and their wife. They've dedicated their lives to protecting the House of Lamidae, hoping one day one of the seers in the house would have a vision to help them. All the Sisters ever say is... she is coming to you. Warning: Contains scorching m/f/m menage, bondage, and a sassy dragon female who wants her mates to play!
