Edgar Hoover, the mob battles to control Cuba, Las Vegas and Hollywood, as well as the personal war between the U.S. Attorney General Bobby Kennedy and legendary Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa.O’Reilly and Dugard turn these legendary criminals and their true-life escapades into a read that rivals the most riveting crime novel.",
