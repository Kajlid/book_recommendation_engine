  "description": "See how it all began in this \"Cheetah-Licious\" collection that includes three new stories! Galleria finds out that her mean old neighbour's pooch is about to have puppies - her dog is the father! Soon Galleria and her family are caught up in a humongous custody battle. Next, Chanel's trying hard not to have a cheddar cheese meltdown with all the drama in her life while the Cheetah Girls have to get back their street cred after losing the Apollo Theatre Amateur contest. Then, the Administration of Children's Services tries to take Dorinda's foster brother Corky away from Mrs Bosco. Will the Cheetah Girls still want to help Dorinda after they discover the terrible secret she's been hiding from them? Finally, just as the Cheetah Girls are getting hyped to record their bomb-ditty doodle demo, the twins Aquanette and Anginette deliver the worst possible news - they won't be able to sing with the group! The Cheetah Girls are so close to their dream, and yet so far. Will they finally be able to catch their shooting star?",
