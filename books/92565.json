  "description": "Seven years ago Danielle Hamilton left her home in Serenity Cove leaving behind a drug addicted mother, work-obsessed Grandmother and the first boy she has ever loved. Danielle promised herself she would never return, but now - she has no choice. The family Inn her Grandparents put their lives into is going under and Danielle is the last hope they have to save it. When she temporarily returns to her home town, she’s even less prepared than expected to run into her first love, Oliver Garrison. After their encounter leaves her on edge she decides what is really needed is a distraction. What she doesn’t expect is the way she feels when she meets Corey Preston with the bad boy edge, a gentle heart and smoking body. Oliver is everything she thought she ever wanted while Corey is everything she never thought she needed. Dani promised herself when she left Serenity Cove at 18 that never again, would this be her home. However, her heart didn’t get the memo and for the first time in her life, she feels at home. But will her demons from the past let her have the love she deserves? Or will she return to her life in New York - once again leaving her heart behind in the one place she fears to be?",
