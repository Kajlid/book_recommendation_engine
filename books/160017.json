  "description": "Whether it be nail-biting courtroom suspense surrounding a celebrity star on trial; the tear-jerking return journey of an ageing war veteran to the battlefield of his youth; an hilarious account from a dog's perspective of the eccentric clientele that frequent his master's restaurant; a bittersweet tale of a vendetta waged by a young girl denied her favourite ice cream; or the adrenalin-fuelled adventures of a terminal cancer patient turned base jumper - these make up just a handful of examples of what to expect in this riveting short story collection. 'Immensely Visual' and 'Highly Versatile' are by far the most frequently recurring descriptions of the author's bold style of writing given by early reviewers of 'Impromptu Scribe', his d√©but short story collection.",
