  "description": "\"Charlotte stood mesmerised. The piece was beautiful, not only sexual but conveying the deep love the man felt for this woman and the growing child in her belly. A tear slid silently down her cheek as she stared at the sculpture. She felt starkly alone for a moment, and then tensed as she felt Daniel move behind her.\"  When Charlotte Ranleigh first laid eyes on Daniel Winterflood she was unprepared for the instantaneous jolt of lust that ran through her. Only a year had passed since the sudden death of her husband. Since that terrible day, the beautiful and talented young widow had been in self-imposed exile at her marital estate in the Southern Highlands, trying to make sense of her loss and blaming herself for the part she'd played in it. There were many things Charlotte believed were beyond her now - a happy marriage, children, and her dream of starting an art school at Ranleigh Park. Certainly, she'd never thought she'd desire anyone again, especially not the playboy art-dealer she'd only just met...  \"Her hand was tiny but her grip was firm and he held it for as long as it took to deliver the best knockout million dollar smile he could muster. God, how was he going to keep his promise after her overwhelming onslaught of all his senses?\"",
