  "description": "Heroes aren't defined by shining armor, golden crowns, or noble virtues. Beggars, thieves, killers, children, and foolsâ€”a hero is anyone who takes a stand against oppression, abuse, and evil. Ragged though they may be, they hold their ground, defy hopeless odds, and conquer the impossible no matter the personal cost. Eighteen bestselling and award-winning authors give you a look at what it truly means to be a the simple act of standing up and making a difference, even to just one person.",
