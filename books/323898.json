  "description": "Rijou’s notorious Court of Blades is as corrupt as it is violent. Here, justice is bought and sold as lives are destroyed with impunity – all to serve the duchy’s Ascendant Houses as they consolidate power by orchestrating the entirely legal murders of those who oppose them.Into this world of corruption a mysterious duellist arrives, daring to foil the schemes of her enemies and setting the duchy’s elites against each other. They call her Lady Consequence, but she once had a different name – years ago before her family was slaughtered and she was consigned to the prison mine known as the House of Tears. Now she has returned with the plan and the means to rescue her brother and restore their house.But the secret forces who engineered the deaths of her family have plans of their own for this beleaguered duchy, and if Consequence hopes to defeat them, she’ll first have to prove her wits as sharp as her rapier, and truly earn the title of Our Lady of Blades.",
