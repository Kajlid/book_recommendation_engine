  "description": "Are you puzzled by women and their sexual desires? Do you wonder, for example, whether your girlfriend or wife really likes giving—and getting—oral sex? What are her secret fantasies? What is it that she really needs to have an orgasm? Wonder no more. In What Women Really Want in Bed , over 200 women of all ages, backgrounds, and walks of life reveal frank, no-holds-barred truths about what turns them on, why they’ll choose a good book over torching the sheets with their lovers, and what they wish men knew about sex.  Discover exactly what your wife, girlfriend, or one-night stand wants you to know about foreplay, sexual positions, orgasm, and getting them into the mood—and into the bedroom. An insider’s guide to women’s sexual psyche, this book debunks sex and seduction myths, explicitly tells you what she needs between the sheets, and gives you the hand, mouth, and position techniques she’s been craving.",
