  "description": "A very confused Viking finds himself hurtled through time to face the rigorous ordeals of the Navy SEALs. Yet while his brawn allows him to easily adapt to the military, he's no match for one of the most difficult challenges of all-the modern-day woman.What do you get when you cross a Viking with a Navy SEAL? A warrior with the fierce instincts of the past and the rigorous training of America's most elite fighting corps? A totally buff hero-in-the-making who hasn't had a woman in roughly a thousand years? A wise guy with a time-warped sense of humor chanting grody jody calls? A dyed-in-the-wool romantic with a hopeless crush on his hands-off superior officer? Hoo-yah! Whatever you get, women everywhere can't wait to meet him, and his story is guaranteed to be . . . WET & WILD",
