  "description": "It was a warm summer morning when the dead began to rise up and feast upon the living. The city was overrun in a matter of hours.The military acted immediately. They closed all the exits leading out of the area in order to contain the outbreak. They shot anyone trying to escape.Their methods were successful. The outbreak was contained, but all hope for the people trapped behind the gates . . . had been lost.The EPUA website was the only form of communication still available to the survivors. It was there that the legend of the General began to take root. He was a hero that fought back against the zombies . . . a hero that saved lives. The survivors once again found something to believe in, but the rest of the world wondered if the man truly existed.They were about to find out.The fifteen minutes of footage was leaked onto the internet only minutes after it was filmed. It showed a single man standing between a horde of zombies and a group of frightened survivors. What happened next was amazing . . . and it made the world believe. Because within those fifteen minutes of footage, the man known only as the General stepped out of legend and entered reality.",
