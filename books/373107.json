When the body of an unidentified man dressed in the uniform of an 18th century British soldier is found in the Concord woods, Sweeney can't help but want to know more. Soon, with the help of a young boy who has secrets of his own, she's looking into the 230-year-old disappearance of a local stonecutter who was one of Concord's famous Minutemen. But when her sleuthing collides with Cambridge homicide detective Tim Quinn's own investigation into a more recent disappearance, Sweeney has to face the fact that Concord's historic past may not be laid to rest and that secrets forged during the founding of a nation can come back to haunt the present in terrifying ways.",
