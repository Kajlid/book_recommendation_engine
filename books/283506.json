  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author W Winters comes an emotionally-gripping, romantic suspense.I fell for someone I shouldn’t have. I’m not the only person to ever do such a thing. I know that. And I’m not an awful person for desiring his touch, his kiss, his everything… but I knew I shouldn’t have indulged. There’s something about knowing it’s wrong that tempts me that much more. The seduction became a game with higher stakes than any before him. In fact, it was only ever him.The thing is, I knew I shouldn’t. Now that the game is over and the pieces have fallen… I know I should have just walked away. There’s no way out of the wreckage. That doesn’t change the fact, that I wanted him more than anything. I still want him more than anything. Tempted to Kiss is book 3 in a series. Hard to Love (book 1) and Desperate to Touch (book 2) must be read first.",
