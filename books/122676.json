  "description": "I may have escaped their house but there is no running from Grayson, Royce, and Logan. Not when Royce knows my most precious secret, Logan refuses to let me go, and Grayson hates to see me remotely happy. As if I don’t have enough to deal with already, between worrying about my daughter and dodging my sleazy boss, not to mention keeping up my grades, now I have to worry about what Royce might do with my secret while attempting to get over Logan and avoid Grayson at all costs. Except Halston is a small campus, and at least one of them keeps showing up in my life. It makes forgetting they exist impossible.However, when shit hits the fan, they’re the ones I end up turning to. The only ones I can trust. Who knew my life would only get more complicated second semester?",
