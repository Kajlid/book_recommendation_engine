  "description": "This is a humorous story about the zombie invasion of Las Vegas.Many things are lost in Las Vegas: innocence, paychecks, Little Scotty’s college fund. But the worst of all...is humanity. Once a man’s been bitten by lady luck, the hunger becomes infectious, and before he knows it he’ll chew the arm off the guy sitting next to him just to win a hand of poker. Especially if he’s a zombie.Las Vegas has been overrun by flesh-eating, undead monsters that are now flooding the Strip and obliterating everything in their wake—cars, tourists, and even casinos. First on their path of destruction: the Olympus, Las Vegas’s premiere hotel and casino, which is currently housing a human buffet-line that’s been trapped inside by a poorly thought-out, self-locking alarm.Amid the chaos of hungry zombies are a handful of survivors not yet food for the slow (but persistent) tourists-turned-undead: a guitar-wielding Elvis impersonator and his nostril-mining son, a feminist stripper, and an alcoholic janitor whose drunken hijinks might just be the only thing keeping him alive. Cornered inside an overflowing casino, the only place for this rag tag crew to go is out, but is there any place safe? Can they evade the soulless Bobby Darin impersonator who’s become unofficial king of the zombies? Have the zombies taken over every last casino in Vegas? Or were they always there to begin with?Written by the co-authors of the popular web-comic A Beer for the Shower, and the novel The Missing Link.",
