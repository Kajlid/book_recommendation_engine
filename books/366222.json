  "description": "Lest Ye Be Judged is the third installment in the Adam Omega, Vampire series. Adam Omega once a man of God was turned over a thousand years ago in order to save his wife Eyanna from death or worse at the hand of vampires. Adam has become the most feared and powerful of all his kind. He walks in the light of the sun, eats, drinks, cast a reflection and does what he pleases. Adam also wears an amber cross and goes into the churches just to prove that he can. A few years ago Adam found that the soul of his wife has been reincarnated into the body of Eve Moses. Adam is not your typical vampire, bemoaning his life, seeking redemption. He enjoys the power he possess and use it to the fullest. Readers have taken to this sexy anti hero in a big way. L.A. Banks author of the famed vampire Huntress Series has given Mr. Omega two thumbs up.",
