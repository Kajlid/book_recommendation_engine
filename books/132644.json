  "description": "Now and then, you see something that alters how you view the world. That's what teen orphan Grace MacKenna learns in this paranormal suspense novel, Into the Mystic, the first book in The Crossings Trilogy. Death, ghosts and the foibles of the living all collide together for our insufferably independent protagonist as she escapes from a volatile aunt in Boston to the secluded mountains of West Virginia, wrestles with lingering anger over the horrific deaths of her parents and sister, finds unexpected friendships in the local riverside town, and tackles a budding romantic triangle with two very different young men one living, one dead. In her isolated mountainside home, Grace discovers how to see and talk with ghosts. In particular, she is pulled into the life of a dashing Civil War ghost, William, and unwittingly finds herself helping him resolve unfinished business so he can cross into the hereafter. But is Grace actually experiencing angels and demons in disguise? Will she find out too late? And will her developing love for the ghost affect her decisions regarding her real-life romance? Before learning the answers, you ll journey with her to the backwoods flatlands of Georgia, and to Antietam Battlefield (during a full moon \"when the divide between life and death is weakest...\") where Grace interacts with menacing ghosts. Join Grace as she learns that forbidden love can make demands that teeter between life and death.",
