  "description": "MAC THINKS THE ATTRACTION BETWEEN HER AND BOSTON IS MERELY PHYSICAL. SO WHY DOES IT FEEL IMPOSSIBLE TO LET HIM GO?If you had met me before this week, you’d have thought I was one of the most responsible, play-it-safe human beings on the planet. You’d have assumed someone juggling three jobs and managing her own business wouldn’t even have the time to get involved in messy relationships.That’s what I thought, too.I was wrong.This week, I met Boston. He wears the ripped, shaggy-haired, and adorable look like he was born that way. I’m game for some harmless flirting, maybe a little more, and he definitely doesn’t have any objections. Why deny the obvious spark we have?Because that’s all it is: a spark. The sooner I can enjoy a taste of Boston’s lean, chiseled body, the sooner this silly infatuation of mine will be over.Then I’ll be safe.Except that kissing Boston doesn’t snuff out that spark. Not the first time, or the second, or the third.Instead of satisfying my curiosity, I want to know about him: why he’s dropped everything to help out his family, why he has a way of calming tense situations down, why I can’t get enough of his smile.Why he’s making me question everything I thought I wanted.Why I can’t stay away...18+ due to mature content.
