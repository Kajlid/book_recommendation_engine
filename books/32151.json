  "description": "\"A tense, thrilling, fabulous tale.\" ― Philadelphia Inquirer They were American and British air force officers in a German prison camp. With only their bare hands and the crudest of homemade tools, they sank shafts, forged passports, faked weapons, and tailored German uniforms and civilian clothes. They developed a fantastic security system to protect themselves from German surveillance. It was a split-second operation as delicate and as deadly as a time bomb. It demanded the concentrated devotion and vigilance of more than six hundred men―every one of them, every minute, every hour, every day and night for more than a year. Made into the classic 1963 war film of the same name starring Steve McQueen, James Garner, and Richard Attenborough. 16 pages of photographs",
