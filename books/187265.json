  "description": "Book 2 and the final of the Borden series.  WARNING: This book contains sexual situations - of a very rough nature - violence, and strong language that may be offensive to some. I fell in love with a very bad man.  Marcus Borden is that very bad man, but I knew that already. I accepted it. I just didnâ€™t expect to be pulled into the darkness of the world he'd worked so hard to hide from me. Now he's let me in and showed me what he's capable of - and it scares me. It scares me to think I'm in love with a man that has enemies who would do anything to hurt me.  And with a dark threat on the horizon, I need to ask myself just how far I'm willing to go to be with him. And how deeply in love I am with him to accept his darkness.",
