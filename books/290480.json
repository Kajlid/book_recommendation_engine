  "title": "Travel in Time: A Life Story in Poems",
  "description": "Life experiences are unique and inestimable. And exactly those values I aimed to capture in my poems. Life could be an adventure, a dream, an illusion, a wonderful poem or endless love.  TRAVEL IN TIME is not only a collection of poems, it is for you as a reader an experience into a new world, into the world of poetic and romantic imagery. Step out with me in time, there where you will touch with your spirit the Transylvanian green mountains, will listen to the song of a lonely shepherd, or you will hear the howling wolfs in the moon’ light. Experience with me the innocent emotions of the first love, breath the fresh air of a foreign country, meet the parents with hearts of diamonds, smile at the innocent sight of an angel, and perhaps, you will encounter a seldom beauty, the Queen of the Night. The images, thoughts and emotions you will experience reflect vivid moments from my life.  Perhaps, along the journey, you will encounter familiar situations or places, and maybe you will smile by reminiscing your own adventures, your own memories, your own love story.",
