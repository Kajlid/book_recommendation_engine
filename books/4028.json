  "description": "When food is your life, it's hard to think of anything else. Still, Garfield manages. Whether it's time to clean out Jon's drawers his way, finding a hiding place that's too good, or discovering he can sleep in any position, half the fun of Garfield is watching his between-meal antics. In his twelfth book, he's up to his usual tricks, and that's all his fans need to hear.",
