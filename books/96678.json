  "description": "Every dog deserves a forever home, and after being mistreated and given up several times, Wrigley has finally found his. The good-natured, smart mutt now spends his days as the house dog at SunRidge Assisted Living, comforting and doting on forty-five seniors. Wrigley has free run of the place—going where he senses he’s needed—but his preferred spot is beside his favorite resident, Marjorie Thompson.A big shift comes to SunRidge when a cranky curmudgeon named Walter Kepsen moves in across the hall from Marjorie. Having arrived reluctantly at the urging of his son, Walter can't stand Wrigley or anything else for that matter. But a dramatic event is about to occur that will shake SunRidge, and make the old man see the house dog in a very different light.Told in Wrigley’s voice, All That Ails You is an endearing story about the power of a dog’s love, when we need it most.",
