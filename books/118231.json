  "title": "Lady of the Lake",
  "description": "As with the Unicorn, Heaven and Earth have no separation within me. I am the One. The once-mighty Roman Empire is crumbling, and the empire has been pulling its legions from the farthest outposts of its vast territory. The withdrawal of Rome's legions has left the island of the Britons in a state of uncertainty, vulnerable to attack and invasion from all sides. Niniane, a novice priestess, is largely unaffected by the events troubling her land. But she confronts troubles of her own as facets of her emerging nature bring her into conflict with the rules governing temple existence. Only when she emerges from the temple does she come face to face with her destiny - a destiny entwined with those of a Roman commander and his men - a destiny that reveals the truth of who she really is. Although Niniane's true identity was lost, long ago, in the mists of time, an echo of her story remains in the mystical legends of the Lady of the Lake, who appears, often unexpectedly and always indefinably, in the stories that comprise the Arthurian legends. Niniane's real story, though, is a journey of inner transformation and self-realisation. As her story unfolds, and she rediscovers the truth, she becomes a message and an example, the potential of which has the power to transform all of humanity.",
