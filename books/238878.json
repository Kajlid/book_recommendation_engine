  "title": "The Royal Wedding",
  "description": "When most girls get engaged, they face a disapproving mother-in-law. In my case, it’s a disapproving nation. How can we possibly get married when the entire kingdom is trying to break us up?No one—and I mean no one—wants me (a former anti-royal blogger) to marry Prince Arthur. The anti-royals haven’t forgiven me for abandoning ship and swimming over to the prince’s yacht, and the royal watchers won’t ever forget all the horrible things I said about their beloved monarchs. The king, (a.k.a. my nasty future father-in-law) is going to throw every obstacle in my way, including a beautiful, poised, and highly accomplished doctor who also happens to be in love with my fiancé. But I’m determined to make this work and keep my fledgling career as a reporter intact. Arthur’s the most wonderful man I’ve ever known (the sexiest, too), and we will get our happily ever after. I hope. To be honest, I’m terrified that Arthur is questioning whether it’s even worth all this trouble. And I’m starting to wonder the same thing… The Royal Wedding is a heartwarming and hilarious romance featuring a bride with more haters than Justin Bieber, a prince who just might crack under the pressure, and the world’s most embarrassing bridal shower. It’ll have you laughing, cringing, and cheering.",
