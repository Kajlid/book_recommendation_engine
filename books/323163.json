  "title": "Drui Claiming",
  "description": "Drui Claiming Jory Strong \"Book 4 in the Supernatural Bonds series.\" Dragons. They huff and puff and burn the house down when they don't get their own way. They're possessive, dominating, and don't know the meaning of \"carefree\" because they're weighed down by all the treasure they feel compelled to guard. They're trouble but it doesn't change the fact that Marika has it bad for a certain silver-blond male named Xanthus whose dark, dark eyes have a lethal effect on her libido. She wants him, but she can't have him. Dragons don't share and she comes from a long line of tree-hugging, multi-partnered Drui. There are threesomes, foursomes-and more. But there are no twosomes and she's already got one permanent man in her life, Tallis-a shapeshifting Sjen who is every bit as dominant and possessive as a dragon. It's a hopeless situation, or so it seems, until Fate intervenes and Marika decides to go for what she wants-both Xanthus and Tallis in her bed. And if the men want to \"do\" each other? She's all for it. \"Reader Advisory: While every effort has been made to enable Drui Claiming to be read as a stand-alone story, it is set concurrent to Sophie's Dragon in the Supernatural Bonds series, and some story elements mentioned in Drui Claiming are explained in more depth in Sophie's Dragon.\"",
