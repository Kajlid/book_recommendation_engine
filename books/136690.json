  "description": "Polly Wilkins is a successful freelance journalist/writer. She has been living with her partner Steve in what her parents call sin for the last eight years. But, to her parents disappointment, there are no signs of wedding bells or the patter of tiny feet on the horizon. Why? Because Polly is not in the least bit maternal. Can this all change after Polly and Steve have a torrid weekend looking after her nephew? Or will Polly stick to her guns and lose Steve forever?",
