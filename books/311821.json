Sexy lingerie under my dress, check. After four months of working up my nerve, I was going to finally shed my v-card. The problem? My date dumped me for someone else. I vow this summer I’ll be different. I’ll be that daring girl that has a summer fling without a care in the world. I’ll find some hot, outdoorsy guy who can show me what I’ve been missing. And when summer ends, I’ll blow him a kiss and walk into my big, bright future with my heart intact. Enter dirty-talking raft guide Caleb Morgan, a perfect target for my lust. But one (incredible) night becomes two, then four...and pretty soon I’m falling. Hard. Can I save myself before it’s too late? If you like the sweet heat of Lauren Blakely and the emotional journey of Corrine Michaels, you will love Dakota Davies’ sexy new family saga.",
