  "description": "Which is worse: to love your mother fiercely only to lose her? Or never have a mother at all? Obie and Princess never debated this issue. They were equally motherless; it’s what forever binds them. Obie is a former street child & junkie's son; Princess was raised in splendor on Park Avenue. When Princess is three, Obie is her babysitter; when she’s thirteen Obie's her best friend and confidant. At eighteen Princess dreams of being an R&B Diva and Obie, whose \"Rags-to-Riches\" transformation into a music video superstar/director captured America's attention, knows just how to make that dream come true. Their lifelong bond grows into mutual attraction, yet Princess isn't satisfied being one of Obie's groupies. Inevitably the two fall head-over-heels in love. Social-class differences, color complexes and being stalked by an ex-boyfriend strain their budding relationship until, on the closing night of her second tour, the ex shows up uninvited and unwanted, and Princess disappears with him. But when Obie's abandonment issues crash head first into Cess's need for emotional distance the fireworks really begin. Then the question becomes: Can a motherless child ever truly open his or her heart enough to love someone else?",
