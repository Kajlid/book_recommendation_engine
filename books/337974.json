  "description": "Eleanor Rigby is tiny, blind, left behind, and led by her zealous, overprotective guide dog, Warren, coursing constantly through the places she knows. Tired, mired, and sequestered from the world, Eleanor can't shake the feeling she's going nowhere slowly. Until she recognizes something in the sound of Ewan Dempsey, reclusive and compulsive maker and player of cellos, who impels in Eleanor a rare moment of caprice.",
