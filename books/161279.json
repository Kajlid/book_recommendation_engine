  "description": "Collision Course is an intense police procedural and legal thriller incorporating elements of blind political aspirations, human failings, and hope. In the style of Scott Turow and John Grisham, Collision Course is a fascinating and enjoyable read. The novel is set in the background of the strained relationship between the Police and the minority community arising from racial prejudices embedded within police departments. Sergeant Josh Williams, East Providence (RI)) Police Department and his fatal encounter with Anthony ‘JoJo’ Machado, a troubled Marine Corps war veteran, becomes a victim of politics and the quest for power. The tragic taking of a life used to further one man’s personal gain. The novel explores the human aspect of those thrust into a nightmare beyond their control. An ambitious US Attorney turns the rage of racial inequality into a platform for a run for the US Senate, perverting the Justice system and trampling over anyone in his way to succeed. A misogynistic, but brilliant, defense lawyer stands between the abuses of the government and pursuit of the Justice. Collision Course is a must read for fans of courtroom drama and the deadly situations Police officers face on a daily basis.",
