  "description": "The funny classic middle grade book about a boy who accidentally hatches a dragon. Sixth grader Jeremy Thatcher discovers a strange magic shop he has never seen before. He enters, and his life is changed forever. After he leaves Mr. Elives’ magic shop with a strange marbled egg, it soon becomes clear that this is one pet he wasn’t prepared for! How is he supposed to keep a flame-breathing dragon with razor-sharp teeth and an out-of-control appetite in his bedroom? But if the playful baby dragon is ever to grow up to become a magnificent beast of myth and legend, it needs Jeremy. And though he doesn’t know it yet, Jeremy needs a dragon. ★ “A funny, enjoyable, imaginative story whose serious undercurrents lend it unexpected depth.” —Kirkus (starred review)",
