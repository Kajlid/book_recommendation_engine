The caveat: he will lose his memory and his form. Waking up in the town of Nofer in Daganland,an outpost of the empire, Brad enters into a foreign land of beehive-patterned buildings,where residents are forbidden friendships, and social interactions of any sort except in a work related setting.Ruled by a tyrant,the inhabitants are monitored in all aspects of their life.  The strange town filled with smoke and mist where the sky glows as if on fire becomes a testing ground for his wits and cunning in his struggle to survive.His memory is gone, but he knows he doesn't belong here.
