  "description": "The unquenchable quest for wealth killed the world. Great armies were not the weapon of choice. Something smaller was the nemesis of mankind. Genetically engineered nemotodes - microscopic worms designed to destroy rice crops. A miscalculated attempt by Western powers to rewrite their fate which ends with a world devoid of vegetation. Billions have perished. The air is heavy with poisons. Food is in short supply and cannibalism is common.Only the biggest seas and rivers remained unaffected. Those that had the means took to the oceans - harvesting the sea, safe from predators. With the promise that they would return. Decades have passed without hope.Sam - a woman born out of chaos and a borderline sociopath - comes to act as a guide for others in search of a ship which they believe contains large stockpiles of seeds. Sam’s true motivations are constantly brought into question as the party face a series of challenges – emotional and physical - as they make their way through Eastern Europe.",
