  "description": "She gave up stripping to go legit until three Kiowa cowboys bring on the down-and-dirty.\nJackson Gray Wolf is turning thirty, and what does he have to show for it? A ranch. No wife, no kids, no dates. He's had his eye on the pretty owner of the Ugly Stick Saloon, but their one accidental encounter was interrupted before he could get her out of her take-me-now red cowboy boots.Audrey Anderson isn't in the market for a man. Been there, done that, has the scars to prove it. She retired her pole-dancing boots after purchasing the Ugly Stick Saloon, and now manages a stable of strippers. When she winds up one stripper short for a private party, she's forced to slip on a mask and into the role of the mysterious Kiki.Jackson didn't want the birthday bash his twin brothers are throwing him, but his vow to ignore the rented stripper goes awry when she shows him exactly how far she's willing to go for all three of them.Audrey can't forget the sizzling heat between her and one sexy Kiowa in particular. Jackson. Trouble is, she's not sure if he wants the bold, brassy Kiki, or if he's ready for the wounded woman underneath.Warning: This title contains hot scenes with multiple partners, with a little BDSM on the side. Caution it could melt your e-reader!",
