  "title": "Make Something Up: Stories You Can't Unread",
  "description": "Stories you'll never forget—just try—from literature's favorite transgressive author Representing work that spans several years, Make Something Up is a compilation of 21 stories and one novella (some previously published, some not) that will disturb and delight. The absurdity of both life and death are on full display; in \"Zombies,\" the best and brightest of a high school prep school become tragically addicted to the latest drug craze: electric shocks from cardiac defibrillators. In \"Knock, Knock,\" a son hopes to tell one last off-color joke to a father in his final moments, while in \"Tunnel of Love,\" a massage therapist runs the curious practice of providing 'relief' to dying clients. And in \"Expedition,\" fans will be thrilled to find to see a side of Tyler Durden never seen before in a precursor story to Fight Club.Funny, caustic, bizarre, poignant; these stories represent everything readers have come to love and expect from Chuck Palahniuk. They have all the impact of a sharp blow to the solar plexus, with considerable collateral damage to the funny bone.",
