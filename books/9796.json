  "description": "Nancy Harmon had fled the heartbreak of her first marriage, the macabre deaths of her two little children, the hostile front-page newspaper stories and the shocking charges against her. She changed her name, dyed her red hair sable brown, and left California for the wind-swept peace of Cape Cod. Now she was married again, had two more beautiful children, and the terrible pain had begun to heal ... until the morning when she looked in the back yard for her little boy and girl, found only one red mitten, and knew that the nightmare was beginning again.",
