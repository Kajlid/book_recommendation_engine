  "description": "It’s 1633 and Annakiya is on the run, trying to save her life. Annakiya was sold into slavery at 9 when she was taken from her father in Tunisia. To her, it seemedlike life wasn't worth living -- until she found refuge in the home of a sympathetic owner. She also found something she thought was completely out of her reach -- love. So why was she now trying to get away? Fans of Karen Valiquette’s new series detailing past lives were spell-bound by her first book, “Soul Journaling - Lessons from the Past” based in 1500s France. This sequel carries on with her next incarnation in Turkey during the 1600s.",
