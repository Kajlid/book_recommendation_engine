  "description": "Paul van den Berg is an accomplished sixty-year-old man. He grew up in a strict reformed family and has been struggling with his homosexuality ever since he can remember. By being hard on himself, never allowing any emotions and always maintaining a firm order throughout his life, true happiness has eluded him thus far. One day, he receives a phone call from Greece. A old friend has passed away and has named Paul as one of the beneficiaries in his will. Chaos strikes in his usually carefully structured life. Confused and anxious, he decides to travel to Greece. Once he arrives, Paul is subjected to an omnium gatherum of emotions, sadness and regret.The author: \"The story about this quest by Paul van den Berg sprouted after my friend Dimitris died of a heart attack. In the years that I've known him, he often told me about this friend that he had in the Netherlands. The last time I spoke Dimitris he said he planned to visit him again, after forty years. Unfortunately he never got the chance to do this. A few months later Dimitris died.I forgot the name of his Dutch friend and because of this, could not search for him. Gradually the idea for this story was created. It is actually not a novel but more of a narrative or a trip report in a metaphorical sense. I deliberately chose to tell the story through the eyes of Dimitris' friend. This way, the death of Dimitris feels not without significance. The comparison with Homer's Odyssey is therefore logical.\"",
