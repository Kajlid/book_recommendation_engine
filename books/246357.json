  "description": "Winter is coming to Tennessee and there's no money to buy a new coat, so a little girl's mama sews one for her out of rags. The little girl wears it to school proudly, and when the other children laugh, she gives them a quick lesson about what it means to be rich. Judith Sutton's beautiful paintings bring one of Dolly Parton's best-loved songs to life. \"The heartfelt verses are imbued with the same genuine, infectiously likeable spirit Parton herself projects.\" Publishers Weekly",
