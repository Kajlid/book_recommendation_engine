  "description": "When Luke McCabe began the restoration of the dusty, '58 Cadillac Sixty-Special Fleetwood in his mom's garage, he knew Betty McCabe was keeping a secret. Over the years, she'd sold it off piece-by-piece for almost nothing, and it took him eight years to put it back together with nothing but factory original parts. When it was complete, it looked like it just rolled off the showroom floor. Luke never expected his first journey would hurl him into a time-bending nightmare that he could not explain, into an era long before he was born. In Las Vegas, Nevada, in 1958, Luke McCabe becomes a sadistic serial killer called The Cowboy. Luke must now battle the demon he has become if he is ever to make it back home. \" ... Think Patterson, Iris Johansen, Jeffrey Deaver even- Shelman is just as good in my non-professional, yet well read opinion.\" ~ Avid Amazon Reader",
