  "description": "The WBL. The Women’s Baseball League, but the W also stands for War...MVP Jill “Mac” MacDonnell has Olympic glory behind her and the first-place Delaware Blue Diamonds are rightly proud of their iconic outfielder. Insult Mac and you insult fiercely protective colleagues, fans and friends. Young first baseman Smokey O’Neill, the bad girl of the Boston Colonials, has just insulted Mac. The day her quote hits the sports news she’s traded to Delaware and must walk into the rival’s den—and all-out war. Not just with players, not just with the press, not just with Mac herself. As with any war, there are bystanders with agendas. Not everyone is rooting for the Blue Diamonds and Mac to win the title one more time. Strife and camaraderie, life on the road and off-the-field politics, Celia Cohen’s compelling, romantic story of strong women, baseball and love returns to print with all the players and plays.",
