  "description": "Jane Napierski is back at work at the job she loves—being a personal assistant to her friend Sienna Blake, a rising star actress. The duo is on location in Virginia Beach to film Sienna's new TV series, along with costar Reed Forrester—the man with whom the world thinks Sienna is in love. Wrong.Sienna's heart actually belongs to her fiancé, Craig, a Navy SEAL with the Saint Squad. Craig must fly under the radar if he is to keep Sienna safe from his world of terrorists and toxic bombs. And Reed has no problem pretending to date his old friend Sienna simply because it means he can spend time learning more about Jane. Making a TV series is grueling work but not nearly as difficult as the treacherous adventure that is about to begin with a simple photo taken in the wrong place at the wrong time—an image worth killing for.When Craig returns to the United States to spend time with Sienna, he's not expecting to spend that time protecting her and Jane. Frightening incidents targeting the two women rapidly escalate, and as Craig and his Saint Squad investigate a tangled conspiracy, they find themselves tracking, here at home, the terrorists they have searched for across the globe. But can they shut the terrorists down in time to save Jane, Reed, and Sienna?",
