  "description": "What if you could push rewind to relive any memory from your past as vividly and accurately as the day it happened? What times of your life would you choose to revisit?  Retired judge Anne Weller Barnes longs for the close family she sees in her mind’s eye and in the decades-old family movies. But in Anne’s actual family, the shocking circunstances surrounding a long-ago tragedy have created misunderstanding and disengagement.  When her estranged brother dies and leaves her an invention called the Memory Enhancer that allows people to program their dreams to recover old memories as clearly as the day they were made, Anne dives into her past, hoping to find a way to help her family be close again. Instead, family members dispute her newly recovered memories, which leads her to share the device with them, resulting in discoveries and realizations that change their lives forever.  Bittersweet Memories is a moving story that explores yearning for the past, the unreliability of memory, and the powerful impact of family secrets.",
