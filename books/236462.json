  "title": "The Manasseh Project",
  "description": "In a single, terrifying instant, every living person on Earth vanishes. The planet is left utterly devoid of human life. Then slowly, people begin to reappear; thrust back into a world that has lain derelict for centuries. Driven by the hope of somehow reaching his family in Scotland, airline pilot Dale Malloch joins with other destitute survivors. Together, they begin the perilous journey across the treacherous mountains and expansive plains of North America, towards the vast Atlantic Ocean, hopeful of finding some way to cross it, But what is the unearthly, deformed creature that stalks through the woods of Chicago? Who is the strange woodsman with an eerie tale to tell? Who are the murderous savages that slaughter bewildered survivors in the midst of the crumbling jungle-ruins of New York City? While Dale and his companions face deadly encounters with violent men, ever striving to reach the ocean before the winter snows arrive, Bella Malloch and her two young children struggle for survival on the freezing, forlorn moors of the Scottish highlands. Each step Dale takes brings him closer to his family…and to a discovery so devastating, that its sheer immensity has driven those who know the truth to the very edge of bloodthirsty barbarity…and beyond.",
