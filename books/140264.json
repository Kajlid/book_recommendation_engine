With a towering presence and a fearsome reputation, Blackbeard captured between 20 to 40 ships during his short but impactful career. As Otto delves deeper into Blackbeard's life, he discovers that this tale doesn't merely belong to the past; it has deep roots in the present.And here begins the tale of \"The Cove.\" You might be wondering, what exactly is a cove? For starters, these mysterious places have hidden entrances, often tucked away behind towering cliffs. They served as secret fortresses were pirates could anchor their ships, stash their plunder, and vanish from the authorities' reach. These coves are small, sheltered bays or coastal inlets, scattered along rugged coastlines, offering natural harbors that provided both safety and seclusion to those who understood their hidden paths.
