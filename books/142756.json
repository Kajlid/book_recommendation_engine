  "description": "A late night phone call was never supposed to cause so much torment. Ripper will do anything for Chaos Bleeds, including cleaning up the Princess’s mess. When Judi calls him, he answers without thinking, and soon he has a dead body to hide and a car to destroy. He will do everything in his power to protect the young woman. What he doesn’t expect is the lust that hits him from being around her. After being used by a pimp, Judi never expected to sexually want a man. Devil and his crew saved her from hell, but Ripper is throwing her headfirst into heaven. Ripper’s touch makes her crave everything she’d given up on. However, Devil has adopted Judi as his daughter. No one touches or hurts the Princess of the club. What will Devil do when he learns that one of his most trusted men has claimed Judi for his own?",
