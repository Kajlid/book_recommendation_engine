  "description": "Corey Maduro used to love baseball. Now he's not so sure. He's in a monster slump at the plate, and the Coach's advice is only making things worse. Then there's Katelyn Moss, who thinks she deserves Corey's center field job and seems determined to out-do him in every way. But Corey's biggest problem is his dad, who turns into a howling, wild-eyed maniac at his son's games. With the team headed to the big Grand Slam Tournament at the shore, this should be an exciting time for Corey. But every time he thinks of a week of 0-for-4 games, Katelyn making him look dumb, and his dad arguing with the Coach, Corey wonders if it isn't time to take up chess.",
