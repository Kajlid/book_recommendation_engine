  "description": "Speculative/Science Fiction - Lab FictionJames Weems hears the chit-chat of microbes. Viruses, fungi, and bacteria buzz like a billion bees in his head. He would dearly love to return the gift. But then he learns that within these microbes lie the secrets of every living thing, the great tapestry of evolution, and the rules governing all life. Knowledge is power, and James may become the greatest force ever in medicine: a visionary who could end disease's reign over mankind. However, others also possess this gift, and they guard it jealously. To tamper with its works is to incur their wrath. And tampering is precisely what James intends to do.",
