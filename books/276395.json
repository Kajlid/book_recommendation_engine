  "description": "JakeThey say People change over time. That might be true, but I've had people look down at me not once, but twice. Both times, I dusted off my shoulders and carried on. When my fianc√©e broke things off with me, it wasn't her voice that I heard. Instead, it was Juliet Dunnett in my head, her snobby tone telling me why I wasn't good enough. Now she's back in town. No husband, no ring, looking sad and lonely as ever. I can't help but want to help her out. Can I get close to her without falling for her again?   Juliet Coming back to town when I swore people would watch the dust settle after I left wasn't as humiliating as I thought it would be. Looking for Jake Carson was another story. We were never friends and I was never his girlfriend, but we had something. Something that wasn't but still was. I didn't need a new relationship, but I was alone. All my bridges were burned and who would have thought he of all people would be my hero? Could I be near him without letting sins from our past catch up to us?",
