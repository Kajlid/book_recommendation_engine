  "description": "Book 1 of the Josephine Meyers Mystery series Best friends keep secrets, or at least they try to. As teenagers growing up in the mountains of Pennsylvania, the scariest thing Josephine and Skylar have to deal with is a rustle in the woods after dark. This summer, however, might show them the true meaning of fear. George dives head first into their lives, quickly making enemies with everyone he meets. His hands are soon covered in more than just engine grease, and the fear in Sky's eyes, coupled with her terrifying stories, has Jo at the end of her agreement to keep quiet. At the height of the July heat wave, Sky’s stories reach a turning point. Unable to hold it in any longer, Jo sets out with a foot-long blade in her hand to make sure George never lays a finger on any of them again. But, perhaps George isn’t quite ready to leave.",
