Angus has just brought down the government with a deciding vote. Now the crusty Scot wants Daniel to manage his next campaign.Soon Daniel is helping Angus fight an uphill battle against \"Flamethrower\" Fox, a Conservative notorious for his dirty tactics. Together they decide to take \"The High Road\" and—against all odds—turn the race into a nail-biter with hilarious ups and downs, cookie-throwing seniors, and even a Watergate-style break-in. But that's only the beginning. Add a political storm in the capital and a side-splitting visit from the U.S. President and his alcoholic wife, and Terry Fallis's second novel is a wildly entertaining read full of deft political satire and laugh-out-loud comedy.",
