He bears the charisma of an easygoing boy-next-door mixed with a rule-breaker personality both in person and on screen.For a moment, I thought maybe my fairy godmother sent him to me.Until he decided to run against my mother for mayor.Everyone in our town knows my mom’s happiness comes before my own, so I take it as my personal mission to show him who really runs this town. I just didn’t realize that being my mom’s right-hand woman would put me in such close proximity to him. Very quickly, I question whether he wants to win the mayoral race or me.",
