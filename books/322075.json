  "description": "The Rampaging Fuckers of Everything on the Crazy Shitting Planet of the Vomit Atmosphere is a collection of three short novels by a master of satire. Mykle Hansen's subversive tales capture the smugness of mainstream culture. He thrusts his characters into absurd and humorous situations that reveal the defects in the modern social fabric. With the wit of Christopher Moore, the inventiveness of Terry Gilliam and the rudeness of South Park, Hansen's surreal fiction is ridiculously fun to read. Three Bizarro MONSTER A poignant tragedy of penis enlargement gone horribly wrong. JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF AGNES A gripping history of the first Starbucks in the anus of an 80-year-old prostitute. CRAZY SHITTING A touching parable of love, friendship, and feces.",
