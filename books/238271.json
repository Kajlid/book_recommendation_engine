  "title": "The Mentor",
  "description": "Everyone knows NOT to discuss how to raise children. The Men of the North have been living in exile for centuries, raising their boys without the influence of women. Now an experiment will bring girls and boys together in a new school with children and teachers from each side of the border. But how can two teachers work together when they don’t agree on anything?  Sparks fly in this clash of cultures when Archer Rex objects to Kya Rae’s meditation “shit” that will surely turn his Nboys into wusses. He wants the kids to learn how to hunt and fight instead.  The Mentor is the third installment in Elin Peer’s series The Men of the North. Readers call it witty, intelligent, relevant, and masterfully written.  Get this fascinating and entertaining romantic comedy set in the future, today!",
