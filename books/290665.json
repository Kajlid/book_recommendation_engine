  "title": "Mack's Perfectly Ghastly Homecoming",
  "description": "Mack’s over the moon to not only have Brandon but to finally be done with all their training. With the official FBI stamp of approval, they are ready to start ghost busting.  The very last place he wants to be sent to is his hometown of Opelousas, Louisiana, however. But a child is being terrorized, and when he discovers it’s his favorite cousin, all reluctance is forgotten.  His cousin’s ghost problem is not their only case, though. The nearby university also has a malevolent ghost that is seriously escalating. Students are being scratched, pushed down the stairs, and generally terrified. Even with Brandon’s unwavering support, this might be a bit much for just two people to handle. And when the ghost proves it can break all the windows in a three-story building? Mack knows they definitely won’t be able to do it alone.  It’s shaping up to be a perfectly ghastly homecoming.",
