  "description": "Bushwhacked by the corrupt lawman Walker Dodge, Dalton loses his money, his horse, his gun and very nearly his life. Recuperating in the dead-end town of Harmony, he hears rumors of a fabulous treasure hidden nearby and, even with Walker closing in on him, that’s enticing enough to risk staying. And then there’s Misty Valdez, the one person who claims to know where the treasure is, and she entices him even more! But the price of her help may be too high for Dalton. With time running out, can he avoid Misty’s trap and find the treasure before the gun-toting Walker catches up with him?",
