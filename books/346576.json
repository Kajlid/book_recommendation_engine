  "description": "\"No room at the inn\" means someone wants Nancy to check out -- permanently! There's nothing like riding a horse across the beautiful English countryside, and Nancy has been looking forward to this vacation. But the danger begins even before she arrives at stately Moorsea Manor. Someone steals a road sign, sending Nancy down a dark, twisting road to nowhere. When she finally finds the inn, she's almost killed by a bronze statue dropped from a second-story window! The owners tell her that there have been other \"pranks\" as well. But someone's going to get hurt -- and that means Moorsea Manor will be out of business. Now it's up to Nancy to find the culprit, before the guest list becomes a casualty list!Cover art by Ernie Norcia.",
