  "description": "LUCIAN  I am a Dragon Prince of the House of Smoke… and I am dying.  Five hundred years is truly enough for a man like me. A monster. Yet a ten-thousand-year treaty will die with me, if I don’t spawn a dragonling to take my place. My two brothers are no use in this task. It falls to me, the eldest by a hair’s breadth, and yet, I cannot face the horror of another sealing. Another death. Another woman’s blood on my hands.   ARABELLA  I was saved from death in a dark Seattle alley by an impossibly beautiful man who swooped in on golden wings. Now he’s taken me to his lair, opened my eyes to a world of immortals I didn’t know existed, and given me an impossible task—find him a mate. Then, and only then, will he set me free.   He needs her more than he wants; she wants him more than she should; and the fate of both the mortal and immortal worlds depends on not just repairing their hearts, but finding a Love that’s True…   The FALLEN IMMORTALS series is a modern Beauty and the Beast story with flaming HOT dragon shifters, vengeful Dark Fae, and beguiling fallen angels.THE FALLEN IMMORTALS SERIESLucian and ArabellaKiss of a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 1)Heart of a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 2)Fire of a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 3)Leonidas and RosalynChosen by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 4)Seduced by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 5)Touched by a Dragon (Fallen Immortals 6)Leksander and ErelahLoved by a Dragon  (Fallen Immortals 7) Marked by a Dragon  (Fallen Immortals 8) Claimed by a Dragon  (Fallen Immortals 9)Of Bards and Witches: Leonidas's Story (Fallen Immortals 10)",
