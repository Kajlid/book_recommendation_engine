  "description": "Lt. Samantha Quimby, USMC is a beautiful, brilliant and very unique young woman. Not only does she have the privilege of being the youngest known Special Ops officer in the Corps, but an unfortunate accident during a dive in the Marinas Trench leaves her permanently amphibious! Her new found ocean freedom, combined with her unique ability with ocean mammals and an overtly defiant and somewhat reckless nature, wreaks havoc on her very loving, but very strict family. Her father and uncle, both USMC Generals, and her older brother, Michael, are in constant pursuit of trying to keep her safe from herself and her own curiosity and often thoughtless actions. In desperation, the three resort to old-fashioned military discipline- bare bottom spankings.The 18 year old is appalled, but it does not take long for her to discover that love can be expressed in a firm and consistent manner upon her little bottom. She meets Rich, a handsome and very dominant engineering officer, who quickly becomes part of the family's routine. For Sam, he's the perfect combination of her beloved Generals, and he steers her towards life as a submissive. Not only does he find himself frequently spanking his wayward girlfriend, but he gradually introduces her to the not-so-secret world of true D/S.Love, laughter, duty and obedience frames Sam's life and, despite a constant sore backside, she couldn't be happier.",
