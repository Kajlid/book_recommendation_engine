  "description": "Lisa leaves her law career to become a navy wife and Supermom, but somewhere between “I do” and “deploying again,” waves of chaos threaten to overtake her. She has everything she ever wanted—a husband who knows his chardonnay but can’t identify a Phillips-head screwdriver, three quirky kids, each with a separate agenda, a perpetually shedding dog, and a minivan full of cold french fries. In other words, everything she ever wanted, and possibly more than she can handle. Overwhelmed, Lisa hyperventilates when the DVR reaches 98 percent. Her eye twitches at every ping of her smartphone. She is riddled with anxiety over picking the right sugar substitute. Will she survive the endless minutia of modern family life, or will she end up on the laundry room floor eating chocolate frosting out of a can?",
