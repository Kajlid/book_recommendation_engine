  "description": "Alone at Christmas, Greg Bennett feels his life has been a waste. Sixty years old and he has no one to spend the holiday with -- and no one who cares. Greg knows he's made mistakes, hurt people, failed in all the ways that matter. As a young man, he fathered a child he never acknowledged. He deserted a friend in his hour of need. He abandoned his own brother, who he hasn't seen in years. And he and his wife are in the midst of an acrimonious divorce. Listlessly wandering through the streets of San Francisco, Greg finds himself in a church -- and he whispers a simple, heartfelt prayer. His prayer finds its way to the Archangel Gabriel, who assigns his favorite angels -- Shirley, Goodness, and Mercy -- to Greg Bennett's case. Gabriel knows that very soon, Greg will need all three.",
