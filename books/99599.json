  "description": "Kelsie Leverich, New York Times bestselling author of The Valentine’s Arrangement, continues her series with a new novel of a life plan that goes awry—in the arms of a soldier…Meagan Mitchell is the girl-next-door—and then some. She can throw ’em back with the guys and have a spa day with the girls. She’s sweet, smart, beautiful, single—and almost thirty. After dating too many Mr. Wrongs and Mr. Not Availables, it’s time to rethink her five-year plan…Captain Reed Porter lives for the thrill—he’s an Airborne Jumpmaster with a rush addiction. Slowing down and settling down are not in his agenda, making him exactly the kind of man Meagan is trying to avoid…Even as she finds the intense attraction between them impossible to deny, Meagan isn’t willing to risk her heart, or her future, on a reckless charmer. Not unless Reed can learn that the feeling of a safe landing is just as addicting as the rush of the fall…",
