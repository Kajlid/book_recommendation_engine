  "description": "Joined by Trimp the Hedgehog, Dinny Foremole, and Gonff—the ever-mischievous Prince of Mousethieves—Martin embarks on a perilous journey to the northland shore, where Luke, his father, abandoned him as a child. There, within the carcass of a great red ship, he finally uncovers what he has been searching for: the story of the evil pirate stoat, Vilu Deskar, and the valiant warrior who pursued him relentlessly over the high seas, seeking to destroy Vilu at all costs, even if it meant deserting his only son. The legend of Luke and his son, Martin, is a glorious tale from Redwall's history.",
