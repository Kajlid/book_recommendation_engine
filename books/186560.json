  "description": "Ex-assassin Easton Caird has made some major sacrifices in the name of love. The wild sexual chemistry and tender moments with his lover, lycan king Grisha Vasiliev, make it worth it. Not that reclaiming his pack from his gangster father hasn’t cost Grisha almost everything himself.  They’ve both always lived on a razor’s edge. But Easton’s never had so much to lose before, or more dangerous enemies.  The Hellfire Vampires are his lycan king’s fiercest allies. Then again, the Hellfire may decide they want Easton dead. Gold, also known as vampire blood, is the hottest, near-mythic drug going, and it’s being drained from kidnapped vamps. Easton may just be implicated in those kidnappings.  Under siege himself, his lover will fight to protect him, for with a soul traded and his powers gone, Easton has few weapons of his own but for his wits.  His wits, and a very, very rare gift that he must no longer deny.  Grisha will kill to defend him. But will Grisha need to be defended against Easton?  * Forget Him Not is the third Hellfire Vampires book, and is best read after His Sweet Prince (the second). Both books can be read separately from His, the first Hellfire Vampires story.  Approx. 59,000 words.  The Hellfire Vampires Bloodline: His (Book 1) His Sweet Prince (Book 2) Forget Him Not (Book 3)",
