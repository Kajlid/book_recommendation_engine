  "description": "Drama!! Brittney's mean enough, but when Vane moves in town, things get ugly at school, especially when Cassidy moves over to the mean group. Soon enough prank-calling, name-calling, insulting, and pranks are not uncommon. Those aren't the only things going on for Zoe and Rach. Zoe has her Ballet performance coming up, but does she truly want to perform? Rach is ready for her huge art contest, but will she win? Things are looking bad, and people start wondering whether there is such a thing as a happy ending. Will fifth grade end well for these frenemies?",
