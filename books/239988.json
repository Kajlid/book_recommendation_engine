  "description": "An ancient race of sentient predators lives amongst us. Their numbers are few and they hide themselves well - like all predators, they are expert at the art of concealing themselves from their prey. They can pass as human, and blend seamlessly in to human society, whether it be in the guise of cunning corporate lawyers like Eric Carver, or gangland psychopaths like alpha male Owen Tanzer. They are not werewolves - but they are the reality that lies behind the legend of werewolves. When bar-owner Jack Dwyer's best friend Artie is brutally murdered, his restless spirit leads Jack to uncover the truth. Jack burns to avenge Artie's death - but who will believe his story of who or what the murderers really are? Jack is on his own - except for his girlfriend Molly, his sister Courtney and their head barman, Bill, who hides a potentially shocking secret under the skin. The four of them must destroy the pack that threatens to take over Boston, before they themselves are hunted down as prey.",
