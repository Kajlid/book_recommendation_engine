You will hear, but you will not be able to communicate. You will endure across the ages, a silent witness to the decades that go by.”François Damont’s only crime was loving the son of a witch in a time where it wasn’t permitted.

Frankie might be hiding something, but the connection between them is too strong to ignore. Can he unlock the mystery before it’s too late?Strange dreams. Dark forces. People who may not be what they seem. Time is not the only thing against them. And perhaps Daniel knows more than he thinks he does.A sweet 82k MM paranormal romance featuring magic, witches, and a relationship that might just be able to endure anything.",
