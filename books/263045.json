  "description": "Ian Prescott's destiny lies hidden in a past he can't remember and a future he can only imagine, as he traverses the galaxy to destroy the mage who assassinated his parents. Ten years have passed since Ian survived the first devastating attempt on his life. Now, Lord Turok has returned to finish the job he started. After killing the hellhound sent to eviscerate him, Ian journeys to another world where Celtic legends spring to life to save his imprisoned aunt and banish Lord Turok to the underworld for all eternity. Only the flaming sword, Brander, has the power and the magic to return Lord Turok to the underworld, but all magic comes with a price. Will Ian risk losing his soul to save his aunt's life, stop a bloody civil war, and avenge his parents' murder? How much is a single life worth?",
