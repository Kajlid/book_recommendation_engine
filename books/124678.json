  "title": "Cat on the Hill",
  "description": "Autumn is a lonely and cold time for a stray cat in Cornwall after the hum of the summer, and winter is worse still. Most of all though, it is a hungry time. Even for an ex-ship's cat, life is a struggle, with fierce harbor cats and a yappy dog, all of whom chase him out of the village, away from its pavements of tempting dropped chips and tasty mackerel. The chapel on the hill becomes a safe haven for a while. But then, in the depths of winter, the yappy dog and his friends, the harbor boy, the donkey, and the horse come up the hillâ€”bearing sausage! One would almost think it was Christmas. This new and magical incarnation of Cornwall in winter features a guest return of the successful Sinbad, the lifesaving dog.",
