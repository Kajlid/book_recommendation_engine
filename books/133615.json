There's warm milk and honey to be had, designer pajamas from Diane von Firstinbed, and no one dares be seen without a baby blanket. But before she knows it, the nuzzling, snuggling, and dreaming are over—and Snuggleford has slept through it all.This hilariously endearing bedtime story is perfect for anyone who loves sloths, music festivals, and/or cuddles.",
