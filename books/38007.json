  "description": "A fallen angel with a mission and a medical examiner who's lost her faith are fighting for their souls in a glittering, near-future Manhattan... Blind faith is for fools. That's what Dr. Morgan Sterling believes. And she's going to prove it by curing the zombie plague ravaging her city's slums. She's certain it's not a sign of the End of Days, but a nasty disease--until an angel appears in her morgue in a flash of glory. Luniel is not just a fallen angel. He's a powerful warrior sworn to fight evil in hopes of a chance at redemption. He's after the demon princes who are stealing the seven vials of holy wrath which, when perverted, will unleash eternal hell on earth. To stop the plague, Luniel needs Morgan's help, \"and\" her faith. But Morgan believes science is their salvation. If the zombie plague is a demonic curse--and if Luniel is true--he'll have to prove it. Even if he loses his heart to true love or his soul to Hell...",
