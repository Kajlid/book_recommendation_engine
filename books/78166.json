  "description": "\"Sudden Prey\" opens with a death and ends with one.For months, Lucas Davenport's men have been tracking a vicious woman bank robber named Candy, and when they finally catch up with her, she doesn't go quietly. In the ensuing shoot-out, she dies â€“ and Davenport's nightmare starts. For her associates are even worse than she was, particularly her husband, a deeply violent man who swears an appropriate revenge. First he will find the names of those responsible and then he will kill those nearest and dearest to them, just the way they did Candy.So it begins. The husband of one officer is shot and killed. The wife of another is ambushed at work. When a third attack is thwarted, the pattern becomes clear to Davenport. With an urgency born of rage and terror, he presses the hunt, desperately trying to track down the killers before they can strike again, before they can reach out for Davenport's own loved ones. But in this effort, he may already be too late.Did we mention? He thinks there's someone inside the department working for the other side. It's a tough one.",
