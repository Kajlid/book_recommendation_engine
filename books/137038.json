She wished that the man of her dreams would come and sweep her away, far away from the home where she’d always felt ignored and unwanted. Now, she’s grown up, and she’s learned better. You can’t count on anybody to make your future better. You can only build it yourself.And you especially can’t count on Cole Jackman.It’s been nearly a decade since their tumultuous high school romance, but Heather can’t quite shake the memories. And when Cole stumbles back into her life, she learns that she still can’t control herself around him.

Something…furry.As Heather uncovers the truth, she finds herself caught in a centuries-old conflict that puts her on center stage. Her dual destinies - one as Cole’s mate, and one as his sworn adversary, have made her enemies on all sides. And to make matters worse, she just can’t seem to keep her hands off of him. Can she find a way to tame his wolfish nature, and bring peace to the Douglas Mountain clan before it’s too late?",
