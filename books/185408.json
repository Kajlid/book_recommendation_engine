  "title": "JOHN!: Episode One - AD 27",
  "description": "This is the story of “the disciple that Jesus loved” (John 13:23). He is believed to be the same person as John the Apostle, son of Zebedee; John the Evangelist, author of the Gospel and three Letters of John; John of Patmos, who wrote the Revelation of John; and John the Elder, the revered leader of the Church of Ephesus in the closing years of the first century AD.  This is historical fiction. It is historical, for it strives to be true to all that is known about the characters, their locations, and their actions from the Bible, from archaeology, and from other historical sources. It is fiction, for it fills in this record with a tale told by the author, informed by the author’s estimate of what may have actually happened.  Endnotes refer to Bible verses which contain the nonfiction, the stuff that really did happen. Enjoy the story, and remember that it is only part nonfiction, and the rest is in the realm of possibility.  Rolin Bruno  \nLate Winter, AD 2015",
