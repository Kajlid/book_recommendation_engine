  "description": "\"Do you want me to be dangerous?\" he asked, his voice husky and low.I gulped, and for a moment I was incapable of speech. But he was quiet, waiting. \"No. I don't.\"\"Then I'm not dangerous at all,\" he murmured. His gaze moved from my eyes to my mouth. \"You've never been safer than you are at this moment.\" I shivered as his breath tickled my skin. Our lips were mere millimeters apart when the sky shattered in a kaleidoscope of colored light. We didn’t know how much we had to lose until we were infected with magic. Sam was in love, Juliette was the main caretaker for her siblings, and Ana and her dad planned the best parties in New York. But we lost it all when we were shipped to Chebeague, an exclusive school for newly infected mages.Everyone knows about the mages, those who survive the infection and end up with magical abilities. We’ve seen the power of magic, the high-paying jobs, and the world fame. But we never saw the cost. We didn’t know we’d be forced to give up everything: sanity, family, even the right to talk on the phone.We didn’t know mage was just another word for prisoner.",
