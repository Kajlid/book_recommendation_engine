  "description": "A tale of intrigue, suspense, sectarian violence and one Muslim boy’s struggle for a better life…When, during the 2007 Lebanon conflict, a stray terrorists’ rocket killed his mother, twelve-year-old Jabir Sarkis vowed he’d join the army and fight terrorism.But fate had other ideas. Later, while attending university, events occur in Australia that will shape the rest of his life: the murder of an Israeli dignitary, the prime minister’s assassination, a $M20 bounty and the lure of a permanent visa.When Jabir identifies the assassin, his reward is a new life in Australia. But Australia is only half a world away, well within the reach of Hezbollah’s tentacles. Barely settled in Sydney, Jabir’s girlfriend, Rihana is kidnapped in Beirut. And that is just the start as his new life, the one he’d always longed for, spirals out of control.As Hezbollah torments him vicariously through Rihana and closes in, in Sydney, the hunt is on. The new Australian PM has his back, and so does an agent of Israel’s Mossad, but will the assassin get there first?Bounty takes you on a gripping ride from a poverty-blighted, terrorist-infected corner of Lebanon, to the streets of Beirut, to Tehran, to Mossad headquarters in Tel Aviv, to the halls of power in Canberra, and finally to its thrilling climax in Sydney.",
