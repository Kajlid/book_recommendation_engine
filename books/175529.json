  "description": "It’s all about the #Selfie.She was the one girl I never wanted.Until I had her.One night.One mistake.Something we both wanted to forget.I got rid of the proof. The one piece of evidence that could remind us both.At least, I thought I did.When it shows up on the school Buzzfeed, rumors fly. Friendships are tested and the feels get real.I don’t do relationships. I don’t open my heart.Especially for a girl everyone knows I hate.What happens during spring break, stays in spring break.Until it follows you home.",
