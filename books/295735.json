  "description": "Some secrets don’t die with the heroes.  So, Raptor taught me how to fight, how to do the right thing, how to be a hero... and then he had to go and get himself killed. He never told me his real name. I never even saw his face.  Now, new enemies plan to reveal his secrets. If I can’t stop them, they will destroy me, my friends, and, let’s just say it, the entire city.  Raptor may be gone, but he isn’t done ordering me around.  Cuz he just sent me a text.  If you enjoy Batman, Spider-Man, and The Teen Titans, you will love Raven’s thrilling adventures in Heroes, the second book of Superpower Chronicles. Get your copy today!",
