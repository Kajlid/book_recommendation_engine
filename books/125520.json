  "description": "Xanthus Terrinass is a gorgeous, powerful mage with a bright future. As the heir to the Terrinass family, who possess the rare magic to transfer between worlds, he's looking forward to the freedom his abilities will bring him. But power has its price, every mage is expected to marry and produce gifted offspring. Xanthus has managed to hide being gay, and has almost convinced himself to fulfill his obligations, when he meets Brice. Brice has spent his whole life waiting for the man of his dreams, literally. His magic has shown him glimpses of a beautiful, soul connecting love destined to end tragically. If he can trust his visions, being with Xanthus may lead to his death, which is reason enough to keep his distance. When Brice discovers his parents have sold his ungifted sisters into slavery on another world, Xanthus is the only man who can help save them. Every moment they spend together they fall more deeply, and more dangerously, in love. As they cross the worlds to rescue his sisters, Brice seeks not only their rescue but a way to change his own destiny with Xanthus.",
