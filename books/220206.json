  "description": "Sin A middle child born into Devil’s Fury MC. Sin never felt that he fit into the club. He didn’t see his life as anything other than the son of the president. Wanting a life away from the MC, Sin joined the military after high school, becoming nothing more than a grunt in the Marines. Military life was hard, and war was something he didn’t expect. People called him a hero for defending his country, but he felt more like a coward. A hero wouldn’t have shrapnel scars on their back, proving they were running away from the fight instead of facing it.  Savannah She was raised by her working class family in the midst of oil country, Texas. Catching the eye of an older man, the son of oil royalty, she thought she found love. But she was wrong. He wanted her on his arm, to make him look good, just as a woman should. Savannah wanted to be heard, her opinion to matter. She wanted to be valued. The first strike of his hand across her face should have been evidence enough that her life wasn’t turning out as she had hoped. Getting smacked around became the norm. Fearing him became her life. Sin & Savannah Two people broken. Two people living a life they didn’t want. Two people thrown together To keep each other safe;  One from their past, and one from their own misery. Can he rectify a past tragedy? Can she be his salvation?",
