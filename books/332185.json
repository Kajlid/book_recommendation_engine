  "description": "How do you mark a quarter century? While parties are great, and we’ll have those, I wanted to distill the time in a tangible way. To hold it in my hands, and share with you, dear readers, in celebration and appreciation. But how? A collection! I dove into my published short fiction. Some I included because they were challenging to write. Several show my growth as a writer. I love them all. There’s science fiction, fantasy, and, yes, horror. Plus an all-new story from Night's Edge. If you know me only from my novels, welcome to the darker, deeper corners of my imagination. Here Be Wonders! Aliens among us, or who are us. The perils of birthday cake and a vacation like no other. Epic fantasy and a wizard left to die on a beach. A robotic prothesis with a mind of its own and a case of murder most foul. Twelve stories of wonder, suspense, terror, and awe.Contents: * A Grateful Introduction • essay by Julie E. Czerneda; Cover: Imaginings by Roger Czerneda * First Contact Inc.
