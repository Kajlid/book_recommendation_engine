  "description": "From the writer of 'Basically Frightened' comes another twist on a familiar genre.  Japanese ex-pat Naoka sees her new life in England changed forever after being saved by an irresistible force called Henrietta, a middle-aged woman determined to make the most of every moment of her life since the disappearance of her husband many years before. United by friendship and insomnia, Naoka and Henrietta are thrust into a world of shady characters, grim night cafes, local gangsters and the most high profile kidnapping case the city has ever seen. Armed with intelligence, wit, stubbornness and a smattering of Aikido, these two women from very different worlds combine â€“ 'The Insomniacs Club' is open for business.",
