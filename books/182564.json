  "description": "The Priest Whisperer is an inspirational novelette series describing the life of George Mykal Ferluci, who lives his life quietly in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. But this is about to change. One sunny afternoon George experiences an awe-inspiring vision of another dimension, causing him to doubt his common perception and world view. As he prays with all his heart to understand what happened, he enters into a visionary meditation, sliding deeper and deeper into the realms of his thoughts and feelings. There, he encounters something even more bizarre than his first vision: a voice that entangles him into an odd conversation. And so begins a life-changing, spiritual journey as the voice escorts George to meet his true self face-to-face and teaches him the secret riches of Christianity. Often witty and with inspiring anecdotes, the voice slowly dilutes George’s common sense and opens his mind to receive Jesus Christ’s long lost, esoteric memorandum: the mystery of God Child and people’s inevitable joyful destiny. As the voice elaborates the ancient, miraculous truth of mankind deeply buried in the Bible, a premonition of a modern, contemporary Christianity manifests and how it could advance beyond mere religion, allowing spiritual awakening and personal growth. It’s a bit hard to put a label at the Priest Whisperer, since it conveys ancient mysteries in a contemporary setting. In order to do so, it’s style embraced various genres, like religious & inspirational fiction, visionary fiction, new age Spirituality, and magical realism novels. We hope it’s an inspirational reading for everybody.The Priest Whisperer received a four star rating at SPR: http://www.selfpublishingreview.com/2...",
