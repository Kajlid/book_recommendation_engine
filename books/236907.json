  "description": "“Kocot has found a language for her emotions that pulls an abundance of memories, post-punk urban metaphors and manic verbal twists into her simultaneously cerebral and energizing universe…”— Publishers Weekly A tragic narrative journey through a New York wasteland and a warning to a city and a world in danger, Noelle Kocot’s third book has the prophetic immediacy of Ginsberg’s “Howl” and the urgent clarity of Langston Hughes. As a poet who has achieved success in the realms of both grassroots popularity and national critical attention, Kocot is poised to claim her place as America’s boldest new poetic voice.",
