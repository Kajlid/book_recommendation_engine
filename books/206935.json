Management consultant Dr. Marilyn Paul guides you on a path to personal change that will bring true relief from the pain and stress of disorganization. Unlike other books on getting organized, It's Hard to Make a Difference When You Can't Find Your Keys offers a clear seven-step path to personal development that is comprehensive in nature.  Drawing on her own experience as a chronically disorganized person, Paul adds warmth, insight, humor, and hope to this manual for change and self-discovery. She introduces the notion of becoming 'organized enough' to live a far more rewarding life and make the difference that is most important to you.",
