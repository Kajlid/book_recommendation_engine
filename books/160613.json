  "description": "A leather-bound smoking buddy is about to make Angie Salinas throw all caution to the wind...Angie Salinas' job as a public defender has her mixing with more unsavory characters than she would like, but none of them are as intriguing as Rich Parker A member of the Devil Dogs MC, Rich Parker is one of Angie's regulars. Leaning with easy confidence and eyes that could melt steel, Rich has caught Angie sneaking peeks at him since the first day he sat down in her waiting room. When Rich offers Angie a cigarette after a long day of work, he knows that Angie is eager for more than a cigarette. Good girls know nothing is safe in this world, and Angie usually makes the right choices. But after one smoldering look from Rich's sinful eyes, Angie is ready to make a very inappropriate but very tantalizing choice.",
