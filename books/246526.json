  "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of The Blueberry Lane series comes a new trio of romances featuring the Haven triplets!  Tierney Haven and Burr O’Leary come from completely different worlds… …but there’s a reason they say “opposites attract.”  Bookish Tierney Haven has always preferred places to people, and she especially loves the peace and quiet of Moonstone Manor, an estate museum located in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, where she is head docent, chief historian and live-in caretaker. The very last thing she expects to find on her doorstep in the middle of the night is bruised and bloodied stranger, Burr O’Leary, in desperate need of her help.  Against her better judgement and at the risk of her brothers’ wrath, Tierney offers Burr sanctuary at Moonstone Manor, and nurses him back to health, surprised to discover that the dashing, enigmatic stranger loves the history and peace of Moonstone as much as she. But Burr has a dark history, and those who hurt him will stop at nothing to eliminate him...placing Tierney in grave danger until he is well enough to find them first.",
