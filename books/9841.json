And I would do anything to make Pete happy, including sitting by while Georgia Tech’s Metaphysical Science Review Board strips him of his scholarship. But it doesn’t take the genius of a metaphysical scientist for me to figure out that something else is going on when Peter is handed his pink slip and kicked out of the program.Apparently, Peter has a secret. Sweet Peter, gentle Peter, the love of my life Peter, isn’t going to be Human anymore.And if that doesn’t take the cake, the Lesser-Bred who knows Peter’s secret and has put himself in charge of helping Pete become has decided that in order to keep people safe, to keep me safe, he needs to lock Peter away. Yeah, right. Over my mutilated, maggot-ridden body.",
