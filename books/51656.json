  "description": "When four big chickens see a wolf sneaking near their coop, they run into the woods to hide. But for a bunch of big chickens, running away from danger isn’t as easy as it looks. As they continue on their way, they wonder:What if they get stuck in a ditch? What if they hit an iceberg in the lake? What if they step into a cow patty? Ewww! Brimming with silliness and the kind of slapstick humor small children love, here’s a rollicking read-aloud with an uplifting message and a very satisfying ending. Henry Cole’s hilarious artwork captures all the sly humor.",
