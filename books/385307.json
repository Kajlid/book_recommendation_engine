While still on a murder mission hunt for the crooked lawyer that double-crossed her uncle, the latest addition to the family brings her one step closer to that sweet revenge. This ruthless queen-pin owns the day and the night. Mother Nature herself can t interrupt her cash flow. But when bad calls are made and her chief female escort goes missing, it s time to set things off. Sand and Rene can admit that they haven t always been honest with one another, but are they ready to forgive and forget? When they each find themselves being blackmailed into working for Chyna, it s no coincidence. They go against the grain to prove their love for one another, bearing in mind whose turf they re treading on. An unrelenting thirst for notorious revenge has Chyna, Sand, and Rene, riding out, hanging low, and staking out their highest claims yet.",
