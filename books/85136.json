  "title": "The Circlet Treasury of Lesbian Erotic Science fiction and fantasy",
  "description": "This out-standing collection of lesbian erotic science fiction and fantasy was originally published as two anthologies, WORLDS OF WOMEN and STARS INSIDE HER. In these pages women writers turn their vivid imaginations to faraway planets, erotic futures, and sensual fairy tales, to celebrate sexuality and explore what it means to be a woman who loves women. In these stories, women seek their pleasure through magic, from goddesses, in enchanted forests, and with fairy women. Taking desire out of our modern-day political context, and letting imagination run free, these writers create fantasies like no other. PRAISE FOR WORLDS OF WOMEN \"Circlet Press is where I go to find fresh, authentic women's writing.

Treat yourself!\" —EIDOS Magazine",
