  "title": "Beyond Pleasant End",
  "description": "1878 marks the apex of American Spiritualism, but the people of Pleasant End don’t like “all that hairy scary stuff.” Of course psychic Ava Godfrey is lonely, being told long ago to keep her little spirit visitors and messages to herself. When a visitor comes to town and befriends Ava, she begins to struggle with the most important decision of her 18 years: stay in Pleasant End and marry Marcus Fisch as everyone expects, or follow the messages and myriad signs pointing her in a new direction: East. Just when she thinks there is no way to follow her heart, Ava visits a fortune-telling gypsy and makes a shocking discovery, and her path suddenly becomes crystal clear. She faces telling her mother that she must do as the spirits and signs have asked. She must say yes, and go.",
