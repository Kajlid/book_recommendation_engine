  "title": "This Shrinking World",
  "description": "Book 1 of 9 book series.  300 years ago, in a nameless world, a prophecy passed unfulfilled. A secret society that formed to prevent its occurrence believed it was their doing, while the secret society created to ensure that the prophecy came to pass wasn't certain it had been stopped at all. Eventually, along with the mythology of time prior to the great Lizard Queen’s expansion of this world, the prophecy of Lacáruna fell into legend.  Split among three nations, nine ancient books hold the key to this world's creation but no one has the ability to read them. And many have come to believe the world is shrinking. The indications are there—nations' leaders falling ill, swamps drying, militaries gathering—that is, if those signs are being interpreted correctly. No one knows because the prophesied Lacáruna, a female from another realm and the only being who can read the Lizard Queen's language, never arrived.  What they don't realize is that Amy Darlidale is just a tad late.  Taking a break from a stressful workweek, Amy, recently divorced CEO, drives out to her desert getaway. While on a morning jog she crosses paths with an orange lizard and, on a whim, chases it into a field. Suddenly, she finds herself under a starless sky confronted by oddly marked and strangely colored people who claim she's there to rescue the world from evil’s grasp and expand it once again. But not everyone wants that to happen so there's a price on her head.  This is far from the relaxing weekend Amy had intended.",
