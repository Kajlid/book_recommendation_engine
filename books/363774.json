  "description": "What if your family couldn`t protect you? What if it was your family you needed protecting from? Forgiveness is far off for teenagers Blair and Ardith, best friends and accomplices in a terrible crime. At the home of the only adult they trust, a police officer, the girls confess every horrifying detail. But it soon becomes clear the act was not one of malice or revenge, but borne of fierce loyalty and an unimaginable desperation. Written off by abusive parents and mocked and shunned by their classmates, Blair and Ardith had found a safe haven with one another. And when that haven was threatened, they realised they would have to do everything in their power to protect it. Whatever the cost.",
