  "description": "Amidst the hot tempers of the werewolves, Sebastian is well known for his legendary calm. The instant he saw Erica, he knew he would never want another. With the instinct guiding them to each other and held beneath the sway of the moon, they were irresistibly drawn together. Sparks flew the moment they met, but then she ran from him and the problems began to multiply. But Sebastian will never let her go, after all a wolf only finds his mate once in his life. She’s his, even if she doesn’t know it.With internal turmoil eating away at them and external threats looming will the oath that binds them be strong enough to keep them together? Excerpt:“Erica,” he breathed, caressing her cheek gently. “I don’t want to have to fight you. Can’t you simply accept that we’re meant to be?”“No Sebastian, I can’t.”“And I can’t accept that we won’t be together. It seems that one of us is going to have to change their mind and that won’t be me Erica. I’ll be back tomorrow.”“Is there anything I can do to make you change your mind? This isn’t going to work Sebastian. I can’t take a mate.”“I won’t change my mind about this sweetheart and you don’t have a choice in the matter of a mate, I’m already here.”",
