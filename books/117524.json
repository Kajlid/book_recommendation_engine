  "description": "ETERNITY IS JUST A STEP ACROSS THE THRESHOLD The Threshold I am speaking about here “The ‘line’ between the ‘moment’ a person dies - the soul leaves the fleshly body and immediately steps over into ‘Heaven or HELL’ for all eternity, very few people are sent back to earth to tell others of their experiences, BUT most people are not sent back to tell it all. You might say that you do not believe in such places, well, then that means you DO NOT believe in the true YHWH (Jehovah) GOD who tells us about heaven and warns us about hell, which IS mentioned in the Bible. A lot of people believe that heaven is here on earth! WRONG! Look what Yeshua/Jesus said while HE was still on earth before HIS crucifixion in John 14:2-3. “In MY Father’s house (heaven) are many dwelling places; if it were not so, I would have told you so, for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you to MYSELF; that where I am, there you may be also.” That speaks of a place called heaven and Yeshua/Jesus fetching us to be with HIM. NO person can stand before YHWH GOD one day and say that they did not know about it! YHWH GOD is not a GOD of excuses and does not accept any excuses, but the truth only. Other books by the 1.
