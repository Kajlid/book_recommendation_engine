Granting a wish to their dying mother, Mary, a healer, sends the brothers on a journey. A journey to heal, to grow, to forgive, and to love. A journey that will take the gun toting, horseback riding, tough-as-nails brothers to a place very different from the home they know. Kentucky 2011 - Nicole lives a lonely, simple life. A life void of excitement. She'd been burned enough times in her life to know that tragedy was normal and everyone eventually hurt you. Her quiet life is ripped to pieces the day she discovers four cowboys in her empty house claiming to be from 1875. Can she help the brothers learn what they were sent to learn and find a way back home? Or are they truly there to teach her a lesson in trust and love? Read this story about healing, love, hope, pain, loss, friendship, and family, to find out!",
