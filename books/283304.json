  "description": "Gripping, heart-stopping, and an incredibly epic journey with a twist you'll never see coming. USA Today bestselling author Meghan Quinn, brings you a modern take on an old fashion romance that will leave you breathless and wanting more.  This isn’t a story about a love triangle. There is no triangle involved. This isn’t a story about an accidental pregnancy. Although having a baby with her . . . I would. This isn’t a story about lies and deception, even though at times I’ve lied to myself.  No, this is my story.  A story about sacrifice. A story about a man who fell in love with the wrong girl. A story I wish I never had to tell. I learned a long damn time ago, the only way to achieve my dreams was to avoid distractions—at any cost.  But all it took was one single night. One night and my entire life…changed.  One night had me colliding head first with the biggest distraction of my life; Rory Oaks. Smart. Charming. Beautiful. Rory changed everything.  Quickly, my one-track mind, my goals started to bend.  Each kiss faded decade-long dreams.  And with one single interaction, I flew off course.  BOX SET of FOUR BOOKS The Upside of Falling The Downside of Love The Left Side of Perfect The Right Side of Forever",
