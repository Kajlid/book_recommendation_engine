  "description": "Info from the back \"Journey to a strange land. Capt. Alex and his team had been computer selected to explore the sun-twin planet Cygni C. They found there a race of men who wiled away their lives playing childish games, making love, and vegetating in the deep, luxuriant jungles. Alex's friends succumbed to the planet's many delights. Only he felt duty-bound to return to earth.\"One of the most delightfully terrible science fiction books of all time. I still can't believe this Bodhisvatta of bulldada ever got published but I'm glad it did!",
