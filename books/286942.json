  "title": "The Masters",
  "description": "The Masters is volume one of seven of The Stone Dance of the Chameleon—a coming of age story—a saga of love and war—an apocalyptic epic fantasy about power and redemption.\n A black ship defies winter gales, bringing to young Carnelian’s remote island of exile three masked Lords of the Chosen—a cruel ruling caste. These Masters beg his father to return with them to oversee the election of a new God Emperor. To repair their ship, they pillage and destroy Carnelian’s home—the only world he’s ever known—condemning his people to starve. He and his father embark with the visitors on a long and perilous journey—against deadly opposition—to Osrakum, the heart and wonder of the world and seat of absolute power. \n(This Second Edition is a leaner and extensive reworking of the acclaimed original.)",
