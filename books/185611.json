She can stay in her safe, sexless marriage, or she can risk everything and commit to her sexually irresistible personal trainer, Blake. The decision should be an easy one, but what kind of personal trainer takes a strap to a client’s ass when she disobeys him? At first appalled, she soon finds that she enjoys it. Even needs it.

Lydia is riddled with doubts, and Blake’s spurned ex-girlfriend starts causing trouble neither of them needs.Tired of Lydia’s wavering, Blake subjects her to a prolonged test of her commitment.
