The only problem is that all of Kayla’s choices for the past eight years have been wiped clean in the matter of seconds. She is in an alien place surrounded by strangers. What’s worse, she isn’t even aware of all the things she has lost. With her journey of self-discovery slowly unfolding, how can she find time for anything or anyone else?Sometimes things can get real pretty fast.
