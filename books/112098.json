But when a tyrannical king from the East rises to threaten their very existence, the clan allows five children to develop their psychokinetic abilities with the hope that one day they will be able to help to defeat the menace. Five teenagers, collectively called Omordion's Hope-Atakos, Fajha, Cristaden, and twins Zimi and Zadeia-attend a boarding school where they have been taught for ten years by Hamilda Shing, who has been like a mother to them. When Hamilda is suddenly kidnapped, however, the group must set out on a perilous journey to save her-realizing along the way that Omordion holds many deadly secrets. Meanwhile, King Tholenod desperately tries to find ways to rule the world, while his son, Aillios, valiantly attempts to save his people from his father's brutality. All seems lost until a shocking discovery forces Prince Aillios to reevaluate his beliefs. In this exciting young adult tale, five gifted teenagers struggle to survive in a world where nothing is as it appears, a battle rages to save humanity from a vicious tyrant, and a secret waits to be revealed.",
