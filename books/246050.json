  "description": "This edition was previously published under the ASIN B078P7QB3Q Her given name is Prudence, but friends and family call her \"Pro.\" And it looks like she’s living up to her superstar nickname.  Pro seems to have it all going on – finally! Her business is rocking out, thanks to an impressive client, and her relationship with David “Meat Mountain” Fleischberg seems to be heating up. It like she’s living her dream life, but are things too good to be true for Pro in this steamy second installment of Going Pro?  Between dealing with some major work-related drama that threatens her career and feeling the effects of having her family and friends hundreds of miles away, Pro almost doesn’t notice David pulling away from her ahead of his final season. Before she knows it, all of the mixed messages, cancelled dates, and cryptic conversations have created some serious doubt, and it all comes to a head when Pro once again bumps into The Mountain about town.  Yes, there is an HEA for Pro ahead, but first, see what happens as one of these lovers goes out of bounds in their budding relationship.",
