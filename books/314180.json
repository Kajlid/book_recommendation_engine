  "description": "Vik Bedi was not supposed to be the one.Arrogant, smooth-talking surgeons—who also happen to be Geminis—are bad news. Our chemistry might be off the charts, but I’ve been burned by guys like him before.You’d think I’d have learned my lesson . . .But in a moment of weakness, I foolishly allowed a one-time fling to get him out of my system. Now I’m addicted—to his devilish smile, his heated gaze, and the way he steals my breath just by walking into the room. As a NICU nurse, I know how to be strong in the face of fear and chaos, but he knows when I just need to be held. He’s slowly inching his way into the one part of me that he can never have—my heart.They say the brightest stars burn the fastest, but I’m afraid he’ll leave me in embers.",
