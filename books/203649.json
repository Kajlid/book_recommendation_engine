  "description": "RAISING THE DEAD  With midterms looming, the students at Sunnydale High are predictably stressed-out. Even super-student Willow is feeling the pressure to succeed. And when her usual study buddies -- Buffy, Xander, and Oz -- decide they don't need her tutorial sessions, Willow wonders if \"she's\" really what they don't need. But her hurt feelings don't explain her sudden antagonism toward Buffy -- or the strange dreams they've both been having.  As tensions in the school escalate into brutal acts of violence -- and the perpetrators turn up horribly mutilated -- Buffy and the gang search for a supernatural source. The evidence indicates that someone is attempting to resurrect a powerful Hindu demon. Willow's new con?dante, guidance counselor Promila Daruwalla, becomes the prime suspect...until Giles runs into an old \"friend\" who is always causing trouble. It will take all of the Slayer's resources...and the help of \"all\" her friends...to find the culprit and destroy the key to the demon's resurrection.This novel is non-canon.",
