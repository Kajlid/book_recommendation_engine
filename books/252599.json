  "title": "BEHIND CLOSED DOORS: A Daughter's Story",
  "description": "This story is about an Italian Catholic family that came to America on vacation and never returned to their homeland. When their youngest unwed daughter became pregnant, her family disowned her. It was 1949. Abortions were illegal. She was seventeen when she gave birth. She was my mother.  This book chronicles the effects the birth of an unwanted child had on three families and three generations. It takes you through the unsettling chain of events that followed when my motherâ€™s family sent her away. It shares her fight for survival to care for us, and how she eventually gave up and left me with strangers. After years of separation we reunited, but I struggled to forgive her for all she had done.  I spent a lifetime trying to find my place in the world. My greatest dream was to have a home and a family I could call my own. The book tells you about the bad decisions I made along the way, and the price I paid because of them. I share with my readers the lessons I learned about life, and how I finally managed to find happiness.",
