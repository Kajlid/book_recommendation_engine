  "description": "The boy next door has always made her breathless. Joey… I wouldn’t say I ran away exactly—twenty-two is too old for that. I’d call it self-preservation.I have one objective: protect my heart from the boy next door who has no clue I’ve loved him my whole life, even with a front row seat to his revolving bedroom door.My escape plan almost worked. Except I left one thing behind.Logan Carter hijacked my heart, and now it’s time to get it back. This time for good.Logan…I wouldn’t say I’ve been lying this whole time—not about everything. Not about how much I miss my best friend, and definitely not about how pissed I am that she left with hardly a goodbye.She’s the last person I ever expected to ghost me, and her absence left a gaping hole in my chest.When Joey Grayson steps off that bus, I know I’ll do anything to keep her home, and that means finding out the truth. But I’m not sure how to tell her my truths when I’m living so many lies.",
