  "title": "Just About Armageddon",
  "description": "The earth is wrapped in a thick blanket of dense, dirt-infused cloud cover. It is the aftereffect of a massive slab of space debris slamming into the planet - potentially exterminating all animal life on the surface. Randy Tagget and several hundred survivors populate the Lifeboat Augusta, one of three orbiting space platforms intended to preserve human life. Tagget and his counterpart, Keisha Miller launched into space with every intention of returning to earth as soon as it was safe. Their assigned role was to work with their fellow survivors to re-establish the species on terra firma. That goal is not shared by everyone on board the lifeboat, however. Governor Raphael Fuentes has other plans. Nefarious plans he shares with no one, yet he pursues them with increasingly ruthless abandon. Can Tagget and Miller survive the unavoidable conflict to come? Will Governor Fuentes prevail? Only time, luck, and nerve-shattering risk will determine the future for Tagget, MIller, Fuentes, and the last traumatized members of the human race.",
