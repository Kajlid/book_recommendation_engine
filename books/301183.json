  "description": "Kyou has a routine. A system. He guards Brannigan Genovese, hacks for his family of choice, and drinks far too much caffeine for any living being. He has contingency plans for everything except for the following: •\tBrannigan buying up real estate from the Irish Mob•\tKyou’s band of brothers figuring out who Brannigan actually is•\tIvan sneaking into said Irish Mob headquarters for the fun of it•\tFeelings for one Brannigan Genovese that undermines his own common senseOddly enough, it might be the feelings that get Kyou in the most trouble. Because when Brannigan is in danger, Kyou breaks every rule he has to save the man. And damn the consequences. Tags: It’s not stalking (totally stalking), Brannigan doesn’t envision being on the run from the mob as his meet cute, but he’ll take it, its not stalking if he likes it, Kyou needs all the naps, does it count as a heist if they’re blowing stuff up, Ivan votes yes, band of brothers, pansexual character, Kyou is utterly done, family of choice, emotional growth, Ivan’s actually serious for once, yes the world almost ended, sleep deprived hackers make poor snap decisions, fortunately for Brannigan",
