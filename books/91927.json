  "description": "Elaine is an ordinary human with ordinary dreams, maybe a little too shy for her own good. At least that's what she tells herself, until she is kidnapped off of a city bus by a strange and charismatic man named Ghalib who has come looking specifically for her. Ghalib definitely isn't ordinary. He isn't even human. He's a Dream Architect, one of the beings who create dreams for humanity. His world is the realm of passion, imagination and nightmares, where humans may be kept as pets, or personal slaves. Ghalib is obsessed with Elaine, whose vivid, erotic dreams he finds irresistible. If Elaine is to contend with Ghalib on her own terms, she'll have to do more than let go of her shy, inhibited waking manner. She will have to realize her own dreams. (F/M. F/F, M/M)",
