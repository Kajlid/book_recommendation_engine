  "description": "Eliana Shay is an ordinary college girl with an extraordinary birthright. When handsome professor, Aiden Klemenson, sees her, he singles her out as a potential Chosen of the benevolent gods of Creation. He tries to convince Eliana that she is born to do the work of the gods—something unique and powerful. But Eliana’s past doesn’t allow her to have the trust she needs—in Aiden’s gods and the man himself. Aiden must employ all of his considerable charm to break through her defenses, while trying to keep their relationship strictly platonic. A difficult task when the lush and curvy Eliana’s obvious desire and seductive aura shreds his self-control. Despite his best efforts, desire burns between them with an enchantment all its own.The gods of Destruction will stop at nothing to keep Eliana from becoming a powerful force against evil. Cunning and deceitful, they send demons and magical serial killers to exterminate her before she can become a Creation god's Chosen hand on earth. In order to survive, Eliana will have to learn to have faith in her own strength and the warrior who stole her heart.This title is previously published and has been extensively revised and lengthened in content.",
