  "description": "Yeh-hsien. Cenerentola. Cendrillon. Ashenputtle. Chernuska. Cinderella. These are just a few of the names of one of the best known and most beloved fairy tale characters in the world. The tale is known in countless variations throughout Europe and Asia as well as Africa and the Americas. The tales share the familiar story of a persecuted heroine who finally triumphs over oppressed circumstances through her virtue and the assistance of a magical helper. Whatever name she is given, the character has inspired countless generations and remains a vibrant part of modern popular culture. A discussion of the Cinderella Cycle is provided in the introduction, explaining how seemingly unrelated tales are considered part of the Cinderella family. A brief history of Cinderella scholarship is also included, detailing why the tale was once considered the key to understanding how stories were disseminated around the world. Building upon Marian Roalfe Coxâ€™s seminal work with Cinderella over 120 years ago, this collection offers more than 150 full length Cinderella tales and over 200 summaries of other variants from around the world. Some of the tales are new translations, a few appearing for the first time in English. Many of the stories are clearly related to each other, but with some the relationship is less obvious. Whether you are a student of folklore or an armchair enthusiast, this anthology offers a diverse array of tales with a unifying theme that both entertains and educates, all gathered for the first time in one impressive collection.",
