  "description": "'Pieces of a Rainbow' is a collection of seven short stories, each one based on a different colour of the rainbow. You will find a full spectrum of emotions within the stories. Some are sad, some uplifting. There are not always happy endings, but the tales reflect the real world, and the forces of nature at work in our lives; sometimes beyond our control. The stories are diverse in style, and the characters, although fictional, are true-to-life. There is something for everyone in this inspired collection. Excerpt from 'Forever Blue': '...Some people are lucky; they just carry on going, keeping up with the current, riding the waves. Others find a ship they can sail in forever; but some are left to drift alone, battling against the waves, and hoping they can get to the shore in one piece.'",
