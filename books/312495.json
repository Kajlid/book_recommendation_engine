  "description": "Deceptively simple yet strikingly profound, MUTTS is a comic strip that speaks to fans of all ages. In Patrick McDonnell's animal-centric world, Earl, the dog, and Mooch, the cat, provide both postulations and punch lines, enlightenment and entertainment. They seem innocent, yet speak volumes. \"Kids will immediately take to the funny-animals look of the strip,\" wrote Mark J. Estren in Virginia Parent , \"but there's plenty here for adults, too.\" Indeed there is. From musings about friendship to the benefits of adopting shelter animals, these two and their furry pals hammer out the mammalian issues of the day.The late Charles Schulz described MUTTS : \"I think the best new comic strip to come along has been MUTTS . . . . The little dog and cat are just innocent creatures, and all the characters are funny and fun to look at.\" MUTTS is a true classic.",
