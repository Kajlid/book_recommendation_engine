Jonathan Sauvage is at the helm of the struggling winery -- battling demons of his own and unprepared for the arrival of a fiery and opinionated apprentice. Before long, neither one is sure if they are working together or against each other, but one thing is certain: falling in love just might unravel their chances at finding the futures they thought they wanted.",
