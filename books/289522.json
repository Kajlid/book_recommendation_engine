  "description": "A Paranormal Women's Fiction with a bit of class, and a lot of sass for anyone who feels like age is just a number!  One day I’m married, living in Seattle, and magic isn’t real. The next, I’m divorced and living in the guest room of my ex’s hotter- than-sin cousin’s place in Savannah . . . and talking to an animated skeleton named Robert.  I have to admit, Robert isn’t my worst date.  At forty-one, I didn’t think I’d be starting over. But I’ll be damned if my ex thinks I’m down and out because he pulled a fast one on me. When a job comes my way that offers me a chance to use my childhood training in the shadow world, I take it—I need the money more than I care about my sanity.  It’s dangerous. I have to embrace the magic and dark of my past. And I need Advil to keep me going.  So those who’d hold me back better sit up and take notice, because a new woman is in town, and she’s not about to be counted out by anyone.  Even if she does groan when she rolls out of bed in the morning.  *-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*   Next in Series -- Pre-order now!
