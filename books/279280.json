  "description": "Vote! Vote! Vote! Class elections at Abigail Adams Junior High are underway, and the Beacon Street Girls are in the middle of it all! As the drama escalates, election posters begin to disappear. Katani is really worried. Could someone very close to her be responsible? \"And why,\" asks Charlotte, \"is everyone so competitive?\" That's not all. Mr. Popular, Dillon Johnson, is running too, and he's making big promises. Can he keep them? Henry Yurt, aka the Yurtmeister, has plastered smiley face posters all over the school that are too silly for words, or ... maybe not. Will the candidate with the best ideas win the election, or will big promises take the day!",
