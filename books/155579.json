  "description": "If Jack Kerouac had lived, what might he have done and written? Kurt Landefeld opens the doors on this for us in his remarkable novel. \"This is a moving tribute to Kerouac, whom Kurt Landefeld brilliantly resurrects in this imaginative triumph. He gives Kerouac a new lease on life (in more ways than one) in this finely executed novel. It’s a 'must read' for anyone who values Kerouac, the Sixties, and the created worlds of those whose eyes see what might have been. Bravo.” ~Dennis Baumwoll.It's a fine first novel and a needed revision of a master American writer. ﻿",
