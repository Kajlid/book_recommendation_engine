So far? Only the client is a sure thing.Because we wake up together, hungover and half dressed in my suite. So many questions. Such a freaking mess.And I only remember snatches of last night. Giddy, colorful glimpses of dark clubs and a chapel and–oh god. Did my grumpy boss really lick tequila out of my belly button? Say it isn’t so!It can’t be real. Must be some horrible prank.Because he hates me. Doesn’t he?\nWoke Up Wed is a short and steamy enemies-to-lovers romance, starring a repressed CEO and the assistant he’s determined to divorce… soon. Eventually.",
