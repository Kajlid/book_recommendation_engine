  "description": "Brauer leaves no stone unturned, no metaphor untold, and no holds barred in this witty deconstruction of the modern economy. With up to the minute inserts and reflections, Twelve Big Lies and the Prairies of Heaven unravels a contemporary canvas of economics today, exploring and demystifying the causalities, and the influence of those responsible. Brauer's idiosyncratic style, from his Quaker roots and Buddhist principles, lends a piquancy to his curious stance with phrases like \"Seeking to understand wu-wei, the art of participating without interfering, might go a long way to re-orienting the bizarre farrago that democracy has become.\"Whether getting ruffled with the Media having 'all the percipience and principle of a lobotomised Caliban', or lumping bankers in with politicians in the 'conspiracy of charlatans', Brauer weighs his arguments to form a trustworthy voice intent on showing, rather than telling. With edicts for everyone from Confuscious to archy the cockroach, Brauer communicates with palatable, pub-table anecdotes and examples, home-grown diagrams and illustrations, and fair, honest questions in this timely study of human beings in the face of power and money.",
