The situation doesn't get better when she discovers that the bed and breakfast won't let her keep her reservation now that she's single. But the residents of Summerland, the strangely idyllic and drowsy oceanside town, are happy to have her come to visit. And in a town where all the residents are young and stunningly beautiful, there's plenty to enjoy. Like Felix Graves, the darkly handsome owner of Sacred Grounds.
