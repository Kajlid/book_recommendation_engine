  "description": "I met Shumayl’s eyes across the table, and suddenly he spoke to me, asking me to explain all this to him.“They are all going to travel together,” I said to him, “They are going with Arnulf and his wives to the greatest adventure of all. They are going to explore the great Star Ocean.”“What a marvelous story,” Shumayl said and laughed, “Just imagine how much mischief they can make out there!”*The fourth book in the BLADE HONER series about the life of the Oseberg priestess covers the last year that our still very young heroine, Thordís, spends in Rusiyah, and the first trials of manhood proposed by the Vessel.",
