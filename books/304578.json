I just have to keep reminding myself that I'm doing this for me. It has nothing to do with the gorgeous man staring at me like I'm a crazy person.Tyler - Why is she climbing into my car uninvited? I don't care how sweet her smile is. Or how long her legs are. This isn't some aimless summer road trip. But I can tell from the way she's looking at me that she knows the truth. I'm not driving toward something. I'm driving away from something. Someone.",
