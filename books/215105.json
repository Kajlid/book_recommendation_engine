  "description": "What would you do if you had a kill chip implanted in your brain and you didn’t know when it was going to go off? The clock is ticking as Jake searches for the infamous programmer who started it all, the one man who knows how to remove the chip. The question is…how much time is left? With his love by his side and his self-driving car to guide him, Jake traverses the AI-controlled United States to find a man many believe is dead. Along the way, he encounters mutant animals, knife-wielding jungle men, and the bots, with their flamethrowers and their black-and-white ways. Then, everything changes when he finds something so special, so shapeless, it can’t possibly fit into the boxes at the prison-zoo— into the cages.",
