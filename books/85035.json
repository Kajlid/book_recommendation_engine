  "description": "A suspenseful tale set in the Spanish Civil War. Max is begged to come back to the waning theater of confrontation between the leftists and Franco’s fascists to find a volunteer freedom fighter who has disappeared. Many famous people were involved in or eyewitnesses to the doomed struggle against Franco, including Ernest Hemingway and John Dos Passos. In this cosmopolitan mix looking for the ‘cause du jour’, Friedman tries vainly to stay neutral in his search but is quickly thrown into a maelstrom of intrigue.",
