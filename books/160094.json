When he sees a young man dressed as a submissive, a part of him awakens which he long thought lost.Alan is having the worst night of his life. Talked into the costume by a friend, he is humiliated, despite the fact that serving a Master has always been his dream. He just wants the night over. That is until he meets the tall, dark, masked man at the bar.The chance encounter reminds Jeff just how much he loves to be in control, and it is a fantasy come true for Alan, but once the mask comes off, they must decide if their feelings for each other are enough to move things outside the bedroom and try to make a relationship work between them.",
