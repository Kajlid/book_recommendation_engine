  "description": "**Previously published in 2013 as THREE TO TANGO in The Unwrapped Anthology, THE TANGO LESSON is a stand-alone novella with a Happily Ever After a Threesome Ending**  My name is Isabelle, and I’m a smut fiend.  But only when it comes to books.  In fact, for twenty-three years, the only outwardly kinky thing about me was my hair on a rainy day. Compared to the toe-curling, earth-shattering, mind-blowing romps on my Kindle, my sex life was totally vanilla. Less than vanilla, actually—it was vanonexistent.  And then I took a tango lesson.  They say it takes two to tango, but let me tell you--  a tango for three is a hell of a lot of fun.",
