  "description": "A New York Times Notable Book and a Los Angeles Times Best Book of 2001, the critical success of Babe in Paradise heralds Marisa Silver as one of America's most talented young writers. The unforgettable characters of Babe in Paradise ―an aging stunt man, a chauffeur, and a voice-over actor among them―live on the periphery of Los Angeles's allure, outside its glamour and success. Marisa Silver's singular voice makes us care deeply about their everyday desperations and hard-won hopes.",
