  "description": "Recently retired, Carole Seddon resides in the seaside hamlet of Fethering. There she maintains a quiet and sensible life with the companionship of her dog Gulliver. But everything changes when she and Gulliver find a corpse on the beach. What's more, there are two wounds on its neck. The body mysteriously disappears and the police dismiss Carole as a befuddled middle-aged woman. She almost starts to believe it herselfuntil a stranger threatens her to keep quiet or else. Unable to contain her anxiety, Carole confides in her eccentric neighbor, Jude, who suggests that if the police cannot be bothered to catch a killer, maybe they should do it themselves.",
