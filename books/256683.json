  "description": "It is what's forbidden that draws the sweetest temptation.Declan’s parents object to her going to college; forced to stay home as a farmhand. In the blink of an eye, all of Declan’s aspirations of higher education are wrenched from her grasp. It’s when she’s at her lowest that her father’s kick aims precisely where it hurts.As time passes – she counts the bruises – her father hires more hands to work around the farm, including a quiet boy her age named Joel. They grow closer as they share duties, with tender feelings growing bright and robust as they steal secret moments out of sight of the other prying work hands.A heavy foot can crush even a fruitful harvest.When Declan’s parents catch wind of their love, they reject the match. Fists fly, and emotions run dry as Joel and Declan try to tie up loose ends and earn a life for themselves. Do they dare to nurture their dreams of more than stacking hay? Can Declan break the ball and chain that anchors her to the farm, or will she remain under her parent’s firm thumbs?",
