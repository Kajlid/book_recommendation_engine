  "description": "If you go down to the woods today.......... For New Yorker Gus Freeman, a visit to England fulfils a lifelong dream - and breeds a lifetime of nightmares! When her beloved best friend is killed in a drug-related shooting, Gus Freeman's world is turned upside down and, after an unexpected windfall, she decides to take a break from her dead end job and make the pilgrimage to England to walk in the steps of her hero, Lord Byron. Her trip takes her from the imposing Harrow School to Byron's seat of learning in Cambridge where a chance encounter leads her back to London and to a quaint inn called The Six Bells. Despite it's charming facade, The Six Bells has it's secrets and when Gus befriends a seemingly friendly local couple she discovers that some secrets are buried deeper than others. When the line between worlds blurs, a door to the past is opened, and, as her search for the truth reaches it's terrifying conclusion, Gus comes to realise that the answer lies - restlessly - in nearby Mad Bess Wood. Based on real life events, Mad Bess Wood is the place where the past and present collide - and neither are necessarily on your side!",
