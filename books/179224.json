  "description": "After escaping the clutches of the evil Vampiress Maura, three friends struggle with the past in finding a new way of life and love...Claude is nobody's hero, yet he finds himself saving yet another damsel in distress. He should have learned his lesson the first time. Cat had been a major thorn in his side but at least he hadn't been unfortunate enough to be attracted to her. That had been Xander's problem. Now he had a problem all his own. The charming and intelligent Gretchen threatens everything Claude has come to accept about himself.Gretchen is not amused by Claude's advances. His arrogance combined with the skeletons in her closet has Gretchen on the defensive. Dealing with Claude is merely a means to an end; she wants her independence as well as vengeance. If only her body would get on board.",
