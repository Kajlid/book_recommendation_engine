  "title": "Satan’s Silence: Ritual Abuse and the Making of a Modern American Witch Hunt",
  "description": "Communities throughout the United States were convulsed in the 1980’s and early 1990’s by accusations, often without a shred of serious evidence, that respectable men and women in their mids—many of them trusted preschool teachers—secretly gathered in far-reaching conspiracies to rape and terrorize children. In this powerful book, Debbie Nathan and Mike Snedeker examine the forces fueling this blind panic.",
