  "description": "In 1879 Texas, handsome Brett Liberty is straddling two worlds; he is unable to fully embrace his Iroquois blood or freely conform to a world made for white men. The only time he finds peace is when he is with his mustangs… until he discovers rough-and-tumble Rayna Harper. Having known little kindness in her lifetime, Rayna has built up a tough exterior. But Brett sees her heart buried beneath the layers of hurt and fear. Though he could never expect a woman to share his troubled life, he's completely taken by this red-haired beauty. She seems to understand him more than any woman has before. As their mutual understanding melts into growing desire, it seems that a brush of the lips is all it takes to chase their troubles away…",
