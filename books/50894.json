  "description": "Sofia Marino is a kick-ass heroine. Her role on the cheesy TV sitcom “Spy Girl” has garnered her a male cult following, fan sites, and a hefty bank account. Okay. So it’s not Scorsese or Spielberg, but at least she’s in front of the camera doing what she was born to do. Faster than a director yells, “Action”, her life goes from Hollywood to Hollyweird when she wakes up in Arizona, disoriented and caked with blood. With several hours of her life unaccounted for, Sofia finds herself on the run and under the protection of burned out FBI agent, Joe Bogart, a man who once broke her heart with a single kiss. Sofie and Joe embark on a mission to save not only themselves, but also their friends and family. If they succeed in staying alive, will these two jaded souls then risk their hearts on each other, or will they forever remain. . . Seduced?",
