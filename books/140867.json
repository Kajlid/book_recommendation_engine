Divine Wilkinson is a young girl longing to break away from the strict, abusive hands of her father--a man of God who's adored by everyone on the outside. She endures the pain and suffering with the help of her faith, until a life changing family secret is revealed.Closed-off and broken down, a sweet friend and admirer, Darion, influences Divine to finally leave the hurt behind and start fresh. Her new found freedom takes her out of her home and into a world of desire, where Divine loses sight of her faith as she searches for a love to fill the deep emptiness that won't seem to go away.Darion, a man who had supported and helped her through a time of loss, seemed to have been perfect for Divine, but later on their relationship becomes strained, and she finds herself feeling neglected and unappreciated again. Divine soon meets Sean, who gives her all the love and attention she is not getting at home. Will Divine be strong enough to resist the pull of lust and return to her faith, or has she found the love she'd been searching for and is willing to hurt others in order to have it?",
