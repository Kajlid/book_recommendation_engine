There’s zero chance they’ll ever meet in real life.So, when Noah sees an opportunity to secretly meet his crush, he takes it.Even though he’ll have to join the cast of a local production of Chicago with his self-obsessed mother. Even though he’ll need to lie to his best (and only) friend. And even though he’ll have to sing and dance in front of actual people.Because love is worth the risk. And, really, what could possibly go wrong?",
