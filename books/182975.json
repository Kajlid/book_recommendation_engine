  "description": "Rhys Harrison’s dreams of a medieval fantasy world called Seodrass have lost her a lot of sleep, but also provide inspiration in her story writing and design for her video game company’s latest project. When her brilliant young intern, Braeden Somerleigh, suggests her dreams are visions of a real place, she suspects his genius has driven him insane—until his research leads them to a doorway between the two worlds.The two find themselves in a once-peaceful kingdom now torn apart by tyranny and genocide, masterminded by a mysterious figure known only as Malmuir. What’s more, Rhys and Braeden learn their arrival is believed to fulfill a prophecy of two “Foretold Ones” sent to preserve Seodrass. Unable to find a way back home and hunted by Malmuir’s bloodthirsty troops, the pair has little choice but to accompany Sir Daeg—a knight straight out of Rhys’s dreams, or so she thought—on a desperate quest to save the kingdom and their own lives.All From Dreams, the first volume in an epic new series by Bethanie F. DeVors, weaves a tapestry of action, magic, humor, and romance that will spellbind lovers of fantasy and high adventure from the first page to the last.",
