  "description": "Cassandra Larkin is a woman with a dark secret. Anderson is a sexy ghost with exactly what she's looking for, and the Ether's the only place she can get it. The Ether is a dangerous place where even the most powerful witches go only to work complex magic, and sex in the Ether is asking for trouble. Secrets don't stay secret for long when the treacherous demon, Deacon, discovers the truth about Cassandra and plots to use her magic as his ticket back into the world of the living, back to Tara Stone and her coven of witches, upon whom he has sworn a terrible vengeance. Cassandra must accept her dark past and stand with Anderson, Tara, and the Elemental Coven against Deacon's wrath or risk the loss of friendship, purpose and love, everything that she only now dares to believe she may be able to have.",
