  "description": "In 1180 A.D. Mistra Hensly, your average-day farmer's daughter, encounters young Flynn Nightly. Flynn isn't your average-day traveler being forced to look for love, but a vampire trying to quench his undying thirst for blood and the everlasting lust of love. On All Hallows' Eve the two confront each other when Mistra is heading home from saying good night to her mother. Night, the mysterious new visitor, assumes that Mistra is attending the party he and his parents are. During the confusion between the two, Flynn enthralls Mistra into meeting him yet again, and living with him in his castle for months before the night is to begin the next day.",
