  "description": "When the leader of the local witch coven is murdered, all evidence suggests foul play of the faerie variety. With group of anti-supernatural assassins running around town, I have to figure out their connection with the dark faeries before my best friend Isabel, the new coven leader, becomes the killer's next target.  Nobody ever crosses the witches and escapes unscathed, but with the ancient Sidhe, all bets are off. I need to have my wits about me, otherwise one mistake might spell the destruction of our world.",
