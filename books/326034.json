  "description": "Tyler\nMy fated mate is dead, but I still seem to see her everywhere I look, feel her claws digging into every part of my life. All I want to do is throw myself into my work, return to some kind of normal where my Alpha gives me orders, and I follow them. Since Liam can’t seem actually do that, it’s a relief that our Setting Luna has figured things out. She’s assigned me a job that gets me away from the pack for a bit: escorting refugees home. There’s no chance of me finding my mate on this trip, so what could possibly go wrong?\nStella\nAll my life, I’ve been trapped in a limelight I never wanted. Born with a severe birth defect, I was always the “special” twin, and not in a good way. My sister’s been missing for years, having fled from our emotionally abusive father and, no doubt, the shadow I cast. I’ve always trusted that no news is good news, but when I hear there are refugees coming home, part of me can’t help but hope I’ll get to see Sheila just one more time.This series features one couple per book with a guaranteed HEA. This particular novel also deals with character disability and PTSD.",
