  "description": "\"Winner of the 2017 Gold Line Press Poetry Chapbook Competition\"\"Pentimento is a well-crafted chapbook that contemplates the frayed end of things just as masterfully as it examines love's illuminated beginnings. Each poem carefully weaves a greater narrative of what it means to lose someone -- in spirit, in body, while also exploring what it means to leave and be left behind. This chapbook is earthy, painterly, and introspective, soberly interrogating trauma, war, guilt, and death while also steadfastly celebrating love, family, and the gleaming importance of joy.\"- Safiya Sinclair",
