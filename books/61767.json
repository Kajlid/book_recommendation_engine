  "description": "Diandra and Lizbeth are back, and this time things are very different. Cocaine overdose victims are turning up in Bethany Beach and Lizbeth and Alexar are busy trying to clean it up. But when a surprising twist turns the case upside down, Lizbeth may have to compromise all she holds dear to make things right. District Attorney Giles Carson has plans for Lizbeth, as well. He's not done with her, and he's not forgiven her for ruining his clandestine efforts. Now a death threat hangs over her head and Diandra won't just stand aside and let someone come between her and the woman she loves. The more things change, the more they stay the same- until they change again with just another bite.",
