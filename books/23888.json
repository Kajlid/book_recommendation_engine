  "title": "We Are Not Afraid: The Story of Goodman, Schwerner, and Chaney, and the Civil Rights Campaign for Mississippi",
  "description": "It was one of the most haunting crimes in American history--the abduction and killing of civil rights workers James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner in rural Neshoba County, Mississippi, during the \"Freedom Summer\" of 1964. Seth Cagin and Philip Dray use extensive interviews, trial transcripts, and government files to weave a dramatic recounting of the civil rights cause for which these young men gave their lives.This long awaited reissue of We Are Not Afraid includes a new introduction by the authors that reflects on the case's history, including the belated 2005 state prosecution of Edgar Ray Killen, one of the surviving Klan ringleaders.(back cover)",
