Blackbeard still terrorizes the Caribbean Sea, one of the last pirates to challenge the reign of King George.Sailing unwittingly into this unsavoury company comes one John Chandagnac, bookkeeper and puppeteer. He seems an unlikely candidate for piracy, or the machinations of dark sorcery. But, christened Jack Shandy by a drunken pirate captain, he may turn out to be one of the greatest of them all...Tim Powers, award-winning author of The Anubis Gate, blends exciting history with outlandish fantasy in this rousing tale of high-seas adventure and magic. Come sail away on stranger tides...A hunt for unearthly spirits with the aid of a mummified two-headed dog. A journey through the Florida swamps in search of the Fountain of Youth. A battle at sea with the Royal Navy. An encounter with sunken ships crewed by zombies.Once again, Tim Powers demonstrates his remarkable ability to thrill, amuse and enchant his readers - in the adventure of a lifetime.The best fantasy writer to appear in decades. - GuardianCover illustration by Richard Clifton-Day",
