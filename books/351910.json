  "description": "Stories are old of a hero who will come to Farsala's aid when the need need is greatest. But for thousands of years the prosperous land of Farsala has felt no such need, as it has enjoyed the peace that comes from being both feared and respected. Now a new enemy approaches Farsala's borders, one that neither fears of respects its name and legend. But the rulers of Farsala still believe that they can beat any opponet. Three young people are less sure of Farsala's invincibility. Jiaan, Soraya, and Kavi see Time's Wheel turning, with Farsala headed toward the Flames of Destruction. What they cannot see is how inextricably their lives are linked to Farsala's fate - until it's too late. In \"Flame\" the first volume of The Book of Sorahb, Hilari Bell introduces readers to a world of honor, danger, and magic in this spell binding tale of self-discovery.",
