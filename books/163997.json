  "title": "Armageddon: Fall of the Vampires",
  "description": "In a near future vampires are society. They live in happy homes and work everyday jobs and live as we do now - or at least they did until their food supply began to dwindle. Now the entire population is falling to starvation. In a last ditch effort to save themselves and preserve their race the government releases a television broadcast informing the public that it was a government created myth that vampires couldn't sustain themselves by feeding off of other vampires. In an instant the world is sent into a cannibalistic frenzy while the government moves behind the massive distraction to roundup the last remaining human animals to harvest for their own preservation. In the midst of all this, a sixteen year old boy who lost his parents in a hunting expedition is the only hope and protection that his six year old sister has in this world gone mad.",
