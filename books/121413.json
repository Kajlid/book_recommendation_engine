  "description": "According to \"The Comics Reporter,\" \"If a reader were to pick up on any one cartoonist working at a furious and considered and accomplished pace right below the radar of most comics fans, C.F. might be the best choice.\" This first book by C.F. (also known in the East Coast underground music scene as Kites) is perhaps the most anticipated graphic novel debut of the year. Coming out of the fabled Providence, Rhode Island, art and noise scene, \"Powr Mastrs\" is an intense fantasy story projected to run to 10 volumes. In it, C.F. narrates the story of a tribe of mystical warriors whose power relations are constantly in flux. As power shifts, so do physical and psychological identities. In this first volume, we are introduced to the central characters and the complex geographies in which they wander. Overflowing with graphic ideas, from the intricately designed costumes each character wears to C.F.'s exacting architectural detail, \"Powr Mastrs\" is rendered in a distinctive pencil line that has already attracted much attention in sources like the groundbreaking comics anthology, \"Kramers Ergot,\"",
