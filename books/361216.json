  "description": "\"Release Them, and You Will Re Set Free.\" These were not exactly the words R. T. Kendall had hoped to hear during a painful situation when he had been terribly wronged! However, these words cut into his heart. He knew he couldn't ignore them and also be healed. When everything in you wants to hold a grudge, point a finger and remember the pain, God wants you to lay it all aside. You can avoid spiritual quicksand and experience the incredible freedom found in total forgiveness. Is total forgiveness easy? Of course not...but this book will give you a game plan...and the encouragement to cast out areas of unforgiveness that have kept you from enjoying the best God has to offer you. Learn what forgiveness is and what it is not. Uncover the physical, emotional and spiritual consequences of unforgiveness, and see why God adamantly encourages you to forgive others. Make the choice to forgive -- and step into a new dimension of freedom and inner peace.",
