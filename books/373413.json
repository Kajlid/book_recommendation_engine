  "description": "Carl Mackay had an okay job, a beautiful woman, and a lot of big plans. But one day he met a beautiful, frightened girl who didn't quite belong in this world. And something began. Irrevocably. Something that diverted him forever from his path, shook the sleepy dust from his eyes and brought him to a startling confrontation with the furthest limits of life, death - and an alien, terrifying danger... the Sinful Ones.",
