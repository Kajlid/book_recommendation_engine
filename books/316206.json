You see, the Englishman with a cocky smirk and an infuriatingly sexy accent I had the displeasure in meeting with? He also happens to be my boss.\nAsher\nI was minding my own business when a certain… tiny someone came into my life and I fell. Literally. Fell on the ground with her on top of me.The little firecracker gave me a piece of her mind and all I wanted to do was piss her off one more time. Because I can.So I did just that. Again and bloody again.\nThis is a standalone novella with a guaranteed HEA and NO cheating!\nNOTE - Sinful Lust is a part of the Sinful Series but could be read on its own. For a better experience, we suggest reading Sinful Liaisons first.",
