  "description": "Thorn is not your average, everyday dragon. For a start he has no scales. Instead, his hide is a strange but beautiful fluid silver, with odd properties that surprise even him. He also turns up his nose in repulsion at his broodmates' carnivorous fare; nothing makes Thorn quite so happy as a good helping of mineral-based rock and ore. Still, in his personally excavated cave, with the company of his devoted Dron attendant Nashkar and his own thoughts, Thorn is almost contented. Contentment quickly becomes a thing of the past when Thorn finds an odd, two-legged creature by the river. The thing is covered in a thin pink skin that is leaking sticky redness. It smells awful, but Thorn decides to rescue it anyway. And so his adventures begin. Kord, human and irritable, has been injured by Damacles, an evil sorcerer who has kidnapped his beloved. Thorn must help Kord escape the Dragon Lands and find his beloved before it is too late. It's a pity that they don't get on better.",
