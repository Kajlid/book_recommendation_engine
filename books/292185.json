  "title": "Keeping Score",
  "description": "One more careless mistake and I could lose everything, including the career I have worked for my entire life. I’m just done. Done with jersey chasers. And done with women—for the time being.That is until Sophie Thomas, a local magazine photographer, crashes into my life. She’s bright, she’s funny, and there’s just something about her that draws me in. I know I need to stay away, but I can’t.I just hope I can take down the carefully constructed walls she has built up around her already broken heart, and show her that I’m keeping score—and I don’t lose.",
