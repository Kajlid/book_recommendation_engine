  "description": "Nam’s life sucks. She loathes having to live in baking hot Thailand and now her boyfriend back in England’s dumped her. The heat’s killing her; she can’t understand the lingo and has no idea that the Mara, the Buddhist devil, wants her for his blood collection – the descendants of the offspring he’s sired with mortals down through the centuries. That all changes when an earthquake then tsunami rips her parents’ hotel apart, killing Nam and her mother and thrusting them into the Buddhist Limbo. Together they drive back the demons sent by the Mara to seize them, and Nam discovers that her blood-line might be a bummer, but it gives her the power to blast demons out of existence. Her mother knows the Mara will pursue Nam through every plane of existence and offers herself as his slave in return for Nam’s safety. Nam fails to stop her making the pact and sent spinning back to her life in tsunami ravaged Thailand. Nam’s battered and guilt racked, alone in the knowledge that her mother’s dead in this world, but living on as a slave in the Mara’s kingdom of pain. Along with the mysterious and attractive Simon, Nam must harness and hone her new found powers, find a path back to the Underworld and break her mother out of the devil’s clutches. Going after the Mara’s going to mean dying all over again and that sucks, big time. But if Nam fails, she’ll not only lose her mum, but also her own soul as the devil’s plaything for eternity.",
