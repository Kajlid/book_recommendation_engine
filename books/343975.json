  "description": "The prophecy spoken by an ancestor has been passed down through the generations and must now be fulfilled: \"The old moon will wane and the sky will grow dim. Listen then to the call of the kuaka as they gather for the flight to the north.\" Ihaka and his people must travel north across Raukawa(Cook Strait) to visit kin and 'renew the strands of the net that bind us to Hawaiki. To do this, they must build a great double-hulled canoe. Ihaka and his friend Pahiko are caught up in the work, especially Ihaka. He is the apprentice of Paoa, the tohunga in wood and stone crafts, and this is a chance to learn new skills. But as tha canoe takes shape, from the felling of the mightly totara in the bush to the final launching, Ihaka finds his relationship with the old man has it's own challenge. In accepting this, he comes to manhood.",
