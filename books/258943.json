  "description": "OUT NOW!\nreader warning, if you're sensitive to the occasional horror theme, smoking weed and nicotine, drinking vodka straight from the bottle, and a shit load of cursing, this epic fictional adventure may not be for you.\nSome people are life sucking, soul destroying, end of world assholes…then there are zombies. Actually, they’re not really zombies, they’re infected, but you know, tomayto tomahto.Don’t get me wrong, I’ve got my faults, too. My attitude down-right sucks. I’m untrusting. I smoke and curse too much, and I’m somewhat of a kleptomaniac. In a normal world, those faults help keep my rock queen facade intact. But in this new world, one raging with illness and torn apart by the desperate and stupid, I’m what you would call a survivor.My plan was simple, stay alive and protect my teenage sister. When a silent man with a steely gaze shot his way into my existence, I knew that more than my life was at stake. Lawson Bishop had the potential to crack his way inside the hard shell of my heart and bring it back to life.Exclusive to Amazon -Amazon.com - http://tiny.cc/RockZombieAmazon.com.au - http://tiny.cc/RockZombieAUAmazon.co.uk - http://tiny.cc/RockZombieUKAmazon.ca - http://tiny.cc/RockZombieCA",
