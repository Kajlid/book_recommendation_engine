Told through old photographs, diary entries, letters, and the results of a mail-order DNA test, Cori pieces together a profound scrapbook that begins as a paternity search and becomes a chronicle of her mother’s reckless life. A stunning visual memoir, Sweet Charlotte’s Seventh Mistake is an intimate look into one woman’s unconventional family history.",
