  "description": "Reverend Jack Mallund knows his SAS regimental reunion party won't be for the faint-hearted. When a pornographic movie is played, he turns away, but before doing so, the face of one jumps out at him with a familiarity that makes him it is his teenage daughter, missing, presumed dead. That night turns Jack's life upside down all over again. With police reluctant to reopen the case, Jack must go it alone. His faith is pushed to the extreme and his conscience to the precipice of insanity as he fights to find his daughter.",
