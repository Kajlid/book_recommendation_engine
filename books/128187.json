They grow gradually more independent as the story progresses.Several meetings of the Farthing Animals are held, to decide on how best to deal with the new problems facing them and they maintain the \"community spirit\" established with the Ancient Woodland Oath, reinforced by the journey and the perils of winter. As a result of the territorial feelings of Scarface the Fox, they become confined to a small area of the Park and there are several eventful meetings between Farthing and White Deer Park foxes on both sides of the boundary.",
