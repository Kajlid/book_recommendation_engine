  "title": "The Planets: Sam Sun",
  "description": "Inspired by the classic children’s books, The Mr Men by Roger Hargreaves and the gorgeously simple Meg and Mog book series, The Planets series aims to reach younger readers (4-7 years) and, through laughter and a huge dollop of cheeky humour, introduce them to our solar system and The Planets in our solar system.In this first book in the series, we meet Sam Sun - a bright, shiny star with funky pants, fabulous flip flops and warm sunny rays who is suffering from a bad case of solar wind. Find out what happens when his pants keep catching on fire…!This colourful and easy-to-read picture book is a fantastic introduction to the solar system for kids and, with a fact section about planets, comets, stars and suns at the end of the book, should leave your children both laughing and with a little more knowledge about the planets in space.Some lovely words from lovely people about Sam Sun:Sara Cox live on Radio One:“I didn’t realise the sun wore flip flops! It’s one you can read with your children. Brilliant, excellent!”The Children’s Book review:“MacDonald has come up with a unique way to introduce the solar system to young children. As I read, I laughed a lot and couldn't help but be reminded a little of the Mr. Men series I grew up reading (that's a good thing). The illustrations are bold and bright, enticing for any young reader.”Watch out for the rest of the series, coming soon!",
