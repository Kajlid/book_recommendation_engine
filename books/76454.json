A magical statue of a nymph by the name of Baggage, an ornamental pool decoration, has playfully endowed the Pebble swimming pool with the power to reverse the aging process. Typical Thorne Smith fun ensues when Pebble, his wife, and his mistress take a dip and take 20 years off their lives. One of the funniest scenes concerns a book dealer wanting to display his old and rare to Pebble's unresponsive mistress.The Ron Howard movie Cocoon borrowed the theme from the Glorious Pool with many of the same humourous results.The Glorious Pool, published in 1935 after Thorne Smith's death was completed by his wife, Celia. This is the last novel that Smith had a direct part in writing.",
