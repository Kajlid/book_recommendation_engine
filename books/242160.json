  "description": "Prince and the Purple Rain Era Studio Sessions pulls back the paisley curtain to reveal the untold story of Prince’s rise from cult favorite to the biggest rock star on the planet. His journey is meticulously documented through detailed accounts of his time secluded behind the doors of the recording studio as well as his days on tour. With unprecedented access to the musicians, singers, and studio engineers who knew Prince best, including members of The Revolution and The Time, Duane Tudahl weaves an intimate saga of an eccentric genius and the people and events who helped shape the groundbreaking music he created. From Sunset Sound Studios' daily recording logs and Warner Brothers' vault of information, Tudahl uncovers hidden truths about the origins of songs such as “Purple Rain,” “When Doves Cry,” and “Raspberry Beret” and also reveals never-before-published details about Prince's unreleased outtakes. This definitive chronicle of Prince's creative brilliance during 1983 and 1984 reveals a new experience of the Purple Rain album as an integral part of Prince's life and the lives of those closest to him.",
