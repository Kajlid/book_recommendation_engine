  "description": "Chris always knew where he was going and how to get there. He’d had the best friend in the world, been tops in his class. He’d known he was going to be a lawyer when he grew up and he planned to get married and have kids. Then came real life. When his wife walked out on him and the girls, Chris realized that he doesn’t know for sure why, but not knowing what’s important in his life might be the problem. He’s lost touch with his daughter, his friends and himself during his marriage.And then Bill--his former best friend in the world--reappears in his life and catches Chris at his most inept and lost. The two of them aren't sure they can become friends again but they have a long history together and, as they reconnect, it’s better--and hotter--than Chris had ever fantasized it could be. Then his wife returns and Chris has to reassess what he wants once more.",
