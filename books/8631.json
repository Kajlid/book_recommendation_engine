  "description": "A year ago, Magnius Zoleki struggled with a life of boredom and an unhappy marriage. These days, he'd take those problems in a heartbeat. After fleeing New England, Magnius and Amii arrive on Barnard a decaying trade outpost on the edge of oblivion. One misstep sends them hiding in places vagrants refuse to tread, all while they plot to rescue her father from the alien mothership. Her plan is nothing short of audaciousâ€”if they manage to stay under the radar long enough to execute it. To add to their troubles, the crisis with Xur reaches critical proportions. The Allied Confederacy refuses their demand for unconditional surrender, plunging them into a brand of warfare Astra has never experienced. Magnius and Amii try to stay neutral but get caught between the two sides and swept into the struggle. It's the beginning of a war that might kill everyone he holds most dear. The last place he wants to be is on the wrong side, and if that doesn't tear apart what remains of his sanity, Amii Martin will. The Reckoning is the second novel in the Astra saga, a story that follows in the epic tradition of Cyteen and Dune.",
