  "description": "My body’s made of iron. My muscles are sculpted by God himself.And my green eyes have been described as ‘lady magnets’ by the Vegas Tribune. The Trifecta sensation is only the dirtiest male revue show Vegas has ever seen. We’ve been blazing the stage for a while and have gained quite the fan base. Women travel from across the country just to catch a glimpse of us. I’ll let you in on a little secret...I hate every second of it. It’s just not me.I despise being viewed as a piece of meat.When my new neighbor, Emma moves in next door, I hate that she sees me the same way. But, when her and her daughter are in danger, a possessive need to protect her takes over. The more I get to know Emma, the more I realize she’s more like me than I realize. And I won’t let her past stand in the way of our future.",
