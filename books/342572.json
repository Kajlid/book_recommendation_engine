And so, in the noble tradition of resignation, he is heading back home to look after his niece and work on his stiff upper lip...But on the way he agrees to give a ride to a poor Spanish woman and her child.

There's certainly more to this single mother than meets the eye. But could she be Benedict's second chance at love? Only if they can see past their differences. And that will require delving into a complicated and painful past...",
