  "description": "All his life, Jonah’s been warned about wolves.  The last of a dying species, hiding amongst the humans, Jonah accepts his lonely life, knowing one day he’ll lose himself in the call of the sea. And then a pack of werewolves moves in next door. Wolves are dangerous, cunning, and vicious. He knows he has to chase them off before they discover the truth about what he is. But he hadn’t counted on Nate, their ruggedly handsome alpha. No one warned him wolves could be so… captivating.  As the lone alpha left, he’s their only chance of survival.  After an attack leaves his pack on the run, it’s up to Nate to lead them to safety. He brings them to the one place they won’t be followed, a place wolves don’t dare go. At first, the Cove seems like a haven and stories of monsters lurking in the shadows sound far-fetched. Jonah, the local vet, and their new neighbor, is just the sort of distraction Nate needs. When danger closes in on all sides, Nate must do what he can to keep his pack, and his new favorite human, safe from harm. But is Jonah all he appears to be?  The truth will tear them apart.  When Nate turns up at his door with an injured wolf cub in his arms, Jonah doesn't have the heart to turn him away. He knows he's playing with fire, letting himself be drawn further into the shifter's dangerous world, risking discovery with every word, every kiss. Self-preservation be damned.  Forbidden is a novel-length read, featuring a flirtatious wolf, a lonely siren, an evil alpha, a loyal dog, mpreg (kind of), and scenes not suitable for readers under the age of eighteen.",
