  "title": "Beyond Feminism and Islamism: Gender and Equality in North Africa",
  "description": "Are women in North Africa and the Middle East \"\"feminist?\"\" Or is being a Muslim incompatible with feminism? Is there such a thing as \"\"Islamic feminism?\"\" Through interviews with Moroccan activists and jurists – both male and female – and by situating these interviews within their socio-political and economic contexts, Doris Gray addresses these questions. By doing so, she attempts to move beyond the simple bifurcation of \"\"feminist\"\" and \"\"Islamist\"\" to look at the many facets of internal gender discourse within one Muslim country, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the discussion on women's rights in the Muslim world in general. The status and the role of women is one of the most hotly debated topics throughout the Middle East and North Africa, and this is particularly visible through this discussion of what it means to engage with and promote feminist thought and actions in the region.",
