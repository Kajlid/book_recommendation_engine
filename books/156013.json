  "description": "\"I don't come across books like Armand Rosamilia's CHELSEA AVENUE enough. Infused with the dreamlike quality of memory, Rosamilia fulfills the full measure of the promise I first saw in his DYING DAYS series. Beautifully dark, this book held me entranced.\"â€”Joe McKinney, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of DOG DAYS and PLAGUE OF THE UNDEADOn July 8th 1987, in Long Branch, New Jersey, The Haunted House Pier and Murphy's Law club fires destroyed not only local landmarks, but everything Manny Santiago found dear. And it isn't over. The entity responsible for killing Manny's family and wreaking devastation in the small seaside community has reappeared. Again. As it has every year since. And is growing in power.  Every July 8th it returns, as survivors of the fires, including Manny, are mysteriously led back to the now-vacant seaside lot on Chelsea Avenue, where the entity intends to finish what it started in 1987 once and for all.",
