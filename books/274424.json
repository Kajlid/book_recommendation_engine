  "description": "Lif and Lifthrasir Book 1: Asgardian Tales Power has a price. No Half Bloods know this better than the Lifs and Lifthrasirs, possessing the power of Yggdrasil itself, able to manipulate the dimensions of Life and Death throughout all 9 Realms. The price? These Heroes outlive all Mortals, their only choice for happiness is to curse their beloved with a \"Blessed Apple\" derived from the famed immortal apples Iduna guards, trapping their loved ones in a land where they are never able to leave while the Heroes barely age. As if that isn't cruel enough, Odin revealed a terrible Prophecy - Ragnarok, the final battle of all Mortal, Ethereal and Incorporeal beings where the Cycle of Immortality itself will end, killing beings who have never died with a Lif and Lifthrasir playing pivotal roles in those events. The Patrons of Old established the Accords - a treaty setting terms for all future Lifs and Lifthrasirs. Forced to train as Warriors and sacrifice their freedom, they serve under the Guardians, the council of members from all 9 Realms who designate missions so that their powers are shared equally, an agreement that has kept the peace for almost a million years but, as Odin himself revealed, all things come to an end. Nothing spells disaster like the Blazing Spear of Blood, created by Ymir from the root of Yggdrasil connected to Hel, capable of devouring anything with its cursed flames. Stolen by Xerxes the Red King, it has been stored in Ubhal Ã’ir under the Lifs for millions of years, much to the chagrin of the Jotuns who now act as if it never existed. But it isn't forgotten. Someone is desperate to steal it and Comharrachadh Beatha is the perfect opportunity as most of the Guardians are on vacation enjoying the Tournament where the Realms best Warriors come together on peaceful terms to battle each other. Treachery runs thick behind the celebrations as evil looks for an opportunity to rule again. If you love mystery and suspense, this book will definitely satisfy a long afternoon reading on the couch.
