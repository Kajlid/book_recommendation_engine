The sleepy town is suddenly transformed into Cupid’s playground, complete with chocolate fountains, bicycle’s built for two, and a romantic breakfast buffet.Of course, no one loves a single’s buffet quite like a pack of vampires. Only, they’re not there for the dark-roast coffee and homemade sticky buns.When eligible bachelors start dropping like wilted rose petals, Holly springs into action. She’s quickly thrown into a tangled web of secret romances, unrequited love, and more than one blood-thirsty vamp.In short, it’s a bad time to get an eviction notice.",
