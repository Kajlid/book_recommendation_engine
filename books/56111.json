While Garrison is recovering from his injuries, Schroeder makes him an offer the young man cannot refuse—refuge at Schroeder’s luxurious mountain retreat and rehabilitation from the best doctors who can treat Garrison’s blindness, and, if not cure him, at least teach him a new way of life.But Thomas Schroeder has a secret. He is dying and determined not to lose his life. The doctors tell him his body cannot be saved. But about his mind? Garrison’s healthy young body would make an excellent replacement for Schroeder’s failing corpus, if the machines to perform the operation can be perfected in time.Garrison has secrets of his own. Since the bombing that caused a loss of his sight, Garrison has become aware of new abilities slowly developing in his mind: mental powers he is beginning to master; strengths Schroeder cannot expect.Richard Garrison and Thomas Schroeder, two strong-willed men locked in battle for the greatest prize—life itself.",
