  "description": "Torn apart by tragedy, Lorelei has kept Xander at arm's length, focusing on her career and gifts, rather than rekindling their love. But now that she's back in Salem, she can't avoid him and finds herself slowly softening toward the man she's loved all of her life. However, the witch hunter they've been fighting still hasn't been vanquished. Between that and breaking the curse of the Blood Moon, now is not the best time for her to give the sexy Xander another try. Despite Lora pushing him away, Xander has never stopped loving her. But now that the stakes are higher with evil threatening them more than ever, he is done giving her time and space. With the curse that Jonas put into place long ago creating havoc with the innocent residents of Salem, the core six, their coven, and the witches from Hallows End need to work together to overcome true wickedness. Will Xander and Lora find themselves once again amidst these stormy seas and their recent separation? Or will evil reign, throwing the core six, Salem and Hallows End into unimaginable peril?",
