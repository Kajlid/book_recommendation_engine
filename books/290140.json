I want to return to the peace of the grave so I can free myself from this terrible undead life but the hunger won’t allow it. There’s only one solution to my pain-riddled It quiets the hunger and restores my body to a more agile and stronger zombie. The more I eat, the better I get. I have no control over the hunger when it decides to make me feed. What a way to unlive?",
