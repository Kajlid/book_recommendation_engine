  "title": "Be A Man: The Plaid Manifesto",
  "description": "America. The land of opportunity. The birthplace of the Ford truck, Lincoln, Washington, Edison, Babe Ruth and strip malls. We are the land of innovators and pioneers. America has gone from pioneer to pansy. When did we become a douche bag boot camp? What the hell happened? No more! The gauntlet has been thrown down. Be A Man! Discover your inner carnivore and eat a juicy steak straight off the fire. Climb a freakâ€™n mountain. Drive a truck, environment be damned! Enter the wild with only a bow and arrow plus your trusty pocket knife. Understand the importance of giving your progeny a name of simplicity and power. Being a Man also incurs the responsibility of knowing what not to do as a man. Men do not pick out drapes. Men do not play the flute. Nor do men buy potpourri, shop together, or wear pajamas outside the house if at all. Above all else know that plaid is the manliest pattern in fashion. Plaid is not even fashion. It is the manifestation of order in an otherwise chaotic world that needs order. Pick up Be A The Plaid Manifesto to fully appreciate what it means to Be A Man! Your inner pioneer is waiting.",
