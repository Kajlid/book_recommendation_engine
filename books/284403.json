  "title": "It's Your Camino: One Couple's 500-mile Pilgrimage across Spain",
  "description": "The Camino de Santiago is both quest and pilgrimage, goal and process. It is not a journey for the faint of heart or the soft of foot. People embark on the five-hundred mile, thirty-one day trek from the Pyrenees Mountains in France to the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela in Spain for all sorts of reasons--religious, spiritual, physical, and personal. For author Kenneth R. Strange Jr. and his wife, Aurora, walking the Camino is about adventure and a lifelong love of Spain, both of which shine through in \"It's Your Camino.\"\"Reliving their journey in \"It's Your Camino\" is an inspiration, a joy and a must read!\" -- Martin Sheen, actor in the movie \"The Way.\"",
