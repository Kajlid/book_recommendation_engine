  "description": "**FEMINIST FICTION TO FRIGHTEN THE PATRIARCHY!**Behind every successful man is a strong woman... but in these stories, she might be about to plant a knife in his spine. The characters in this anthology are fed up - tired of being held back, held down, held accountable - by the misogyny of the system. They're ready to resist by biting back in their own individual ways, be it through magic, murder, technology, teeth, pitfalls and even... potlucks. Join sixteen writers as they explore feminism in fantasy, science-fiction, fractured fairy-tales, historical settings, and the all-too-familiar chauvinist contemporary world.(While most of the content is YA appropriate, please note the editors recommend this anthology for 16+.)Authors:Liz ColeyShannon GreenElaine GriffinLindsey KlingeleKamerhe LaneJenna LehneDemitria LunettaEmilee MartellTracie MartinCori McCarthyKyrie McCauleyMindy McGinnisKate Karyus QuinnMelody SimpsonAmanda Sun",
