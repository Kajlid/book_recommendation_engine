  "description": "Violet already has the weight of the world on her shoulders, but a new enemy rises to test her. This time, it isn’t a demon or one of the creatures from hell who will get in her way. Instead, it is a challenger for Zach's affections. Thanks to her rival, she will encounter someone who she hoped she’d never see again. At the mercy of an enemy who she’d humiliated so badly in the past, not even her guardian angel will be able to save her this time. She’ll have to find a way out of her newest predicament herself. Determined to discover where the stolen angels’ grace has been taken, Violet will learn some painful truths that will haunt her. She will also discover that she has some unexpected allies when she returns to hell. The longer she spends in the underworld, the more danger she faces. Her transformation after being attacked by the Wraith Warrior is worsening by the day. She is in a race that will either see her dead, or turn into something from her worst nightmares.",
