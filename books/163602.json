  "description": "She-wolf.\nRilen could smell her; could virtually taste her on the back of his tongue.He almost didn't want to turn around and look. What if he was wrong? He'd waited two hundred years for this. Desperately searching, about to give up...believing he was just not destined to ever find her.And yet here, stuck outside on this dark, rainy night, her scent wafted over him like a fading song in a dream. How could it be that here of all places and tonight of all nights, he may finally have reached the end of his achingly long search?",
