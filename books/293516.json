He just doesn't know he has a daughter.He didn't know I was pregnant when he left our small town. Neither did I.But it doesn't change the fact that he's a prick.

His giant hands holding her small ones.The way he smiled at her like only a father could.My heart is broken, but there's room for him in it. Maybe he'll stay once he knows the truth?Maybe he will love both of us...",
