  "description": "The last two entries into the Sons of Ares had Fitchner on his heels. In the first, he was driven by love and desperation to save his wife Brynn before her execution at the hands of the Board of Quality Control. He failed, but rescued his child. In the second entry, Fitchner went head to head with both of his early allies--Arturius and, in a way, Quicksilver. His wrath left Arturius dead and setback Quicksilver's dream of expanding exploration and human habitation to other stars. In Forbidden Song, Ares may not always be in control. But he has a plan, and it's a doozy.FORBIDDEN SONG is one part Ocean's 11, one part Les Mis√©rables, and sets the fuse for the Rising that Darrow will inherit.",
