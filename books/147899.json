Dr. Seuss adds his signature spin to the age-old dilemma of indecisiveness in his rhyming picture-book classic 'Hunches in Bunches'.Go outside, play video games, eat a pizza, do homework? Whether you have a “four-way hunch,” a “nowhere hunch,” or an “up hunch,” Dr. Seuss and his unmistakable one-of-a-kind advice will ensure that readers of all ages won’t get “ga-fluppted.”\nDr. Seuss\n and his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, have been delighting young children and helping them learn to read for over fifty years.
