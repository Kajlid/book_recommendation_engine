  "title": "Dead Are Alive",
  "description": "Following a church robbery and the murder of reverend Hopkins' wife, Gwen, bounty hunter Fred Douglas tries to bring justice to the corrupt town of Hazel by assassinating Gwen's murderer, Sheriff Wellman. As Fred awaits his execution after a failed attempt on the sheriff, an experimental antivenom reanimates two children into the unmercifully ravenous walking dead. Chaos erupts as the children begin a bloody feeding frenzy. The virus is spread with every bite and before long their victims rise from the bloody earth to join a swelling horde. In this western town, there's no longer a choice of bringing down criminals dead or alive. Because this time, the dead are alive! Also includes bonus horror western short story, \"The Heist\" by Jason Thacker. \"Imagine riding shotgun with the Wild Bunch on a nightmare ride through zombie country and you've got a pretty good idea of the terror Jason Thacker has cooked up in Dead Are Alive. Thacker's latest left me breathless and begging for more. Trust me, not since Joe R. Lansdale's Dead in the West has the Old West been this scary!\" -Joe McKinney, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of Flesh Eaters and Dead City \"Dead Are Alive is a zombie western with teeth. It's not a book you'll easily put down and you'll find yourself telling your friends about it long after the last page is turned.\" -Eric S. Brown, Author of the Bigfoot War series \"Dead Are Alive has everything the reader could hope for from a true-to-form zombie western. One of the highlights in this book is the fact that there is an honest-to-goodness reason/explanation for the dead rising. Kudos to Mr. Thacker for taking off the gloves and not being afraid to creep out his readers. The first actual zombie scene will haunt you long after you've read the final page.\" -TW Brown, Author of Dead: The Ugly Beginning and Zomblog",
