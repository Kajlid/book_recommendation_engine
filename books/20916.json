  "description": "”Liszt’s Dante Symphony\" is an enigmatic tale of murder and covert spy rings amid the turbulent rise of Bismarck’s Prussia, which leads to Hitler’s infernal Third Reich.Following the life of Angelo Di Purezza Jr., whose father was a student and (unbeknownst to him) fellow spy of Liszt’s, the reader is taken on a journey of suspense and intrigue that cascades over two generations. During those years Europe would experience numerous revolutions and witness two World Wars, thus emulating the horrors foretold in Dante’s “Inferno” and Liszt’s symphony, as Hitler’s poison gas and human incinerators, coupled with a fiery barrage of weapons, turned the world into a Hellish cauldron of death and destruction. A stellar cast of historical characters fill the pages, including Franz Liszt, Napoleon III, Pope Pius IX, Rossini, Saint-Saëns, Gustave Dore, Albert Einstein, a string of Nazi commanders, and their diabolical leader, Adolf Hitler. DiSilvio’s mastery of history and the arts shines, making this tale an exciting amalgamation of politics, religion, classical music, and the visual arts, coupled with secret codes, murder, suspense, sacrifices, and ample doses of wit, humor and even romance.",
