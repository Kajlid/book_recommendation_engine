  "title": "Tammorack: The Chronicle Scrolls",
  "description": "For ten thousand years the world has descended into a sickening madness, even darker and more dangerous than when Ishbun walked the earth. Civilizations have crumbled into chaos, new creatures prowl the night and the heavens are incomplete. The Gods that remain feud and struggle for dominion over the festering mortal realm. Who can bring balance and harmony back to the world? None… except perhaps the ten ‘heroes’ that fought against The Beast of Mortilas so long ago? Surely it would be foolish to think that they could do anything but create more disaster? But there is no one else to turn too. Humanity is tearing itself apart and this is the final gambit… a last resort. Continue on the adventures as our group of misfits, with questionable morals and bitter differences, try to recover the Tammorack; the key to bringing the world back from the edge of a dark abyss. As they battle another foe that holds the past, present and future in their hands and draws to them characters from the dawn of time. Can they still work together, or have they become to toxic to find common ground? Will they add to the chaos that is swallowing the world or heal its wounds? All hangs in the balance once more and only the Tammorack can restore order. Pray they are good enough.",
