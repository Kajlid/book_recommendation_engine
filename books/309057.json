  "description": "She was everything he never knew he needed.He was everything she avoided.ðŸ’—Itâ€™s not the first time Iâ€™ve been called a stalker.I canâ€™t blame Andrew Christiansen for thinking I am since we keep crossing paths, especially when I pop up in the most unexpected of placesâ€”his office.Weâ€™re opposites in every way. Not the kind that attract.Iâ€™ve been called a ray of sunshine. Heâ€™s been called a grumpy workaholic that needs an attitude adjustment. By me.Somehow, we become friends, the teasing, flirting, and kissing kind. But this thing blooming between us threatens to turn this relationship from friends-to-lovers into a full-blown office romance.Thatâ€™s the least of my worries because one or two, little, okay big, secrets Iâ€™ve been keeping may turn him from the one I want into the one I canâ€™t have.",
