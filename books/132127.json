I’m not sexy, I’m not attractive and I’m no fun. I’m plain and boring with no charm at all. The only thing good about me is probably my brain, which everyone also finds boring. But I must ask you this… Mr. Zachary Anderson, can I be your girlfriend?\"How long can you fake being in love before it turns into the real thing? Tori and Zach are about to find out.",
