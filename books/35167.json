Kylie, Gobswistle and Etain are plunged into battle once again, and the young Changeling must come to terms with her new identity, or more than just she will pay the price. Eigyr brings the scroll before the king. It seems the scroll contains Jason's final visions of the invasion of Kilneuair. But is the scroll from Jason, or is it a ploy of Jason's kidnappers to trick the townsfolk? The struggle for the answer drives a rift between King and Druid, and Myrrdin falls from grace.

As Alban Eiler draws ever closer, the confrontations between townsfolk and Vikings and between the children of prophecy and Huddour finally arrive. And what has become of the Medb?",
