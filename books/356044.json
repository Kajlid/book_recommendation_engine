  "description": "Dancia Lewis has a secret whenever she sees someone threaten a person she cares about, it's a disaster. Cars skid. Structures collapse. Usually someone gets hurt. So Dancia does all she can to avoid getting close to anyone, hoping to suppress her powers and stay under the radar. But when recruiters from the prestigious Delcroix Academy offer her a scholarship, she accepts. After all, it's a school for diplomats' kids and prodigies, not B students with uncontrollable telekinetic tendencies. Or is it?This captivating debut, the first in a series, puts a paranormal twist on private school.",
