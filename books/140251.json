  "title": "Eden and Afterward: A Mockingbird Guide to Genesis",
  "description": "The Bible is as strange as it is surprising. Even its most well-known stories can catch us off guard, revealing things about God and about ourselves that we had not seen before. Nowhere is this more true than with the book of Genesis. Its iconic accounts of shepherds and nomads, apple-eaters and ark-builders, sharpen our view of human life and the God who works in the midst of it. With empathy and imagination, \"Eden and Afterward\" traces the first notes of the song of grace which plays throughout the entire Bible.",
