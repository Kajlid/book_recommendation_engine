  "description": "Caresses Soft as Sandpaper - subtitled \"A Collection of Amorous Ramblings and Rotted Erotica\" - is the first book of Catalyst's writings ever published. While some sources reference the chapbook as \"[being] reproduced in the first section of [his book] Cottonmouth Kisses,\" the claim is not entirely correct. As a matter of fact, of the 31 poems, two pen and ink illustrations and one photograph by Catalyst that appear in Caresses Soft as Sandpaper, only five poems - \"Actions Speak,\" \"Scorch,\" \"Those Final Moments,\" \"Anything,\" and \"Yeah, Sure\" - were included in Cottonmouth Kisses. Instead, Caresses Soft as Sandpaper is one of three sections in Cottonmouth Kisses. Conversely, that section contains three poems and a short story that were not - and are not - among the compendium known as Caresses Soft as Sandpaper.",
