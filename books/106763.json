  "title": "Regret's Shadow",
  "description": "Valia is a fantastic and dangerous world, filled with monsters, mutants, and undead sorcerers. Bathed in the rays of a strange star, it is at once alien and eerily familiar. Dramus Hiltsman is a lowly scribe with a powerful gift; the ability to understand any text, any symbol. For years he’s lived quietly among the dusty halls of the Temple of the Sacred Scroll, translating texts and dodging the cruel headmaster, longing for a life outside the cold stone walls. A seemingly random event will send him out into the wider world, his way shadowed by an ancient evil. He will cross paths with vile nobles, relentless agents of the king and unlikely heroes. The veil over humanity's hidden past will lift and Dramus will be faced with a terrible choice - is his the hand that brings on the darkness or is his the only one that can stop it? Regret’s Shadow is the first volume in the Sins of Earth Trilogy, a science-fantasy series in which sinister forces seek to drag the mistakes of the past kicking and screaming into the present - to the doom of mankind!",
