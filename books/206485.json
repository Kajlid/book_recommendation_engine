  "description": "Blood on the Floor. An Undead Adventure.  Twelve days ago a deadly infection spread across the world. Populations have been destroyed. Law and order are gone. Life, as it was known, has ceased. The infected are now the strongest species and survival has become brutal. Heather has survived by hiding. Hiding is her thing. People are bad. What others do to survive is no concern of hers. On a mission for supplies, she makes a decision that not only places her in danger but one that will change everything she ever knew - or believed in...  Set against the backdrop of The Undead - the UK's best-selling zombie horror post-apocalyptic series that is a cult smash-hit with over 1500 top reviews. Blood on the Floor is the first Undead standalone adventure by RR Haywood.  *This ebook version includes The Undead Day One.",
