  "description": "My name is Blake. My dad was a member of the Charcoal Cobras, a gang well known in the south, specifically Florida. As his son, I am a legacy. Only, my dad got out, he escaped the fate that the CCs presented so I could live a normal life. When I was eighteen, the CCs found us. They killed my parents and threatened me with the life of my girlfriend, the love of my life, so I'd stay and work for them to pay off my father's debts. My name is Anna. The love of my life was murdered during our senior year along with the rest of his family, or so I thought. The past eight years I've been contract killing for a guy named Theo and my partner Adam to get closure after the tragedy. I never thought that one of the sick men I'd be assigned to kill would turn out to be my high school sweetheart, the man I still hold deep feelings for, even after almost a decade. I never thought the innocent, sweet, religious Blake Randal would turn out to be the infamous murderer and gang member Blake Scott. What happens when years, tragedy, pain, and sin separate two people madly in love? Does love prevail, or do their immense differences ultimately tear them apart?Blake is a bad boy with an unforgettable past and fierce addictions. He's damaged. Anna is a woman who only wants to rid the world of the sick bastards who feed off the innocent. She's lost.After all of the years and all of the pain, after all of the time and all of the change, can two old teen lovers, now in their mid-twenties, really fall in love all over again?",
