  "description": "It took some heavy convincing, a few white lies, and the death of her leader to pull her away from that village, but finally, Kate is with me. I have never felt such relief. I will keep her safe. I will protect her with my last breath if I have to. I won't let my fears get in my way. And in time, I will tell her the whole truth. About me. About Eden. Even if she hates me afterwards . . .   The Village is a mere memory. The world stands before Kate a wide-open door to the unknown. It is her life now. And her greatest fear.  Her only comfort is Ian with his promises of a new life in Eden. A refuge abundantly full of every good thing. A sanctuary of hope. A place of wonder. A paradise where the Archer doesn't exist, and Fate can't reach her. Together with the other boys from Eden, they embark on a harsh journey full of harrowing surprises and heart-wrenching secrets that forces them to prove their devotion to one another time and again.  But the boys of Eden? Just who are they with their unnatural abilities and dark secrets? Will entrusting her life–her heart–to one of them place her in graver danger than ever before?  Will Eden finally be enough? Or will her heart continue to ache for something greater?",
