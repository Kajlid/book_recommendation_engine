  "description": "Come back to Thunder Point! From the #1 \nNew York Times\n bestselling author of the Virgin River series, book 7 in her beloved Thunder Point novels, where second chances can be complicated, but finding love might be simple… Grace Dillon was a champion figure skater until she moved to Thunder Point, Oregon, to escape the ruthless world of fame and competition. Though she’s proud of the quiet, self-sufficient life she’s created running a successful flower shop, she knows something is missing. Her life could use a little excitement. In a community where there are few eligible singles, high school teacher Troy Headly appoints himself Grace’s fun coach. When he suggests a little companionship with no strings attached, Grace is eager to take him up on his offer, and the two enjoy…getting to know each other. But things get complicated when Grace’s past catches up with her, and she knows that’s not what Troy signed up for. Faced with losing her, Troy realizes Grace is more than just a friend with benefits. He’s determined to help her fight for the life she always wished for but never believed she could have—and maybe they can find real love along the way.First published in 2015",
