  "description": "After a scandal of Olympic proportions, Vince Dawson has lost his job as a diving coach and is on a downhill slide. So when he sees Austin Brody at a local pool, diving like a trained athlete, he thinks he's found his ticket back to the big leagues. Austin is the least likely man to go to diving meets. He dives for beer, smokes, and works double shifts as a welder. He thinks Vince might be a little crazy, wanting him to try diving competitively, but he's willing to give it a shot. What Austin isn't willing to do is let Vince rule him, and he argues about everything from waxing to wearing Speedos. Used to young, up-and-coming athletes who fold under pressure from their coach, Vince finds Austin's independence baffling; and hot. The two find common ground, gradually working toward being more than just friends, but can they compete? The world of a professional athlete takes money, time, and hard work. Austin and Vince are both willing to fight for what they want, but will they be able to work their way up the ladder to the kind of elite competition it will take to get Austin noticed?",
