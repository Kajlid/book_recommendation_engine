  "description": "A woman with a dark past...Forced into hiding after her NSA-sanctioned task force lands on a terrorist cell’s hit list, cryptologist Zahra Gill must rely on the skill and experience of her ex-Special Ops Titanium Security teammates to keep her safe—including former Force Recon Marine Sean Dunphy. The impossibly sexy man has the unnerving ability to shatter her concentration by simply walking into the same room. Even though she’s sworn to keep him at a distance, his charm and protectiveness weaken her resistance. Drawn to his strength and magnetic sensuality, she finally gives in to the passion she’s denied herself for so long...even though she knows she might lose her heart in the process.The man strong enough to win her trust...Sean’s had his eye on the guarded, proud analyst from the first day they met. He knows she’s hiding something from him, but nothing could have prepared him for the shocking truth of her past. When a targeted attack brutally exposes Zahra’s dark secrets, Sean will do everything in his power to protect the woman he’s fallen for. Unfortunately the cell hunting them has powerful connections and their enemy is closer than they ever imagined.",
