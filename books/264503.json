  "description": "Morgan Downs’ life is unexceptional. She’s stuck in an abusive loveless marriage and often made to feel inferior by her parents because of her speech impediment. Although as bad as her life is, she never expected to be kidnapped from her home and taken to a private military base to become a test rat for a science experiment. But things change when Morgan meets Alpha. She should be afraid, he isn’t quite human after all. Alpha is a genetically enhanced super soldier, and Morgan has been captured to bear his offspring. Yet, Morgan finds that Alpha isn’t the real monster behind those confined walls. They are both captives of the insane scientist, Dr. Ryder Strong. This book contains some graphic scenes of violent acts. Readers please be advised.",
