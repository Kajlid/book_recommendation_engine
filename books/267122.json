  "title": "Every Girl Tells a Story: A Celebration of Girls Speaking Their Minds",
  "description": "Every girl tells a story. Every girl wants to be heard. Listen to these stories, look into these pictures, and be dazzled by American \"If your heart's in it, you'll keep going. Girls can do anything. Girls rule.\" \"The best thing my parents have done for me is to show me that it's okay to be myself.\" \"I'd like to open a clinic for women and children. That has always been my dream.\" Working in close collaboration with Girl Scouts of the USA, documentary photographer Carolyn Jones has captured in words and pictures a lasting portrait of eighty-five American girls -- the girls who are our future. As First Lady Laura Bush says in her foreword, \"My hope for every girl, everywhere, is that she, too, will find her voice and achieve her dreams.\" This is a book for women of all ages, who will recognize the girls they once were and still can be. It is a book for fathers and mothers, who hear -- but may not always listen to -- what their daughters are saying. But most of all it is a book for girls, who will find themselves reflected in this joyous celebration of their complexity, depth, honesty, and glorious, soaring optimism.",
