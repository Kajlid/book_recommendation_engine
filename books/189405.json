  "title": "Jesus and His People: Israel",
  "description": "This first volume of a series of three introduces the reader to a new - or rather very old - way of approaching the Holy Bible. By recognizing the New Testament to be the repetition of the most fundamental Old Testament history, one is able to firmly and clearly describe and understand the message and mission of Jesus of Nazareth. This way, one is able to see the classic Catholic-Protestant controversy with new - or rather very old - eyes.Jesus and His People is Schiffer's first book, published as a trilogy. It attempts to include all Christian churches and traditions within a single framework, while advocating a Christian unity. He writes from the conviction that choosing Jesus Christ is the only divine option for mankind and that following Him means embracing the ancient faith of the early Church.Pierre Schiffer (b. 1976) is a Dutch Christian theologian. He received his bachelor and master degrees from the Catholic University of Louvain (Belgium), specializing in fundamental theology and Biblical exegesis. The person of Jesus and the Judaic-Christian history of salvation, especially as laid out in Holy Scripture, serve as the foundation and inspiration for his writings.This is the fully revised version (September 2015) of the original text of July 2014.",
