  "description": "Princesses are not exactly known for having a great sense of humour. Especially if they've been waiting patiently up in a tower for their knight in shining armour to rescue them ... only to find the result completely unacceptable.  Knights are not exactly known for delicacy and tact. Especially when they've risked life and limb (well, nearly) to rescue fair maidens ... who turn out to be rather less than grateful.  Three-headed beasts, thorny vines, clanking armour and very bad singing are only the beginning of a somewhat odd and wholly untraditional fairytale.  You may have heard it before ... but you've never heard it like this!",
