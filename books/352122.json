  "title": "A Sword for the Immerland King",
  "description": "Set in the world of Tessalindria with an Arthurian milieu to keep it familiar, this first in a projected several-volume series revolves around the classic struggle between good and evil. Princess Vrengnia embarks on a spiritual journey and is aided by a wise blacksmith and his son. Her father is confliced by his desire to be a good king and father, and his desire for revenge. It becomes quickly apparent that the blacksmith is a deeply spiritual and prophetic man who is in constant communion with MahEladra, the sovereign spirit of Tessalindria. The first in the Portals of Tessalindria series, this book is especially for those who enjoy fantasy and for those who don't particularly. The characterizations and spiritual insight elevate it from fantasy to visionary fiction.",
