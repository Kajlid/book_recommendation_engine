  "description": "One day KJ Dawn's life was at its normal best and while not everything was going her way, the ones she loved were within reach to hug, send messages to, or talk with by phone. But a change was coming, and it was charging toward KJ like a runaway locomotive with full steam ahead. And when she went to bed the night of January 25, 2008, there was no way she could've known how that inevitable collision would change her life forever. KJ's raw and unchartered journey would hit her head-on when she woke up the next morning, and her first step into unknown territory would begin when she opened her front door. \"My Sister's Departure,\" written by KJ Dawn, is a work of non-fiction that tells the story of how the tragic and untimely death of one young woman affected the lives of her family and friends. No, it's not about the all encompassing average family who shares holidays and plays well together, and Katie's death reunites them in a sometimes violent reunion that you won't believe unless you read it for yourself.From The Editor of \"My Sister's Departure\"2nd Edition",
