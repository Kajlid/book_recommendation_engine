The narrative dwells in the past as well as in the present era with RSS, Modi ( Pradhanmantri) among others. The best part of the book is obviously the connecting dots between history and the present socio-political ethos of India. Sweta deserves an applause for providing such a treat to the readers. Shaheed- E - Azam is also there, omg this particular phase about him and that too Kakori ( Bismil ka Sandesh)well, too good to stay away from such impeccable delight.Do not miss the codes, do not miss the love story and more overlook for the truth.Mitron, get the book.\"-- Debraj Moulick, active blogger, official book reviewer and film reviewerA blockbuster thriller!",
