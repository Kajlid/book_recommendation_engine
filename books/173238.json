  "title": "Korea: A Walk Through the Land of Miracles",
  "description": "In the late 1980s,  New York Times  bestselling author Simon Winchester set out on foot to discover the Republic of Korea - from its southern tip to the North Korean border - in order to set the record straight about this enigmatic and elusive land. Fascinating for its vivid presentation of historical and geographic detail, Korea is that rare book that actually defines a nation and its people. Winchester's gift for capturing engaging characters in true, compelling stories provides us with a treasury of enchanting and informed insight on the culture, language, history, and politics of this little-known corner of Asia. With a new introduction by the author,  Korea  is a beautiful journey through a mysterious country and a memorable addition to the many adventures of  Simon Winchester .",
