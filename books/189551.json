When he stumbles upon a time-travelling wormhole in his closet, Karl and his best friend, Wayne, develop a side business selling access to people who want to travel back in time to listen to their favorite bands. It s a pretty ingenious plan, until Karl, intending to send Wayne to 1980, transports him back to AD 980 instead. Though Wayne sends texts extolling the quality of life in tenth-century Mannahatta, Karl is distraught that he can t bring his friend back.Enter brilliant, prickly, overweight astrophysicist Lena Geduldig.

Unable to resist meddling with the past, Karl and Lena bounce around time. When Lena ultimately prevents her own long-ago rape, she alters the course of her life and threatens her future with Karl.A high-spirited and engaging novel, \"Every Anxious Wave\" plays ball with the big questions of where we would go and who we would become if we could rewrite our pasts, as well as how to hold on to love across time.",
