  "title": "Forever",
  "description": "Riley & Kyle have been best friends since they were nine-years-old. To them, it doesn't matter that Riley is a girl and Kyle is a boy, or that Kyle's parents make a lot more money than Riley's, or even that they live an hour away from each other. All that matters is that they've found a friend in each other unlike anyone else, and that they share a bond that is uniquely their own. As Riley and Kyle grow up, however, they learn that life isn't always as simple and as easy as they once thought, and that the lines between friendship, love and hate aren't always so easy to define. Forever is a story about learning to stand alone as well as trust in others. It is a story about growing up, what it means to love and lose, and how to heal. Not just a coming of age story, romance, drama, or inspirational fiction, Forever is, at its core, a story about two people trying to hold onto each other, despite everything life throws at them.",
