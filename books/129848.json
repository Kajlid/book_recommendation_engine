  "description": "Hercules is not as interested in “playing nice” as he is in playing strong! But when one feat of strength destroys his little sister’s 12-piece tower, he must use his powers for good to restore the tower and seek her forgiveness. She forgives him indeed, and then shows her own strength by gleefully knocking down the stacked blocks herself! Joan Holub’s expertly focused text pairs perfectly with Leslie Patricelli’s famously humorous illustrations. Includes a summary of the original Hercules’s Twelve Labors myth at the end.Also available in the Mini Myths Don't Get Lost, Odysseus and Good Job, Athena!Praise for Play Nice, Hercules!\"These adorable volumes feature the title characters learning important life lessons with slight allusions to their Greek mythology counterparts.\"-- School Library Journal",
