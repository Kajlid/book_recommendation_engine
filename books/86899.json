  "description": "This book is no longer available. Now contained in Caught Up in Us.Seventeen-year-old Kat Harper has always dreamed of silver-screen kisses, the kind of love you see in the movies. That’s exactly what she gets the summer before college when she meets her brother’s best friend Bryan. He’s five years older, but that doesn’t stop them from falling into a summer romance so perfect it could have been scripted by Hollywood. They kiss in the back row of the movie theater, on the beach at night, even on the quiet streets of her hometown when no one’s looking. Surely, he’s falling as hard for her as she is for him, right? But Bryan breaks her heart and leaves with barely an explanation, forcing Kat to move on from her first love... until five years later, when he walks back into her life. Now she has to face the truth that she's never gotten over him. Is it possible he hasn’t stopped thinking about her too?",
