  "description": "The Great Pantomeus has spent five hundred years brewing up the perfect revenge. What Matthew Nightingale doesn't know, is that he's part of the plan...A crazed, near-immortal alchemist locked away in an underground chamber is the last thing Matthew expects to find on a school trip to the British Museum. But the hasty pact he makes with the terrifying stranger completely backfires when Pantomeus breaks free and Matthew is plunged headlong into a mind-boggling world of secret societies, alchemy, and revenge.Caught in the middle of a centuries-old feud between ageless Masters, Matthew now has only one way to escape Pantomeus’ murderous plans – join the secret Order of the Crucible of the Crimson Lion and become an alchemist himself. Only, it isn't gold that Matthew makes in the Order, but friends, and soon he is whizzing through portals, discovering incredible inventions and powerful arcana while the Science of the Impossible plunges him into a mesmerizing world. But the ancient Order has secrets of its own, and when Matthews discovers a barefoot girl of a mysterious race kept hidden away in a dusty old mansion, and the link between the legend of the Knight-Sorcerer and Pantomeus, he knows no one is safe. Something terrible is going on in the Order, and it's up to him to find the truth. But can he save his new friends and stop Pantomeus in time before he loses everything he holds dear?",
