  "description": "I build things.But nothing prepared me for the wreckage Ivy Bright left behind.She was a firecracker.Untamed.Irresistible.A temptation I never saw coming.By the time I learned the truth—who she really was, how young she was—it was too late. I’d already fallen. And when she walked away, she took more than just her secrets. She took me.Losing her nearly destroyed me.Years later, she’s back.Stronger. Bolder.Still just as tempting.But the past doesn’t stay buried.And when the truth finally comes to light, we’ll have to decide—was what we had just a reckless mistake, or was it always meant to be forever?",
