  "description": "For ten years Kal Hakala has been the Bureau of Supernatural Investigation's top man, the longest surviving agent in its blood-soaked history. The World At Large has no idea that The World Under exists. And its vampires, demons, zombies, and mythic monsters are growing increasingly restless. In all Kal's time with the Bureau, there has been no case he couldn t crack, no monster he couldn t kill. Then a plague of zombies comes to Denver, along with a vicious serial killer dubbed The Organ Donor.Â A childhood encounter with a legendary monster has left Kal with an endless supply of rage and hatred for all things Supernatural. But now the target is on his forehead, and the Un-Dead don t die easy. The Bureau has a few aces of its own a few magicians, a cyber-ghost. Unfortunately Kal is a perennial loner ... And the World Under is wise to His tricks.",
