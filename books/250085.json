  "description": "A boy and his father share a winter night of sledding. Outside, the crescent moon is shining brightly and the world is covered with snow. Inside, a boy and his father feel sad. So they put on their hats and coats and climb a hill, pulling a red sled. Father and son climb aboard and zoom down the hill under a starlit sky. With their spirits lifted high, they return home for a mug of hot chocolate. Then it's time for bed. Patricia Thomas's loving story, affectionately illustrated by Chris L. Demarest, is told with the utmost simplicity.",
