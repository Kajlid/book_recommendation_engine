  "description": "What happens when a parakeet named Ruby gets an unexpected mind-meld with Marcella Hollister's quarrelsome mother, Thelma? After Thelma is kidnapped from her hospital bed, Marcella must find her -- somewhere in the tall pines of the six-million-acre Adirondack Park. With the help of her Native American husband Quinn and bizarre \"tips\" from Ruby, Marcella butts heads with quirky bird psychic Earl Tiramisu, much to the chagrin of the FBI, who wants her to stay out of the investigation.Why is Tiramisu asking questions about Thelma's past and the money she's been spending? The FBI agents hint that it may be related to an unsolved fifty-year-old bank heist, but Marcella can't believe her annoying, but honest-to-a-fault mother could be involved.Across the rugged Adirondack park landscape, a brutal scenario evolves, where the good guys aren't what they seem, and only Ruby's newly acquired talents provide slim hope for survival.\"I had the privilege to read the most delightful mystery, For the Birds, by Aaron Paul Lazar. If I had to categorize it, I'd call it a cozy with an unusual supernatural touch, but in all honestly, it was one of the most unique and refreshing mysteries I've read in a long time--with a huge surprise ending.\"Marilyn Meredith, (as F. M. Meredith) author of Angel Lost",
