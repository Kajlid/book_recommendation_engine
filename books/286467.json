  "description": "CamillaI thought I had the perfect relationship and the perfect job. Boy, was I wrong. After a disastrous end with my boyfriend, I need to get away, if only for a little while. Never in a million years did I think that a city girl like me would end up in a country place like Beaumont, Texas. I only need to get away for a little while. Being away from New York was exactly what I needed, I just didn't expect to be temporarily working for a rock star. Knox is consistently hot and cold and broody beyond belief. However, beyond the broodiness, there's a sweet side of him too. I need to be professional though, and he's making it hard to resist him.KnoxI've been on the road with my band for years when I find out some unfortunate news. Leaving my band, even temporarily, was never my plan. I have absolutely no desire to return to my hometown, where the person who broke my heart resides. I wish I had a choice, but I don't. Camilla walks into my home with a sass that is all too attractive. It takes all of my willpower to to stay away from her. I don't want her, but I find myself needing her.",
