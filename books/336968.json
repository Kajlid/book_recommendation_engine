  "description": "Publishing January 24, 2023. Three-time-Emmy nominee and former editor-in-chief of “Seventeen Magazine” and “Soap Opera Digest” Meredith Berlin is releasing her debut women’s fiction, Friends With Issues, which follows three glamorous, self-made women in their 40s who gamble with love, sex and their careers in NYC and L.A., as one charismatic man captivates them all. A poignant page-turner, Friends With Issues follows Brooke, Elizabeth, and Susan, three friends who have made their mark on Manhattan but who now struggle with the daily balancing act of career, family and friendship. Brooke thought she married the man of her dreams, but now she’s questioning her marriage as she embarks on a new venture to Hollywood. After a shattering diagnosis, Elizabeth attempts to remake herself in order to hold on to some semblance of her identity. Susan should be ecstatic when her media mogul husband catapults them into financial security, but as her uncertainty about their relationship grows, she opens a Pandora’s box of new passion–leading to stunning revelations neither saw coming. In Meredith Berlin’s provocative debut these women discover that their lives and identities can transform regardless of age, achievement, or status-––and money doesn’t protect you from the unimaginable. Fans of Little Fires Everywhere, novels by Liane Moriarty, and Valley of the Dolls will devour this absorbing drama to its powerful end.",
