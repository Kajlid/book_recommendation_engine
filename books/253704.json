  "title": "A Shot in the Texas Dark",
  "description": "When a full-blooded Cheyenne called the Bone Lady asks Al Quinn to find her missing daughter, Gerta, he readily agrees. However, he soon discovers that there is no trail, no starting point. Forced to grab at glimmers and hunches that lead him to the seamy edge of a hidden child-porn ring, Sheriff Clayton asks Al to cooperate with an undercover FBI agent.  Al’s pal Fergie thinks the Bone Lady is one of the scariest women she’s ever met. Not only does the woman work in a butcher shop, but some bodies begin to show up sliced like holiday hams.  Each effort to find Gerta leads Al down a new dangerous path, from Russian mafia types to his old foes connected with the Mexican cartels. It may be that this time he just has to take a shot in the dark.",
