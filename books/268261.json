  "description": "Sticks and stones and moss and leaves… that’s what Tatiana is made of.  Tatiana is a replacement—an exchanged child—created to take the place of a perfect human baby and left in a cradle on a cold, winter night.  But twenty years later, her time is running out. The creature who made Tatiana returns and challenges everything she knows. Not only is Tatiana not human, and her family not her family, but the human world is killing her.  Determined to give her family the life—and daughter—they deserve, Tatiana journeys to a strange world, one of fire and dust, and concrete and glass. There, she'll risk everything to find the human girl she replaced, and make things right.  But she won’t be alone. Grisha, a roamer, and Fedir, a mysterious shifter, find her and vow to help her.  And they aren’t the only ones.  Soon, Shubin, Taras, and Kopala, are caught up in Tatiana’s quest. Fascinated by this exchanged girl, the five otherworldly creatures will put their trust in her.  But hope is a fragile thing, and Tatiana's been burned before. Will she come to believe she's finally found a place to belong?  **Forge and Fire is a slow burn reverse harem romance**",
