  "description": "Rider Dillinger likes who he is, and he knows what he wants. He works hard for one of the toughest teachers on campus and he likes to unwind the same way any other twenty-something does; with sex. When his friends with benefits arrangement ends badly, Rider finds himself at the school health clinic where he meets campus nurse, Eli James. Rider thinks this will be a simple hook-up, but he doesnâ€™t count on the connection that forms between them. He sees this as his golden opportunity to tell Eli his secret desires, after all, what has he got to lose?   Eli James was enamored with Rider from the moment he saw him. His round eyes, and pouty, innocent mouth hid a man who wanted sinfully delicious things. The idea of sharing Rider appeals to Eli, but only on his terms. As they navigate a relationship based on emotional exclusivity and sexual variety, they end up falling deeper and deeper in love.  When an event neither see coming rocks their world, Rider knows he needs to do something drastic to rectify the situation or risk losing Eli to the crushing weight of guilt.
