  "title": "Know Your Real Self: A journey towards inner peace and freedom",
  "description": "This book will provide all spiritual answers, clarity and spiritual guidance that you are seeking on your path and will help you attain inner peace & inner freedom. It will also help you attain positive strength, happiness and higher states of consciousness. It will also reveal the ultimate spiritual truth and the mysteries of enlightenment and liberation or moksha. I got a strong intuitive feeling to write this book so that more and more people can be benefited by it. I wanted to share my life s journey & experiences in depth with readers and sadhaks/spiritual seekers who are on a similar path so that they can get insight and more clarity on lot of issues which will deepen their faith and help them to see their own journey in a different light. The other reason of writing this book is to help other sadhaks/spiritual seekers gain insight and learn from my experiences. I never intended to write this book for any name or fame or money but rather my main intention is to help other seekers on their spiritual path so that they can purify their inner selves and experience higher states of consciousness, inner peace and inner freedom. The book also has two very powerful meditations which will completely transform your life and help you in your spiritual growth and inner purification provided it is practiced regularly with surrender and faith.",
