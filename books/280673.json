  "title": "Oxford Marmalade",
  "description": "I originally read this collection of linked stories on BBC Radio Oxford over eight consecutive weeks, and they proved such a hit with the listeners that I was invited back to read one of my short stories every week for the following two years. A number of people have asked me since to publish Oxford Marmalade in book form, and following the success of my novels and short stories on kindle, that’s what I’ve done. I haven’t been able to resist adding some finishing touches, although surprisingly few were needed – just to reassure those who enjoyed them so much the first time around. Set in Oxford, they connect various characters, exploring from their different perspectives the complexity of relationship and the convoluted, sometimes heartbreaking dance of intimacy. There is Dinah and her second husband Piers, facing the hidden truths of their marriage after 15 years. Then there is Dinah’s wayward son Kit, passionately involved with Poppy, whose husband Titus falls in love with her rather late in the day. And finally there is Lucy, who has given up on romantic love until Ben comes back into her life unexpectedly, determined to remind her. Their lives, and the lives of those they meet, interweave and overlap as intricately as ribbons in a traditional Oxfordshire Maypole dance. As you might expect, if you have read my fiction previously, these stories don’t hold back from portraying honestly the subtleties and depth of human emotion and behaviour, seasoned lightly throughout with insight, empathy and humour.",
