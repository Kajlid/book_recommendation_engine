  "description": "From the swamps of the Florida panhandle, once again emerges private investigator Jack Ludefance, in a murder/mystery/thriller novel by award winning author Behcet Kaya, titled “Appellate Judge.” A key element in this case, in which readers are orbited into with a very subtle path of reasoning, revolves around a violin. Not just any ordinary violin, but a Stradivarius, worth many millions of dollars. What’s more, it seems this particular Strad, which was gifted to the judge years back by a Swiss aristocrat, was actually at one time owned by the most famous violin virtuoso who ever lived, Niccolò Paganini; adding even more to its value. The uncovering of details about this violin makes for a very sophisticated history into the world of classical instruments.",
