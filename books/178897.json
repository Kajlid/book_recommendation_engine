  "title": "A Northern Nativity: Christmas Dreams of a Prairie Boy",
  "description": "Artist William Kurelek created this uniquely moving book on the theme that Christ came to all people everywhere. What would happen if He came now? A boy imagines that the nativity takes place in northern snows. He dreams that the Christ child is born to Eskimos, to Indians, to Blacks, that the Nativity takes place in a fisherman’s hut, a garage, a cowboy’s barn, that the holy family is given refuge in a city mission, a grain barn, and a country school. A beautiful holiday story for all generations.",
