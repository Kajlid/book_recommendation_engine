  "description": "When people in Paris look at Michel Roth, they see little more than a Parisian student. What they do not realise is that he is carrying a secret, one that he cannot even reveal to the woman he loves. For Michel is no ordinary Frenchman but a German. He has been sent to Paris to assist the Nazis in dealing with Resistance fighters.",
