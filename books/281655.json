  "description": "A kitten is adopted and raised by a pack of huskies -- and even develops some canine characteristics!When 12-year-old Mina discovers an abandoned kitten, Nukka, in the outskirts of Fairbanks, Alaska, she knows she has to take it in. And with the help of Mina's huskies, Nukka quickly becomes part of the family.There's only one problem (or is it?): Nukka is a cat, and with only a pack of huskies to raise her, she develops some... interesting characteristics. Nukka learns to pant like a dog, play fetch like a dog, and even wants to become a sled dog, just like her canine siblings. But they're so much bigger and stronger than she is. How could Nukka ever keep up?But things take a turn for the worse when the pack is stranded in a forest during a rescue mission. With a blizzard on its way, will Nukka be able to save her family before it's too late?",
