  "description": "Frog is settling in for a relaxing day at the pond. (AAHH.) But waitâ€”there are other creatures at the pond as well. (AH HA!) And some of them are out to get Frog. (AHHH!) Not to worry, Frog gets the last laugh. (HA HA!) Using only two letters, along with many brightly colored and lively illustrations, Jeff Mack brings his hallmark humor to this rollicking book that will leave young readers guessing, laughing, and on the edge of their seats. Plus, this is a fixed-format version of the book, which looks nearly identical to the print version.",
