  "description": "Jack is an FBI agent, a playboy, a man who is happy tasting the flavor of the month and not staying for breakfast. He’s perfectly content with his life and has no interest in finding his happily ever after. So when he is attracted to Kennedy at his partner’s wedding, he naturally takes the opportunity to seduce her. Now it’s time to focus on the next good-looking woman who comes along, right?Ah, you don’t always get what you expect. Kennedy was burned by her ex-husband—badly. She told everyone he cheated on her, because the truth—that he stole all of her money before disappearing out of her life—is far more embarrassing. For the last three years she’s struggled to pay off her debt, ignoring her libido and refusing to consider allowing another man to get close.A one-night stand with Jack is the perfect way to break her sexual fast—until she discovers that he’s pouring her morning coffee and frying bacon.While Jack goes undercover at a male strip club, the two begin an affair that distracts him from his job and puts their hearts—and Kennedy’s life—in danger. Now there’s only one way Jack can stop this killer, and it involves making that declaration they both swore they didn’t want.",
