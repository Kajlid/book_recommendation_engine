Shayla Perkins isn't the kind of girl who makes the same mistake twice, especially when it comes to Sean \"Stitch\" Molina. So when he gives her the world's biggest rejection, that's it--she's done. Until the sexy, silent, unavailable Sean makes Shay a very personal offer. Of course, it still doesn't mean he's interested in her. Or does it?  Sean has done things in life. Bad things. And he's paid the price. All he wants now is to make up for his past by doing good in the present. And no one deserves more good than Shay. Beautiful on the inside and out, Shay is the kind of woman who should be cared for and protected--especially from a man like Sean. He's tried to keep his feelings for her in check, but a single, reckless impulse pulls them closer than ever before.  Soon the two are sharing their biggest dreams and satisfying their deepest desires. But what will happen if the only way to truly give each other what they want most...is to let each other go? \"The perfect mix of funny, hot and heartwarming. I enjoyed it immensely!\" --Mia Sheridan, New York Times bestselling author, on Four Letter Word  The Dirty Deeds Four Letter Word Hit the Spot Bad for You",
