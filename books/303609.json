  "description": "When long-time White Rock resident Mike Donnelly is found dead at his hunting camp, it appears as if the tragic death was by his own hand. But a gut feeling tells Chief of Police Sam Mason otherwise. Is it any coincidence that Mike’s family farm sits smack in the middle of a parcel of land that greedy Lucas Thorne desperately needs to complete the development of his resort? Sam and Sergeant Jody Harris’s line of questioning stirs up a hornet’s nest. When Thorne threatens to expose a secret from Sam’s past, Sam realizes the corruption in White Rock runs deeper than he ever suspected. And when a startling discovery surrounding slain officer Tyler Richardson is brought to light, Sam and Jo discover that you never can tell who might be keeping secrets.",
