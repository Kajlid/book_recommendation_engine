  "description": "The Sebastian Trilogy - A tale of romance, erotica and edge-of-your-seat suspense! Romantic, tragic, funny and dark ... \"I live in a respectable three bedroom house in a respectable village in Dorset, with a respectable job but with a far from respectable secret. The secret brings a wicked smile to my lips this morning.\" Elizabeth Dove is a mother, wife and successful business woman. To the outside world, she leads a perfect life. Elizabeth knows differently ... frustrated in a passionless marriage, she embarks on an illicit journey to rediscover her sensuality. When Elizabeth meets Sebastian De Montfort, Lord of Penmorrow House in Cornwall, she is thrust into his world of domination, dark secrets and self discovery. Can Elizabeth find the fulfilment she seeks or will her own desires bring about the destruction of those she loves? Elizabeth and Sebastian's erotic journey begins in Book One, Sebastian - Secrets, will have you on the edge of your seat in Book Two, Sebastian - Dark Bonds and reaches a dramatic conclusion in Book Three, Sebastian - Retribution. \"Forget Christian, forget Gideon, forget Gabriel, heck all those dark and mysterious alpha males - forget them all and meet Sebastian. He's going to mess with your head, he's going to make you swoon, he's going to make your pulse quicken and then he's going to make you squirm. BAM! the story hit me and got its claws in me straight away, it bowled me over and I was totally at its mercy, just as Beth is with Sebastian. You'll be laughing, nail biting and crying. The Sebastian Trilogy is a hoard of sizzling excitement and great twists.\" 5* Review, Amazon.co.uk",
