  "description": "Summer school is supposed to be a pain, but it isn’t supposed to be the end of the world.  Sam’s first year of teaching is finally over and he loved every minute of it. With summer school well underway, he’s starting to feel like he’s getting the hang of this teaching gig, particularly since he’s pretty sure his students are the most awesome kids ever. When a suspiciously high number of students and teachers don’t show up one day, Sam is thrown into a situation he can’t believe. Nanites have saved many lives, but now it’s all gone wrong and people are going crazy.  Trapped inside the school, Sam has to ride out the wave of insanity sweeping across the land. There’s one thing he’s very sure of…no one is going to hurt his kids. He’ll get them to safety, no matter what comes between them and the road home.  The Book of Sam is a prequel to the Between Life and Death series. Go back and experience the nanite apocalypse from the beginning with Sam, a character favorite of readers in the first book, The In-Betweener.",
