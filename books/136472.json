A science fiction drama about androids and AI after the extinction of humanity. And everything changes.What follows is a tale of love and loss, fame and infamy, of extraordinary events in one world, and another. And as Zelu's life evolves, the lines between fiction and reality begin to blur.Because sometimes a story really does have the power to reshape the world.",
