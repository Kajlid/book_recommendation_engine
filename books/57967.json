Angelique is taken to a strange and marvelous estate where she is befriended by Culdun, her Liege's fey companion.

But old fears and an older curse resurface, threatening to drive them apart and banish Drew into an eternity of loneliness. Will Angelique's growing love be strong enough to save her Liege? Or will she flee once the secret is revealed?",
