  "description": "Maximilian Cale, the Duke of Lyons, accepted long ago that his kidnapped brother was dead. When a crytpic note from investigator Tristan Bonnaud claims otherwise, Max seeks out Tristan's sister, Lisette- just as Tristan himself goes missing. Have the siblings staged an elaborate hoax? Or is the fiercely protective beauty innocent as she claims?Fearful that the powerful duke will retaliate, clever Lisette convinces Max to accompany her to Paris to jointly search for their loved ones. Posing as husband and wife- not an English duke with a tarnished family name, and the illegitimate daughter of a viscount- they find an exhilarating passion that has enticingly blurred the line between danger and desire. And they discover that some mysteries, like those of the heart, are answered tenfold in the bliss of a true and trusting love.",
