  "description": "At the request of his Sire, Benjamin Rossignol is asked to meet with a woman in order to assist him with finding a cure for a mystical Hell poison that has infected one of his Brethren. At the meeting, Ben is understandably drawn to the beautiful strawberry blond woman with blue eyes, but there is more to her than just a pretty face. Everything inside him urges him to get to know her. He does not understand why he feels compelled not to lie to her or try to hide who and what he is. When he realizes she is his promised mate, he must convince her to accept him and be with him or lose her. Will she choose him? Alison Stevens, psychic empath, senses a great deal from the man she is talking with over dinner. He thinks she’s beautiful. He is drawn to her for some reason he doesn’t understand. Nah, maybe it’s just her. She must be projecting what she wishes he were thinking. Agreeing to help analyze a friends blood for a possible poison, what she discovers when she looks under the microscope is astounding. What she discovers about Ben is unbelievable. Can she accept everything he’s told her? How is he so sure she is his promised mate? Will she or won’t she accept a new life with a new love?",
