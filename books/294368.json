And Iris likes what they see. Babs is made of fire.Iris grew from a seed in the ground. They have friends, but not human ones. Not until they meet Babs.

Something is happening in the other realm, and despite being warned to stay away, the three friends have to figure out how to deal with it on their own terms.Anyone who loves the work of Francesca Lia Block and delights in Studio Ghibli films will be entranced by this gorgeous and gentle young adult novel about three queer friends who come into their power.",
