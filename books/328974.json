And while I downed that potion to qualify—the one with fifty percent chance of killing me—what were you doing?That’s right.

But congratulations, you found the one exception, because Briar Bishop hates you.To add to everything, she’s untrained (and insane). Come the trial, demons are going to eat her alive, and she’ll take your magic with her—magic she’s now burning through, it seems, just to spite you.And who is the one left to clean up this mess?Right.Me.Where are my matches? I need a bloody smoke.……*ahem.* The Witcher meets Zodiac Academy in a slow burn four book romance. Broody vamps and shifters. Enemies to lovers. Monsters and magic. Check. Check. Check.
