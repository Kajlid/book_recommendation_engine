  "description": "After a cyclone moves Dorothy Gale's house from Kansas to the magical land of Oz, she begins her quest to get back home, meeting the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, and the Cowardly Lion along the way. The secretive Wizard offers to help--if Dorothy and her friends can bring him the broomstick of the Wicked Witch of the West. But can the Wizard really do what he claims? or is he nothing more than a humbug? Since its publication in 1900, L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz has become one of the world's best-loved fairytales. The first totally American fantasy for children, it is one of the most popular children's books of all time. Newly designed and typeset in a 6-by-9-inch format by Waking Lion Press.",
