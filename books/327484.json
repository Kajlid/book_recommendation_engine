That she will love him with everything that she is. Until her dying day. She tries to fight it, feebly. Because she is a woman who isn’t afraid of anything.Not even him.“He will be your sun. Your stars. Your moon. Even though this man is darkness itself. Midnight personified.”Wren Whitney does not trouble herself by thinking of the consequences of her actions. What events she put in motion by letting him into her life. She never could have imagined what would happen to her. To them. How utterly ruined they would both be by their love.",
