  "description": "Grace Lisa Vandenburg orders her world with numbers: how many bananas she buys, how many steps she takes to the cafÉ, how many poppy seeds are in her daily piece of orange cake. Every morning she uses 100 strokes to brush her hair, 160 strokes to brush her teeth. But Grace's life is about to change on a day when all the tables at her regular cafÉ are full, and a stranger, Seamus Joseph O'Reilly (19 letters in his name, just like Grace's), invites her to sit with him. Because no matter how organized you are, how many systems you put in place, you can't plan for people, who are unpredictable and full of possibilities. And suddenly, Grace may be about to lose count of the number of ways she can fall in love.",
