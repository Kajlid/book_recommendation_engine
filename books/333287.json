  "description": "Revolutions not only change worlds-they often transform flawed men into heroes. Disgraced physicist Steve Marks joins a group of paranormal investigators in their violent confrontations with other-dimensional monsters that feed off human fear. Soon the team must also battle the aliens' human allies within the U.S. military. As Steve discovers more about the entities, and how to hurt them, he becomes the key factor in the plans of multiple factions. Steve must become a full player in a genocidal game he doesn't fully understand. He must also rediscover his own integrity-an integrity that will force him to risk his friends, his new-found love, and even the survival of the human species for what he knows is right.",
