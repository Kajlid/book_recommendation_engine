  "title": "Artie and the Princess",
  "description": "Artie and the Princess was first published in 1945. This charming story about a little dragon and a princess named Pandy is lavishly illustrated with delicate ink drawings and fine watercolor washes by the author, Marjorie Torrey, a Caldecott Medal winner. Torrey, a popular writer and illustrator in the middle of the 20th century, illustrated her last book in 1957 and then disappeared from public view. Her books have faded into obscurity over the years, but as you will discover when you open this book, her beautiful artwork, humorous characterization and gentle message of kindness and self-confidence remain relevant. Now, more than ever, the sweetness of this little book will resonate with readers of all ages.",
