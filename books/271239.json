  "description": "Kerrianne Huntington’s perfect life was shattered one seemingly ordinary morning when her husband was killed in a car accident. Now, four years later, she still struggles with picking up all the pieces. Being a single mother of three active children keeps her plenty busy, but she can’t help the loneliness that tears at her heart. When Kerrianne meets a widower with two children of his own, she finds herself wondering—is it possible to love a man with the same heart that still mourns another? Or will she have to choose? By Morning Light is a poignant, often humorous tale of love, friendship, and heart-wrenching decisions.",
