  "description": "\"I have nothing to offer a woman like Cora. Not what she deserves, yet . . . I want her anyway.\"I never expected to meet the woman of my dreams in a coffee shop. Especially when she’s a famous Hollywood actress and I’m nothing but an overworked, underpaid barista. Only I already have someone special—my son. Providing for him and getting through college are my top priorities. Dating while juggling single fatherhood isn’t. Cora Bentley deserves a partner who can offer her the world. But the heart wants what it wants, and mine won’t stop beating for hers. I should walk away. It’s what’s best, even if she won’t admit it. But I can’t bring myself to do so. Not when she’s everything I could ever want. Not when she could be our one good thing.\nOne Good Thing is a single dad, opposites attract, stand-alone contemporary romance.",
