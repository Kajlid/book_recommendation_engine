  "title": "The Alchemy Press Book of Ancient Wonders",
  "description": "When we think of a wonder, our minds go most often to the great buildings of the past - the pyramids, the Taj Mahal, Stonehenge - but the human mind can make almost anything wondrous. We walk with wonders every day, through the power of curiosity and imagination and our human tendency to make stories about what we fear, what we desire, what we wish to understand. This collection offers new glimpses into the wonder we all feel. Discover standing stones, burial mounds, ruined castles and sunken cities: the ancient sites that litter our landscapes; the ancient wonders that possess a mysterious appeal that cannot be denied. Includes: Introduction: Kari Sperring. Fiction: Adrian Tchaikovsky, Aliette de Bodard, Peter Crowther, Anne Nicholls, Adrian Cole, Pauline E Dungate, Bryn Fortey, William Meikle, John Howard, James Brogden, Shannon Connor Winward, Misha Herwin, Lynn M Cochrane and Selina Lock.Editors: Jan Edwards & Jenny Barber",
