  "description": "Grief- and guilt-ridden Skylar sometimes wonders if she has the strength to go on living after her life mate's murder. She functions in the physical world only, denying her supernatural gifts and any subtle realities, existing only to ensure her precious son's health and happiness and living far, far away from the shattering memories of Dunleavy Castle. But as much as she tries to forget, as much as she strives to deny, as much as she tries to punish herself, her immense desire for one man refuses to be purged from her mind or body. Jax Ammadon's suffering has made him stronger than any Watcher alive. For hundreds of years he's burned for the one woman whom fate has designated could never be his. He watches helplessly as Skylar's denial of the truth of what they are to one another slowly kills her. Her grieving period must come to an end. It's time for the new King of the Watchers to claim what's his.",
