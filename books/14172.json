The years at each other’s sides never diminished his love for him, but with the rise to fame in their rock band, Black Heart Down, more than a few challenges hindered their relationship. Now, he’s reached a crossroads, either he’ll have all of Kyler, or he’ll walk away from everything they’ve built together.Kyler may be fearless on stage, but if there’s one thing to send his heart crashing down, it’s losing Robbie. When Robbie delivers his ultimatum, Kyler’s willing to do what it takes for things to work. But change doesn’t happen quickly, and when he makes a terrible mistake, all their history together might not be enough to save their future.",
