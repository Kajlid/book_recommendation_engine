  "description": "The follow up to her bestselling breakout hit How to Be a Woman , Moranthology is a hilarious, insightful collection of Moran’s London Times columns that confirms her status as “the UK’s answer to Tina Fey, Chelsea Handler, and Lena Dunham all rolled into one.” ( Marie Claire ) Possibly the only drawback about the bestselling How to Be a Woman was that its author, Caitlin Moran, was limited to pretty much one being a woman.  Moranthology is proof that Caitlin can actually be “quite chatty” about many other things, including cultural, social and political issues that are usually the province of learned professors, or hot-shot wonks—and not of a woman who once, as an experiment, put a wasp in a jar, and got it stoned. Here you’ll find Caitlin ruminating on—and sometimes interviewing—subjects as varied as caffeine, Keith Richards, Ghostbusters , Twitter, the welfare state, the royal wedding, Lady Gaga, and her own mortality, to name just a few. With her “brilliant, original voice” ( Publishers Weekly ), Caitlin brings insight and humor to everything she writes.",
