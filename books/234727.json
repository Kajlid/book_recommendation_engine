  "description": "The first chapter of Kavven, book 7 in The Azziarin Series, included at the end of the book.\n\n\n\nCamilla\n\n\nI spent my entire life training to be the Chief Pilot on the first deep space mission, but nothing could prepare me for what was to come. Hurtling through a black hole in my evac pod, landing on a hostile planet and needing to find a way home, making new friends, and eating the same god-awful soup every meal just to stay alive. I had to start over, learn everything from scratch. At least I have my Neuro-ocular Implant to help...\nWith two borrowed coins, I headed to the fight club. I didn’t know who to bet on, but when I spotted him, I wanted him to win. And then he started talking to me inside my head, telling me to free him and he’d take me home. His voice oozed sex but sounded like the promise of death. It both scared and excited me. Could I trust him? Could I refuse his offer to take me home?\n\n\nZorvak\n\n\nWhen I find the traitor, he’s dead! After being drugged only to wake up a prisoner of the Humchins, a lawless species who runs fight clubs and pleasure ships, I had to escape!\nI cast my senses wide, hoping to find a Compatible, even though it was extremely rare. And there she was. Another female from my planet. I struck hard, formed the mental pathways, and demanded she free me. She ignored my order. When she finally talked to me, the more I suspected she was not from Ulaya and I had bonded with an unknown species… sight unseen!\n\n\nZorvak’s Rescue is a standalone sci-fi romance. If you love a book with action, adventure, suspense, and romance, then this one is for you. Told in two POV’s. Intended for audiences 18+",
