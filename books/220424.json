  "description": "Jackalope-Girl Learns to Speak is a chapbook of poems that use domestic fabulism to tell a story of adoption. Fabulist elements are placed right in the familiar world: Jackalope-Girl—a girl with antlers, whiskers, and rabbit ears—is born, meets boys, deals with her obvious weirdness, deals with her adoptive father’s illness, and learns about her adoption. The theme central to many of these poems is loss. Some poems speak from the voice of Jackalope-Girl’s imagined birthmother—Antler-Girl. Using a wide range of styles, Jackalope-Girl Learns to Speak chronicles a coming-of-age story using imaginative imagery and metaphor.",
