  "description": "Chelsea and Liam fell in love after years of friendship. Their journey to be together wasn't direct, and as a result, they are equipped to confront and overcome obstacles they face together. As their lives move forward, they want to reach the same milestones other couples their age achieve: get married, buy a house, have children, live happily ever after.When their plan is derailed and Chelsea begins to blame herself for her past choices, a new issue appears out of left field, throwing a wrench in their carefully curated timeline. With their status quo being flipped on its axis, everything they've built together is challenged.Can they learn to lean on each other and their families? Will they be able to manage? Can they achieve the proverbial happily ever after? Or is everyone just too tired?This book can be read as a standalone, but it is also an extended epilogue of We're All a Little Guarded. 100% of proceeds from this publication are being donated to SickKids Hospital through SickKids Foundation.",
