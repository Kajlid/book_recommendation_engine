  "description": "If you think it's all good deeds and stuffy politeness over at Camelot, you're wrong! Most people don't know this, but things are pretty bad right now. King Arthur's in jail, Merlin's gone missing, and there's a cruel demon in charge. Seriously!Now it's up to young Leonard, a page to a poor but kind knight, to set things right--even if that means going on a dangerous quest, outsmarting hungry monsters, or risking his life to make friends with a bunch of grumpy dragons.Filled with magic, monsters, and irreverent humor, DRAGONFRIEND is an epic YA Arthurian fantasy novel (C.72,000 words) in the spirit of Excalibur, The Princess Bride, and The Sword in the Stone.Leonard the Great, ELVENKING: Leonard the Great, Book Three COMING THIS MONTH!",
