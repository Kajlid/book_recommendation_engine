  "title": "A Death in the Family",
  "description": "In 1910 when Euphemia's father expires in his dish of mutton and onions he leaves his family on the verge of destitution. An appeal to her estranged aristocratic grandfather fails and showing the capable and intellectual aspects of her character that her mother so despises, Euphemia assumes a pseudonym and heads off into service. What Euphemia expects to be a grand adventure begins with her discovery of the murdered body of 'Mr Georgie, a less than loved family cousin. Born with an innate sense of justice, and because the police are very suspicious of her recent arrival, Euphemia throws herself into her own investigation, not realising she is delving into the murky family secrets of her employers and putting her own life at risk. Help comes in the guise of the annoying but honest younger son of the house, Bertram, who risks his reputation to work with her, not realising she is the granddaughter of an Earl and far too inquisitive for her own good.",
