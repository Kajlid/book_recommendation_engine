When the voice on the other end of the line promises him excitement, wealth, and happiness, he is more than a little intrigued.Arriving at a hastily scrawled address, Wilson discovers a mysterious and exclusive organization that offers its clients whole new lives . . . for a price. The organization arranges for a client's demise or disappearance and outfits each with a new body in which to begin again. But there's no turning back, and no room for second-guessing. When Wilson begins to question his new circumstances and pushes some very well-established boundaries a bit too far for the organization's comfort, his second chance may just be his last.",
