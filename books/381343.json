  "description": "Elizabeth Gilbert meets Jennifer Weiner in this hilarious comedy of errors starring resident Los Angeleno Sydney Welles. Sydney seems to have it all―a lucrative career, a comfortable life, and a man who looks good on paper―until the Catholic Church, looking to repair some serious image problems, approaches the ad agency she works for to create a positive campaign. Sydney, told by her boss it's her account to lose, stumbles through the novel trying to figure out how to sell religion to a soulless society. She begins a one-sided argument with the Lord himself via riotous, pleading e-mails, all the time asking why He/She had to enter her neat, secular life and make such a mess of it.Complicating things are her best friend Anna's on-again, off-again wedding; the disturbingly handsome priest serving as the church's liaison; and Jake, the new guy, who looks good in real life but comes equipped with all the real-life complications. Susi Rajah's wickedly funny debut novel introduces an unforgettable new voice in fiction and gives us a ribald, self-deprecating young woman who eventually discovers that love requires even more faith than religion.",
