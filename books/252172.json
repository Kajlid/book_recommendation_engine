  "description": "Callie Penrose must die....Callie Penrose - a wizard with a splash of Angel’s blood flowing through her veins - kind of broke the Vatican and their band of holy-warrior wizard-priests, the Shepherds. Officially, the report stated Callie forgot to turn the other cheek, and things escalated....She returns home to Kansas City to find new gangs of supernaturals roving the streets, preying on the innocent while the local factions do nothing. Although not unified, everyone seems to agree on one point....Callie Penrose must die.And she’s still hearing those strange Whispers in her mind - much more frequently than before, and not nearly as...forgiving.But when an epic betrayal blindsides her and she discovers the truth of her birth - why Heaven and Hell have been so interested in her - Callie’s world begins to crumble, and she must decide whether she wants to be a good girl....Or if it’s time to be a little naughty.No matter how hard you try, you can’t make an Angel cry....They just roar.",
