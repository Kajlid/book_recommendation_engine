  "title": "Where Bad Boys are Ruined",
  "description": "I ate leftover cupcakes and cracked macarons for breakfast.  I was ninety percent sure he simply ate up girls like me.  I was covered in paint splatters, cake batter, and sweat the first time I met him.  He was covered in badass tattoos and a smile that seemed to hold a secret I would never figure out.  Rule number 1 was never, under any circumstances, fall for the man who I wrote my lease check to.  So, I tucked him away in the “Fantasize Only” compartment of my brain and called it a day.  But he didn’t make it easy.  He was arrogant, funny, and the biggest flirt I had ever met.  Most of the time, I didn’t know if I was just a game to him.  If I didn’t know better, I’d say he was on a mission to ruin my life.  And maybe my heart, too.",
