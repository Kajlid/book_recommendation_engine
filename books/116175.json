  "description": "Julie manages her life the best way she knows how, by waking up everyday and putting one foot in front of the other, along with a little help from modern medicine. Most days she holds things together pretty well; as the mother of twin toddlers and a wife to a husband she can barely stand she still manages to keep up appearances and paste a smile onto her face. Until dreams of a sexy vampire plague her nights leaving her panting when she wakes. Julie begins to struggle with her own urges though she dare not admit aloud that she now has a taste for blood. She longs to indulge her desire by taking the vein of the vampire that makes her quake with need. How much longer can she keep the creature inside of her at bay? Only time will tell if Julie is strong enough to resist her darkest desire or if she even wants to try.",
