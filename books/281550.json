  "description": "Mercury Hale is not a hero. Not in his mind.He's happy spending his late nights slicing his way through monstrous astral fiends, using a weapon imbued with a mysterious power, at the behest of the secretive Procyon Foundation. It's a strange way to earn a paycheck, but hey, he's good at it.The problem is, things are getting worse.More attacks. More public exposure. None of which Procyon wants. When he tries to get to the bottom of the mess, Mercury is confronted by a tightly-guarded secret about Procyon - its true purpose, and what that means for the fate of the world.Worse, Mercury is not who he thinks he is.And he's not alone.",
