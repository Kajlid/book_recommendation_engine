Only problem--SAS is really just a way to lure young women to the ship, so they can be mated to an Apochian warrior. Can Dachar convince Anis that her future lies with him? It won't be easy, for Anis's independent streak isn't the only challenge facing Dachar. A racial purity movement is dead set against Earth brides, and Anis's future mother-in-law is a true believer. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
