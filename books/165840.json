  "description": "Curiosity might slay the cat, but satisfaction will bring her back.  Cassie had always known she was a submissive type but traditional BDSM seemed just a bit too strict for her taste. So when she heard about an opportunity to be a shared submissive with a difference, she pounced on it. What better way to spend her last few weeks of summer than as an indulged animal, trained and collared, stroked and petted and, hopefully, fucked regularly by a handful of lovers? Nothing too emotional. No way to get attached. Just no-strings fun and a happy memory to take with her when she finally enters full-time, boring adulthood.  Strong and handsome with a deviously twisted imagination, Greg seems the master of her dreams and Cassie is his perfect pet. With his housemates away, they have a whole weekend to play and Greg intends to take full advantage. He’s going to push his new pet’s boundaries in more ways than one.   This novella is 15,000 words of hot, explicit pet-play erotica. It is meant for adults only (and kinky adults at that). It contains elements of BDSM, anal play, and spanking.",
