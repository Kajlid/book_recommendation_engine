When one of those decisions leaves him temporarily homeless, he never expected to gain a new friend.Nessa is real, she’s honest, and she believes in him. Zander longs to be authentic. He’s been pretending, playing a part, for as long as he can remember.But Nessa is pretending, too. Pretending she isn’t exhausted, that the world isn’t too loud, and that she doesn’t have a book full of notes that might explain why she’s always been a little different.As she's learning to trust herself, she might even realise that she doesn't need to hide who she is.All The Wrong Shelves can be read as a standalone. It’s book two in The Without Filter Series.All The Wrong Shelves is a low-angst, slow burn, slightly forbidden (brother’s best friend), new adult romance, and it takes place in Copenhagen.
