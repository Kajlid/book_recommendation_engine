  "description": "Leann wasn't good enough for her upper-crust in-laws, so they gave her the mansion none of them wanted. Years ago, something or someone in the house killed Leann's brother. Will its violent secrets kill her next? \" . . . a spine-electrifying supernatural tale where a huge Southern States mansion contains one of the most terrifying, violent and indeed psychopathic ghosts to haunt any town. It is also a murder mystery-why did Robina Willets apparently kill all five of her young children, and her husband, before stabbing herself to death? And, if you are in the camp of believing that 'Justice . . . just is not, ' then this will have you frothing at the mouth with righteous social fury.\"--Tim Roux, author of \"Missio\" and \"The Dance of the Pheasodile Kathleen McKenna is a former adolescent social worker who holds a degree in Sociology. She is from Alaska and, after relocating to New Mexico, began writing. An admitted aficionado of a good scary tale, she began \"The Wedding Gift\" following a visit to New Orleans, where she saw a beautiful antebellum house and began imagining \"what if \"there were a beautiful young girl from the wrong side of the tracks who married her way in and then \"what if\" there was already a ghost there . . . . She shares her home in New Mexico with a morbidly obese, alcoholic Old English Sheepdog and is presently working on a new novel.",
