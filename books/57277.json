  "description": "Life on Earth is increasingly at risk. What to do about rescuing our planet, and ourselves, is a growing concern for people of all ages and all walks of life. Mark C. Coleman's groundbreaking book, The Sustainability The Politics of Change & Why Personal Accountability is Essential NOW!  takes a cold, hard look at the facts about where we stand and how to move forward. The Sustainability Generation is beyond simply another green book in that it focuses on the poisonous influence of our acquisitive culture and its root cause -entitlement. Our culture of entitlement encourages the belief that instant gratification is our right; this in turn erodes our sense of duty toward anything outside of these immediate desires. Our consumption habits are out of control and they are sabotaging our destiny. In response to this, Mr. Coleman argues that nurturing our sense of personal responsibility, and squashing our hunger for more stuff is the single most important step toward saving our world for future generations. The Baby Boomer generation is retiring and the so-called Generation Y will soon receive the largest transfer of wealth in history.  It is vital to emphasize the need for replacing our entitlement culture with sustainable growth through redefining our core values.  The Sustainability Generation provides a clear roadmap of how individuals can empower and enlighten themselves and their peers. A new Sustainability Generation that is committed to environmental and social change will offer the promise of the greatest legacy possible-a future!",
