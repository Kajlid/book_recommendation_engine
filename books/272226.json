  "description": "What sort of girl loves sin like I do? What sort of person thrives in it?  I'm the princess to a dirty throne of motorcycles and madness, daughter of the president of the Death by Daybreak Motorcycle Club. My father's four closest officers—men dressed in blood and death and sin—they're my honor guard, cloaked in leather vests and tattoos. Only, there's nothing honorable about them at all.  They're all wrong for me. Every motorcycle club has its old ladies. These guys … they share one. They share me.  ***I WAS BORN RUINED is a 90,000 word new adult, reverse harem, motorcycle club romance with one daring, bada** leading lady, her four sexy outlaws, and a romantic suspense plot. Contains cursing, violence, and sexual situations.",
