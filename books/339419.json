  "description": "When Dylan Reese first sees Tomas, the sensual masked Dom at Club Chained, he instantly feels the connection between them. Falling under his dark spell, Dylan is unable to resist his commands, baring his body and his soul for his masked lover. In an intense exchange of sensual power, Dylan submits with an honesty and a passion he's never known. He finds himself falling hopelessly in love with a stranger who can't or won't reveal himself. Dr. Jack Marchand, a professor of medieval history, is smitten the moment he lays eyes on Dylan, the green-eyed PhD candidate he is mentoring. As their friendship blossoms, so does their trust - freeing Dylan to confess his submissive orientation while Jack admits his naturally dominant impulses. A tumble into bed after too much to drink convinces Jack he must possess Dylan on every level. But just as Dylan is captured by a fantasy, Jack is held prisoner by a secret of his own creation. Jack finally realizes the only way to liberate Dylan's heart is to confess what he has kept hidden from the world.",
