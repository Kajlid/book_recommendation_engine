  "title": "Woman of the House: The Rise of Nancy Pelosi",
  "description": "Arguably, Nancy Pelosi will be one of the most important political figures for many years to come. Not only has she somehow won the confidence of the boy's club of the House and returned her party to majority status after twelve years of Republican rule, she has managed, in her first 100 hours on the job, to pass much of the legislation she promised. Pelosi is also leading the vocal, in-your-face opposition to the Iraq war, this generation's defining event, and is likely one of the most important political figures of the last few decades. Bzdek chronicles the rise of the country's most powerful woman, shining a light on the nuts and bolts that make up the person who is two heartbeats away from the presidency by line of succession.",
