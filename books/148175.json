It means, \"You're beyond help.\" That's what folks say about fifth grader Footer Davis's mom, who \"ain't right\" because of her bipolar disorder. She just shot a snake in Footer's yard with an elephant gun, and now she's been shipped off to a mental hospital, and Footer is missing her fiercely yet again.\"Bless their hearts\" is also what folks say about Cissy and Doc Abrams, two kids who went missing after a house fire.
