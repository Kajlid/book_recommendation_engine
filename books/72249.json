  "description": "Everyone is a Storyteller. The story you tell can change the world. Extraordinary ideas travel the currents of time like actors in search of their next great role. We are not the first to ponder the mysteries of the universe and hope to find its key. What we are now \"discovering\" may have been known thousands of years ago. \"Wisdom of the Toga\" is both entertaining and thought-provoking as it delves into the realm of interpretive mythology, storytelling, science, and pop culture to uncover a common thread woven through time...mythic patterns that shape our lives. Laying out a pathway from ancient humankind's struggle for survival to our fascination with space exploration, the reader is guided on a captivating journey to reveal that \"long ago and far away\" the course was set to determine the part each of us will play in humankind's unfolding story; for as long as the Fates allow.",
