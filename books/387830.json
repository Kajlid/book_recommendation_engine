  "description": "Answer Me This! ( ) is a weekly interactive comedy podcast, presented by Helen Zaltzman and Olly Mann. In each show Helen and Olly answer listener-submitted questions, as diverse and fantastical as \"Why does golf bring out the worst in people?\", \"Who invented the scotch egg?\" and \"Why do all girls hate me?\"In the Answer Me This! Question Compendium, Helen and Olly bring their trademark irreverence to the page for the first time in an inventive and witty spin on the classic Q&A format.Since its debut in January 2007, Answer Me This! has been chosen as an iTunes Podcast of the Year in 2008, and in 2009 became the first independently produced podcast to be nominated for a Sony Radio Academy Award. With listeners all over the world, and more than 1.5 million downloads per year, the show is now one of the most popular comedy podcasts in Britain.",
