  "description": "Natalie Harlow’s professional life is on track. Junior Vice President and account manager to Brighton New Media’s biggest client - Fitson Entertainment Groupe - she has everything she ever knew she wanted. All she has to do to keep it that way is hide the fact that her nights are spent with Fitson’s Chief Creative Officer, James Fitzgerald (known only to her as Gentleman Twelve). Their secret meetings under the guise of work are thrilling, but Natalie is constantly on alert that someone could find out - it is against Brighton policy to date clients - and bring to an end everything she has worked so hard to earn. James, meanwhile, is growing tired of pretending in public that Natalie means little more to him than a stranger, and has hinted at an ultimatum: him or her job. Straining the already-burdened relationship is Celine, James’ soon-to-be ex-wife who has come to Los Angeles with a secret of her own; Ivy Whitcomb, an opportunistic co-worker with a past connection to Fitson; and Joe Gallo, who has his professional (and maybe personal?) sights set on Natalie. Can Natalie and James' relationship withstand bombshell revelations and secrecy? Find out in this provocative follow-up to SINFUL REUNION and CANDIDATE FOUR!",
