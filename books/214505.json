  "title": "Martin of Gfenn",
  "description": "Martin of Gfenn is a work of historical fiction telling the story of a 13th century artist who, at nineteen, contracts leprosy. He fights physical deterioration and social stigma to do what he believes he was meant to do - paint fresco. His short journey takes him from Augustine cloister where he grew up, to the streets of a rapidly growing Zurich to a hospital for lepers built by the Leper Knights of Jerusalem, the Knights of St. Lazarus, in the village of Gfenn. The story is inspiring; its philosophical focus is Christ's teachings from the perspective of Martin whose leprosy, youth, passion for painting and education have conspired to make him an early day Christian humanist",
