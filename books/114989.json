She is in her final year of university and they are having a hard time making ends meet.

She does, however, meet a client, a handsome white man named Peter Elsworth. The sparks fly immediately, but thereâ€™s a huge problem. Her father, and his mother, are vehemently opposed to an interracial relationship. This leads to tremendous conflict, but their love will not be denied. They grow closer, yet the closer they become, the more the tension rises. In time a secret connection between their two worlds become clear and this adds another dimension of conflict and complexity. But love is color blind and they are irresistibly drawn to one another.",
