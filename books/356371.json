  "title": "Backwoods Ethics: Environmental Issues for Hikers and Campers",
  "description": "The classic guide to low-impact camping and hiking techniques. When Backwoods Ethics was originally published in 1979 it was hailed by environmentalists and wilderness managers as a prophetic call to reevaluate the impact of outdoor recreation on the wilderness. Now, more than twenty years later, its warnings and advice are more relevant than ever. The authors present a stringent ethic of low-impact hiking, camping, cooking, and alpine management techniques in an attempt to preserve the wilderness experience for generations to come. The huge increase in the popularity of recreational hiking and camping since the original publication of this book makes its message even more relevant today and its potential audience even larger.Author Biography: Laura and Guy Waterman are known throughout New England for their passionate commitment to hiking, climbing, and conservation in the White Mountains of New Hampshire.
