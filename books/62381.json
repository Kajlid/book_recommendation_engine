For another, Cary has to confess about his alter ego and hope Antonio forgives him. Just when Cary thinks he's figured it all out, past and present collide and he is forced to choose between the family he wanted as a boy and the one he has come to love as a man.\nNote:\n The Blue Notes Series can be read in any order.
