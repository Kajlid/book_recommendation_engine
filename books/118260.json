  "description": "Sarah is in shock when she and two other waitresses are called into her boss' office, and accused of stealing. She is even more in shocked when both of the other girls claim that she is the one who has been stealing. Travis looks at beautiful young Sarah and thinks that maybe with a little discipline she could turn out, and become a good worker. He informs her that he wants her to work for him at his house over Christmas so she can pay him the money she owes him back. While a snowstorm rages outside Travis starts having long talks with Sarah's bare bottomed over his knee, but still she won't confess. He feels that she just needs more convincing, even if his hand is already getting very sore. During the day they spend time together making Christmas cookies and food for the birds but at nighttime he works on reforming Sarah. Meanwhile both are captives of the blizzard in his huge log house, high up in the mountains. Travis punishes her for stealing, but the truth is, the only thing she stoled was his heart. Will they learn to get along, or will their impasse continue for their whole stay? Age 18 and up.",
