  "description": "In 1977 The Blyton Summer Detective Club unmasked the elusive Sleepy Lake monster - another low-life fortune hunter who would have gotten away with it too, if it weren't for those meddling kids. By 1990 the former detectives are haunted by strange, half-remembered events that cannot be explained by a guy in a mask. Andy, the once intrepid tomboy now wanted in two states, wants answers. To find them she will need Kerri, the former kid genius now drinking her ghosts away in New York with Tim, an excitable Weimaraner descended from the original canine member of the club. They will also have to get Nate, the horror nerd currently residing in an asylum. Luckily Nate has not lost contact with Peter, the handsome jock turned movie star who was once their leader... which is remarkable, considering Peter has been dead for years. The time has come to get the team back together and find out what actually happened all those years ago. It's their only chance to end the nightmares and, perhaps, save the world.",
