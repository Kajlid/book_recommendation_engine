  "description": "\"Sera must die.\"   I thought that despite my curse, I could live in peace with the princes, but fate won't let me have my way. The famines of our kingdom continue to worsen despite my efforts. And a vision from the princess has stated I'm to die to fix it. I'm now public enemy number one, and the princes are receiving political backlash because they're sticking by my side.  Fate only has worse in store, but at least I have four delectably firm butts to keep me company.   Continue Sera's journey in this second book of Sera's Curse, a reverse-harem series! Things get more heated in this installation, and it veers toward New-Adult Romance.",
