Just a number. So, I texted him.Iâ€™d never done anything like it before.It felt so dirty and wrong, but at the same time, I felt alive.He was much older than me, so intimidating and sexy.He made me feel things no man ever has.I was under his spell.The last thing I expected was to ever see him again.While this book is best enjoyed going in blind, it does contain distressing themes that may upset some readers.
