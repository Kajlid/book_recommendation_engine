  "description": "Organization—that’s what I do. Control—it’s my middle name.Hello. I’m Elizabeth – your personal concierge. My job is to play fairy godmother to the rich and famous.The universal rule book may say to never mix business with pleasure, but its author never worked for Grant Morgan, my sexy and brooding client. As a top attorney in Manhattan, Grant is used to calling the shots and dominating everything he touches. He also changes girlfriends as often as I pick up his dry cleaning. A part of me still wishes I could let him command my body and take me in ways I've never imagined, though.\nOne moment of weakness is all it takes to change everything forever.\nAddicted—I can’t get enough of him. Consumed—He’s all I think and dream about.The book has officially been thrown out the window. I’m in love and completely terrified. With lines blurred, I find myself lying, cheating and stealing to protect myself from being hurt. But my choices affect more than just me and now I’m not so sure what I’m trying to protect myself from.Will love be enough to erase all I've done? Or have I made the biggest mistake of all?",
