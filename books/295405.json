  "description": "I need a woman to help me shut up my big Greek family.  And my new intern is perfect for the job, though pretending to have a relationship with her might be a little taboo.  Good thing I’m in charge.  Being a self-made billionaire, I haven’t spent much time looking for love.  None actually.  Lucky for me, it’s fallen right into my lap.  This pretty American girl has zero sense of direction, but a good heart and a sexy smile.  I’ve always been smitten by a woman that needs rescuing, or so it seems.  Something tells me that she might be more than I bargained for.  Either way, I just need her to fake it for me until it appears real.  Funny how real it quickly becomes.  Every Good Girl Deserves a Bad Boy. ~ Weston",
