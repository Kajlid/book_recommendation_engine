  "description": "Francine is stunned when she discovers she’s been married - for the last ten years! - to Benny, the surly and nerdy frenemy she worked with one summer in Vegas. How in the world did they end up married? They could hardly stand each other! Though there was that drunken night….She tracks down Benny, sure he’ll be as shocked about the marriage as she is, sure he’ll be happy to dissolve their union ASAP so she can get the documents she desperately needs. But Benny is now a cold and wolfish billionaire. And yes, he’ll sign the paperwork…for a price: she has to spend the next three weeks playing his doting wife.",
