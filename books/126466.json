  "description": "Honey Whiskey is not a standalone book; it is the second book in the Bastards series. In order to fully understand the characters and storyline, without feeling confused, you must read the first book about Matty and Jo, Always Been Mine. The Bastards live in a world that most don’t understand. We follow our own rules, only accountable to each other, the innocents we protect, and the people we couldn’t save. Each of us wears a mask, hiding behind a polite smile and a respectable job, covering the monsters inside. I made peace with who I was a long time ago. I have no regrets.Except one. I've been in love with Jo Walker for years, always standing on the sideline, playing the only position I could. When she looks at me, she sees her best friend; he's the man I want to be. I blew it once; I walked away, leaving her with more questions than answers, knowing it was best for both of us. A few months without her made me realize that nothing mattered if I couldn’t have her. I need to get her back, and I’ll do anything she asks, including telling her my darkest truths.I expect her to run away and never look back. That’s the smart thing to do, the safe thing to do. I’m no good for someone like her. This life will only syphon all the goodness away, leaving her bitter and cold. It seems like my choice should be easy. But, I’m not letting her go without a fight.
