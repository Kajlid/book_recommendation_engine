  "description": "Billy has no idea what prompts him to take in a ragged, dirty man off the streets. All he knows is that Montana calls to him somehow, and that he always listens to his instincts. Montana, or Tanny, thinks that Billy is crazy, because nobody is that nice. Not in his experience, anyway.Tanny brings all sorts of problems with him, from addiction to trouble with the police. Billy is determined to make Montana whole again, and he thinks he knows just the thing to replace Tanny's favorite high. All Billy has to do is help Montana get back on his feet, and then he can teach Tanny all about his lifestyle.Too bad no one believes that Tanny is redeemable, least of all Tanny. Billy's friends threaten to become overprotective, the people who populated Tanny's life on the street pop up at the most inopportune moments, and Tanny thinks that Billy is far too good for him, a homeless guy fresh off the reservation, scarred and way less than perfect.Can Billy convince Tanny to give him, and their newfound relationship, a chance? Or will the reality of Billy's lifestyle scare Tanny off just when life is starting to get good again?",
