  "description": "Ann Michelle is tired of her boring, sheltered life. She longs for something real . Then she meets Raquel Marissa Diaz-Raq for short. Sassy, streetwise, and totally fearless, Raq is everything Ann Michelle isn't. She has a voice to die for and the attitude to go with it, and she'll stop at nothing to be a star. All Ann Michelle wants is to go along for the ride. Even if that means leaving home to go on the road with Piper, both girls' favorite hip-hop artist. And shedding her identity along the way to become Glitz, a bolder- but not necessarily better-version of herself.Crackling with authenticity, energy, and heart, Philana Marie Boles's first young adult novel is about the true meaning of friendship and the pitfalls of fame.Watch a Video",
