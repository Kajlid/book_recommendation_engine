  "description": "In Eve Calder's Sugar and Vice, things are heating up at the Cookie House when star pastry chef and amateur sleuth Kate McGuire finds herself in the midst of a shocking murder mystery. OUT OF THE OVEN Lately, Kate has a lot on her dessert plate. She's launching a cookie-of-the-day challenge in the heart of Coral Cay, providing sweet treats for the reception of the town's handsome new veterinarian--not to mention dealing with tourists in town for a pirate festival and the surprise arrival of her former fiancï¿½, Evan, who seems determined to win her back. AND INTO THE FIRE And if that's not enough, a skeleton has been found--in the backyard behind her best friend Maxi's floral shop. Kate knows Maxi could never hurt a fly. Maybe the remains belong to Sir George Bly, a long-dead pirate whose name has become urban legend--until now? It's time for Kate to use every trick in the recipe book to prove Maxi's innocence, and find the truth about the skeleton, before the last of the cookies crumble . . .",
