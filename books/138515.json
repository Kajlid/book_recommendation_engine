  "description": "Debut novel from teen author! Teen author J.R. King completed his debut novel at 12. He spent a year and a half rewriting and revising. The illustrations throughout the book and the upcoming trading card game are based on J.R. King's own drawings. J.R. King's twelve-year-old antihero turned hero, Arianna Kelt, is a reformed thief and wizard seer. Now you wouldn't think being a wizard seer would be such a big deal, but it is a big deal to the Wizards of Skyhall. For you see, those particular wizards are sworn to protect the citizens of Earth from all the things they shouldn't know about--namely wizards, warlocks, and all the creatures of the magical realms that no humans should know exist. Certainly Arianna would like to blame all her troubles on donuts--the vile, corrupting food that has caused her problems more than once--but she couldn't. Well, not quite. The truth was she got nabbed sneaking a piece of cherry cobbler, and just when she thought her luck was running out, she saw the wizard, and of course, seeing the wizard got her into a whole new barrel of problems. Full of humor, action, and adventure, you'll be rolling on the floor with laughter, sitting on the edge of your seat, and turning pages so fast the Law Gnomes will be out to get you too. Enter Skyhall and become a wizard if you dare!",
