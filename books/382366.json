  "description": "With the Upper Sixth firmly behind her, it seemed likely that her rule would be an easier one than that of her predecessor, Chris Rivers, but once again Lesley is destined to encounter - and surmount - overwhelming difficulties. The temporary Head disliked Lesley from their first meeting in Miss Gordan’s study. Jean Cameron was strangely reluctant to become a senior and certain members of the Lower Sixth were determined that some of Lesley’s escapades last year should not be forgiven.",
