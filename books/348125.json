  "title": "From Baltimore to Broadway: Joe, the Jets, and the Super Bowl III Guarantee",
  "description": "While Super Bowl III may be known most famously for Broadway Joe's guarantee, this book explores a variety of overlooked storylines, including Matt Snell's then Super Bowl rushing record for the Jets, the opportunistic Jets defense that forced five turnovers from the potent Colts offense, league MVP Earl Morrall turning over quarterback duties to injured legend Johnny Unitas in the third quarter, and the memorable battle between Johnny Unitas and Broadway Joe on one of the biggest stages in league history. This chronicle gives football fans the inside story on the game that Hall of Fame sportscaster Curt Gowdy called the most important in pro football history, and for the first time get perspectives from players on both ends of the epic battle.",
