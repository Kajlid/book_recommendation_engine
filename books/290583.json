  "description": "In this brilliant first thriller, in the vein of Peter James, a killer goes on the rampage in a quiet Sussex village, leaving only one witness — a woman fighting for her life.On a cold January morning, a nightmare awaits a small Sussex village. A deranged young man goes on the rampage, shooting everyone in his path before taking his own life. It is a senseless, tragic event, but sadly not an unfamiliar one.At least, that’s what everyone thinks. Only Julia Trent — believed to be the sole survivor — knows that there was a second man involved. But after being shot and badly injured, her account of the massacre is ignored.But she cannot let it rest there. Together with Craig Walker, the journalist son of one of the victims, Julia sets out to find the truth. As they peel back the layers of a dark and dangerous conspiracy, they discover the slaughter didn’t begin on that bitter day in January. And worst of all, it won’t end there.From the Trade Paperback edition.",
