  "description": "Love. Vengeance. Madness.Ien Montgomery wants nothing more than to find love and compose music, something impossible under the weight of his family's expectations. When he meets a beautiful violin-prodigy, Kiera McDougal, he is certain he has found his one true love. With her, he imagines a future outside of his parents' control. That is, until a horrible accident tears them apart. Disfigured and abandoned, Ien thinks of nothing but returning to Kiera and exacting revenge on the people that ruined his life - his parents. But, vengeance is empty. Betrayed by those closest to him, Ien discovers that the price for his happiness may be his sanity. Set amidst the landscape of New York's Gilded Age, and inspired by Phantom of the Opera, TRANSCEND takes a journey through Ien's psyche and exposes the fine line between love and madness.",
