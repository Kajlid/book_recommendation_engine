  "description": "From the suburban streets of Melbourne to the wide plains of the Wimmera, this collection recreates the rhythms of small town life between the wars and into the 1960s. Through the tangle of family relationships and the shock of a sudden death, the characters travel across the landscape of the mind as well as Australiaâ€™s wide and distant horizons. Multi-layered and original, these short stories capture perfectly the disparity between a desire for freedom and the need to belong.",
