  "description": "Shocking, intimate, often uncomfortably honest,  Adore  reaffirms Doris Lessing’s unrivaled ability to capture the truth of the human condition Roz and Lil have been best friends since childhood. But their bond stretches beyond familiar bounds when these middle-aged mothers fall in love with each other's teenage sons—taboo-shattering passions that last for years, until the women end them, vowing to have a respectable old age.",
