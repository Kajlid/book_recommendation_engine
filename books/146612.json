  "description": "I built my empire on blood and betrayal, turning my heart to stone after losing the only woman I ever loved.Love is a weakness I can’t afford. But then Isabella Rossi walks into my world—scarred, defiant, and hauntingly like Sienna. She was supposed to be a pawn in a dangerous game, a surrogate to secure my legacy. Yet her strength and fire awaken feelings I buried long ago. Falling for her is a risk I can’t take. In my world, love doesn’t save—it destroys.Betrayed by my father, I’m sold to Lorenzo Vitali—a man who embodies the darkness that ruined my family. He demands I give him a child, a choice that should shatter me. But it’s not the demand that terrifies me; it’s him. His icy exterior hides a dangerous pull I can’t resist. I hate myself for wanting him. Falling for Lorenzo means losing myself. Men like him don’t love—they devour. And I refuse to be consumed.",
