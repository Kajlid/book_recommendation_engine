  "description": "He could look…and this time he can touch! Each year, Hong Kong's most kissable businessman Oliver Harmer allows himself one Christmas present: a lavish meal with off-limits Audrey Devaney. Keeping her at arm's length—quite literally!—is a battle of epic proportions for Oliver, but also an irresistible temptation. Until the year she doesn't come. Now the rules have changed! Because, this Christmas, Audrey is single, and Oliver must decide if he will let her run away at midnight for good, or fight for her to stay until morning!",
