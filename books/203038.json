  "title": "Four Major Plays, Vol. 1: A Doll House / The Wild Duck / Hedda Gabler / The Master Builder",
  "description": "Among the greatest and best known of Ibsen's works, these four plays--A Doll's House, The Wild Duck, Hedda Gabler, The Master Builder--brilliantly embody his landmark contributions to the theater. Rich in symbolism and often autobiographical, each work deals convincingly with the human emotions of greed, fear, and sexual hostility, and confronts the external conflicts between reality and illusion.
