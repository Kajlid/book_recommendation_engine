  "description": "\"He’s exactly what I never knew I wanted.”\n\n“Delicious is my life.”\nOwning his own business gives Gavin Campbell the sense of security that was sorely lacking in his childhood. He’s poured everything he has into making his bakery, Delicious, a thriving success… and it’s worked. Between his small circle of close friends and his round-the-clock work schedule, Gavin really doesn’t think there’s anything missing in his life. Or if there is, he certainly doesn’t have time to worry about it.\n“I’d do anything for you. You know that.”\nWith his warm heart, outgoing personality, and generous nature, Ben Edwards is the walking definition of a people person. Everyone likes Ben, even the string of ex-girlfriends who wish they could have inspired him to want more than the casual dating that seems to be the only thing he’s capable of. Ben wouldn’t mind sharing his life with someone, but he has yet to meet the person who makes him want more.\n“I want to be the one who takes care of you.”\nWhen Ben asks Gavin to be part of a promotional campaign for the small, home town bank that has been in his family for generations, he inadvertently causes an accident that leaves Gavin unable to work. While Gavin worries that he’ll lose everything that he’s worked so hard for, Ben is blindsided by his unexpected attachment to the other man. Thrown together, both will find that just because nothing is missing, it doesn’t mean they can’t each find exactly what they need once they finally come together.",
