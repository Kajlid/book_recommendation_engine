  "description": "They say nothing bad ever happens in quaint Askergan County. To Cody Lawrence it sounds like the perfect place for a family winter getaway. But everything 'they' say about Askergan is wrong... dead wrong. For the first time on record, a blizzard is blowing over Askergan—a storm so powerful that it knocks out a local power line, trapping his family inside with no heat and no electricity. Cody believes all he has to do is to protect his wife and daughters from frostbite. But when he hears a haunting voice in the blizzard urging him into the storm, he realizes that the stakes are much greater than frozen fingers and toes. Something in the driving snow wont be content until Cody heeds its call and delivers his entire family, presenting the gift of their smooth, supple skin... Readers describe Skin as: “…stomach churning…” “…vivid…” “…bizarre…” “…gripping…” “…engrossing…” If emotionally flawed characters, crisp dialogue, and action-driven plots turn your crank, then you will enjoy Logan’s psychological exploration of how guilt and remorse shape decisions in the face of unspeakable horror.Grab your copy of the raw, emotionally charged thriller Skin today! *Revised edition; includes editorial revisions and the first two chapters of the sequel Crackers* Other Books in the Insatiable Series Book 1: Skin Book 2: Crackers Book 3: Flesh",
