In April, he kidnapped and slaughtered two Baskin-Robbins employees.They called him \"The Fast Food Killer\" but his real name is Paul Dennis Reid, Jr. When he was caught and sentenced to seven death sentences, yet a new chapter began in the saga of one of the most heinous serial killers in our time, and the people whose lives he cut short. The victims were reduced to being called \"the victims of Paul Reid.\" Until now.
