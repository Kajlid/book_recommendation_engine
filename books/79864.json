  "description": "There is a legend in this world of a weapon that only the most wicked of souls seek. It has passed down through the years since before the coming of the gods and each time it's been found, it granted its master the power to conquer. The power to rule. In the past, it was known by another name, but now it is only known by Rune Breaker.After decades of dormancy, it just found a new master.Only this time, things will be different. The new master of the Rune Breaker is an escaped slave-soldier of the Hailene Army of Ascendancy. She never sought the weapon. She does not want to conquer or rule.Making that choice won't be easy, for the Rune Breaker is not a sword or bow, but a man; a shapeshifting mage bound to serve whoever finds him as punishment for his ancient crimes. And his sentence has done nothing to reform him. Now, with a villain from before history bound to serve a heroic soul, the question must be answered: Can evil be turned to the cause of good, or is the taint of darkness all corrupting and absolute?Before they can find out, they must brave a world alien to both of them and the attentions of a foe who stalks them in hopes of gaining access to a power beyond the gods.Collects the first book of the web serial novel, Rune Breaker by Landon Porter.",
