  "description": "Emily Fenwick, formerly with the NYPD, is now the reluctant defender of 1890 New York. Ignoring her inner voice, she went to a carnival in Central Park and entered a Victorian tent in hopes a psychic would have some encouraging news. The guarantee she received of meeting a tall, dark, and handsome stranger comes with a huge catch - he lives in an alternate dimension of the past.",
