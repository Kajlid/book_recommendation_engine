  "description": "In exchange for her kingdom's protection, Oriane agrees to live under a demon lord's roof and tyrannical rule. She becomes his captive in all but name, his cruelty towards his enemies knowing no bounds. When his latest batch of prisoners includes men from her castle, the fallen angel princess must race against their impending execution to free them.  ...But it soon becomes apparent that there could be a traitor in their midst. Could it be her intelligent and reserved tactician, her hotheaded guardsman, or her kind-hearted chef?  ***This is the beginning of a dark reverse harem series, containing fantasy and paranormal elements, as well as multiple love interest. No love triangles here! Warnings for scalding smut, graphic violence, and coarse language. Recommended to 18+ readers who don't mind darkness creeping into their romances.",
