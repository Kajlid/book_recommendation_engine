  "description": "\"Run Sallie Run\". You may remember reading a similar sentence in the Fun with Dick and Jane books as a child. What was Sallie running from, and why did she feel the need to run? Humorously, this pocket book looks at dating from the perspective of the mature single again woman, and uses song titles and music lyrics to delve into some of the reasons why the author believes that Sallie may have been running. The author was widowed for almost two years after a 32 year marriage when she started this work, and through her dating experiences and various conversations with other mature single women, has come up with several reasons why Sallie may have needed to run like hell from the situations she may have found herself involved in. The topics in the book are meant to evoke laughter, sometimes at yourself, as well as awaken a sense of alertness if you happen to relate to any of the circumstances addressed. If nothing else, use the book for a conversation piece when you invite your girlfriends over for a cup of coffee or a glass of wine to compare running scenarios. Then compile the information discussed and send it in to runsallierun@yahoo.com for the sequel book. Most of the topics addressed are not in any particular order of importance but randomly cited.",
