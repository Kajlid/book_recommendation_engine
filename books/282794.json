He is more than ready for a month-long break from his offensive coordinator responsibilities. Until a public fight with the Piranhas' star tight end, Colton Roth, and the subsequent media fallout, results in the pair being forced to spend the summer at Camp Lost Lake together.Colton is almost as good at antagonizing Coach Conley as he is at playing football, but as usual, his behavior has landed him in hot water. Now, his position with the Piranhas is on the line, and he must stay away from any potentially scandalous situations. Trying to stay on his best behavior doesn’t last long though, and after hooking up with Coach Conley, it looks like Colton might have put the final nail in his career’s coffin.Can Colton and Eli survive an entire month in the middle of nowhere together? And will either of them still have their careers intact after the summer is over?Being Enough is a 45K word MM romance that includes an NFL player and coach who think they hate each other, a summer camp in the middle of nowhere, and an inebriated game of spin the bottle. This is the second book in the Portland Piranhas series, but it can be read as a standalone.",
