  "description": "The first time I saw Wolf Ramsey was at his family’s estate in Kauai. He was huge and imposing. Armed to the teeth. When he looked right at me, fascination wasn’t my first reaction. It was fear.His outrageous good looks were shadowed only by his wild intensity. You could tell he would be reckless and brutal. Even from a distance, his dark, dangerous energy made my heart beat faster in a way I wasn’t expecting. I knew he would take me places I’ve never been and ruin me, body and soul. I was relieved when it was time to leave.But before I could escape him, one single announcement changed my entire life. Because it’s not going to be my sister who secures the family alliance between the Ramseys and the Fitzpatricks.It’s going to be me. And my new husband-to-be, Wolf Ramsey.WILD HEARTS is a steamy new adult arranged marriage romance, set in paradise.Note to readers: Wild Hearts is the second book in the Paradise Series. It can be read as a standalone, but this book contains spoilers to Book 1, so it is recommended that you read the first book in the series, Devil's Angel (Paradise Book 1), before reading this one.",
