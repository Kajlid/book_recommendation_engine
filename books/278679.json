As the junior owner of the family business, he knows better than to look for love \"on the clock.\"  Jonas Chadwick is the new guy at the firm. Older, wiser, and a survivor of the school of hard knocks, he's not in the market for an office romance, even if he knows for certain his young boss is gay.  One kiss is all it takes to send Micah and Jonas on a collision course, and when bodies collide, the friction gets hot...  Gay / Contemporary",
