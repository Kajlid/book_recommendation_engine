  "description": "***Due to sexually graphic content and language that some may find offensive, this book is intended for mature readers only***  That voice in her mind, she couldn't be completely sure but it sounded so familiar to her.  Ananda discovered that she can read other people's mind when she was 11. It is supposed to be a gift but it's driving her crazy. Her parents can't understand her and the only person who can, her brother Ryan, is off to the university.  Lonely and disoriented, Ananda runs off to New York. She thinks that in a city as big as that, there must be someone like her walking around. She instead meets Kerri, her best friend, with whom she cannot read thoughts, which is a welcome development.  Ond day, while walking around New York City, a man's voice calls out to her. Ananda should've been happy; it was what she was in New York for. But she's just scared. She decides to go home only to realize that her apartment may have an intruder.  Things happen so fast. One minute Ananda is in the arms of a stranger, being hushed. Then she follows the stranger, Jared, to the car. They end up in a motel, in bed, exchanging body heat and fluids.  But who is Jared?",
