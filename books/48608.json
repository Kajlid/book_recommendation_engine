  "description": "THEIR FIRST MISTAKE was ever telling the world about the wonders they had found.They should have kept it all a secret. If they’d kept it a secret, fewer people would have died. When archaeologists uncover the largest ancient safe in the world, the wrong kinds of people will show up: criminals, mercenaries, treasure hunters. THEIR SECOND MISTAKE was opening it.Why would an ancient culture devote three generations to build a giant stone safe? Why would they bury it so the jungle could hide it from the world? Why ritually sacrifice one hundred thousand people to ensure its secrecy?THEIR LAST MISTAKE proved the biggest.This last mistake hurt the most. Their last mistake was to assume that nothing had been left behind to keep guard….Special note for Kindle format: PLAZA has an active table of contents, is approximately 90,000 words, and displays seamlessly with Kindles and all other eBook reading devices.",
