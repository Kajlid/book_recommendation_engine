  "description": "Ladies, never stop believing that you have honor, integrity, and strength. This book confirms this, giving examples of why this is true. Women have had to endure abuse throughout history but have still remained strong; raising families, positively contributing to society (even though they often don't get credit for their accomplishments).This book, years in the making, gives girls and young women a better understanding of who they are and the kinds of people they may have to deal with in their lives. As we're not born knowing what is explained in this short book, hopefully it will provide wisdom, helping women to make wise choices in life.The understanding of a negative situation often helps us to make peace with it and experience forgiveness - which ultimately benefits everyone.",
