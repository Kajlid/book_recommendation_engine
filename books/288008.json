  "title": "The Rebound",
  "description": "After the ending of a long-term relationship that brought her nothing but stress and tears, Madeline JenkinsÂ is ready to have some fun. Do something wild. Spontaneous. Maybe a little risky.  In other words, she wants to be nothing like her regular quiet self. Not forever. She likes herself. But she wants to try something new--just for a little while.  What better way to have some fun than to fall into an ill-advised, no-strings-attached fling with a very hot man. True, Ken isn't an ideal rebound guy. He's the sheriff, he's ten years older than her, and she's known him for years. They have nothing in common except an intense attraction that seems to come out of nowhere.  But that makes it easier. Ken is just her rebound. And no matter how good he makes her feel about herself, it's not like they'll ever want each other for real.",
