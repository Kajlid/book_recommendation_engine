  "description": "Have you ever had a relationship so powerful that it haunted you when it was over? For Laura Brooks, a relationship she had in college continues to affect her life as a grown woman, professor, and mother of three. Laura and Nick shared a brief and intense romantic relationship that ended when Laura graduated from college. A few years later, Nick committed suicide, leaving Laura to wonder about a relationship that could never exist. Things become even more complicated when she develops the same connection with a living man who is as elusive as her ghost. Maybe, like Laura, you have experienced a love so strong that you find it hard to let go. You may wonder why you continue to hang on to the feelings left by a relationship that is over. Why would you continue to feel connected to a person who is no longer in your life? Throughout this book, Laura faces her ghost and follows a journey to determine why he still haunts her. Along the way she follows cues from the universe that help her to appreciate her continuing connection to this man. The journey is one that we all make at some point because love never seems to come at the right time or in the form we want. My Ghost tells the love story of the entire human race and helps us understand why we remain connected to people who have left our lives. It explores the concepts of soul mates, synchronicity, and unconditional love.",
