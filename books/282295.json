  "description": "I knew I’d ruffle feathers, but the day I walked into Rockport High, I had no idea the cheap shots that were to follow.  You see, the Ballers and I have a history. They play basketball. I play basketball. But they hate that I play basketball as good as them. And the only thing they hate more than that, is me.  That’s right. I’m a girl, and I. Can. Play. Make no mistake about it.  The Ballers can do their worst, but I will make it onto the RHS boys’ team. This is my last resort to make a name for myself, and I can’t let them interfere—even if the so-called kings of the school have declared war against me.  Game On is a reverse harem high school bully romance novel.",
