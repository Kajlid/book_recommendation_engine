  "title": "White Crow",
  "description": "Some secrets are better left buried; some secrets are so frightening they might make angels weep and the devil crow.\nÂ \nThought provoking as well as intensely scary, White Crow unfolds in three voices. There's Rebecca, who has come to a small, seaside village to spend the summer, and there's Ferelith, who offers to show Rebecca the secrets of the town...but at a price. Finally, there's a priest whose descent into darkness illuminates the girls' frightening story. White Crow is as beautifully written as it is horrifically gripping.",
