  "description": "Former Marine and amateur scub a diver Bob Mintz discovers a sunken German U-Boat off Murrells Inlet, SC in the days after Hurricane Hugo. In doing his research on the sub, he finds a mystery. This sub was supposed to have been given to the Japanese, and scuttled after WWII. How could that be? And why would a submarine be so close inshore in notoriously shallow coastal waters? He enters the sub and finds a document that boggles his mind; one that could have far-reaching consequences on the balance of power in the world, and perhaps launch a nuclear holocaust. He teams with a buddy from the Corps, ex-CIA agent Jim Hopkins, and what they find takes them to South America, to the mountains of Chile, and into the very offices of the Vice President of the United States.",
