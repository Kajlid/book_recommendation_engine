The Summer Ridge estate is besieged by illness, demons and horror, leaving our  intrepid adventurers to ferret out the true nature of the black magic in Kensington. Just  as Archie and Lucia are settling into their courtship they find everything they have  worked for may burn to cinders.  The one thing everyone knows about Archimedes Merriweather is that he is more than  just a wizard. And the time has come to prove that  Magic does not make the man.",
