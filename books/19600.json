But he is an only son with five sisters, and when his father suffers a heart attack, Eli gives up his writing to assume responsibility on the farm. Though willing to abandon his dream of becoming an author, he won't give up his beloved Phoebe.Can their love for a good story develop into something that lasts forever, or will Phoebe's deep-seated fear of desertion stand in their way?",
