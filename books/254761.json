  "description": "Everyone seemed to preach for higher education, but no one teaches you about this shit. Damned if you do, damned if you don't! Triggered by life's choices, 'adult-ing' is a constant battle between creating this successful social media worthy life and never leaving the couch again. \"WTF am I doing with my life\" has become my daily mantra and little did I know, I wasn't the only one of my friends who was facing this depressing crisis of being unfulfilled, confused and upset by the uncertainty of life. This book is the conversation I wish someone was real enough to have with me, before I rushed to grow up, while I was struggling to figure life out, the truth that, although may have been ignored by a know it all attitude, would have been helpful so I wasn't caught so off guard. I want to inspire and motivate people through the conversation about being an adult. The conversation I wish someone was real enough to have had with me. Of course, at that time I would have ignored with the typical \"I'm grown\", know it all attitude, but a heads up would have been appreciated.",
