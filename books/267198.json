He was my first love, but so out of reach with where fate had taken me. With a little girl to look after and a past I wished I didn’t have, things were never going to be easy when it came to my life in this small town. Let alone my love life.At least that’s what I thought until he showed up. A former flame who still ignited a part of me I thought had long gone. As if life wasn’t complicated enough. Two men want me, two men kissed me… and my heart is split between them both.Autumn Night Whiskey is book 2 of a contemporary romance duet. Tequila Rose must be read first.",
