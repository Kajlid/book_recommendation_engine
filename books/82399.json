  "title": "The Flavour Of Liberation",
  "description": "The Flavour of Liberation is the first two volumes of an inspirational guide on how to meditate. Unlike most works on this subject, it concentrates upon the experiential flavour of meditation. It is a comprehensive collection of discourses on all aspects of healing and concentration practice, which explains and clarifies key elements of the path in a simple and lucid manner, whilst inspiring the reader to keep developing their meditative potential. Burgs draws on his wisdom gained from his time in Asia, learning with his teachers in Bali, Burma and India. Since then, over the ten years he has taught meditation in the UK, he has developed his own unique teaching system that brings together both the systematic approach to meditation as well as the more profound transmission of the direct approach, both of which are the cornerstone in Buddhist traditions. He takes us on a journey of penetrating insight. Beginning with an incisive investigation of the human experience, the book progresses through meditation as a tool for healing and the refinement of character, finishing with clarifying instructions on how to start developing the deep states of samadhi (including jhana) that are the culmination of meditative stability. This unique work is an essential guide for those intereseted in meditation, and is a must read for those wanting to learn more about how beneficial meditation can be to one's daily life.",
