  "description": "After the success of my last paperback book 'Lockdown 2020: 5 Minute Poems', I decided to sit myself down and write some more 'Challenging' Poetry.It's taken me some time, but here are a few based on the different emotions that we ‘the human race’ are faced with throughout our lifetime.All these poems were written on a personal level and reflect times in my life that have either been challenging, or just plain life-changing.I would like to donate 50% of any proceeds to the Mental Health Foundation.I hope you enjoy :-)",
