  "description": "Joy Newhouse is the diva of the airwaves, a relationship expert who scores big with listeners for her jaw-dropping, scathing commentary on men, women, sex - no subject is taboo for this provocative radio shock jock. When she's fired suddenly by new management, Joy isn't happy off the air and out of the spotlight. So she writes a book that features her most titillating calls and letters, a bestseller ripe with the kind of gossip intended to put Joy back where she belongs: on top.Soon, however, negative and righteous feedback from those listeners she exploited in her book stirs up a media scandal, giving Joy a crisis of conscience - and a taste of payback. Perhaps it wasn't so wise of her to hitch her star to her readers' most personal stories - tales of secret affairs, office romances, baby-daddy drama, cheaters, swingers, sibling rivalries, job infighting and more. Perhaps there's a better way to reinvent herself?",
