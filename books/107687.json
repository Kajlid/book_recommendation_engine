His plan gets derailed when he bumps into an old friend, Serieve, who manages to get them swept away to another land. Suddenly, they are caught up in the middle of plot by the evil King Nicholas to assemble an ancient unholy artifact that will enable to destroy all life in the land. Now, they must work with the other unfortunate souls who have been stranded there --a strange wizard, an elf, a priest and a particularly irritating assassin named Andrea-- to stop Nicholas before he destroys everything they hold dear.
