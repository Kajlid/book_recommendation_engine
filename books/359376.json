  "title": "Jouvert Morning: Selected Poems",
  "description": "Jouvert Morning is a collection of poems that centers around the theme of love. At times, love is enticing and sensuous as in 'Love You, I do' and other times love strangles and kills as in 'Fallen Sister.' Included in this collection of poems is 'So Much Love,' which depicts the agape love of God for a suffering humanity. Jouvert Morning also illustrates the infinite nature of love. Love has no beginning or no end. Time and space cannot contain love. In 'Virgin Bells,' the sound of bells tolling ushers in the longing of love lost long ago. Love births life and transcends death. I urge you to come experience Jouvert Morning in its attempt to embody this complex emotion we know as Love.",
