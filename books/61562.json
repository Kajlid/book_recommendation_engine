  "description": "One vampire’s obsession may spell the undoing of them all.New Orleans is a place full of culture, history, and a literary atmosphere, which draws people from around the world. Cynthia O’Connor is one of these people. A student by day and a vampire movie buff by night, she never suspected that in the dark of the theater among the dusty curtains was the very thing she salivated over, that as she dreamed of vampires, a vampire dreamed of her. Ripped from the protective covers of her bed, Cynthia is awakened in another world, a world where the monsters are real, and a threat waits around every corner. For a blood feud long thought ended is about to begin again, and the clan Wrath is all that stands between the secrets of the night and a war that could rip the fabric of human reality asunder.",
