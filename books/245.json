  "title": "You Can Take the Cat Out of Slough...",
  "description": "The author decided to stay home with his two-year-old daughter for a summer and the disaster-prone tabby cat Birmingham—Brum for short. The result is a series of hilarious tales filled with death-defying feats. All aspects of normal life, including gazebos, small birds, and kitchens all take a dangerous turn in the presence of Brum. Efforts to train and restrain the tabby are fruitless, but in spite of it all—including the exuberant Maya and her plastic mallet—Brum carries on.",
