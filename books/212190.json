  "description": "After his successful first job as a vampire hunter, Dom continues his search for his father and brother…  When the head vampire of the Blood Order, a sinister and omnipotent clan of vampires, discover that Vincent Beauchamp was involved in the slaying of their lieutenant, the elite and shadowy Blood Order declares war on Beauchamp and his daughter, breaking their longstanding peace treaty. Permanently hiring Dom to carry out his mission is Beauchamp’s only hope. After all, he needs a protege to continue with the work he began so long ago.  With such little experience in slaying vampires, Dom questions his ability to save Beauchamp. He’s seen and experienced so much–so quickly. But he knows his duty, and his duty is to slay the vampires who stand in his way. Will Dom and his thirst for justice be enough to help Beauchamp take down the Blood Order once and for all?",
