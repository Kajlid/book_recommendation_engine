  "description": "It's 1975 and 16-year old Bev can scarcely believe it when the dishiest boy at youth club asks her out. But then Mike dumps Bev for the girl down the road and Bev's whole world falls apart. Thankfully Bev is off to stay with her French penfriend but her passion for all-things French turns sour when faced with the lack of public toilets and endless dusty museums in the searing Provence heat. Horribly homesick, Bev counts the days until she lands back on British soil and can meet up with old-flame Simon whoâ€™s working at a hotel in Weston Super Mare. But Bev just can't get Mike off her mind...This is Bev's real-life 1975 teenage diary in the raw: hilarious yet tearful, bitchy yet philosophical, laugh-out-loud yet toe-curlingingly embarrassing. If you liked Rae Earl's 1980s Mad, Fat Teenage Diary, you will love this real-life diary from the decade that taste forgot: the 1970s.Now a positively ancient 55 and thankfully no longer with a pair of platform shoes in her wardrobe, Bev's 1975 diary, along with all her other teenage diaries from the 1970s, is dedicated to her 19-year old son to prove that his middle-aged mum was once a teenager too!",
