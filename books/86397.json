  "title": "Erotica Universalis : From Pompeii to Picasso",
  "description": "From the dawn of time, ever since Adam and Eve, all artists of every age—whether the Egyptian, Greek and Roman artists of Antiquity, or more recent famous names as Rembrandt, Courbet, Degas or Picasso—have succumbed to their fantasies, obsessions and libido, and produced erotic works that the censors have taken good care to keep from the public. For Erotica, we surface from the subterranean realms of the museums to enter those of our national and private libraries. Here we discover that not only most of our famous writers, such as Ovid, Aretino, Voltaire, Verlaine or Maupassant, wrote erotic texts that bordered on indecency, but also that great artists like Boucher, Fragonard, Dalí or Matisse were inspired to provide suitable illustrations for these naughty books. For this special anniversary edition, we have culled highlights from our Erotica Universalis collection. A banquet for the imagination and a feast of the eye!",
