  "description": "Denise has always been a strong woman and the men in her life have expected her to be just as demanding and dominating under the covers. She never met the man that made her heart pulse with desire or who took control, because she was always in control, and it left her empty inside. Despite a successful career, and graduating at the top of her class in the FBI academy, she never had the same success in love. Her problem was she held a secret that she didn't even want to admit to herself. A secret so dark and twisted that she pushed it to the bottom of her heart and hid it there. She had a secret desire to feel conquered, and completely ravished in bed. She wanted to be tied up and teased until she cried out in ecstasy. Denise never met the man she felt safe sharing her secret desire to submit to. Until the day she met Victor.",
