  "title": "Ellie's Legacy",
  "description": "When 15-year-old Ellie's parents move her from Australia to live in the Scottish castle they've been left by a relative, she knows she's in for a culture shock. Bad weather, next to no phone or TV reception and a dearth of entertainment are to be expected, but from the moment the plane arrives in Scotland, her life changes in ways she never imagined. Nothing in the remote highland village of Glenwillow is as it seems and it's not only the locals who are keeping secrets - her parents are hiding something, too. But when she falls for gorgeous and mysterious teenage groundsman, Flynn MacAlister, none of it matters, until Ellie discovers his is the biggest secret of all.",
