  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN: B0992S9DF5A deadly killer stalks my every move, but they’re messing with the wrong witch-wolf assassin.Why would anyone think hunting a psycho hybrid with a supersized wolf form and crazy volatile witch powers is a good idea? It’s a mystery. But you do you, killer.I’m Graves, kickass hitlady extraordinaire, and I’m a teensy bit unbalanced. But that’s okay because my mates—dominant alpha Dean, insane vampire Slasher, sweet bookish Brannigan, adoring wolf Hugh, and ruthless Edison—are just as unhinged, and they love me just as I am. Even if I do have a tendency to get stabby, come home covered in blood, and attract danger like flies to … well, you know.Two more trials, and I’ll have proved my worth to the powers-that-be of Blake Hall. I’ll avoid prison and get to keep my magic and shifting abilities. But with someone determined to kill me, and a secret society scarily obsessed with me, these trials will be anything but straightforward.But Rebel “Graves” Falcon is no quitter. I’ll find this hunter and spill their blood and guts even if it kills me. Which it just might.Blood Wolf is the sequel to Killer Crescent, a paranormal romance with psycho men, a badass FMC, twisted romance, and lots and lots of bloodlust. Secret societies, killer wolves, dangerous vamps, and cunning witches lurk in these pages, but all of them will meet the sharp end of Rebel Falcon’s knife. This book is medium burn, with moderate heat, and multiple love interests.The release date is a placeholder and WILL be moved forward to 2021.",
