He might have started this fight, but I'm going to end it, whatever it takes. Will it cost me the chance at becoming an angel again? Or will I be able to silence him and earn back my wings?Reaping Angel is the second book in the Fallen Redemption trilogy, featuring a fed-up former angel, buried secrets from the past, and a cold, hard look at the ugliness of life—and death.
