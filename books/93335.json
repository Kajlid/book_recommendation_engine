Her estranged son runs a rival winery, and an alcoholic neighbor, Len Dougherty, lives on ten acres of the Rutledge vineyard given to his family as compensation for the accidental death of his father. Meanwhile, beautiful, ambitious Kelly Douglas, a rising TV newscaster, is assigned to prepare an in‑depth report on the Rutledge winery, which is in negotiations to merge with a French winery.
