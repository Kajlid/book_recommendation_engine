  "title": "The Eyes of Un-Cried Tears: A Ukranian Battle Cry",
  "description": "My name is Dasha. I was born and raised in Kyiv, Ukraine. I had always wanted to be a doctor. My goal in life was to help others. I am the first person in my family to attend university. Once, my life was perfect. Once, I had a husband. Once, I had children. Now, I have nothing. Nothing but eyes filled with un-cried tears. I thank you all for your support of my country. Money from this book goes directly Ukranian people. It will be used to buy basic necessities for those, living in shelters. Many shelters, all over the world, have been set up for refugees. Many of which, are independently funded. Even if you do not buy this, please donate. There are many platforms online, including amazon. Thank you all. Love, Dasha",
