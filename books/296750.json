  "description": "He was born a weapon. She became one to destroy him.Dark. Dangerous. Deadly.Those facts should’ve kept me away from this underground world where people disappear and never return.They didn’t.His mistake: Taking Zoe, someone I consider a sister. I will stop at nothing to get her back. Even if it means infiltrating a notorious organised crime ring in search of the faceless ghost who plucked her away.My mistake: Not expecting him. Julian—the guard surrounded by a shroud of darkness and mystery. I'm helplessly and dangerously drawn to the man within.The more I get lost in him, the riskier my mission becomes.What if Julian is more than a mere guard?What if he’s related to this man called Ghost?Ghosted is a standalone mafia romantic, contemporary suspense with tones of darkness. For a better understanding of Team Zero's world, you might want to read Lured and Crowed first. Due to language and sexual content, this is advised for mature audience only.",
