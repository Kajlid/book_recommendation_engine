  "description": "Nina Roth and Elizabeth Savage come from different sides of the world - from utterly different sides of the social track. But under the skin they are the same: desperate to escape from a past which dragged them down, determined to make an extra mark on the world in spite of appalling personal tragedies. Drawn together by coincidence, held together by recognition, they are both determined to succeed. But they are both unlucky in love - and have enemies who will not willingly let them succeed. And the trouble with being a tall poppy is that people always know where to find you ...'Her novels are action-packed; her heroines gorgeous ...I loved it' Daily Mail",
