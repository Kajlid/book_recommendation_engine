  "description": "Green chile has never been more dangerous.Maddie Swallows had always intended to be a psychologist. But becoming a wife, mother, and tenured professor—that was more than she’d ever dreamed. Until it all implodes and she finds herself without a job, divorced, and a single mom to two teenagers.Despite needing a therapist of her own, Maddie returns to her New Mexican hometown to open her own therapy office.Except, she’d forgotten how difficult it had been growing up in a small town, and returning as a forty-year-old woman doesn't make it any easier.When Maddie is invited to a New Year’s Eve dinner party, she’s reluctant to go, but determines it would be better than staying home--she can’t hide from town gossip forever.Until a member of the town council winds up dead before they've even had appetizers and everyone at the party is suspect.",
