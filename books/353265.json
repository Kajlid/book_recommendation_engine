  "description": "A modern vampire tale which takes you for a journey across continents and time, following the title character. Von Dred is a refreshing twist on the vampire tale. The story follows the main character from his humble beginnings in a borough just north of London, to his days at university, his loves, triumphs, losses, and life. Once he is sired his tale continues as he searches for the answer to how and why he became the monster he is. His strong religious upbringing weighs heavy on his conscience. He resigns himself, eventually, to his fate – liar, thief, murderer…vampire. Our protagonist, no longer able to see his family, wanders around England and Europe, and eventually goes to America on his quest. He tries to figure out whether he is running away from something or to something else. All the while, his one big question goes unanswered – “Is there someone out there who will love me…forever?” Von Dred is not just a novel it is a journey full of unexpected twists and turns, love and indifference, disappointments and debauchery, blood and tears.",
