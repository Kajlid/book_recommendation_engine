  "description": "Luke: Being a submissive guy with anxiety isn’t easy. I’d be tied up in situations and then feel the mind avalanche begin, helplessly watching as it would tumble out of control and ruin the moment. Then I met Adam: A handsome police officer who swept me off my feet and out of my boring life. He’s got a dominating, authoritarian personality but carries a quiet gentleness with him everywhere he goes. Just being around him keeps my anxiety at bay. And better yet, he’s into the same things I’m into. He wants to show me his playroom…  Adam: My whole world felt like it stopped the second I saw that angelic man in the bookstore. When I saw the name of the book he was carrying, it told me everything I needed to know. Once I got to know Luke, I learned that his past partner was a bully in the bedroom — and not the fun kind. It’s up to me to show him how amazing and tender a real dominant can be. The only problem is, he’s bossy. Even though I’m the one giving the commands, he knows that he’s the one in control. Luckily I have a few kinky tricks up my sleeve…  **This is an 80,000+ word romance novel about 2 men in a relationship. It’s a standalone novel with no cliffhanger, no cheating, and HEA guaranteed. Readers can expect several extra spicy scenes that would make a ghost pepper jealous.",
