  "description": "Women are missing and dying in the Triangle area of North Carolina. One woman holds the key to why.  With the conclusion of the Y-Man murders nine months ago and her resignation from the FBI, Former Special Agent and Behavioral Analyst, Rainey Bell has finally found peace and contentment she never thought possible, even if she remains a bit paranoid. Her wariness is well-founded and justified when a monster from her past rears his demonic head.  Rainey has faced death and evil before – alone. Now it’s different – she has a family to protect, her own. Only Rainey can keep them alive. Or can she?",
