  "description": "She’s sleeping with the enemy…and might be catching feelings.When Zoey Seever’s best and only friend Skylar is unceremoniously dumped on the night of her Prom, the last thing Zoey wants to do is get involved with the girl responsible for breaking her best friend’s heart. Chelsea McDaniel has a reputation at their rival school for using girls up and tossing them aside when things get serious. It’s the same sort of rumor people have been spreading about Zoey ever since she abruptly ended things with an ex-girlfriend of her own. Soon enough, Zoey finds herself roped into Skylar’s plot to make Chelsea pay. The plan is simple: Zoey will seduce Chelsea, make her fall in love as only another heartbreaker can, and then cruelly dump her at her own Prom. But Zoey isn’t the coldhearted girl her own best friend thinks she is. She doesn’t use girls. She’s hardly even properly out of the closet. And Chelsea is more than just an attractive stranger; back in middle school, she was also Zoey’s first kiss. Caught up in a whirlwind of deception, guilt, and her own growing feelings, Zoey will be forced to decide between the only friend she has left and the girl she might be falling in love with…who may want nothing to do with her once she finds out the truth.The Gay Girl's Guide to Ruining Prom is Amazon-bestselling author Siera Maley's newest young adult lesbian romance.",
