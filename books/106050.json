  "title": "The Path of the Spiritual Sun: Celebrating the Solstices and Equinoxes",
  "description": "The ancient veneration of the sun is one of the greatest celebrations in history. It has been encoded in sacred texts and sites by peoples separated by vast distances for thousands of years across the world.Although often looked at as simple-minded sun-worshipers, there is another reason why the ancients aligned some of their most inexplicable and advanced sites to the sun and stars, and encoded the movements of the heavens in their sacred teachings.The sun, source of all light and life, is central to a cosmic spirituality that is both ancient and timeless—and as ever-present as always. Its principles have formed the basis of many of the world’s religions—unbeknownst even to many of those who follow them—and are just as relevant to people searching for spirituality today.The Path of the Spiritual Sun by Belsebuub uncovers the profound spiritual significance of the veneration of the sun, pulling together the sites, texts, traditions, and symbols from around the world that were based on the solar cycle to reveal the common thread of spirituality running like a current of eternal knowledge through all of them and imbued in the very fabric of creation itself.Contains a guide with ceremonies and mantras to celebrate the solstices and equinoxes based on ancient practices from around the worldIn The Path of the Spiritual Sun, Belsebuub has created a comprehensive and practical guide to the celebration of the sun.
