  "description": "In The Wicked Pleasures Anthology, twelve short stories carefully selected by the renowned Cecilia Tan explore the many facets of kinky love. With contributors from the United States, England, Australia, and Canada, as varied as their stories, the themes cover the entire spectrum of BDSM activities, including spanking, bondage, and role playing. These pleasures are wicked but not evil, always focusing on mutual pleasure and consensuality. A longtime dominant husband decides to switch roles with his submissive wife for her birthday. A woman who loves being spanked throws herself a unique bachelorette celebration. A finicky dom goes to a charity auction intending to buy a whip and ends up going home with something else entirely. A small-town girl who long ago left home for the big city's vices comes home to find that although the town hasn't changed, her ex- has. An overworked school principal can't leave work behind until her best friend buys her an exclusive weekend treatment at a very special \"spa.\" These stories and many more await the adventurous reader in The WIcked Pleasures Anthology. Contributors include: Kris Cherita * Elizabeth Coldwell * Cynthia W. Gentry * Ralph Greco, Jr. * Alex Picchetti * Jean Roberta * A. Silenus * Cecilia Tan * Peter Tupper * Sage Vivant",
