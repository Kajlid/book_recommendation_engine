  "description": "\"Cinderella has never seemed so real.\" | Lissa Clouser \"Darkly beautiful and wonderfully well-written.\" | Cherie Reich, author of The Foxwick Chronicles A Cinderella sequel. Money can’t buy love, but magic isn’t a sure bet either. Cinderella, now officially a princess, finds royal life is not what she once dreamed. When a mysterious elf from her past stirs up long-suppressed passion, Cinderella begins to wonder if there really is love beneath the spell that captured her husband’s heart. But undoing magic can be harder than casting the initial spell, and the results are even less predictable.",
