  "description": "Nocturne: Book Two (The Celtic Vampyre Saga)262 pages (print length)After Nathaniel and Faelynn find more than an invaluable confidant in one another, together they begin to boldly journey deeper into the odyssey of their own destinies. Vowing to aid Nathaniel in his quest for salvation, only if he takes her to see the one she believes is responsible for all the heartache in her life so she can savour the sweet taste of vengeance, Faelynn finds herself making the long trek to the isle of Newfoundland, the dominion of Cormack de Crüel. Unknown to Nathaniel, Cormack and the vampyre elites are secretly meeting at the secluded Castle de Crüel in order to put the final pieces in place for the creation of a North American Vampyre Union—an insidious organisation that has only a dark and twisted agenda in store not just for humanity, but also vampyrekind. Has Faelynn unwittingly placed herself in harm’s way by putting her trust in Nathaniel? Or has Nathaniel foolishly placed himself in the line of fire by choosing to help someone other than himself for the first time in over two centuries?This intriguing and passionate saga would be attractive to the habitual readers of Gothic literary works, paranormal romance, and horror.*Warning: Some scenes within Nocturne: Book Two (The Celtic Vampyre Saga) contain graphic language and explicit sex.*",
