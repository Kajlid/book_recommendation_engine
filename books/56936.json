  "description": "Provence: the annual pilgrimage to Saintes-Maries of gypsies from all over Europe. The Duc de Croytor, distinguished folklorist, is there and so is Englishman Neil Bowman. But there is something different about this year's pilgrimage. A small group of gypsies have something they are determined to hide, and Bowman soon learns that curiosity is highly dangerous. From the terror of murder during the Provencal cours-libre in the bullring to an exciting action sequence out at sea, the pace builds up, the MacLean magic never falters.",
