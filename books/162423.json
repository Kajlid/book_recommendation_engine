  "title": "Fearless Part III: All-American Monsters",
  "description": "Part III of IV in the first novel of the Dartmoor Series.  As the club prepares to bury one of their own, the rival Carpathians MC takes new, unexpected steps toward drawing the Dogs into an all-out war. With the city of Knoxville turning against them, the Dogs walk a knife-edge between defending their turf and their families, and engendering some goodwill in this city they refuse to relinquish. Defenseless against remembrance, Ava must choose between the future she built for herself in college, and the future she’s wanted since girlhood. Because Mercy’s all-in this time, and heaven help whoever gets in his way.  Told in installments, this rich narrative travels from the swamps outside New Orleans to the foothills of Tennessee, spanning fourteen years, following a family of outlaws bound by brotherhood, blood, and a love that knows no boundaries. Get all caught up with Part I: Lying Down With Dogs, and Part II: Crossing Lines, available for Kindle download.  Fearless will conclude in the fourth and final installment, “Follow You Home,” available December 2014. A compiled, full edition of the novel is due for release in paperback and ebook January 2015.
