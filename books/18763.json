  "description": "The Auschwitz Chapter is an historically complete, precise and definitive account of what took place at Auschwitz concentration camp during World War II, where crimes against humanity were perpetrated by Nazis against Jews, Slavs, Roma, political prisoners, homosexuals, and artists. And all humanity. This Auschwitz Chapter is taken from Lee Vidor's novel, Under Total Eclipse We Will Tremble Like Birds Without Song, which is an historically accurate fictional account of Europe under Nazi Occupation. Even though The Auschwitz Chapter is only a concise single chapter in the novel, more than 2 years were spent researching every existing published eyewitness account of imprisonment at Auschwitz, in order to ensure complete accuracy. It is not suitable for reading by those under 18 years of age. Many more reviews of Lee Vidor books can be found at Lee Vidor ‘I believe I missed no eyewitness testimonies and that the account here given is absolutely accurate in every detail. It is the most specific and accurate description of events and processes at Auschwitz which exists. Every single detail in The Auschwitz Chapter has been confirmed from more than one eyewitness source, from photographic evidence and court documents. I believe it is the single most reliable and harrowing piece of literary writing ever done on the subject of the events which took place in the Nazi concentration camps during World War II.’ Although fictional, the piece contains many precise facts which are extremely difficult to uncover and which are coherently gathered together nowhere else with such accuracy and completeness.
