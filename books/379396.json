And Scooter’s last wish is crazy: find his own long-lost father and return the signed first edition of Of Mice and Men that his father gave him before he took off.Before Nick knows what’s happening, he and the quirky Jaycee are off on an odyssey of their own to track down Scooter’s dad—and to discover a little something about themselves, their friendship, and growing up in the process.",
