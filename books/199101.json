  "title": "The Unexpected",
  "description": "Hannah grew up in a world of extravagant parties and gated communities, without ever knowing what the world around her was like. Sheltered and home schooled by her mother, her only sense of reality came from what she read in books. But, the books did not portray the real world she would soon face. At the ripe age of 18, she enters her first semester of college where she meets Jordan. A boy who she believes to be anything but Prince Charming. Yet, Jordan doesn't give up on Hannah. Even though he grew up with nothing, he wants the girl who naively grew up with everything.",
