  "description": "The Secret History tells the tale of a boy who grows to maturity in the turbulent world of mythical Middle-earth. In the present volume, the eleventh of fourteen, he returns to the West after sojourning for many years in the East, to retrieve a weapon of great potency, to use against the Enemy, Morgoth. During his stay in the City of the King of the Ã†lves, he encounters difficulties, but he is aided by those who recognise his fate. In the other volumes in the series, we follow his childhood, youth and adulthood, as he progresses from obscurity to the climactic ending of the tale. The present volume is some 10,800 words long. Future volumes are in preparation.",
