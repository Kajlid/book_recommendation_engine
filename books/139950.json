  "description": "Iteration upon Iteration, the Observers have watched the world. They have seen it begin mid-motion with people unaware they did not exist the prior moment. They have seen it end abruptly with people erased between one moment and the next. For millennium they have been privileged to observe worlds on behalf of the Creator.Until now. The most recent world, Iteration 145, is broken. All evidence points to the schism among the Observers as the source of the problem. And the solution might require immortals to die.Everything that is made must one day be unmade.",
