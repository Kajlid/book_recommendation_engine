  "description": "“How’s your atlas?” The answer to this simple question could change your life . . . and the entire world. The atlas, the first cervical vertebra of the human spine, encircles the brain stem and acts as a suit of armor protecting the central nervous system. But what happens when the integrity of that barrier is compromised? catastrophic, system-wide failure, manifesting in the form of disorders, disease, and a devastating reduction in overall quality of life. And most people don’t even know it’s happening to them. The most effective care for this problem is also the most non-invasive. It requires no surgery, no drugs, and no lifestyle change. And it’s been around for over 100 years. After watching his brother suffer from the life-altering effects of a sports-related neck injury, Dr. Steve Judson’s passion became helping humans to heal from within, unleash their innate healing power, and reach their fullest potential through chiropractic. Now, he is speaking out, sharing this powerful truth with you. This is not just a book about human health. This is a book about coming alive. It's about challenging your preexisting notions about life, discovering your purpose as a human being, and unlocking your innate potential. Too many of us are asleep, unaware of an incredible truth that could literally save our lives if we only understood its power. Are you ready to wake up?",
