  "description": "Take your partners, please.Suburban witches, defiant old ladies, ageing monsters, suicidal Lottery winners, wolfmen, dolphin women and middle-aged manufacturers of erotic leatherwear: in these twenty-two short stories by Joanne Harris, the miraculous goes hand-in-hand with the mundane, the sour with the sweet, and the beautiful, the grotesque, the seductive and the disturbing are never more than one step away.\"Jigs & Reels\" is Joanne Harris's first collection of short stories. As she says in her foreword, a good short story can startle, ignite, and illuminate... giving you vivid, anarchic glimpses into different worlds, different people. Here, she proves she is as good as her word by creating an eclectic selection of tales for our times that will delight, surprise, entertain and horrify in equal measure. Sly, funny, sometimes provocative but always personal, \"Jigs & Reels\" shows a side to Joanne Harris you have never seen before. So go on, be tempted. After all, it's only dancing.",
