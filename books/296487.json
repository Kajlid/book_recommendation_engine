  "description": "The last thing I expected on the first day of my dog sitting job was a middle-of-the-night fire alarm. Things go from chaotic to scorching hot when I run into my old crush, Miles Thatcher, on my way out of the building.Talk about disastrous timing. I haven’t seen him in years – five to be exact.Since the day we buried his sister – my best friend.That was both the best and worst day of my life.It was also the day Miles kissed me – and promptly forgot about me.Some things never change. He still has no clue who I am. Miles is no longer the boy I fell in love with. Now he’s just a stuck-up big shot with a big bank account and bigger ego.I wish I didn’t still have feelings for him but seeing him again only makes me want him more. If only Miles would finally ‘see’ me.  A lot can happen over five years, but time hasn’t erased the guilt he carries. Underneath his fancy façade is a man who can’t get over the grief of losing his baby sister... or the regret of not being able to prevent it.And I’m just the girl who can’t get over him.",
