  "description": "Think you know about gargoyles? The beautiful winged race disappeared eight hundred years ago. When they last walked the earth, they traveled in close-knit packs, their throats marked with ancient runes. Their greatest enemies were the ugly and brutal harpies that people today mistake for gargoyles.The victim of a harpy attack at seventeen, Dare lost his wings along with his poisonous barbs. When he meets Mim, he doesn't consider himself much of a catch. But Mim is the only power that can make the broken gargoyle whole again. And when she's abducted by a harpy, he's willing to sacrifice himself for her freedom.Which might have worked, if Mim hadn't been willing to do the same thing.",
