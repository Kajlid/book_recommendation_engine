  "title": "Hubris: The Inside Story of Spin, Scandal, and the Selling of the Iraq War",
  "description": "Filled with news-making revelations that made it a New York Times bestseller, this fast-paced, behind-the-scenes narrative tells the inside story of how the Bush administration used bad intelligence to sell--and then justify--the Iraq war. Veteran reporters Michael Isikoff and David Corn take the listener behind the scenes at the White House, the CIA, the Pentagon, the State Department, and Congress, where controversial decisions and turf battles were fought in the highest circles of the Bush administration. Hubris connects the dots between George W. Bush's determination to get rid of Saddam Hussein, the role of the neoconservatives in pushing the case for war, and the outing of a CIA officer, which led to the indictment of a top White House official. It's a dramatic page-turner and an intriguing account of conspiracy, backstabbing, ineptitude, and, perhaps most especially, arrogance.",
