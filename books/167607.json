  "description": "At times we must embrace chaos to find sanity, and sometimes we must destroy in order to save.The beginning of a new generation is underway and life has settled into a deceptive normality for the inhabitants of Mars’ first city, Alkebulan. Commander of the starship Yamakara, Col. Zune Adamini, however, senses that the protection offered by the ancient intelligence they found on Mars is finite. It is almost certain that their guardian will one day leave to find its own place in the universe, having finally fulfilled its directive. Following his instinct, Col. Adamini plans to send two teams on separate missions while they can still utilize their remaining time with the AI’s presence.With limited time, one team must venture into the darkness to update the ancient alien star maps or risk the dangers of having to someday do it alone. A second is sent to Earth to finish building the sister ship to the Yamakara before nature destroys what is left of it. The Yamakara has ferried humanity to its new home, but the years and the distances traveled are beginning to show.Two missions meant to better the last foothold of humanity quickly unravel, potentially costing the lives of the crew and leaving humankind stranded on an inhospitable planet…a planet they are forced to call “home.”Both crews will struggle to understand what is real and what is right. In the end, decisions will be made, leaving none unscarred. And for those who make it home, humanity will never be the same.",
