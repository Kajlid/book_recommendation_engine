  "title": "Arabian Affairs",
  "description": "Arabian Affairs is a collection of humour stories, loosely based (as title might suggest) on the traditional Arabian Nights collection. In these new tales, the mischievous Author masterfully draws you into his madcap world, inhabited by unfaithful harems, thick caliphs (save for Just Ar Rashid), mad sages, rogue merchants and a plethora of other dodgy characters. It is hilarious, sharp-witted, colourful and last but not least - not at all preachy. In short - while Arabian Affairs resembles The Alchemist in some superficial respects, it is much, much funnier. Enjoy the experience, and may the people's respect follow you like jackal follows the camel.: -)",
