  "description": "The world we knew is gone. The world of commerce and frivolous necessity has been replaced by a world of survival and responsibility. An epidemic of apocalyptic proportions has swept the globe, causing the dead to rise and feed on the living. In a matter of months society has crumbled: no government, no grocery stores, no mail delivery, no cable TV. In a world ruled by the dead, the survivors are forced to finally start living. The events of No Way Out have affected everyone in the Community, and not everyone has survived to pick up the pieces. Reprinting issues #85-90 of the Eisner Award-winning series, The Walking Dead.",
