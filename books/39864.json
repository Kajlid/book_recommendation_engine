  "description": "The first new English translation for more than 35 years of Balzac's extraordinary The Wild Ass's Skin, it is also the first edition in English to include Balzac's original Preface of 1831. This novel has been freshly translated by Helen Constantine, who captures Balzac's stylistic energy and exuberance. Patrick Coleman's wide-ranging introduction considers the multiple perspectives of the novel, its conceptualization of historical change, and its satirical commentary on contemporary society. His extensive notes clarify Balzac's many allusions to the culture and society of his time. The book also includes an up-to-date bibliography and helpful map of Paris in 1830.About the Series: For over 100 years Oxford World's Classics has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.
