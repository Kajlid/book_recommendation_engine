  "description": "A SINGLE ROUND, is a collection of short stories from a HARD PLACE. Stories of moonshine and shotguns, obsession and transcendence, love and darkness, and the blindness of human desire. Each tale follows a painful path to one ultimate realization: the devil’s deal always ends badly, often with a single round. The head that was found on the blacktop tells a tale in Johnny Fucking Carson.Tommy watches his dream love become a nightmare in Together Forever.Fame has a dark side, Becoming Famous echoes the age old warning, ‘Be Careful what you wish for’.A story of realization, loss, and transformation takes flight in Redwing. Never judge a book by its cover, even one with fangs, as a surprise awaits in Doc’s Choice. The Grounded, sometimes the dream of escape should remain a dream. A tale of a man who fell in love with a woman who forgot him in The Dog Walker.The Ride will make you second guess what you thought you were sure of. Check out the podcast A Single Round, inspired by the soon to be released Hard Place novel.Both the novel and the graphic novel are scheduled for release in 2021 as well as another collection of short stories, A Lead Pill.For Hard Place updates, sign up at deadcatstud.io.",
