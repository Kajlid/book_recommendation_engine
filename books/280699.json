  "description": "A queer mytho-history of ancient Ireland.*Finalist for the 2020 LAMBDA Literary Award in Transgender Fiction*Long before history began, when Ireland was ruled by poets and tribal chieftains, the prophet Sinnach was the most powerful druid in the ancient province of Mumu. But before he was a prophet, before he was a poet, he was a just boy... a boy believed to be a girl. Unable to suppress his true nature, Sinnach fled persecution and sought refuge in the wilderness. By his nature, his talents, and his oath to the goddess Ériu, Sinnach came to find his place in a world shaped by poetry, magic, and combat.Yet the attainment of great power is not without consequence. Sinnach is inadvertently entangled in the dangerous affairs of both men and Síd, the Faerie Folk. His perilous travels into the Otherworld, the conflicting passions of love, and the return of an old enemy threaten to endanger his identity, peace between the tribes, and peace between the worlds.Inspired by the great mythological epics of ancient Ireland, this is a new myth that tells very old truths about who we were, who we are, and who we might become.",
