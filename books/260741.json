  "description": "Six-year-old Jillybean finds herself alone for the first time in months. She’s in between wars, assassins aren’t after her, and she hasn’t killed anyone, accidentally or on purpose in almost an entire week. What ever will she do with herself? If you know anything about Jillybean the answer is unsurprising: She destroys a million-dollar racing car, sets a town on fire, falls in love, and awakens the first of the hideous giant zombies that will eventually come to rule the world and drive humanity into the sewers where they will scrounge like rats, pecking out a bleak existence. In other words, a slow Monday for Jillybean.",
