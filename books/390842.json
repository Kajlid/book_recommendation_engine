There are meetings with remarkable comedians -some like Paul Merton at the height of their powers, others like Dick Emery and Benny Hill in sad decline - and Bob reflects on what makes comedians great. Above all here is a wealth of wonderful true adventures, star scandals and gossip about the famous and infamous personalities hes known initmately, with more stars than the most lavish Royal Variety Performance, Peter Sellers, Rex Harrison, Les Dawson, Elton John, Larry Grayson, Bing Crosby, Beryl Reid, k d lang and Luciano Pavarotti. As Bob puts it, All the good stuff I couldnt put in my autobiography because there wouldnt have been room for me!' There has always been room for Bob in the hearts of the British public, and this very, very funny book is just one more reason why he so richly deserves his place in our affections.",
