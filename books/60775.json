  "description": "Forget Hell, this is Gehenna. You die, you’re damned and then you wake up here, but that’s not the end of the story. If you don’t redeem, or die the second and final death, you slowly turn into a demon—and then you really do belong in hell.Michael Thane is running out of time, the change from man to demon is eroding what little humanity he has left. His state of mind isn’t helped when he’s framed for a series of brutal torture-murders so vicious they’re threatening to shatter a two thousand year-old truce. Forced to go on the run, he snatches the one human who knows he’s innocent, Special Constable Elizabeth Grant. Murder and an all-or-nothing hunt through the worst parts of hell are not their only problems. They have to figure out who is trying to return Gehenna to a true hell of torment before it’s too late.",
