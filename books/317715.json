  "description": "Lutecia Peacock was at her wit's end! And it was all due to Russell Currie. The sexy-as-all-get-out farmer who had helped raise Lutecia after her father died refused to see that she was a grown-up now-and a pretty sensational looking one at that. What was more, he flat-out rejected the fact that she was desperately in love with him-had been for years! There was only one thing ot do: turn up the Georgia heat full steam and show Russell that she was the woman for him-now and forever!",
