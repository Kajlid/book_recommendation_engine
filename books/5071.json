  "description": "In the heart of Texas lives a family as big and bold as the state itself. The Daltrys are as different as they come, each with his or her own strengths--and weaknesses. Every time a Daltry turns twenty years old, they are presented with a task by their grandmother. These challenges are intended to teach them about character--but they often learn quite a bit about love along the way...Venus Daltry was the beauty of the family--and she made sure everybody knew it! But the refined Texas belle almost lost her pretty head when her birthday labor was finally revealed. Venus was to spend a whole year riding on horseback from Texas to Nevada-helping a dime novelist write his latest book!And the moment Venus met author Sanford Buchanan, she knew she was in big trouble. Sanford seemed rough, uncultured... and, shall we say, blind to her legendary charms. But Venus's nightmare turns into a labor of love when she becomes smitten with her reluctant partner-and is determined to make sure their story has a very happy ending...",
