  "description": "Seven friends. Beers, bets, and bull runs. What can go wrong? The enduring power of friendship disguised as a booze-soaked, contemplative travelogue.In summer 2006, twenty-year-old Gerald Yeung and his childhood friends from Hong Kong travel to South America and Africa on their parents' dime. Confronted by challenges foreign to their privileged upbringing, the \"Wannabe Backpackers\" persevere in their Christian Dior clothes. They make plans to do it again when they turn thirty.The decade that follows doesn’t go exactly to plan. Gerald chases the American Dream in a town of twenty thousand and subzero winters. Others pursue a fast-and-furious life in Hong Kong. They all experience failed relationships, career setbacks, and a decreasing ability to impress girls at clubs. The summer of their thirtieth birthdays, they hit the road again to fulfill a lifelong dream — the 2016 UEFA European Championship. Set during European soccer’s most anticipated event, Kong Boys traces a friendship that transcends distance, culture, and time, dovetailing the different trajectories of seven boys in a decade of changes in Hong Kong. Kong Boys is a celebration of youth, brotherhood, and a sport of incomparable beauty.Winner, Wild Card, Hollywood Book FestivalFinalist, Foreword Indies AwardsFinalist, International Book AwardsFinalist, Top Shelf Book AwardsDistinguished Favorite, Independent Press AwardSilver, Readers' Favorite Book Awards",
