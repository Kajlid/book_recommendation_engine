  "description": "From the wild shores of the Scotland's Western Isles to the bloody fields of France to the glittering courts of Europe, the Macpherson Trilogy follows a family's fight for Scottish independence against the Tudor king, Henry VIII. Rite of Passion Elizabeth Boleyn has been ordered to yield to a lecherous king what she most prizes--her innocence. Now, at the tournament of two kings, her beauty has attracted not only the eyes of Henry Tudor, but those of the handsome Scottish warrior, Ambrose Macpherson, whose bold offer to bed her might be her only salvation... Quest of Love Ambrose Macpherson feels desire for the exquisite daughter of the English diplomat. That the hated English king is pursuing her makes Elizabeth an even greater prize, engulfing Ambrose's very soul with fire and fury. But suddenly, after witnessing an act of treachery that could topple the crown, Elizabeth has vanished. Ambrose knows that fate will allow him no rest until he finds the only woman he has ever loved... \"May McGoldrick brings history alive, painting passion and intrigue across a broad, colorful canvas.\" --Patricia Gaffney",
