  "description": "We are the Night Vigil.We keep the Vigil, looking for the ones who can still be saved, the ones who aren't too far gone. We're the misfits and the muck-ups, unwanted by Heaven or Hell, given one last chance to atone for all the mistakes and missed chances, the pain we've caused others and ourselves, the good things we were afraid to do, and the bad things we embraced with open arms.Unfinished business ties us to the mortal world, to make atonement, find absolution, satisfy retribution, get things right. You won't find a sorrier group of halfway house heroes. No illusions leftâ€”about ourselves, humanity, or what's really out there in the darkness. Just a purpose, to go down fighting the good fight. Because this is our last chance.One final chance to make it right, the thin red line of humanity against the evil that goes bump in the night, your best hope to make it through the hour of the wolf.When a series of disappearances, suicides, and vengeful spirits cause havoc and death along a remote interstate highway, demon-hunting ex-priest Travis Dominick teams up with former special ops soldier and monster-hunter Brent Lawson to end the problem with extreme prejudice.",
