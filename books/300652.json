  "description": "Fira is a take-charge light-talent fairy, who never asks for help. So when all the fireflies come down with the firefly flu, who organizes light for Pixie Hollow? Fira. When three new light-talent fairies arrive on the same day, who volunteers to look after them? Fira. And when the mining-talent fairies set off on their monthly expedition into the underground caves, who lights the way? Fira, of course. But she's exhausted, and the deeper the miners go, the more her glow flickers and fades. Fira's full moon may turn out to be her darkest hour!",
