  "description": "Great book, highly recommended ***** —Mystery Author/Reviewer Cy Wyss Milhomme's historical Boston is rich and inviting, and the main characters are well-rounded and unique, yet familiar, like old friends. The mystery is enriched by the codes that need to be unraveled, an area that Milhomme has obviously studied well. One of the best historical mysteries! ***** —Reviewer/Blogger Saradia Chatterjee …In fact, I have even added some quotes from this book to my favorite quotes’ collection…  In their college days, three friends created the Sleuthhound Club to solve local mysteries and crimes, but only one of the friends turned that early hobby into a profession. Inspector Tuohay of the Royal Irish Constabulary has seen a lot of action in his line of business, including the infamous crime that shattered his career—the amazing theft of the Templar Diamond.  Now six years after the theft in 1902, new evidence surfaces as key players (including Tuohay) receive mysterious invitations to \"The Chase\" for the missing Diamond. And who better to help Tuohay find the missing artifact than the members of his old club?  Danger, betrayal, cyphers, ploys…and murder. Crack the code. Solve the murders. Find the stolen Templar Diamond. And stay alive.  All in a day's work.  \nTry your hand at finding the hidden Templar Diamond by following the clues within the novel, and beyond. Readers and reviewers agree—Grace and Disgrace is a mystery that keeps you guessing until the very end.",
