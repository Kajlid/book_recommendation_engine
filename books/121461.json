  "description": "There’s no crying in baseball, unless you want the one thing you can’t have… your coach. ~Austin Healey It all started with a kinky video about a baseball player and his coach. A coach who happened to look just like mine. Now, I can’t get Coach Wolfe off my mind. He’s all I can think about. Teaching me, touching me, praising me for being the good boy I am. Unfortunately, he won’t do any of those things, not as long as I’m his student. But I’m eighteen and about to graduate. ~Marcus Wolfe I would love to have a boy of my own again. A boy who is honest, loyal, obedient, and generous. A boy just like… Austin, who happens to be too young, and completely off-limits . But Austin doesn’t understand limits. He is determined to make a conquest of me. My defenses are wearing thin. I’m only a man, and a man can only take so much. Ball Boy is an MM baseball sports romance with an age gap, power imbalance, and praise kink. This coach/student pairing can be read as a standalone but contains characters from the already published Family Sins Duet .",
