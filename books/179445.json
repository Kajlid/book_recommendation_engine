  "description": "~A London Lovers Series Stand Alone~  When Leslie Lincoln, a spunky, red-headed American, suffers an awkward moment with an arousingly-sexy British man—she thinks her life can't get any more pathetic.  She's done with men. She doesn't need them. She especially doesn't need their muscular thighs. No siree, she's going to forget all about the brooding, complicated, and seductive \"Theo\" who captivated her on the dance floor of a London nightclub.  Keep telling yourself that, Lez.....  Immersing herself into a new type of romantic cleanse, Leslie thinks she'll never lay eyes on Theo again. But somehow, he's managed to bulldoze his way back in—her cheetah-print onesie pajamas be damned.  He wants more. She wants to run. But he can’t seem to let her go. Both of them have a past—and neither want to share. How can love possibly survive in darkness?",
