  "title": "Your Friends and Neighbors",
  "description": "Your Friends & Neighbors is a searing display of the war between the sexes, delivered with the kind of wit used by the great Restoration playwrights to expose the hypocrisies in male/female relationships.Neil Labute's debut feature, in the company of men, was described by Variety as \"a dark, probing, truly disturbing exploration of yuppie angst and male anxieties\". In Your Friends & Neighbors, male anxiety is again on show, but in a much wider context, revealing the rabid desire of people-regardless of sex- to serve their own interests at any cost.",
