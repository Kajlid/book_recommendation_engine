  "description": "Descripción It is difficult to overestimate the importance of Chopin´s Piano compositions, of which this collection represents a substantial and significant part. The Preludes, Nocturnes and Waltzesare overflowing with tonal, technical and textural innovations which, alongside Schubert, heralded the beginnings of the Romantic era of extended tonality and evermore complex methods of expression. These pieces are required repertoire for any serious Piano student or professional performer, rich in clues and signposts that help understand the development of post-Beethoven composition. In this collection, 26 Preludes, 21 Nocturnes and 19 Watzes are presented, including seven urtext editions new to this volume. All edited by Rafael Joseffy.
