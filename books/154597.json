  "description": "Lizzie Brown is all for letting the good times roll…until a dark voodoo church rises up in the bayou outside of New Orleans. Now the ritual fires are burning long into the night and the dead are having a hard time staying that way.Lizzie goes in undercover to put a stop to the madness. Good thing she’s got her sexy shape-shifter husband behind her, as well as her Grandma’s gang of biker witches. Too bad nobody’s watching Pirate the dog, who has become way too friendly with the phantom haunting a long-forgotten Victorian séance room.Secrets and spirits abound. Nothing is what it seems. And when legions of the dead threaten the city, there may be no stopping them.",
