  "title": "The Silas Diary",
  "description": "This imaginative narrative parallels the book of Acts, giving a first-person account of Paul's first journey. We see it through the eyes of Silas, a friend and traveling companion of the apostle. You'll find yourself shipwrecked in the cold Mediterranean Sea, fighting for life with Paul and John Mark as they grab for something to hold on to in the icy blast of an Etesian storm. You'll discover what it's like to ford a river in a hailstorm only to be swept ashore in drenched, cold clothing, far from shelter or friends. The Silas Diary is your invitation to join Silas, Paul, and their companions on a journey fraught with danger and adventure--a journey that changed the history of the world. Learn with the first-century Christians what freedom in Christ really means.",
