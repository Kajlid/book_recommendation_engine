  "description": "Lovelock writes beautifully. A book that is both original and well written is indeed a bonus. - New ScientistGaia is an intimate account of a journey through time and space in search of evident with which to support a new and radically different model of Earth. Bringing knowledge from astronomy to zoology in support of his hypothesis, Lovelock explores the idea that the life Earth functions as a single organism which actually defines and maintains conditions necessary for its survival.Since Gaia was first published in 1979, many of Lovelock's predictions have come true and his theory has become one of the most hotly debated topics in scientific circles. Recently it was the subject of the BBC Television programme Horizon. In a new Preface written for this revised impression he answers recent criticism of his ideas, and underlines the continuing implications of his theory for the future.Jim Lovelock, a man as inventive and ingenious as he is lively and unorthodox, places a daring hypothesis before the general reader, a kind of geochemical myth for our time...This book...is the exciting and personal argument of an original thinker caught up in wonder. It wins and repays attention. - Scientific AmericanJim Lovelock is an independent scientist who has co-operated with NASA in their space programme and since 1974 has been a fellow of the Royal Society.Cover photograph: Tony Stone",
