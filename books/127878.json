  "description": "Lloyd George dreams of playing for his beloved Manchester United and lapping up the adulation of millions of fans across the globe.So when Dundee FC chairman Bob McCracken, a man of vision, ambition and moderately priced suits, offers Lloyd the chance to play his part in restoring the once-proud club to its rightful place in Scottish football, the shy 17-year-old sees it as a stepping stone to bigger things.Instead he finds himself drawn into a battle for football’s very soul waged by Jocky, the team’s moustachioed, mononymous and megaphone-wielding manager, and seeking solace between the thighs of Dundee’s first female binman.A hilarious satire on the “Coldplayfication” of the beautiful game, The Tartan Special One is a love letter to Scottish football delivered in an inimitably anarchic style.",
