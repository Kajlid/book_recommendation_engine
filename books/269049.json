  "description": "An angsty, emotional new adult romance from USA Today bestseller Siobhan Davis. Stand-alone with an HEA and no cliff-hanger. Kent  Rogue. Troublemaker. Bad Boy. Delinquent.Everyone thinks they know who I am, but they know nothing.And that's how I prefer it.Keeping my demons under lock and key is my only survival tactic.Until a gorgeous feisty bartender enters my life, turning it upside down. Presley captivates me in a way no woman ever has, and I can’t get her out of my mind. She’s determined to resist me, but I’m equally stubborn and more than up for the challenge. Winning her trust, and her heart, becomes everything because she shows me a future worth fighting for.But the consequences of my tortured past are far-reaching, and if I don’t let her go, I'll only drag Presley down this dark hole with me.\nPresley\nSince I aged out of the foster system, I’ve worked hard for my dream future, and it’s so close.Too close to let some arrogant rich playboy distract me.I’ve heard all about Kent Kennedy, and with my history of troubled bad boys, I need his attention like a hole in the head.Except he’s nothing I expected and everything I never dared to dream of. As I slowly uncover the truth, I discover a broken man with a big heart who desperately needs someone to see him.I want to be that person, but his demons loom large, and I don’t know if I’m strong enough to do this again.When the past rears its ugly head, shattering everything, will there be anything left of my heart to protect?",
