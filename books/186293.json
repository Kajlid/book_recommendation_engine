  "title": "Language of Tears",
  "description": "In today’s time and circumvent, in the fast paced world we all live in, dictates little time left for sincere understanding of other cultures and languages. The fact is we become agitated when using the phone, when we are asked to press one or tow for the language we wish our conversation to be heard in. Seldom do we wonder, though we perhaps hope, if there is a universal language everyone speaks and understands. A language, regardless of what nationality is speaking, is instantly understood. What if suddenly you learned there is such a language? A language that goes unnoticed, but one that requires no education, no thought…but once seen or heard, is instantly understood by man or woman worldwide.  Travel through the pages of this book and place yourself in the shoes of the characters portrayed. Though fictional, they are true accounts of human behavior.  Martin, in her quest for a different slant on historical and Christian fiction, shows people worldwide, yearn to be heard and understood. And there is only one language that fills that slot, the “Language of Tears”.",
