  "description": "**Levi's not happy the spotlight was on Ryker. In true Levi ego-fueled fashion, he takes the reins back and drops us where he meets Nick. This isn’t a retelling of the stories you’ve already read. Levi wants to tell you the best side of the story—his. You’ll still need to have read the entire series to understand all the characters in Leveled. If not, don’t say I didn’t warn you.  ***You'll be entirely confused if you haven't read all the books in the series.*** Levi I’m man enough to admit I screwed up. I’m not proud of my actions, but it is what it is. I learned from them and now I’m more determined than ever to prove to Paige my heart is hers. Asking her to marry me was the easiest decision. Walking down the aisle was simple. Holding her for the rest of my life—check. Being a sexy, excellent husband—check. Staying undefeated—Damn right check. But Karma has a funny way of getting back at me And with her sneaky fingers wrapping around my throat She sets my ass up and I’m in some serious trouble.   Paige Who would’ve known Levi would become my husband after all the mess? Giving him a second chance was easy. Becoming his wife was even easier. But I never would’ve known life had extra plans for us. Fighting is what Levi does the best, until he’s surprised with two different types of challenges he’s never experienced. Sucker punched—check. Stumbles—check. Challenge accepted—for sure. Levi might have his flaws and faults, but I couldn’t ask for a better man to hold my hand through life. Or maybe it’s me holding his hand.  Can Levi can step up and overcome the obstacles that have been thrown his way or will he be leveled?",
