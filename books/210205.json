  "description": "Book 4 in the Atherton Pack Series Previous Book: COREY  \"You need to go to Atherton,\" they said. Easy for them. The higher-ups at headquarters don't have their whole world on the line. When Detective Damon Kelly's bosses send him across the state on a \"simple\" cyber fraud case, he never thinks he'd meet his mate, then risk losing Kieran by doing his job. No matter what other possible angles Damon works, his partner Grant Davis is sure Kieran's best friend Corey's their guy, and Grant is bent on bringing him in.  After the birth of their Alpha's son, the Atherton Pack needs another beta. Kieran Baxter couldn't be happier to accept. What Kieran doesn't expect is for all hell to break loose his first week on the job. Clashing with his mate at every turn, and fighting a human cop who wants to arrest Corey for hacking a government database, wasn't part of the plan either.  As more evidence piles up, a bigger, scarier picture comes into focus that could threaten not only the Atherton Pack, but everything the world knows.
