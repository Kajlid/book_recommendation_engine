More than a hundred books strong and growing, the saga has sold more than twenty-five million copies in Japan. Vertical will publish the first five installments that comprise \"The Marches Episode\" arc. In a single day and night of fierce fighting, the Archduchy of Mongaul has overrun its elegant neighbor, Palos. The kindgom's surviving royalty, the young twins Rinda and Remus, hide in a forest in the forbidding wild marches. There they are saved by a mysterious creature with a man's body and a leopard's head, who has emerged from a deep sleep and remembers only his name. Guin.",
