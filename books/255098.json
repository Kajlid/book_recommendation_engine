  "description": "Caldecott Medal winner Jerry Pinkney enlivens the beloved fable with cheerful and classically beautiful illustrations, making this the ideal edition for every child’s library.    As he did with his Caldecott-winning The Lion and the Mouse, Jerry Pinkney has masterfully adapted this story of the hardworking hen and her lazy neighbors. Its Golden Rule message and sassy finale are just as relevant and satisfying as ever. Read it in tandem with Pinkney’s Puss in Boots and The Tortoise and the Hare or David Wiesner’s The Three Pigs.     \"Perfect [for] sharing with one listener, or a crowd.\" —Kirkus Reviews (starred review)   “Cheerful [and] luminous. Kids will gleefully chime in.”—Publishers Weekly (starred review)   “A lush light-filled rendition of a folktale staple.”—School Library Journal (starred review)",
