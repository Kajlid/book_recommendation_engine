  "title": "A White Girl in Harlem",
  "description": "Rory is the daughter of a peace loving, liberal pacifist and has been raised in an idealistic bubble out in the country. When her naive father loses his job working for a forestry company and is forced to take his only daughter and move to New York city, he rents an apartment in the middle of Harlem and enrolls his daughter in school there. At first, Rory is delighted at the opportunity to live and be educated around people of color, but she soon gets an entirely different kind of education. The sullen students and resentful teachers at Harlem High do not take kindly to a blonde interloper on their turf, and have a highly developed sexual interest in pale skin and golden hair. Rory must undergo the sadistic punishment of the vice principal, degrading bondage sessions with the principal, and out and hostility, groping and much more in the halls, classrooms and schoolyard, to say nothing of the nearby stores, parks and her own building. Becoming the helpless bondage sex toy of male and female students alike, with sneers and jeers greeting her every appearance, the pretty blonde teen is trapped amid the hostile residents of a dangerous Black slum, where even riding a city bus is an exercise in dark sexual experiences.",
