  "description": "Raised by a family of cops who see the world in black and white,I grew up with a defiant streak a mile long,And an immunity to gun-toting alpha males.That is until I find myself at the Carnage clubhouse,At the mercy of their Kings.Now my black and white world is a dirty shade of gray,And my immunity to alpha males has disappeared along with my underwear.While I find myself torn between my knights in blue and my kings in black leather,A killer emerges from the shadows, ready to rip both my worlds apart.He thinks he knows who I am, he thinks I’m weak,But he couldn’t be more wrong.My name is Reign. I was born to rule,And I’ll do anything to protect the people I love.Even if it means sacrificing myself.Please be advised that this book may cause shallow breathing, exploding ovaries and spontaneous disintegration of panties.
