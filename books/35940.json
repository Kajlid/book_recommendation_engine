  "description": "Dean enjoys women of all varieties, but unless they’re naked and in his bed he doesn’t have much use for them. He trusted his heart and soul to a woman before and he won’t let it happen again. Then Dean meets curvy Catherine Michaels, the mouthy woman claiming to be Gracie Baron’s long lost baby sister. He’s immediately suspicious of the pretty redhead, but he can’t seem to keep his distance. He aches to strip her bare so he can sip at her satiny skin. But once Dean’s had a taste of her succulent body, he wants more. In fact, he wants her for his own.",
