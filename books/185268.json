This novella includes both characters from my Deep Six Security Series and Cat Johnson's Hot SEALs series for Kindle Worlds.***Former Navy SEAL Jaxson Thomas left the teams in disgrace to save his squad from being dragged through the mud with a JAG investigation. He never thought he’d have to leave the civilian job he got after the teams in the same way, but that’s exactly what happened. To keep his friends at Deep Six Security from losing their biggest contract, he takes the blame for an assignment gone bad. But with the SEAL mentality drilled into him for years, Jaxson can’t give up. He goes to work for Guardian Angel Protective Services and hopes his last bad day was yesterday.His first GAPS assignment tells him that won’t be the case though when he is charged with protecting the woman who was directly responsible for his exit from the teams. Fallon Sharpe, a federal judge’s daughter, now a federal judge herself, has taken on an East Coast mafia family who wants her dead. Can Jax keep her safe until the FBI takes them down? Or will he kill her himself before the thugs have a chance like he’s dreamed of doing for five years?",
