Modern technology has collapsed, returning the world to the steam age and the war between Scotland and England, is on hold as the United States army of occupation keeps the peace. The Americans are in no hurry to leave, they plan to make Great Britain another State of their Union. Scotland and England eye one another with mistrust and an arms war seems inevitable as the English plan building a fleet of Ironclad warships. Telford Stephenson, an agent of the Scottish Secret Intelligence Service, has stolen a copy of the plans, but Harry Lampeter is close on his trail.",
