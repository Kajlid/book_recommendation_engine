  "description": "Akielei Griffith spends her time sparring with her roomie, managing her businesses, talking daily with her bestie and getting paid to remove scum from the earth. Yes, she is the boogeyman who rids both the human and supernatural worlds of their vermin, for a price. But now the hunter has become the hunted. Someone has decided that Aki needs to be removed and her world will never be the same. Now, Aki must find the people who want her dead when she has never really lived. The task is made a little harder with three very protective shadows who did not realize what they had until she was almost gone. Everyone is entitled to their secrets but when they threaten someone’s life, it is time to pull them into the light. Aki has overcome adversity her whole life. What’s one more?  Adversity is the first in the Killer Secrets series. It is a medium burn, reverse harem storyline. It is intended for mature audiences only due to language, sexual content and mature themes. There are sections that could be potential triggers for some. More than anything it is a story of how love is strong enough to weather any storm. 18+ Audiences",
