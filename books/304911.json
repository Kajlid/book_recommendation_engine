If that didn’t happen, I never would’ve kissed her.I’ve spent years ignoring the spark that flares any time I get close to Cammi. I don’t do romance, and I don’t lose control. Ever.One kiss will never be enough though. Not with Cammi. I can’t stay away from her. She’s sultry, sassy and a little sweet. In more ways than one.But I’m not the guy for her. I’m cynical and jaded, and I came to Alaska to escape the ghosts of my past. I’m not planning to fall for a girl who’s looking for a fairy tale.Except my plans don’t seem to matter anymore. Only winning her heart matters.*A full-length, standalone romance.",
