After all, he is a famous dragon slayer! At least, no one has ever seen a dragon in the Mayor's presence.One terrible day, a child goes missing from the Orphan House, and the townspeople vow to find her. Thanks to the Mayor's insidious suggestion, all eyes turn to the Ogress. The Orphans know this can't be: it's the Ogress, assisted by a particularly excellent flock of crows, who secretly delivers much-needed gifts to the suffering humans. But how can the Orphans tell the story of the Ogress's goodness to people who listen only to themselves? And how can they make their enraged, deluded neighbors see the real villain in their midst?",
