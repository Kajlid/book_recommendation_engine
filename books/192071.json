  "title": "Siṃhāsana Dvātriṃśikā: Thirty-Two Tales of the Throne of Vikramaditya",
  "description": "In India, Vikramaditya is held up as a model of kingly virtue, and his reign as a golden age of peace and prosperity. Dating from the late thirteenth or early fourteenth century, these tales, narrated by the thirty-two statuettes of nymphs supporting his magic throne, describe Vikramaditya exploits and extol his extraordinary courage, compassion, and kindness. Against an exotic setting of adventures and miracles, the nymphs relate fights with ogres, occult rituals, and travels to other worlds, as well as very human incidents of betrayal and rivalry. The only edition available of these colorful and instructive tales, this is an important addition to a growing library of Sanskrit titles in Penguin Classics.",
