Elves, Orks, Mages and lethal Dragons find a home in a world where technology and human flesh have melded into deadly urban predators. And the multinational mega-corporations hoard the only thing of real value - information.For Sam Verner, living in the womb of the Renraku conglomerate was easy, until his sister disappeared and the fa√ßade of the corporate reality began to disintegrate. Now Sam wants out, but to \"extract\" himself he has to slide like a whisper through the deadly shadows the corporations cast, through a world where his first wrong move may be his last... the world of Shadowrun.",
