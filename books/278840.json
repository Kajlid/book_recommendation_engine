  "description": "Elizabeth Hawes is one of the best-known and most successful designers of smart women's clothes in America, and the undisputed leader of the small group of American designers who have challenged the style supremacy of Paris. Miss Hawes' story is an adventure into every phase of the women's clothing industry, the second largest business in the United States. Her early struggles for recognition and her final leadership in helping to shift the center of the fashion industry from Paris to New York make a story that will appeal not only to the initiate, but to the thousands besides - and to their husbands.\"Consumers attention!\" Elizabeth Hawes tells us that 'the deformed thief Fashion' steals the real value out of what we buy. She suggests a remedy. She makes a plea for functional and durable merchandise. Consumers want that too. \"Although Fashion is Spinach deals exclusively with the clothing industry it has a wider application\"Aline Davis HaysPresident, League of Women Shoppers",
