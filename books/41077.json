  "title": "Helpless",
  "description": "Helpless is the third book in the paranormal romance series Blue Fire Saga. I don't want to write any \"spoilers\" for books 1 and 2 by summarizing the plot of Helpless here. Helpless continues the adventures of Leesa and her vampire hunter boyfriend Rave. Rest assured it is filled with the same passion, humor, suspense and supernatural danger as the Breathless and Deathless (books 1 and 2).",
