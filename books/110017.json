If it weren't for Joey, the werewolf who has seemingly taken it upon himself to be Kieran's friend and guide, Kieran wouldn't know how to handle it all. Joey Taylor was born and raised in Australia by a deeply religious, and prejudiced, pack of werewolves. Some people might think him a little unusual, but Joey is nothing if not loyal. When he meets Kieran, he instantly knows that the man is his fated mate. It should be the best day of his life, only Kieran is completely straight and just out of a long-term relationship. With Joey resigned to the fact that he can only ever be Kieran's friend, and Kieran determined to fight fate every step of the way, can they find their way to each other before it's too late. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
