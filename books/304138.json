  "description": "Joey Harkin keeps a low profile. He goes to work each day, keeps to himself and makes sure nobody notices him. It's the only way he can be sure the man who has tortured him for eight years won't find him. The only way he can be sure he'll be safe. Everything is calm in Joey's life, until he's summoned to the Managing Director's office. Rick Southwell is a successful man. Smart, attractive, wealthy. He has a close circle of friends and when he needs something more ... stimulating... there's always The Club. There are no shortage of men there willing to act out whatever scene Daddy Rick asks for. He has no interest in anything deep or permanent. Until the night he has to rescue Joey Harkin - the man he has just promoted - from being beaten up. Bit by bit, Rick learns Joey's story. Day by day his desire to protect and care for Joey grows stronger. Little by little, he falls in love. Getting Joey to trust him turns out to be the easy part. Getting Joey to let go of his fear and embrace his new life is much more challenging. Joey: The Complete Unabridged Story brings together the Joey's Story trilogy, newly edited and expanded, with never before released material. It is a stand-alone novel of more than 100,000 words featuring age-gap, mild kink, and hurt comfort themes.
