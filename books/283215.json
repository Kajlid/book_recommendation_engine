  "description": "Marrying your fae prince shouldn’t be this hard.   Hetta’s family now know Wyn’s true identity, but that doesn’t mean they approve of their relationship. Princes are all very well - but Wyn’s not human, for all he’s spent ten years pretending to be.  With gossip spreading like wildfire, Hetta and Wyn receive a royal summons. The Queen of Prydein has heard the rumours of fae intruders, and she's not letting Wyn go until she's satisfied he and his people aren’t a threat. Convincing her would be a lot easier if someone wasn’t trying to blacken Wyn’s name - and if his sister wasn’t trying to kill him.  For mortal politics aren’t the only problem the pair have to face. The Court of Ten Thousand Spires is still without a ruler, and the only way out may be for Wyn to assume the throne himself - meaning he and Hetta can never be together.  The Court of Mortals is book 3 of the Stariel Quartet.",
