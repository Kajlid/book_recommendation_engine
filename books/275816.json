  "description": "Ex-con Grange races against the shape-shifting terrors of the Wild Hunt for one last chance to see his daughter. Old magic is comin’ to town in the latest addition to the Short Sharp Shock book series...  Writing about ‘Magic’, author Eric Nash said: “Having children allowed me to glimpse the magic of childhood. We tell our kids stories of wonder inhabited by tooth fairies and elves, princesses and trolls, bunnies that deliver eggs, a grandfather that gives presents to all the world’s children in one single night, and for a short time they believe. This ability, this innocence, has long fascinated me, and Magic was a way of recording this. Of course, as I explored the subject, I entered the folklore forest and discovered the dark origins of some of western societies’ well-loved beliefs, and one of these made its way into Magic.”  (cover by Adrian Baldwin)  (cover by Adrian Baldwin)",
