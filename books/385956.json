  "description": "Furries-you know, people in animal costumes. You may love them. You may hate them. But chances are, you have not considered eating them...until now! Not since the early days of Monty Python has dark satire so subversive reared its ugly head! From the Hellmouth of the Heartland, Nicole Cushing brings you How To Eat Fried Furries-your guide on how to raise furries as livestock and cook 'em up tender and tasty. The cast of characters is as motley and grotesque as one would imagine given such a premise. There's the misshapen, proto-furry cast of the '70s action-adventure show, Ferret Force Five. Extraterrestrial Squirrels. The Amish and the even more despicable Pseudo-Amish. Whether an avid Bizarro fan or a newcomer to this wave of weird fiction, you're bound to be satisfied once you take a bite out of How To Eat Fried Furries.",
