  "description": "PLAY is a quirky 70k word standalone about life, love, and the pursuit of orgasms. I mean, video games.I'm Payton Blake. A successful, balanced twenty-something girl living the dream. OK. So it's a big-ass lie. I could be all of those things. If I had friends outside of work. And if I didn't mainline watermelon slushies like they were a food group. It wouldn't hurt if I'd had sex in the last year, either. (My best friend insists Jorge the Nightstand Boyfriend doesn't count.) But when you know where you're headed, who needs to enjoy the ride? Even if part of me longed for a little between-the-sheets adventure, Max Donovan would be the last guy I'd call. Sure, he made the indie video game that broke the internet. His eyebrow piercing's sexy, in an 'are-you-in-a-band?' way, and fighting with him gets me off faster than Jorge on bezerker mode. But he's arrogant. Presumptuous. Colder than a cactus and twice as prickly. None of it changes the fact that I crave Max Donovan like a watermelon slushy on a hot summer day. I should ignore him. But I can't, because he just became my biggest client. And whether he'll admit it or not, he needs me even more than I need him.Game on, Max Donovan.",
