  "title": "Long Shadows, High Hopes: The Life and Times of Matt Johnson & The The",
  "description": "Matt Johnson – founder, songwriter and visionary lynchpin of iconic band The The – created some of the most vital music of his era, be it the intense visual feast of Infected or the prescient politics of Mind Bomb. Then he walked away from it all.In this authorised biography, with free access to the The The archives, Neil Fraser draws on hundreds of hours of interviews with Johnson and his contemporaries and colleagues, including Johnny Marr, Johanna St Michaels, JG Thirlwell and Tim Pope. From the early days in the East End to glory days on a global stage, through Johnson’s retreat from public life and return with The The in 2017, this updated edition addresses the 2018 Comeback Special Tour and beyond.Long Shadows, High Hopes examines the enigma that is Matt Johnson – outspoken political lyricist but intensely private man – and what prompted him to step out of the shadows after so long.",
