  "title": "Bits and Pieces: Short Stories from a Writer's Soul",
  "description": "Read an Excerpt: http://www.goodreads.com/story/show/3...A collection of twenty short and flash fiction stories. CJ has been entertaining children and adults for over a decade with her humor, insight, and unique perspectives on life and the human heart, through her children's poetry.Bits and Pieces is C.J. Heck's first book strictly for \"grownups\" and the stories are sure to touch your heart, and soul. Author Note: Behind every poem, there is an untold story. The original thoughts and ideas for it had to come from somewhere. By its very design, a poem can tell only the shortest version of its writer's thoughts, emotions, imagination, or even experiences. The twenty-two short and flash fiction stories in Bits and Pieces let the reader in on the real story behind many of the poems from my book, Anatomy of a Poet.",
