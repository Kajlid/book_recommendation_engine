  "title": "Walter & Albertina Sisulu",
  "description": "For more than five decades Walter and Albertina Sisulu were at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid. As secretary-general of the ANC, Walter was sentenced to life imprisonment with Nelson Mandela in 1964 and spent 26 years in prison until his release in 1989. While her husband and his colleagues were in jail, Albertina played a crucial role in keeping the ANC alive underground, and in the 1980s was co-President of the United Democratic Front. Their story has been one of persecution, bitter struggle and painful separation. But it is also one of patience, hope and enduring love.Walter and Albertina Thethiwe were born in small rural villages just a few miles apart in the Eastern Cape hinterland. From these humble beginnings, they would go on to become two of the country's most respected and beloved figures, among its greatest crusaders for human rights and dignity. For over five decades the pair - married in 1944 - were at the forefront of the struggle against apartheid and the injustices it wrought on black South Africans. The story is a moving love story against all odds. This book is the winner of the prestigious Noma African Literature Award and was a finalist of the Alan Paton Award.",
