  "description": "Every teen goes through the aches and pains of growing up. But no teenager has ever gone through the sort of changes that Bree Hannigan has. After all, how many teenage werewolves are running around out there?More than Bree thought, it turns out.And when Bree and her mother move to a little valley town, broken bones and torn muscles during the three nights of the full moon become the least of Bree's problems; it turns out the community is infested with Werwulfs, and they all have their eyes on her. After all, Werwulfs are born, not turned, which makes Bree the only werewolf in the world, an anomaly and interest to many pack members...and a fine target for a very jealous Werwulf.",
