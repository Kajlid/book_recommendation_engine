  "title": "Beautiful Wreck: Sex, Lies & Suicide",
  "description": "Twenty-five year old Stephanie Schroeder arrived in New York City in 1990 with edgy good looks, attitude to burn and undiagnosed bipolar disorder. Her unflinching memoir chronicles her trajectory through the worlds of queer political activism, corporate America, intimate partner violence, unwilling parenthood, erotic discovery, 9/11...and three attempted suicides. Repeatedly falling through the cracks of the U.S. healthcare system, Schroeder became her own advocate, found help and began a healthier life. Readers will find both entertainment and inspiration in the rollercoaster twists and turns of this \"beautiful wreck\" of a memoir.",
