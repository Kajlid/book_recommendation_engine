  "description": "Boston bartender Ethan Reyes has the haunting ability to read minds. He cannot control it. It plagues his daily life as unwanted thoughts assault him on all sides at all times. Absorbing a million lifetimes of pain and joy-none of them his own-has left Ethan confused, alone, and questioning his own past. The only way to numb the pain, to drown it out, is to drink himself into a stupor each night to squeeze in a few hours of sleep. Strange, horrific things begin occurring at the bar, and the patrons are being tormented and slowly killed off. When the source of the suffering makes itself known-a demon of the vilest order-Ethan is thrown into a world of deception and sin, and must overcome his misgivings of using his 'gift' if he is to overpower the creature after his very soul. With the help of Father Ryan, whose own faith is wavering, Ethan begins to unravel the demon's motive of surfacing on earth, as well as secrets to his own hazy past. Time is running out, and Ethan needs to find the demon before the monster's hellish plan can come to pass, and the world Ethan knows as home is changed forever.",
