  "description": "I’m studying birds in the mountains for the summer.\n\nThen I discover Bigfoot.\n\nOkay, okay, so he’s not really a sasquatch—he’s just a mountainous man in flannel. And sure, I shouldn’t have screamed like that, but the guy took me by surprise, you know?Because he’s huge. So big and burly and bearded that in the fading light, I mistook him for a bear.I think I really hurt his feelings, though. Our encounter haunts me—and when I figure out which one is his cabin, I can’t help knocking on his door.He thinks I’m being polite. And yeah, it started that way, but once I get a good look at him…Oh, boy. I want so much more.\nBig Ol’ Beard is a short and steamy instalove story, starring a burly cinnamon roll and the scientist who wants a nibble.",
