  "description": "He never saw her coming ... After almost a year out of hockey, Bastian Durand is returning from injury when disaster strikes: he’s taken down by the Chicago Rebels mascot in his first game back. It can’t get worse. Or maybe it can. Because the human inside the Rowdy Rebel costume is none other than Pepper Calhoun. His friend’s sister. His coach’s daughter. And the woman Bastian has wanted for the longest time. Pepper has always been a magnet for bad luck and now she’s ruined superstar Bast Durand’s big comeback. So that tracks. Everyone, from her father and brother to the fans and press, heck, even the NHL commissioner, hates her. Everyone but the one guy who should. Hiding away is the only thing she can think of, except Bast has the same idea. To her utter dismay, he’s determined to protect Pepper from anyone who dares breathe a word against her. And to convince her that crashing on the ice isn’t all that different from … falling in love.",
