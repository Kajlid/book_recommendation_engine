  "description": "Through poetry and testimony, Sonia Schreiber Weitz gives life to the millions of children, men and women who were murdered during the Holocaust. Sonia was 11 years old when her family and other Polish Jews were herded into ghettos and forced to live in treacherous conditions that often led to death. Of the 84 members of her family, Sonia and her sister Blanca were the sole survivors. To help cope with her emotions, Sonia turned to writing poetry at an early age. Today she teaches and lectures to adults and children about the Holocaust.",
