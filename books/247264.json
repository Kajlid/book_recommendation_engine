  "description": "Herta Tanner, a young Canadian woman, inherits a cottage in Bavaria, Germany, as well as an unusual job. She believes she must be a pimp for vampires. Herta's main goal is to 'get her life together' and she needs to overcome the insecurities of a nasty divorce. A friend or two wouldn't come amiss either. The folks of the nearby town of Kochberg hate her either for her family connections or because they know what she represents. Her biggest stumbling block is simple cultural differences. Can Herta keep her temper?",
