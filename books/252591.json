  "description": "The Bleddynwood had brooded, silent and grim, for over three hundred years. The villagers lived warily in its menacing shadow, taught from childhood to keep their distance and threatened with whispers of, “Behave, or the Bleddyn Beast will eat you!” But now it’s spreading, and one day it whispers Ammy’s name. When her father and brothers are drawn into the perilous forest, Ammy has to decide how much she is willing to sacrifice to save her family—and what she is willing to become to save the Beast. So begins the journey that will take her from her village and lead her through the high society of Ravenna, the royal court of King’s City, and into the very heart of the Wild Lands.",
