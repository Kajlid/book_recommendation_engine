  "description": "\"It takes my keen eye no time at all to discern that Clifford is prettier than Claudia.\"One snowy night, Charles arrives at Clifford and Claudia's pizza shop full of hopes and dreams that oddly depend on securing the delivery job at the Pizza Place.Despite his careful preparations, things do not go as smoothly as he anticipates. The more he integrates into his new surroundings, the less he understands, except perhaps for the cranky old woman called Clara-Belle, who is out to save mankind equipped with a pack of Camels, a glass of scotch, and a mouth that could take the paint off a passing automobile.Discrimination, violence, sex, love, cigarettes, and alcohol all take a front seat as his hopes and dreams are put on hold. Until one day, unexpectedly, he makes a delivery that will forever change his life, and the lives of the people around him.And through it all, not once does Charles take his eye off the prize in this often brutal and sometimes savagely funny portrait of a young man's coming of age during his desperate days of life with Clifford and Claudia.",
