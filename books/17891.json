  "title": "Daddy, Come & Get Me: a dad's adventure through a Guatemalan adoption",
  "description": "“So why does a father of three biological daughters want to adopt from Guatemala?”Daddy, Come & Get a dad’s adventure through a Guatemalan adoption is a spiritual memoir of Gil Michelini’s journey of bringing his daughter home. Moving alongside the story, Gil reveals a plausible story, based on the official Guatemalan adoption documents, of how a birthmother made the decision for adoption.Gil couldn’t find Guatemala on a map when committing to the adoption of his daughter. He didn’t know anything about starting an international adoption. He didn’t know anyone who had adopted internationally. He did have a goal of adopting a child from outside the United States. It wasn’t inspired by a mission trip or another experience; it was something he wanted to accomplish. His wife didn’t share in the goal nor did many of his friends; however, God turned his goal into a calling—through a nocturnal dream—when his daughter yelled from a mountaintop, “Daddy, come and get me.”This is the first American dad’s memoir of following his call to adopt a daughter from Guatemala.",
