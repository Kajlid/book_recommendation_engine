  "description": "The memoirs of an author living with me take you on a journey - a journey where you can hear my pain (well 'read' my pain anyway, let us not be pedantic but it IS a book and not a self-help CD). Learn about all the techniques I've tried when dealing with my bouts of depression and self-hatred - some techniques actively encouraged by professionals across the world, other techniques (prostitutes, drugs, self-harm) pretty much frowned upon. The spoilsports. What worked for me and what most certainly didn't! Told with the blackest of humour to keep things fun!Includes illustrations by the author and previously unpublished short stories!",
