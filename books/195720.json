But while the other enchanters are feasting with him in his palace in the mountains at the end of the world, something very sinister is happening. Someone - or something - is stealing the jewels of power and plotting to seize control of Open Country.The human children Timothy and Ellen are caught up in these events - sometimes literally caught up, as they travel by dragon or toss about on a magic carpet in a magic thunderstorm. As always in times of trouble they turn to their friend Melinda, the White Witch, but even her power is threatened. In the end everything depends on the Nine Times Master, but will he trouble to exert himself?",
