  "description": "If your bored, stuck in traffic, waiting for your flight to depart, or waiting for dinner to be ready, this book is FOR YOU!The first story that I ever wrote was a science fiction piece about a girl who traveled to an alternate universe by using “wind energy.” The young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three complete strangers to kill again. After many editing changes, I finally sold the story to Disney but enough about “THE WIZARD OF OZ”I think I’ve gotten the hang of this writing stuff. Thanks to my free online degree in “ENGRISH LITERRATURE” from the Mushimushimoto University of Toyko.This book is FUNNY. It has everything in it including the kitchen sink! From Mitt Romney, Costa Concordia Cruise Ship, sex, love, suspense, bad waiters, terrible metaphors, creative children, farming, dumb blondes, and prison love, you’ll see why they’ll say (at the awarding of the next Nobel Prize for Literature)... Ivana who?Yes, I am Ivana Murleau (I wanna merlot..get it?) and this is MY LOVE STORY!:)",
