  "title": "The Scarlet Pimpernel",
  "description": "\"Whenever a suspense novel helps launch a whole new branch of mystery fiction, that story qualifies as a classic. Such is the case with \"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\" published in 1905 and one of the first tales of hidden identity. The hero is an everyday man by day (an everyday aristocrat, in this case), but by night, or in times of need, he is someone else entirely. Think of Bruce Wayne and Batman; Oliver Queen and the Green Arrow; Don Diego de la Vega and Zorro--all regular guys who hide their crime-fighting alter egos by using elaborate disguises. Furthermore, when a story becomes a household name and has been produced dozens of times in theater, film and television--all true of \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\"--classic status is also assured. But most of all, \"The Scarlet Pimpernel\" is of enduring excellence because it embraces the finest quality of fiction: suspense, drama, romance, mystery, and even a dash of history for zing.\"",
