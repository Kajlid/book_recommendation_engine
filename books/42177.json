  "description": "Michael was a target for every single woman who worked with him at his brokerage firm due to his good looks, boyish charm, and the fact that he was recently divorced.  He was totally unaware that in a few short months, the boring life that he was currently living would cease to exist, and instead be replaced by one that would be completely unimaginable to him. Jennifer on the other hand was a woman who couldn't possibly ignore the attention paid to her by men.  Sadly however, her stunning beauty served to unjustly complicate her life rendering it a living hell and causing her to have to constantly run from very sinister elements pursuing her. A series of dangerous and unexpected events keeps driving this unlikely pair together until eventually neither can deny to themselves that they are developing feelings for the other.  Unfortunately, their struggle to survive is nearly overshadowed by their frustrating inability to confess their love to each other, and in the end it may cost them dearly!* Spotlighted on the New Book Journal website* Highlighted at Indie Author Success* Member of the Romance Novel Center Website* Listed with Goodreads 2012* Member of and featured at The World Literary Cafe You can follow me on Twitter @author_jeff.",
