  "description": "-Jimmy Sharp-\n It only took one look for Jenna to break all my rules. When she wiggled out of that dressing room in nothing but a leather belt as a skirt, it wasn't her lack of clothes that caught my attention, it was her. She could have been dressed as Santa Claus, it wouldn't have made a damn difference, because she's the one - My one. All my life I've lived for the music, carefree and answering to no one - until her. I will do anything for her. If only she would just give me a chance.\n-Jenna O'Hare-\n I'm an idiot. A gobsmacked fool. I let my hormones run away with me and had the most intense one night stand with world famous rock star, Jimmy Sharp. Just when I thought there might be something more than lust brewing between us, I accidentally caught a glimpse into his private life. He's absolutely crazy if he thinks I'll be ok with his lifestyle! There is no way I could realistically be with someone like him. I won't - I can't - let myself get sucked in. I just know he'll break my heart if I do. Rock My Beat is a bad boy erotic romance with lots of steamy and detailed passionate scenes for the adult reader.",
