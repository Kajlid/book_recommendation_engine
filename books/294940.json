  "title": "The Majesties",
  "description": "In this riveting and disquieting thriller about the secrets and betrayals that accompany exorbitant wealth--imagine Crazy Rich Asians as written by Gillian Flynn--two sisters from a Chinese-Indonesian family grapple with the past after one of them poisons their entire family. Gwendolyn and Estella have always been as close as sisters can be. Growing up in a wealthy, powerful, and sometimes deceitful family, they've relied on each other for support and confidence. But now, Gwendolyn is lying in a coma, the sole survivor of Estella's poisoning of their whole family. As she struggles to regain consciousness, Gwendolyn desperately retraces her memories, trying to uncover the moment that led to this shocking and brutal act. Was it their aunt's mysterious death at sea? Estella's unhappy marriage to a dangerously brutish man? Or were the shifting loyalties and unspoken resentments at the heart of the opulent world they inhabit finally too much to bear? Can Gwendolyn finally confront the truth about who she and her sister really are, and the secrets in their family's past? Traveling from the luxurious world of the rich and powerful in Indonesia to the most spectacular shows at Paris Fashion Week, from the sunny coasts of California to the melting pot of Melbourne's university scene,  The Majesties is a haunting, evocative, and deeply compelling novel about the secrets that can build a family empire--and also bring it crashing down.",
