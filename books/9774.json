  "description": "Nicole was not happy to be moving from her Beverly Hills mansion to a lousy government building in Washington, even if it was the White House. She was even less happy to find the Secret Service would be accompanying her everywhere she went. For Nicky was a wild, party girl with an appetite for sex. And the hotter, the steamier, the nastier, the better! She discovers that Washington is a dull town, but has more than its share of cruel and wicked men who want to use her body. Her antics so annoy the Secret Service, and so dismay her father's aides, that they conspire to ground her, and to take the edge off her sluttish behavior by providing her with volunteers. But even being ridden by lusty Secret Service agents isn't enough to diminish Nicky's sexual appetite! And when she's caught on video having sex with two black men in a drug dealer's apartment she's set up for blackmail!",
