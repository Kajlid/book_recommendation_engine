  "description": "CHATEAU SINISTERThe mansion called Le Chat Noir rose like a nightmare version of a French chateau deep in the trackless swamplands of Louisiana. For lovely young Nora Elias, fleeing the memory of a disastrous romance, the very sight of this eerie place sent a tremor of fear through her body, an icy shiver through her soul.What diabolical spirit possessed the orphaned little girl whom Nora was to care for, turning the child into a creature horrifyingly wise in the ways of evil and the flesh? What strange and seductive force in the very air of this isolated estate made Nora prey to unaccountable desires, and melted her resistance to an iron-willed man as dangerous as he was handsome, as unscrupulous as he was strong? Le Chat Noir was the home of a satanic secret...but would Nora live to tell the terrifying tale?",
