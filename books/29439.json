I'm just looking forward to a night of dressing up and dancing with Ned and my friends.Soon the fun turns freaking, though â€” things go haywire and everyone starts to wonder if the ghost stories could actually be true. But when Deirdre Shannon's antique tiara is snatched, I'm certain the crook is a guest, not a ghoul.",
