  "description": "As empires fall and are founded anew, the Herdsmen of Ida join the refugees of Troy in search of a vague destiny promised by fickle gods. Amidst disaster, monsters, heresy and war they risk not only their lives, but their hearts, to twist the treacherous threads of fate and deny the desperate demands of blood.  Like the first two books in the Hero series, (Chasing Odysseus and Trying War) The Blood of Wolves draws upon ancient Greek and Roman mythology, as well as Virgilsâ€™s Aeneid, giving readers fast-paced adventures where gods walk the earth, a treacherous fate is merely a moment away and families are turned against each other by the machinations of a wily king.  The Blood of Wolves begins as the protagonist, Hero, believing she has received a vision from the gods, urges her fellow Herdsmen of Ida to leave their war-torn homeland. Her older brothers laugh and dismiss her...until a mysterious Trojan ship appears on the shoreline by the ruins of the once glorious citadel. Taking up where Trying War leaves off, The Blood of Wolves sees the four exhausted heroes embark on a gripping quest to save those forced to flee Troy.  \nBound by past promises and loyalty and led by the visions of a mad king, Hero, and her brothers Mac, Cad and Lycon embark on a journey fraught with peril and personal anguish as they guide these outcast Trojans to a new land to found an empire.\n  Do you love \nheroic mythical adventures\n?
