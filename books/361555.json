After one horrifying moment of shared recognition, Cari knew her life hinged upon whether she could outrun Lance and the hurricane-spawned tornado that was barreling down on their heels.Just when she thinks she's lost Lance and heads for home, the storm throws in yet another twist that will change her fate--forever.Cari's house, her family--her entire life--have been wiped out by the storm. Badly injured herself, and knowing Lance will come after her, she trades clothing and ID with the near-identical cousin who'd been visiting and flees to Baton Rouge. While the world mourns Cari North, she begins an agonizing recovery as her cousin Susan--until Susan's boss calls her bluff and finds himself drawn into her incredible tale.Hunted by a man she once loved, sheltered by a man she hardly knows, Cari chooses to become the bait...and plots the twist of a lifetime to catch a killer.",
