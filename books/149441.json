Both mother and daughter must make sacrifices, but is the price too high? Most importantly of all, will they ever find each other again?Rich in historical detail and reminiscent of stories by Kate Morton and Lucinda Riley, White Gardenia is a compelling and beautifully written tale about yearning, longing, and the lengths a mother will go to protect her child.",
