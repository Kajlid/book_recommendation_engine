  "description": "The year is 2076 and the nation that celebrates it's tri-centennial is very different from the one we know today. In this future, the most cherished thing is privacy. Everyone has a secret identity, an inner self, that they hid with anything from simple masks to high-tech body suits and holograms.Enter a man who is known to his customers as Patrick Immelmann, an illegal private detective by trade. He can dig into the personal lives of anyone and find their most hidden secrets, if you can pay his price, of course. His newest customer is a young lady that wants him to dig into her own life. She's attempting to stay one step ahead of a new, potential, employer that might be able to discover something less than desirable about her past.",
