  "description": "Bestselling author/illustrator Audrey Wood uses simple words and stunning art to celebrate the ever-changing sky.In Audrey Wood's bright, new concept book, a child and his family experience the fun of a sunny-sky day at the beach, then the electricity of a thunder-storm sky, and finally the magical delight of a rainbow sky. After the night sky fills up with stars, readers will be soothed by the pleasure of wishing on a star. Using only two words per page-\"Blue Sky\" \"Cloud Sky\" \"Storm Sky\"-Wood's enthusiastic playfulness will encourage young readers to make up their own simple descriptions of the sky above. Years ago, a teacher told Audrey how rarely her young students looked up. She asked them to begin watching the sky every day and keeping sky journals. They loved it! And soon that teacher saw great improvement in their learning, observing, and test-taking skills. Beautiful, joyful, and educational, BLUE SKY invites us all to be creative in the way we engage",
