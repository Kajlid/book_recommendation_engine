  "title": "Burris Numerical System - Expressing numbers as a function of space and time",
  "description": "The Burris Numerical System is a numerical system invented by Lloyd Burris to express the last place value of a number in normal space while the rest of the place values in the number is mathematically stored in time. There is a process to code a BNS number and a process to decode it. The BNS system is a combination of Lloyd's work with his Vector Coordinate Numerical System and Albert Einstein's work.",
