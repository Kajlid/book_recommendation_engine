  "title": "I Am Become Zombie",
  "description": "Coming home from a breakup with his ex-girlfriend, one slacker twenty-something guy stumbles into a shady gas station with just enough pocket change to get home. Little did he know he'd be stumbling out as one of the first zombies of an otherwise underwhelming outbreak in his quiet little town. Through a series of odd encounters and eye-opening experimentation, he learns that being a zombie really isn't all that bad. He has friends, ambition and full-course meals...things he'd only ever hoped for while living alone in his matchbox apartment. But every rose has its thorns. Eating people doesn't go unnoticed for long. And when the hunters take action...it'll take more than one rotting corpse to fight back. Hilarious, twisted and oozing with morbid wit, 'I Am Become Zombie' kick-starts the apocalypse with an unapologetic tale of self-discovery.",
