  "title": "The Crimson Bond",
  "description": "When twenty two year old, Brooke Ashcroft, moves from her small town to the city after landing a job at a successful marketing agency, the last thing she expects is to unknowingly meet her boss- gorgeous mogul vampire, Alex Chase, in a bar on her very first night. The immediate intensity between them goes beyond anything she’s experienced and she soon finds out that there is a reason she can’t seem to think straight when he’s around- a fiercely powerful bond that is both extremely rare and deeply feared in the vampire world. With their bond complete, Brooke and Alex would threaten the stability of the Regency, a group of the most ancient vampires in existence, and one headed up by none other than her own deadbeat vampire father. When the Regency kidnaps her in an attempt to prevent the bond from taking place, Brooke must trust Alex with not only her eternal existence, but her already battered heart.
