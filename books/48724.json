  "description": "Masha Sweet wakes up on a Tuesday morning with plastic flowers glued to her head thanks to her little sister, Sunny. Masha would like to kill her little sister, but that is not what happens next. Instead, Masha ends up saving her next-door-neighbor’s life, being quarantined with a deadly virus, and finally, bald as a ping-pong ball on a city bench with no money. But during her travels, she learns revenge is never “Sweet.”",
