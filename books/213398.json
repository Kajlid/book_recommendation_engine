  "description": "They say opportunity doesn't knock twice…\n Yet here comes Tyler Paulson, crashing through the door of my life. I know he’ll be trouble, but I can’t escape that smile…  He's our new hot shot quarterback, and I’m supposed to show him around the city, but what I really want to do is show him how much I’ve grown up. Except there's one little problem. If I screw this up, I'm out of a job.  So I have to be professional. No frisky business, and no mixing business with pleasure.  But Tyler doesn’t play by the rules. He’s used to getting what he wants.  I’ll have to resist and not give him the upper hand, but it’ll only be a matter of time before he scores his second chance.  Rushed is a full-length romance with an HEA, no cliffhanger, and no cheating.",
