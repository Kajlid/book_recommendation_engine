And despite their immediate attraction, Tahira wants nothing to do with Antoine—the Sazi are the enemy of the Hayalet Kabile.But Tahira doesn't have a choice, because she and Antoine have discovered that she is a fabled \"power well,\" able to store magical energy from other shapeshifters—and something is hunting her, eager to use her powers for itself.Only if they can set aside their peoples' ancient rivalry and rely completely on each other—body and soul—can Tahira and Antoine save themselves and their people.",
