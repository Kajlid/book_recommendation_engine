  "description": "What’s a guy to do when the one woman he can’t stop thinking about doesn’t believe he’s got real feelings for her? Get downright stubborn and sweep her off her feet, that’s what.Pippa: The idea that my richest and most gorgeous client just proposed to me feels like a crazy joke, or a pitch for some weird reality show. But the thing is, my situation is dire enough that taking Blake up on his offer is a given. I’ll have to keep my wits about me though. Otherwise, the man who’s willing to go through all this to rescue me (because that’s just the kind of guy he is) will be the man I’ll end up falling for harder than I already have.Blake: So, that just happened. I just proposed and saved Pippa's business in one fell swoop. Of course I did. I’ve been protective of her from the very start of our friendship. And now that she’s wearing my ring, protective doesn’t even begin to cover the way I feel. That I stepped up to help her out of the mess she’s in was always a given. But the fact that I had to take such drastic measures to begin with? That’ll all make sense soon enough.All I have to do first is convince the most stubborn woman alive that I really am in love with her.Previously published as Curve Contract (c) 2012 with extensive plot revisions throughout, newly added content, and a different extended ending.",
