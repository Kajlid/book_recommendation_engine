Now her greatest challenge is removing gum from State Room carpets—until she comes across a nasty accident right outside the Royal Apartments.

Buck House buzzes, but only Jane, and the Royal Personage known belowstairs as “Mother,” suspect foul play. At Her Majesty’s behest, Jane launches a discreet inquiry that takes her from the Servants’ Hall to the highest echelons of the Palace.
