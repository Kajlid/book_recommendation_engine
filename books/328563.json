  "description": "A black satin mask was the only thing protecting Lady Katherine Mandeville from discovery and scandal. Temptation lured her to the hedonistic masquerade, and curiosity forced her indulgence in a wicked proposition. A night of paradise with the Marquess of Claireborne enflamed her desire for the forbidden, leaving her ruined in every possible way.A perfect evening of unparalleled bliss...if only she hadn't been caught.This is a Regency erotica short that ends in a cliffhanger. It's part of the Innocence Lost series, a group of erotica prequels to Regency romance novels/novellas, each short featuring the defloration of a heroine. These are not required reading to enjoy the Regencies they precede, however they do enhance the story.",
