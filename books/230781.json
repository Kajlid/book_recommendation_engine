  "description": "My name is Caitlyn Lonette, and I've just been burned.Caught participating in illegal disc-bike racing, my father, First Councilor Lonette, ships me off to finishing school to learn the ways of politics, either voluntarily or through brainwashing if necessary. There, I reconnect with my old racing competitors, Blaze, Vice, and Rush, who turn out to be fellow councilor’s children. We forge a bond to resist the school’s assimilation, to stay true to our passions, but soon find that a love of racing isn’t the only thing we share. The energy that sings through my blood every time we touch thrills me in a way racing never did before. Raised in a family who lacks physical contact, I have to tread carefully or risk being consumed by these three dangerous men. If I can trust them, they’ll be my salvation. Doubt whispers to me, though, that my naïveté and need for connection will place my trust in the wrong place.Whatever happens, we have four years to figure out how to change our fates, or be forced to follow in the path of our ancestors.",
