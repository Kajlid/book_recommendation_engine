And what if the consequences of not finding him are too terrible to imagine?The steerswoman Rowan has learned that Slado, a mysterious wizard, has secretly been working spells of incredible power.

But how does one stop the most powerful man in the world?In the seaside town of Alemeth, the Annex holds centuries of steerswomen's journals. They may contain clues to Slado's location, but combing through them would take more time than Rowan has to spend. Then she encounters a lost friend: Janus, one of the few rare Steersmen. But Janus quit the order without explanation.
