  "description": "Kevin was a stern, ex-navy man who demanded order in his world. Tori, his new, nineteen year old step-daughter, was a bratty, lazy, drug-taking slut without job, education or ambition. They were as different as night and day - in more ways than one. For Kevin was a tall, muscular Black man with skin as dark as coal while Tori was a lithe, beautiful blonde with skin like silk. On a week where his wife is away on business, he lost both his patience and his control. He'd forced many young men into the proper mould during his time in the service, and now he would do the same to Tori. But his lust for her and hers for him spilled into the mixture and turned her education into something quite a bit darker and more sexual. He'd punished many a young man, but never with spankings and strappings. And he'd taught them many things, but not the kind of things he taught his rebellious slut of a step-daughter. But she would learn discipline and respect, even if he had to bring his friends in to help teach her.",
