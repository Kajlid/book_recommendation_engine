  "description": "Sheltered.That’s the word I’d use.As a young fae raised in a small village, my life had been idyllic. Me, my mom, my step-brother Dom, and his dads, Ashe and Curtis lived together above my mother’s healer’s den, all working together to cure the illnesses affecting the multiple species in our community. We’d lived a modest life, but we’d been happy.Until one day, a summons arrived from Ravenshield Castle, calling healers of the realm to the castle. An illness was plaguing the royal family, and they offered a significant reward just for showing up. For a family of healers, the opportunity for money and prestige was too good to pass up.So why did Mom lie about the scroll? Why did she hide the truth of its contents? And why had she never spoken about her past?The pull of the adventure was too strong, so Dom and I concocted a plan to send us across the continent, headed east to Heartmount and the castle atop its hill.But life on the road was an adventure for a female that grew up as cloistered as I did. And at Ravenshield Castle? Well, that’s when things got really interesting.***The Howling Wind is a full-length novel, and book one of The Enchantment Series.
