  "title": "Wanderground: Stories of the Hill Women",
  "description": "Back in print, this is the fantastic story of a group of women who have designed a world of peace and preserved a rich heritage of memory that ultimately changes the world they live in. In the futuristic Wanderground, men remain in the cities, while many women who have been persecuted flee to the hills. There they share their stories of survival, remembrance, and self-discovery. Years later, expressing their freedom in unique ways, the hill women have gained telepathic abilities and flying techniques, while women in the cities still struggle for enlightenment. Not only are readers led to marvel at these \"supernatural\" abilities, they are led to examine their own views on womanhood and how women are similar to and different from men.",
