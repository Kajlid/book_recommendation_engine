  "title": "From Laurel Hill to Siler's Bog: The Walking Adventures of a Naturalist",
  "description": "From Laurel Hill to Siler's Bog presents the fruits of a scientific as well as affectionate association between a dedicated naturalist and the birds, mammals, and insects of a small, wild world. John Terres, noted author and former editor-in-chief of Audubon magazine, spent nine years exploring the Mason Farm wildlife reserve in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. His observations of the animal life around him are eloquently recorded here, organized around the cycle of a year from January through December. Originally published to wide acclaim in 1969, the book is an enduring classic of nature writing, and readers everywhere can appreciate it as an engaging introduction to a naturalist's sensibility and way of looking at the world. In a new afterword written for this edition, Terres reflects on his return to the Mason Farm after twenty-five years and the changes that have taken place there.",
