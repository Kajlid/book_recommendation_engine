Along with Mignola and Gianni, Evan Dorkin and Jill Thompson - who won Eisners in both 2004 and 2005 for their stories in Hauntings and Witchcraft - return to unveil a new painted story starring everyone's favorite evil-fighting strays. Also included is an homage to the great creature comics of Jack Kirby by Kurt Busiek and Keith Giffen, and many more terrifying yarns by some of the most talented folks in comics!",
