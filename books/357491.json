  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ISBN 10: 0140023321 'Of all my books Steppenwolf is the one that was more often and more violently misunderstodd than any other.'Herman Hesse's poetical novel, Steppenwolf, was written some twenty years before he won the Nobel Prize for LIterature in 1946. This Faust-like and magical story of the humanization of a middle-aged misanthrope was described by the New York Times as a savage indictment of bourgeois society. But, as the author notes in this edition, Steppenwolf is a book which has been consistently misinterpreted. This sef-portrait of a man who felt himslef to be half-human and half-wolf can also be seen as a pleas for rigorous self-examination can an indictment of intellectual hypocrisy.The cover shows a detail of a painting by Paul Klee.",
