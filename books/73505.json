  "description": "CELEBRATION OF LIGHTHaylo has grown up in the human world where each year they celebrate the Christmas season. There is; however, no Christmas in the Elven world. Instead, the Elven females have decided to take the idea and change it into something for their own people. They are not about to tell their Life Mates and sweet hearts though. Keeping their plans secret is proving to be too much fun. The Elven male population can tell something is being plotted. Gabriel is sure of it, Eden is keeping secrets and it doesnâ€™t take them long to figure out what is going on. Sevil confirms it. Watch how the season comes together, the planning, the games, the craftiness practiced, all in the name of bringing the Elves together for the Celebration of Light.",
