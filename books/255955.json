  "description": "What would you do if you learned everyone you loved had been lying to you?  Nikira Ward has sought the truth for four long years. After waking from the coma brought on by her house exploding, she tells her doctors what she saw – a man with black wings dancing in the fire. When they told her she couldn’t possibly have seen a demon, Kira did the only thing she could: she immersed herself in all things good and evil. Angels and demons. Heaven and Hell.  Just before her eighteenth birthday, the only person left in Kira's life – her grandmother, the Oracle – falls ill, and once again, her life is rocked off its axis. But this time she’s not alone. When a fat cat, a Nephilim, and a handful of Guardians come to her rescue, Nikira learns who she really is and what powers the Creator has bestowed upon her – the Seeker.  Join Kira and the men who’ve vowed to protect her as they follow the clues only she can see on a quest to find her sister, Rhen, rescue the Oracle, and uncover the hands of evil.",
