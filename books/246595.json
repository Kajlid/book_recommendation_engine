  "description": "Reinaldo Arenas is the most highly acclaimed writer of Cuba’s post-revolutionary generation. The Doorman , his first work set in the United States, breaks new ground with the extraordinary and tragic story of Juan, a young Cuban refugee who becomes a doorman at a luxury apartment building in Manhattan. Oddly alienated from the tenants, Juan finds himself being seduced by their pets–a bear, a rattlesnake, an orangutan, goldfish, cats, dogs–who speak to him, determined to recruit him to their a revolt against humans and human society, and a mass flight to liberty. Fantastic, satirical, dizzyingly inventive, The Doorman is a bittersweet parable about freedom and community, told with a profound sense of humanity.",
