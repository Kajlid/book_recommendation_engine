  "description": "And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of abundance of rain. – 1 Kings 18:41Donnchadh Mac an t-Saoir drives his horses through the snow to the town of Lavoren, nestled high in the majestic Scottish Highlands, unable to shake the sense that ill news awaits his return.His fears are cruelly realised when he is met in the centre of the square and informed that his beloved wife has passed away since his leaving. Grief-stricken and wracked by guilt for having left her, Donnchadh falls to his knees and finally slumps to the earth.It is a position from which he will never leave.Initially granted his request for solitude, Donnchadh is afforded time to grieve. Upon returning to his body however, the people of Lavoren find the old man’s resolve has hardened and as they attempt to forcibly remove him from his supine position, they are staggered to discover that his body will not be moved an inch, by neither man nor beast.Donnchadh informs the town that his heart is too heavy with sorrow to be lifted and declares that only God may move him now. When a storm arrives soon after, battering the town but failing still to move the body of Donnchadh Mac an t-Saoir from where he lies, it appears that God has indeed taken up Donnchadh’s challenge.This is the story of what happens when the irresistible force and the immovable object meet.When Love and Religion collide.",
