When he finds out that his estranged brother was murdered in cold blood, possibly by one of his own Hellfire men, he vows to bring the killer to justice.  When Stormy Jacks opens her door the night of her husband’s funeral, she cannot believe her eyes. The man standing before her is the spitting image of her late husband, and he claims to be his brother. Only Stormy never knew he had a brother…  Ryder begs for Stormy’s help in finding Jett’s killer which will require her to go in deep into the MC world, a world of which she had promised herself never to return. Can she trust him to keep her safe? And when sparks start to fly between them, can she trust him with her heart?  AUTHOR’S NOTE: This book is chock full of steamy romance, peppered with tasteful sex scenes, and spiked with a love triangle for good measure. Intended for mature readers. This is a full-length, standalone novel that contains a HEA ending.",
