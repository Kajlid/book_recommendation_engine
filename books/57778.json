When Steven vanishes from his dive site in Alexandria, Catherine must piece together what few clues are left behind and follow a trail that leads from the shadows of the pyramids to the maze of twisting streets in Cairo's City of the Dead. As they rush toward a thrilling finale, Catherine and Steven find themselves chased by a demented assassin oblivious to pain, buried alive in a desert tomb, and stalked by killers who've been waiting for them since the time of the pharaohs. \"It's The Mummy meets MacGyver!\" \"Big time fun...with fascinating details and a killer ending!\" 448pp, softcover.",
