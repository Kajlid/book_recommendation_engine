  "description": "A shiny badge…A pair of handcuffs…A sexy detective…What could possibly go wrong?When he stepped into the roll call room that morning with his fitted t-shirt, two days worth of stubble, and the confidence and swagger that had earned him a detective’s badge, I knew I was in trouble. Until I transferred to burglary division, I never even heard the name Michael Riley, and now I couldn’t get him out of my head. The fact that he chose me to help with a case might have been a dream or a nightmare. The jury was still out on that one. But while I was deciding if he wanted me or just my help, we still had a job to do. A string of gang-related thefts had plagued the neighborhood, and we were tasked with investigating and coordinating a sting. I needed to keep my mind on work and not on thoughts of him in my bed. He was my partner. I needed to trust him with my life, and maybe if he did that right, I’d give him a shot at my heart. Each novel in the series can be read as a standalone story. There are no cliffhangers.",
