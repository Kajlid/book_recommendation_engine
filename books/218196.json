  "title": "Love Lucky",
  "description": "I had a restless heart, a nasty desire to be loved, a wandering spirit and had barely been out of Glendale. London called in the form of a pretty girl and I followed. I stumbled around one of the greatest cities in the world for a year and a half. Stoned and full of wonder I found people and places that would be far beyond anything I could dream or conjure. It’s an experience that shaped who I am today. It’s about a strong sense of wanting more for my life with a bunch of LUCK thrown in.",
