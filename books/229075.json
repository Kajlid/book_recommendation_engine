  "description": "Chasing My Vietnam War, August 1965-August 1966As a young Captain,  Colonel Roy M. Stanley II  was sent to Saigon on Temporary Duty early in the Vietnam War. Filling a recent vacancy, he was put in a unique position as Shift Chief and morning briefer to the Command Section. That let him learn a complex game of cat-and-mouse with the Soviet/North Vietnamese air defense system and let him see the generals close up.Those were formative days when tactics were evolving and enemy defenses stiffening and he explains how intelligence was collected and processed. During briefings of the air commanders, he was like a \"fly on the wall,\" witnessing their discussions as strategies were formed. He developed a special relationship with some and a loathing for others. His writings are filled with amusing and sometimes tragic anecdotes you won't read anywhere else.Colonel Stanley also had a wry sense of humor and a flair for cartooning. His drawings are not only funny but illustrative of events and people he worked with. He also speaks and shows pictures of what Saigon was like in 1964.",
