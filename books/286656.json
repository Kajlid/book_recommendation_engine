It’s running out of time.One night, Molly Clarke walked away from her life.She doesn't want to be found.Or at least, that's the story.The car abandoned miles from home.The note found at a nearby hotel.The shattered family that couldn’t be put back together.They called it a “walk away.”It happens all the time.Women disappear, desperate to leave their lives behind and start over.But is that what really happened to Molly Clarke?Don’t Look For Me is:“GRIPPING...WITH UNEXPECTED TWISTS... You’ve got a cracking mystery on your hands.”—Adrian McKinty, author of The Chain“A NAILBITER . . . SO MUCH MORE THAN A TWISTY THRILLER. It’s a heartbreaking portrait of a family coping with grief and an insightful study of guilt and blame, gaslighting and agency. If you love fast-paced page-turners with relatable, flawed characters, look no further!”—Angie Kim, author of Miracle Creek\"",
