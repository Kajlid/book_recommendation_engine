  "description": "Paris is just a demon minding his own business when he is jarred out of his comfortable existence by a chance encounter. Being a Lord in the Royal Court, and a highly respected member of his community, he is not prone to human affinities. But when he feels an aura unlike anything he has ever felt before, he is drawn to it with a fierce curiosity. Zoe Fine, a young woman trying to hide from her past in the big city, catches his attention and holds it firmly in place. Itching with insatiable desire to find out why she is so different, Paris begins to follow her, watching silently as she scrapes and claws at a meager existence in the city the best she can. When Zoe becomes aware of Parisâ€™ haunting presence, she summons the courage to confront him. Resorting to drastic measures to rid herself of his shadow, she offers him a deal. Unfortunately for her, he accepts and she is sucked into a world she tried so hard to escape. But Paris begins to feel things for Zoe, and his infatuation does not go unnoticed. Jackson, his long time business partner, senses the changes in the stoic demon lord and tracks the source of the disruption to his newest client. When everything Paris tries to do right, goes horribly wrong, everyone will pay dearly for his sins.",
