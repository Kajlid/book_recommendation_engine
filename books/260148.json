  "description": "Seasons Greetings from Misty Harbor, Maine! The snowy coastal village is as pretty as a postcard, decked out for the holidays in its winter finery. It's the ideal place to celebrate a picture-perfect Christmas, as its hometown warmth melts the coldest of hearts.Recently widowed Amber McAllister has left the hustle and bustle of Boston to help run her aunt's berry shop on Main Street. But the new ad campaign by Ian McNeal, her late husband's business partner, has made the store's jams and jellies the hottest gift in town. Amber is frazzled. Visions of unfulfilled orders dance in her head, until Ian comes to town to buy her out of the ad agency. He falls instantly in love with Misty Harbor's quiet charm—and his long-time crush on Amber is rekindled. Ice skating and sledding together puts a twinkle in his eye—and makes Amber see the quiet, creative man in a whole new light. Though wrapped up in kisses, their fragile love is tainted by memories of her husband. Will ghosts of Christmas past haunt her Christmas present—and future?",
