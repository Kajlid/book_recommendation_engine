  "description": "It was a shock to Naomi and her mother when the fortune they had confidently expected to inherit was left to a nephew they had never heard of. However, Mrs Thurrock hoped that perhaps Naomi and Jerome might set things right by making a match of it. Which might have been a good idea... if Naomi hadn't infinitely preferred his brother Martin - the one without the inheritance!",
