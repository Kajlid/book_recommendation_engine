No matter how far he goes, he canâ€™t escape the tragedies that punctured his college life in Providence, Rhode Island. Augustine is poisoned by the heartache he caused, the reputations he shattered, the two friends he killed. Now, the lies he told to keep it all secret are crumbling.  Augustine seeks relief in a spring break road trip to Key West, where he hopes the sun, sex and insobriety will drown his past. The reprieve is temporary. On the long, dark road home Augustine is forced to relive the erratic series of events that changed his life, and ended others. Augustine races towards a final decision: bury his secrets forever, or seek redemption in the arms of a full confession.",
