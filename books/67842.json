  "description": "It's about LIFE, LOVE, and EVERYTHING in-between.Frankie, the ellipsis radical, and Abbey, the semicolon stickler, are love's young dream, or so it seems. In this light and dark romance we follow the loved-up pair \"twirting\" around the fanciful fringes of London town, and having a right ole time of it. Indeed, Frankie couldn't be happier, finally having met a girl far curvier than even the most curvy of punctuation marks. Cue the eponymous semicolon; a winky blighter destined to royally mess things up; in fact, the semicolon seems intent to mark its territory; all too soon representing much more than the loversâ€™ stance on punctuation alone. That Semicolon Bitch Had to Die is a wild and errant love story featuring a most unlikely of threesomes. Or, to put it another way, when two writers fall in and out of love punctuation is bound to spill! ... ?!?! ;-)",
