  "description": "Written in the eleventh century, Lady Murasaki Shikibu's The Tale of Genji is widely celebrated as the world's first novel, but as Donald Keene has observed, it is also \"one of its greatest.\" Genji the Shining Prince, the son of an emperor, is a passionate character whose tempestuous nature, family circumstances, love affairs, alliances, and shifting political fortunes form the core of this magnificent epic. Throughout, The Tale of Genji offers a lively and well-rounded glimpse of golden age Japan with a cast of characters as richly conceived and nuanced as those of Proust.",
