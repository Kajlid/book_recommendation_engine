His hunt leads him to a dig headed by archeologist Rachel Cruz. When his military entourage forces Rachel’s team out of the cave they were exploring, a flash flood hits the riverbed and Rachel is swept into the deluge. Taelen rescues Rachel and they wash up on a forbidding alcove where he witnesses the miraculous healing of Rachel’s broken ankle. Now he is certain the gods are here. He is inexplicably drawn to her, and she to him.Rachel is not a god, but a Nephilim, and she needs more than a miracle. She needs the technology Taelen can provide to help her find and destroy the god-killer, a weapon so precise and powerful, it will mean the genocide of an entire species. She’s given Taelen her heart, but can she trust him with her secret?",
