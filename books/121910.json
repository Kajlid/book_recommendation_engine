  "description": "Scotland’s all misty lochs and magical forests and perfect boyfriends, right?When dance student Amalphia Treadwell embarks on a secret relationship with her rich, handsome teacher, she has no idea of the danger that lurks in his new school in Scotland.She’s soon dealing with her boyfriend’s beautiful and obsessive ex, the sinister research taking place at the castle school and her own ever-evolving relationship issues.Amalphia works hard to be the best dancer she can be, but as tension builds within the old walls of the castle, she begins to wonder if she will ever escape the dank dark of the dungeon...Dark, witty, sexy and fun, Tendu is a compelling and seductive story of love, dance and obsession. Ailish's dance background and love of history and spicy stories are what inspired this heady mix of romance and ballet set in a castle. She lives in Scotland beside a loch with her husband and two children where she dances and writes and eats rather too much chocolate.Tendu contains graphic sex scenes, violence, trauma and adult language.",
