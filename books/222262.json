  "description": "When beautiful but lonely Iras of the Bear tribe sees a bright star in the night sky she soon disappears without a trail. Aponi, a Pawnee outcast, comes across the clan and hears about Iras’ mysterious vanishing. She decides to start an investigation of her own. Her search takes her up the mountain where an old woman gives her clues. But will Aponi succeed to rescue Iras? Moreover, can she trick the mysterious Starman who holds Iras captive?  \"\"The Taken\" is a twist on a Native American Tsimshian myth that originally attempted to explain the reason for the variability of color in the stars. In Hellenthal’s version, two women take the lead roles and the story becomes one about self-love and tribal acceptance, or non-acceptance as the case may be. Iras is a strong character that lives by her own truth when she is taken captive by a Starman and is then turned into a warning for her tribe of what happens to a strong-willed woman that breaks from tradition. Aponi, a brave heart from a separate tribe, is the warrior that saves her.\" Reviewer  This is the second stand-alone story in the Lesbian Romance Mythology Series. In total there will be about 15 stories covering lesser known myths all around the world from various cultures, retelling and reshaping them, and giving them a unique, lesbian twist. Book One in the series was 'The Cursed', a lesbian twist on an Irish myth, Lir's Children.",
