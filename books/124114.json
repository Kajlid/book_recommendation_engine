  "description": "Horrendous date left my heart feeling like a battered piñata, I knew a gaming marathon would be the perfect remedy. But when I passed out with my portable gaming system in hand, I was transported into the heart of my favorite dating simulation universe! Now, yours truly, is the main heroine attending a whimsical, enchanted academy, armed with magical prowess, EXP, and MANA galore. Dorm life in the academy is magical, especially when my roommate is an enchanted plant with a knack for being judgmental. Plus, she keeps telling me she’s my guardian, whatever that means. Not to mention, I’ve unlocked heart-fluttering connections to some of the men here. Picture six dreamy love potentials, each with their own heart-o-meters and some seriously adorable meet-cute-events. Dating games were my jam, but they always made you choose between the love interests. Why settle for one love interest when I can have six? My goal is to create the ultimate harem and max out their heart-o-meters! Who needs to pick a single beau when you can have a heart-throbbing team? No more tough love choices for this heroine!",
