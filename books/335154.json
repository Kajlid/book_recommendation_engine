He has followed the Islamic faith to the best of his ability without his parents to guide him in a country where the majority are Christians.As an adult who goes by Dan, he only wishes for four things: to be a shopkeeper in the city of Nantret, save for Hajj, find a Muslim wife, and make sure Vaywin is cared for when she grows older. Certain things in his past need to stay buried and gone forever.After two vicious murders in a nearby village, some think a notorious murderer known as the Grey Wolf is back. Some consider him to be just a story, and others think he was a serial killer that simply vanished or met his own grisly end.When the local Baron sends Dan to investigate the murders, he finds himself dealing with far more than a simple killer who preys on random victims. Someone knows too much about his past, and they aren't content to let him leave it behind.The Grey Wolf may be a story, but assassins are real, and someone has put a hit on Danâ€™s life. He'll soon learn that the worst killers aren't always those who remain in people's memories and become a thing of nightmares.Sometimes, the worst are those who remain unknown.",
