  "description": "Jessie Chambers—“Sunni” to the local BDSM community—needs to grow up. Her master, Sir Rune, has told her to get a job. Her sister slave, Sage, is struggling through college, serious as ever. Sunni goes to the local goth/kink store, The Fringe Element, and is immediately embraced by its quirky owner as the newest member of her “little family.” But almost immediately things start to get complicated. Sunni’s ex shows up, claiming he’s found God and that God wants them to get back together. A video of Sunni and Sir Rune doing a scene at the club winds up on television and all kinds of trouble ensues. Sunni must figure out a way to restore her relationships, keep her master from getting deported, take over running the store, and stop everybody else from trying to “save Sunni.”Six sentences from “Saving sunni,” the sequel to “Becoming sage.”\"Sir dipped the huge blade closer and closer, occasionally catching a piece of the plastic wrap with the tip in a movement that seemed much too fast to be safe. The plastic made a very satisfying ripping sound, but only a tiny piece actually came loose—not enough for me to even feel. He was very theatrical, and I knew it was making a good show. I pretended to be terrified, screaming occasionally, although not too much for fear of accidentally setting off my panic. He swung the knife up and down the length of my body, occasionally holding it against my throat and tracing a white-hot line, making some of the women in the audience gasp. It was hard for me not to smile when he ran the blade across my skin; that was actually the safest part of the play, and I knew he was doing it mostly to calm me down.\"",
