Readers can find out how a hunted hippo got his own back on a phoul pharaoh and discover the truth about the cool queen Cleo and the curse of Tutankhaumun. There's also a top ten of phunny pharaohs, a mad mummies quiz and lots of foul facts about the messy mistakes the Egyptians made before becoming mummy-making experts. History has never been so horrible!",
