  "description": "Why do wizards always want you to go into the dungeon first?Dave and his friends are having a bad day. Not only are they having to come to terms with the fact they’re in a weird (and very un-Spartan) magical world, but if no one hires them soon, then it won’t be long before they have to embark on a short and boring career in death by starvation.But when a wizard, an elf, and a dwarf finally agree to hire the Spartans for a spot of monster-infested-dungeon-clearing, it soon becomes evident that the Spartans are going to have to deal with things much more magical and annoying than even they had anticipated.Funny and fast paced, strange and fantastical, join the Hard Blokes as they find out why the hell anyone would go to the trouble of keeping an ancient and mysterious relic in a dungeon, anyway…",
