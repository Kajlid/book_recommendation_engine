In this Justice Brothers Novella, we travel back in time with the original crew for a meet up in Bangkok, Thailand.

Jason Cameron ‘Cam’ — the Tracker.  Roman Bishop — the Interrogator.  Rafael D’Allesandro ‘Rafe’ — the Muscle.  Alex Marquez — the Major  Along for the wild ride is Domineau Rivera, a badass CIA analyst they called Smoke.  Sawyer plays a comical outsider role, but most surprising of all is honorary Team Justice member, Parker Sullivan as the Counselor.  Find out what happens when this group of unique individuals indulges in some down time away from the war. It’s just as funny as you imagine with a little bit of eye-opening tension thrown in!",
