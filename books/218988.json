Brock and his friends resume their training at the Academy, an institution founded on magic, invention, politics, and combat.

Guided by cryptic instructions from the past and backed by a magic they have yet to master, these young heroes embark on a quest to unearth mysteries buried with the legendary Emblem Throne.
