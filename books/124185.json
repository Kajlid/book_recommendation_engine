  "description": "Life in the Outlands had always been fairly generous to Xcel. Inventing new recipes, tinkering with machines, and seeing the local townspeople meant that her days were filled up, barely leaving time to focus on what was missing. But something was indeed missing...Answers about her past continued to both elude and haunt her, to the point where she had given up hope of ever truly feeling whole. However, fate intervenes in the shape of a stranger from Xcel's past. A stranger who can provide the answers she so desperately needs. But is everything as it seems? And now that she is armed with this new knowledge, what will she do with it?",
