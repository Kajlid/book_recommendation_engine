  "description": "I languish here for all eternity, in my jail, my fetid prison. For twenty years I lay in squalor and watch this war unfold before me. How will it end? Will I live to see the day I walk unshackled and feel the green grass beneath my feet? I alone remind my captor of his tortured heart. My flesh feels the sting of his whip as I watch him sink into oblivion as each year passes. Would his neck be within my reach I would surely end his torment with these chains that bind me so. All I may do is watch the shadows fill Jeshion Hall as another day slips away.A short story written primarily in first person.",
