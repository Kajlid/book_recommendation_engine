  "description": "Willow Myers loves Halloween. So when some college classmates invite her to a party, her best friend encourages her to go and have some “fun”. Not a one-night-stand kind of girl, she doesn’t think it likely. Until she sees sexy in a loincloth. He’s tall, big and half-naked. Just what her dry spell ordered. Dax Birch hates The Hunt. The shifter event to find mates took his last girlfriend. He's not looking to be mated anyway. But his family lovingly pressures him into attending. He's ready to go home until he hears her. And she's not just funny, she's hot as sin. His attraction to her charm, sarcasm, and curves is instant. Even without his shifter senses, he knows she's special. The Hunt finally gets interesting. Willow and Dax are an unlikely pair, but they’re ready to give this a go and see where it leads. It leads to lots of time out of their clothes. A lot. The twists and turns keep them on their toes. Willow's life will never be the same boring routine. At least, if she can survive her kidnapping.",
