  "description": "When a boy discovers a single-propeller airplane in his closet, he does what any young adventurer would He flies it into outer space! Millions of miles from Earth, the plane begins to sputter and quake, its fuel tank on empty. The boy executes a daring landing on the moon . . . but there's no telling what kind of slimy, slithering, tentacled, fang-toothed monsters lurk in the darkness! (Plus, it's dark and lonely out there.) Coincidentally, engine trouble has stranded a young Martian on the other side of the moon, and he's just as frightened and alone.",
