  "description": "From USA Today Bestseller Ava Harrison comes a steamy, slow-burn romance with a twist.  Eight years ago, I gave Grayson Price a piece of my heart. To him, I was the strange girl whose mom had just abandoned her. To me, he was a savior, an anchor, someone who stood beside me on that beach. The next time I saw him, I was twenty, and he was thirty-six. He didn't remember me. And when he flirted...I didn't tell him. By the time he found out, it was too late. We tried to deny our desire, but our attraction was too enticing. Eight years ago, I gave Grayson Price a piece of my heart. Too bad he’s my dad’s best friend.",
