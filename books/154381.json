  "description": "It was hard to imagine how Claire's day could get any worse... And then the vampires holding her hostage wanted breakfast.In the town of Morganville, vampires and humans have learned to live in relative peace. Still, Claire Danvers knows that after dark, her homework often takes a backseat to staying alive. This fragile harmony is shattered with the arrival of Mr. Bishop.Bad to the bone, the ancient, old-school vampire cares nothing about maintaining peace—staying at the top of the food chain is enough for him. What he wants from the town’s living and dead is unthinkably sinister. It’s only at a formal ball, attended by vampires and their human dates, that Claire realizes Bishop’s plan—and the elaborately evil trap he’s set for the warm-blooded souls of Morganville...\"Thrilling, sexy, and funny! These books are addictive. One of my very favourite vampire series.\"—Richelle Mead, author of the international bestselling Vampire Academy series.",
