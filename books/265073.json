Now, in his extraordinary new book, he shares what he has learned over the years about leadership and business growth.It is his belief that, to play in the Great Game, you must accept that winning and losing are both part of the same experience.

Drawing on insights from great leaders throughout history, he guides you in learning to do the key tasks that made them successful—tasks that will enable you to find complementary employees and associates whom you can help develop in the very same way. With each turn of the page, you’ll gain knowledge from strategists such as Sun Tzu, General Douglas MacArthur and Sam Houston that will help you grow in business as well as life. Everyone has to start somewhere. As Wes himself has learned, those Small Beginnings often inexorably lead to some mighty Big Things!",
