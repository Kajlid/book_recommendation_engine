  "title": "Going Solo",
  "description": "\"Going Solo,\" the second part of Roald Dahl's compelling and colourful autobiography, creates a world as bizarre and unnerving as any you will find in his fiction. A marvellous evocation of his wartime exploits, it tells of African safaris and deadly snakes; of fighter planes and incredible air battles with the enemy during World War Two.",
