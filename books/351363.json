  "description": "Hallie's only lover is the spirit of her very sexy but very dead husband Jake. When a gorgeous blond cowboy called Aiden arrives as one of ten guests for the singles week at her ranch, she fights her attraction to him. But Jake encourages it, desperate to indulge a fantasy he never fulfilled while alive. As the week unfolds, Hallie tries to ignore Aiden's advances until he comes to her room, determined to satisfy his lust for her. The unseen Jake ups the stakes by arousing his wife in a way only she is aware of. Unsure what to do, Hallie keeps silent, allowing Aiden to think they are alone. The sex is breathtaking for all but she feels guilty and confesses to Aiden, who takes the news badly, leaving Hallie to rethink her life. She is falling in love with Aiden and finds that Jake isn't quite as happy about sharing her anymore. Then Aiden returns, pretending he can cope with the idea of sharing Hallie and the two men reach an uneasy truce in order to make love to her again -- but she soon realizes that Aiden has every intention of claiming her, right under Jake's nose.",
