  "description": "“You don’t need a spark when the embers have been burning for four hundred years.” Sye has always tried her best to stay safe from the bloodshed of the Realm. But seventeen years ago the Re-emergence of magical creatures, the Bloods, changed everything. Rylock and its cities have been growing more and more dangerous with each passing day. Loyalty is no longer determined by the blood in people's veins and being human certainly doesn’t ensure the Council’s protection. When her best-friend’s life is threatened and nowhere in the cities is safe, Sye knows they have to leave. As a Witch provides them with a strange and challenging heading, they prepare for the journey ahead. But what chance does Sye have to keep them alive? Battles are brewing every direction she turns. And she is definitely not a fighter. “There will be fire again.” It’s been two decades since Jaasn was brought back to life by the Phoenix blood in his veins. In that time he started over. Began again. He got to grow up one last time. Except he’s not so sure it will be the last time anymore. Told a prediction he believed impossible, Jaasn is surprised to find himself volunteering to help two girls on a journey to the edge of the Realm. Suddenly his second life is taking him further than he’s ever been before. And he’s not going alone. His unwilling friend, a Witch with magic problems, has been thrown into the deal. As time and distance expand for the four travellers, Jaasn is forced to figure out what fighting for his life really means. And he has to wonder, can they outrun the coming fire?",
