  "description": "The decision to leave the European Union sparked a conflict which would change the world forever. The Scottish Patriots, an underground guerrilla organisation, began their campaign to free their country from the economic downfall they feared, sparked into civil war by political assassinations. Their enemy responded in a way that nobody could have foreseen; a dangerous biological weapon was unleashed, designed to kill them quickly and quietly, but the unpredictable events that unfolded threatened borders and allegiances in a way that none of them thought possible.",
