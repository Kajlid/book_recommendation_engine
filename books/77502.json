  "description": "\"The marriage union is the closest relationship that can exist between two human beings. When a man and woman decide to join together in marriage, they should do so with full realization of their responsibilities. Marriage is serious business. When two born-again believers know it is God's will for them to marry, they come together before God, a minister and witnesses to join their hearts and lives. They make a public profession of their mutual love and devotion, pronouncing vows and pledging their lives to each other. As they pronounce the marriage vows in faith, the power of God goes into operation and a miracle takes place. They are united by God and become as one in His sight. Their union is They are joined together spiritually by God, legally by the contract they enter into and physically, when the marriage is consummated. A husband and wife are joined together as Jesus is joined to the Church. It is a miraculous union. This booklet contains the wedding ceremony that I use as a minister of God. It is based totally and completely on the Word of God. As you use this ceremony, I add my faith to yours in believing God for lives of love and harmony for the couples you minister to, in Jesus' name.\" â€” Kenneth Copeland",
