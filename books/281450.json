  "description": "When offered a position at the obscure Grimmstead Academy, I jump on it. It’s not that I’m running from my past, it’s just…well, some things are better left forgotten. An academy for lost souls and criminals? Not exactly what I signed up for, but as I’m about to learn, once you step within the halls of Grimmstead, you can never leave. As the days wear on, I find out that no one is innocent here. Not me, not the ruggedly attractive headmaster, and certainly not its dangerous, handsome students. Me coming to Grimmstead was like a lamb running into a den of lions, only these lions are just as likely to attack each other as they are me. Mysteries lie within the heart of Grimmstead Academy, and I just might be the key to it all. The walls of Grimmstead are painted with three things.Depravity.Insanity. And blood. If you can’t trust your own mind, who can you trust? GA: A Villainous Introduction is the first book in a planned RH trilogy. There is graphic violence in this book, along with steamy scenes.",
