  "description": "When Hawk McBride hit the pavement of Highway 57 intent on running away from the betrayal of his brother, Hawk could never foretell where his life would be led. Or the disabled purple jeep that would stop him dead. Randi Ronin believed her bad luck day on the side of the highway was her destiny. After all, she had left a failed marriage behind. But when a tall, handsome man with a quick tongue stopped to aide her, she wondered if it was the world's way of righting the wrongs done to her.  Instantly connected by a force neither could understand, Hawk and Randi stand together against man’s ultimate greed on their quest to find what is true, what is chosen, and what is forever destined. And they plan to take everyone down in their crusade for true love.  Of Gods and men, there are few that exist with whom the powers of Earth’s Gems can be trusted. Yet many selfish men will stop at nothing short of total destruction to garner the Gem’s energy for impure means. Some are willing to use the innocent in their quest for dominance.  However, there are always those who refuse to sit back and watch the demise of others without acting, and Hawk McBride is one of them.  >>>FROM THE AUTHOR, Roxy Matthews: This first book in the Pale Bay Treasures Series is a complete novel, no cliff-hanger.
