  "description": "From USA Today bestselling author RC Boldt...I never looked back after skipping out on my own wedding, even if it did leave me estranged from most of my family. Eight years later, I have the life I’ve always wanted. As an advertising account executive, my world is damn near perfect.  Until I come face-to-face with my past. With the man I once loved. The man who holds my future in his hands. The man who’s hell-bent on getting even with me for leaving him at the altar.  Even with all the unfinished business between us, I still love Knox Montgomery. The only problem?  He loves me…KNOT.",
