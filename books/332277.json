  "description": "I won't live to see my 29th birthday unless I make a deal to marry Death.An arranged marriage to a grim reaper? Whatever keeps me on this side of the dirt.My new husband Victor is formidable, built like a god, and ... is scary supposed to be this sexy? Because it's kind of sexy. The problem is he doesn't seem to get this whole marriage thing. Every time I approach him for company, he scampers off like a disgruntled cat. I'd be fine with letting him have his space, but I can't help being reminded every time I look at him that a girl has needs. How can I lure my new husband into bed? And is it even possible to win the heart of a reaper?",
