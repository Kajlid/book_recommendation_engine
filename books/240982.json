  "description": "“Omegas for alphas and betas for betas…”  Ori and Patton have been best friends since they were pups. But growing up changes everything—Ori must settle on an alpha to mate, while Patton takes on the beta's work of maintaining the walled enclave their pack lives within. They try to make the best of it, until a wealthy suitor comes calling for Ori, and they realize neither of them can face a future without the other. And on a moonless night, Ori and Patton escape over the enclave walls, breaking both shifter and human law in their determination to reach the sanctuary of Mercy Hills.  Hunted by their own people and forced into a dangerous masquerade among the humans, their original plan--so simple and direct—turns into a twisted path toward a promise of freedom that might not even exist. Because Mercy Hills doesn't know they're coming, and the trouble they're bringing to the enclave's doorstep may be more than those already beset shifters are willing to bear.  Finding out Ori is pregnant makes their mission that much more urgent. Omegas never mate with betas, let alone have pups with them. If their pack finds the two lovers, they'll be separated forever.  But the pack never reckoned with the determination of a beta in love, or the stubbornness of an omega determined to keep his mate and his baby.",
