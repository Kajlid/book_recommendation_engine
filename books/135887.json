  "title": "Unplanned Choices",
  "description": "Unplanned Choices is a historical romantic drama, set in the late 1960s and early 1970s in New York City and Long Island during the turbulent period of the Viet Nam War, the sexual revolution, the women’s movement, and the struggle for legalizing abortion. It is the story of Steve Lynch’s and his first love Anna Marino, who became pregnant, died during an abortion, and the impact of the abortion on Steve, the abortionist, Anna’s family and friends, and the investigators of Anna’s death.  Situations similar to that portrayed in Unplanned Choices, could be replicated hundreds of thousands of times in the future if abortion becomes illegal or is severely restricted in the United States.",
