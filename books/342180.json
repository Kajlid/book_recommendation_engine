  "description": "Beginning by examining its roots in early Gothic and Romantic literature, The Dark Subculture presents a decade-by-decade analysis of the pivotal Goth milestones as they occurred. Starting with the form’s emergence as a 1970s counterculture phenomenon, defined by classic clubs like the Batcave, the book moves through Goth's 1980s invasion of the arena-rock scene via bands such as the Cult and the Sisters of Mercy. It then concludes with the subculture's enormous impact on film, music, and television during the 1990s, as epitomized by the creative output of musicians and filmmakers from Marilyn Manson to Tim Burton. Author Gavin Baddeley even gives a glimpse of Goth's ongoing metamorphosis into \"Cybergoth.\" He also documents the widely attended Goth festivals, including Treffen, M’era Luna, Carnival of Souls, and the Whitby Gothic Weekend, examines the exciting evolution of Goth fashions and footwear, and explores the scene’s decadent philosophy of style over substance. All in all, this illuminating book offers a guided tour of one of the world’s most influential and provocative youth subcultures.",
