  "description": "Nothing much changes in historic Eagle Valley, Virginia. That's a good thing for Arden McCrae. It's easier to manage her visions of the future when there isn't much to see. Arden would rather stay buried in the certainty that comes with stories of the past. Fortunately, running the local antique store and keeping up with the Eagle Valley Historical Society gives her plenty of history to hide behind. When her aging parents are forced to sell their farm to pay for medical care, Arden sees big changes ahead. The sale threatens the historic status of Eagle Valley, and Arden's own store is in peril. Meanwhile, her father's rapidly advancing Alzheimer's keeps him locked in a heartbreaking past. The rest of the McCrae family is left to make difficult decisions for the days to come. The future that nobody wants is descending fast, and Arden must face the visions she's always avoided. Soon, her town is divided over their historic status and her family is shattered by her father's declining health. Arden will have to choose whether to fight to preserve the past or learn to embrace the future.",
