  "description": "They tell you that a parent's love is all consuming. I never put much thought into it. Not until the minute I heard her take her first breath. That little girl is my world. I'd do anything to protect her. My ex signed over her rights and her family vowed that my daughter didn't exist. Now that she's gone, they want my little girl. They're trying to say I can't give her what she needs. I've known Evan all my life. Our families farms run parallel with each other. He and my brother Aaron have been best friends for as long as I can remember. What they're trying to do is wrong. He needs my help, someone he can trust and I'm more than happy to do it. I volunteered without hesitation. I should have thought about what it would be like to have our lives intertwined. I should have thought about what would happen when our time together ended and how my heart would feel when I had to walk away.",
