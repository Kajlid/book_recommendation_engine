  "title": "The Madness Of Celia Summers",
  "description": "Celia Summers, intrepid mother of two, loves her work as an art therapist. She's proud that she gives her elderly independents something to look forward to each day, even if her partner, Martin, is disparaging of her efforts. But then Martin has a secret agenda Celia knows nothing about. Meanwhile she defends her geriatric charges, fights to secure gallery space for their artwork, and fights to keep The Harbour, a home the residents can truly call home, from being closed. She takes on the might of the town council; to the point of leaping from a church steeple to bring attention to the plight of her independents, no matter that she might fall and end up splattered all over the pavement. When she does fall, however, it's much more painfully. Police Constable Alex Burrows, the son of long time Harbour resident, Colonel Burrows, whose sense of humour has made her laugh, whose tragic personal circumstances have made her cry, whose smile has stolen her heart; turns out to be just as much a liar as Martin. Can Celia ever trust again? Can Alex get past her protective family of friends, forgotten by most of the people in their own lives, and convince her to trust him, to love him, as he does her?",
