  "description": "As I took the steps to the stage I soaked in the moment, allowing the feeling and emotion to fill the void. I knew their love for me was only temporary, but it was enough. Enough to keep me going forward, and enough to sate any desire for permanency. This was my reality, all I was capable of feeling. A brief encounter with a sea of nameless faces, the anonymity kept them from seeing me for who I really was at my core. To them I was Synister Smith, and god damn it they loved me.",
