  "title": "Murder and Mayhem on Staten Island",
  "description": "The excitement and vibrancy of big-city thrills take a deadly turn when they hit Staten Island. Edward Reinhardt murdered his wife and rolled her body in a barrel down a busy thoroughfare. A known bootlegger—and suspected police informant—was found shot three times in a Packard on South Beach, sparking one of the island’s greatest mysteries. In 1843, the bodies of a mother and daughter were discovered in a Christmas Day fire; a family member would stand trial three times for their deaths. During the Jazz Age, a kiss would cost a popular Port Richmond teenager her life. Local historian Patricia M. Salmon has meticulously researched Staten Island’s most horrific murders, some well known and others long forgotten.",
