  "title": "Three-Ten to Yuma and Other Stories",
  "description": "Trust was rare and precious in the wide-open towns that sprung up like weeds on America's frontierâ€”with hustlers and hucksters arriving in droves by horse, coach, wagon, and rail, and gunmen working both sides of the law, all too eager to end a man's life with a well-placed bullet. The New York Times-bestselling Grand Master of suspense deftly displays the other side of his genius, with seven classic western tales of destiny and fatal decision . . . and trust as essential to survival as it is hard-earned.",
