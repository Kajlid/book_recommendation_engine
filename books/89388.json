  "description": "Life would be much easier for Rosalind Olchawski if she didn't have to wake up the morning after the fairy tale.Falling abruptly in love with a much younger drag king, awakening to the passionate madness of life, and breaking barriers, internal and external, are all wonderful things. But the past has a way of lingering and erupting into the present with devastating force, and sometimes love doesn't come with the white picket fence of our dreams. Rosalind's former husband arrives unexpectedly in Buffalo, turning Rosalind's brand new life with her lover Taryn on its head. Paul doesn't know Rosalind has fallen in love with a young woman and moved on with her life, and he wants her back. Will Paul's intrusion destroy him, or the burning new life Rosalind has built?",
