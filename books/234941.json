  "description": "At first glance Audrey Valentine seemed just like any other prole living in Concordia, but she was very different. She was more introspective then most and didn't always like to follow the rules. She was content on being left alone to live out her bleak existence as a lower-class citizen until a tragic accident changes her life forever. After the accident, Audrey is given the “opportunity” to increase her social status but finds it difficult to make the necessary adjustments and to follow the status quo. Her reluctance to blindly follow the rules lands her in trouble and a readjustment counselor is assigned to help her adjust to the unfamiliar environment. Audrey’s comfortable life is up-ended as more evidence of who she is begins to be uncovered. Her plan to live out a quiet and uneventful existence is forced to change as she is exposed to more insidious changes that are occurring in world around her. The question then is who will she become.",
