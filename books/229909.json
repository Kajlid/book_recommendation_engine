  "description": "In Regency England, where classes are strictly delineated and marriages are business transactions, love is often an inconvenient or even tragic thing. When a young servant named Leah becomes infatuated with her master's son, Alexander Stone, she knows she has no hope of ever gaining his notice. Nevertheless she will stop at nothing to coerce him into marriage, even resorting to a false identity. Her scheming and intrigues may soon be triumphant, but at what point does love end and rapacious obsession begin?",
