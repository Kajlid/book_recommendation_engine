  "description": "Delirium’s Mistress is the fourth book of the dazzling high fantasy series Tales from the Flat Earth. In the tradition of One Thousand and One nights, the book explores an ancient world in a series of connected tales.  Long time ago when the Earth was Flat, beautiful indifferent Gods lived in the airy Upperearth realm above, curious passionate demons lived in the exotic Underearth realm below, and mortals were relegated to exist in the middle. Delirium’s Mistress is the story of Sovaz, the offspring of a union between Azhrarn, the Prince of Demons, and the priestess Dunizel. A love affair between Chuz, Prince Madness, and Sovaz/Azhriaz/Atmeh is interrupted by Azhrarn, who takes revenge on Chuz for actions taken in the previous volume of the series. Alone, Sovaz must search for her true self - is she Sovaz, the child of Dunizel, the Moon’s Soul and embodiment of good? Is she Azhriaz, the merciless, all-powerful daughter of wicked Azhrarn? Or is she something more?  Enter this vivid world of brilliant darkness and beauty, of shimmering palaces and extraordinary elegant beings, of merciless passions and undying love. Discover the exotic and wondrous landscapes of the Flat Earth.",
