  "description": "They say you're never truly ready for Death until it's staring you down, its cold, bony fingers outstretched and scratching against your fragile mortality.I thought I was ready the day my own mother tried to kill me. Perhaps I was ready the moment I was born.But as I peer into the chilling void of Death, breath shallow and heartbeat sluggish, I know that it can't end like this. I was made for a purpose.And that purpose is Legion.Now that we're fighting the battle of our lives, a war that could eliminate mankind, I see that purpose as clear as the whorls of dark ink etched in his skin.Realms are colliding. Alliances are forming. And my heart is being torn in two.I know the code the Se7en live by.Kill one to save a million.But maybe it's not me who was meant to die.Maybe it's the man I thought I could save...the man who once saved me.The man I was created to kill.",
