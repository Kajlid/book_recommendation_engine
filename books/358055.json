  "title": "The Fair Folk",
  "description": "Six stories from some of the most famous names in fantasy-all with one common thread-\"the fair folk.\" From blithe fairies to sinister fey, some are fair, some are foul, all are fantastic.  In \"The Kelpie,\" by Patricia A. McKillip, a carefree circle of bohemian artists is confronted by a being more powerful than any muse.  Jane Yolen and Midori Snyder weave a tale of two sisters long-exiled from their magical realm who must survive in ours, in \"Except the Queen.\"  In Tanith Lee's \"UOUS,\" a young woman with a rotten family is granted three wishes by a handsome elf-and learns that nothing good comes free of charge.  A hapless slob finds his world turned upside-down when an eager brownie moves in and proceeds to clean house, in Megan Lindholm's \"Grace Notes.\"  Kim Newman introduces an intrepid government investigator whose latest case pits him against a sinister brood of fairy folk known as \"The Gypsies in the Wood.\"  And the serenity of the Elves is tested in a wry fable of a long-suffering magical apprentice who can't catch a break, in Craig Shaw Gardner's \"The Embarrassment of Elves.",
