  "description": "THE CREATIVE EPIPHANY won a national honored FINALIST AWARD in the 2009 BOOK USA CONTEST in the category of non-fiction narrative. Jo Ann Brown-Scott and the gifted men and women who have contributed stories for this book all received a message that came to them in a Creative Epiphany; delivered from their angel in the darkness, their wisdom, their soul, jolting them forward toward more inspired creativity. They have beat unbeatable odds in order to live their life's longings, some battling overwhelming difficulties of their own making, with passion driving them toward greater self-knowledge and peace. Listening is the only requirement for hearing Epiphany's voice; audible as a whisper or shout in your mind's ear. Your well-being and balance are Epiphany's simple agenda; always guiding you wisely toward your truth. Epiphanies might come through an instantaneous flash of understanding during chaos or calm, or in a humble moment easily overlooked, or after years of unfolding. Always, an Epiphany is life-changing, bringing vivid realization and certitude. The illuminating insight gained from a Creative Epiphany will reassure you that in discovering your life's purpose you will reach fulfillment; finally understanding what your unique creative contributions must be here on earth. Read about them. Listen. Have one.",
