  "title": "The Return of the Twelves",
  "description": "Beneath a floorboard in the old farmhouse into which his family has just moved, eight-year-old Max Morley discovers twelve time-worn wooden soldiers. Under his careful watch, the \"Twelves\" come to life, each possessing a name and a distinct personality. As Max soon learns, they share a history filled with incident and adventure -- all an imaginative legacy of the famous BrontÃ«s (Branwell, Charlotte, Emily, Anne), who were the soldiers' original owners. In its mix of invention, excitement, character, and literary history, The Return of the Twelves occupies a rare place in children's literature. Its gripping narrative and engaging figures make it perfect for young readers of ten and up.",
