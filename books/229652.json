  "title": "The Tailor of Gloucester",
  "description": "\"In the time of swords and periwigs and full-skirted coats with flowered lappets—when gentlemen wore ruffles, and gold-laced waistcoats of paduasoy and taffeta—there lived a tailor in Gloucester...\"\nPotter described 'The Tailor of Gloucester' as her own favorite among her books. It was based on the true story of a tailor who left the unsewn pieces of a coat in his shop and found that the garment had been mysteriously finished for him in the night. It turned out that the real tailor's assistants were his apprentices, but in Beatrix Potter's version of the story the secret helpers are skillful little brown mice.\nBeatrix Potter\n (1866–1943) loved the countryside and spent much of her childhood drawing and studying animals. The landscape that Peter Rabbit first introduced to us in 1902 is still today one of Beatrix Potter's most popular and well-loved worlds. What started as an endearing story about a bunny rabbit would soon become the first ember for the illustrious series that is 'The World of Beatrix Potter', and a story which has endured retelling after retelling at bedtimes all over the world.Age Rating: 3–12+ / Preschool - 2+ / Lexile Measure 960L",
