Her intended, Orville Davis, is waiting for her in Denver City, but it's the wagon master, Laurence McKinney, who catches her eye. The handsome guide flirts shamelessly with her, proving to be a capable leader, but, as, the weeks wear on, the affection she feels for him continues to grow.Laurence McKinney has been wagon master for years, helping folks travel to California. He's seen his share of disasters and accidents. Temptation abounds, the group having rescued a wagon full of harlots heading to the mining towns in the mountains. This spells trouble in several ways, but it's nothing compared to the lovely Crystabelle Marx, who is a constant distraction. The winsome brunette is full of sass and good-natured teasing, but Laurence knows he's in trouble with this one. It's ill-advised to fall in love with one of the customers ... but it may already be too late.",
