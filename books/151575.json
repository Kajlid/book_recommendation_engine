  "description": "From Jonathan Williams' introduction: \"A Note (Clear of Hue)The Clerihew was invented in 1890 by Edmund Clerihew Bentley, who was a schoolboy of 16 at St. Paul's in London when the divine numen of Orpheus struck him. His best one seems to me:The digestion of MiltonWas unequal to Stilton.He was only feeling so-soWhen he wrote Il PenserosoHe never got better than that, and few people have ever managed to equal him, though such as Auden, John Sparrow, Constant Lambert, James Elroy Flecker, Maurice Hare, and Gavin Lambert have tried. … E.C. Bentley is remembered as the author of the detective novel, Trent’s Last Case.…As for definition, Frances Stillman’s The Poet’s Manual and Rhyming Dictionary (1966) says this: ‘The Clerihew is named in honor of its inventor, Edmund Clerihew Bentley. It is a humorous pseudo-biographical quatrain, rhymed as two couplets, with lines of uneven length and often contains a moral reflection of some kind. The name of the individual who is the subject of the quatrain usually supplies the first line.'\"",
