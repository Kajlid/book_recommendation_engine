  "description": "\"Five Little Speckled Frogs, sitting on a hollow log, eating some most delicious bugs. Yum, yum!\" This picture book beautifully illustrates the familiar children's song through watercolor, collage and graphic design. Children and adults can easily read or sing the repetitive text while they count down from five. Watch for patterns by keeping an eye on the frogs and those \"most delicious bugs.\"",
