  "description": "Arrows flying, love’s in the air, Valentine's Day should come with hazard pay. Leave it to Krissy Kissinger to pick the worst time ever to declare her undying devotion to the God of Love…in a text message…after her sister, Chloe's, bachelorette party. As if things weren’t already in the crapper, Krissy just woke with a hangover the size of Zeus’ ego only to find out that Cupid’s missing, the Cherubs contracted mono from a gaggle of strippers, and Ares used all the golden arrows for target practice. As the Fairy Extraordinaire in charge of all things Valentine's Day, our little Fae has precisely seventy-two hours to shake off her pink-champagne-induced brain fog, rescue her lost love from a horrendous horde of two-and-half-foot men, and save V-day before there’s more broken hearts than petals on a rose. With no time to spare, this lovelorn lovely must pull out all the stops to make sure the chocolate doesn't melt, and the bubbly is at its bubbliest if she's to save the Love of the World and, more importantly, the love of her life. Holy Fairy farts, this shit could only happen on a Leap Year.",
