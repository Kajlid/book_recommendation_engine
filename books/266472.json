  "description": "MAGIC IS DYING;CAN I SAVE IT?IF THE PRICE IS MY HAPPINESS;CAN I PAY IT?In the last few generations, only one in a hundred female witches are born with power. So when I came into mine, my grandmother helped me hide it so I wouldn't be swept away by the ISC, our magical government.The price of discovery was steep; becoming an ISC drone and being paired with their choice of mate for my coven. So I hid in plain sight working days at Maggie's Pet Wash, and nights piecing together the mythical Words of Power.The only thought that keeps me going is figuring out a way to beat the ISC and hopefully fall in love with a coven of my own... maybe even raise a few little witchlings.So when my familiar, a pug named Mrs. Pig, screws up my one shot at obtaining the Words of Power, I figure everything is ruined. That is until Pierce, Sam, and their own talking dogs walk into my life. Now that I have them, can I give them up? Even to save magic?The ISC is coming for me. What they don't know I'M COMING FOR THEM, TOO.( This is the beginning of an RH series. Which means our sassy heroine may not get all the guys just yet, but be patient!)",
