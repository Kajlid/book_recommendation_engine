  "title": "Thanks For Nothing, Hippies",
  "description": "This book may be the essential survival guide to nearly everything for the disaffected; it offers its off-kilter judgments on issues as wide ranging as Mexico's narco wars or surviving in a modern workplace, it endures scarcely tolerable bus journeys in odd places and provides a myriad of tips for ruining perfectly good relationships along the way. In these restless and darkly funny poems the writer trawls life's horrors, pleasures, and its most banal irritations in search of an identity she can live with.",
