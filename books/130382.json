They try to promise it will never happen again, but of course they are totally hot for each other, and it takes every ounce of will-power they both have to keep their lust under control. If the Fairy Council finds out what they've done, they could be stripped of their magic and expelled from the Forbidden Realm forever.Desperate to escape the council, they retreat to a cabin deep in the mountains. For now they are hidden, and safe from all the intrigue. Secluded in a haven of their own, passion takes over, and they at last are able to fully give in to their desire. They have no secrets from one another and know that whatever is to come, they will face it together.(25,000 words)",
