She’s always been raised to be a lady in the drawing room and a whore in the bedroom – at least, that’s what her mother said men wanted. But this? This is something entirely different. Jordan focuses his sexual and romantic energy on Claire, training her and caring for her physical and emotional needs. She feels as though she must make the choice to commit to Jordan and his lifestyle or to walk away forever.***WARNING!***ADULT THEMES and multiple GRAPHIC SEX SCENES.",
