  "title": "Blockchain in Digital Marketing-A New Paradigm of Trust",
  "description": "We are going to look closer at Blockchain technology and its impact on digital marketing processes. We will discuss about the future of blockchain in digital marketing and to what extend using blockchain tools is feasible in online marketing processes. Online marketers and organizations use outdated marketing tools which have security issues. Many SEO, search marketing and digital marketing agencies and companies use buggy tools and as a result hurt their customers’ websites. They either provide a temporary ranking solution which would be outranked within a short amount of time after the payment is made or never get results and blame it on Google Algorithm or any other search engine algorithm. In some cases worst case scenario is to fire their employees. A search marketing and SEO expert relies on an agency or company’s in-house tools in order to provide quality results. If these tools are outdated, their campaigns won’t work and it has nothing to do with SEO or PPC experts’ performance. We are talking about dealing with A.I search engines now. 99.9% of these companies have SEO and PPC measurement tools which measure ranking and Pay Per Click( PPC) performance. However the majority of these tools are not A.I and Blockchain based. They reveal a website’s data to competitor and as a result they create war among companies in every niche. These companies want to outrank each other and as a result exhaust their marketing budgets every year with a little result. The reason they survive online is due to the cold calling department and email marketing efforts. We are the creature of habit and comfortable with running our marketing routines. We dislike change! But how long is this going to last? Security is the major concern in organizations. We should get used to the habit of accepting change. In this book we will dive into the significance of using A.I blockchain technology and at the end conclude our finding.",
