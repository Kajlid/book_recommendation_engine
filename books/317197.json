  "description": "I want nothing more than to escape my destiny.Being alpha born means walking a path that's already been laid out for me, with a mate I don't get to choose. On a Lycan's 21st birthday, we are fated to find our true mate. Only, I don't want one, I'm not ready yet.I want to travel and see the world, but I can't do that either.When our world comes under attack from a foe we thought long vanquished, everything I thought I knew gets flipped upside down.With nowhere to turn after my mate rejects me, feeling suffocated by my own skin, I leave my pack to try and find myself... but get found instead.While this book is part of The Seven Realms saga and does contain some tiny spoilers to the Shadow Walkers Saga, it can be read without having to have read any of the other books in the Seven Realms world.",
