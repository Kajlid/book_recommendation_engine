  "description": "The epic conclusion of The Avalonia Chronicles is here . . . War is on the horizon. Queen Morgana’s power grows every day, aided by her army and unseen dark forces. Illiador and Eldoren have fallen completely under her reign. There is no one who can stand against her now—except one. Aurora Firedrake has finally come to understand the power she is capable of wielding, but is it too late? Stripped of her allies and those she holds dear, failure seems inevitable. To win the war for Avalonia, she must journey to the deepest parts of the Darklands to find a way to take back all she has lost, before Morgana opens the Book of Abraxas and releases the greatest evil the world has ever known.  Aurora, the Dawnstar, is all that stands between Avalonia and total destruction. But can she find the strength to unite her people and defeat Morgana and her wicked forces? Or will Avalonia be lost forever?",
