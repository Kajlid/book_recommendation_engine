  "title": "Good Hard Help",
  "description": "As near as my parents and the doctor could tell, I was born with a golden horseshoe crammed deep up inside of my backside – which in hindsight would go a very long way towards explaining those occasional bouts of hemorrhoids I sometimes suffer from.  Yes – I said hindsight.  Yes - this is going to be THAT sort of a story.  Good Hard Help is an epic story that will simultaneously stir your libido and tickle your funny bone. That's two titallated bones for the price of one - you can't argue with economic facts like that.  It is hot and it is funny and it is DEFINITELY worth looking into.  Which is why Amazon built that \"LOOK INSIDE!\" feature.  So just run your mouse up this page to the cover to where it says \"LOOK INSIDE!\" and take a good long peek at what this book has to offer.  Pour yourself a cold beer while you are peeking.  Once you get done peeking just throw your money down and dive right in.  I guarantee a little giggle and a whole lot of giggedy-giggedy-giddy-up-go!",
