Unfortunately, she's not sleeping well at night and she's pretty sure something paranormal is going on in her house. When her fatigue starts to interfere with her work during the day, she contacts her friend Quinn, who works with the New Orleans Ghost Seekers.Franco LeBeau can read minds. When the Ghost Seekers meet at his French Quarter establishment to discuss a new case, he meets Tempest and is thrilled to discover that her thoughts match his own: instant attraction. But after hearing Tempest's story, his attraction instantly turns to worry. He knows it's not a ghost disturbing Tempest's sleep, but an incubus.The Seekers agree to help Tempest battle the sex demon, and Franco offers to act as a bodyguard during the night. Of course, Tempest hopes Franco will do more with her body than guard it. Only one thing stands in their way: a demon that may be too powerful to kill, and who wants Tempest for himself.",
