But the most fascinating of these stories are the ones dealing with love at first sight. No one really knows, or can rationally explain, the magic through which the mere sight of the beloved can trigger powerful emotions, of a kind never felt before. All at once life without that certain being becomes impossible, it is urgent and imperative to live with that one person. This is what happens between a Scottish Count and the daughter of a country priest. Strong, tormenting, powerful love at first sight. A love story of olden times, based on true facts.",
