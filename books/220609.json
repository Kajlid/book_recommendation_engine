All the guys wanted to be them and the girls fought to be beneath them.Both feared and loved, they were like Gods in our tiny town.They pushed themselves into my life, embedded themselves into my thoughts, and just when I thought they couldn't do anymore damage, they found a way. They stole my heart.This is my story.This is how it all began.*This book contains sexual situations and adult language that is not suitable for readers under 18.",
