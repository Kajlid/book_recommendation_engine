Michael of Appolonia returns in Blood Redeemer, Book 2 of the “Of Blood and Magic” series. 20 years have passed since Michael, one of the original seven vampires created in the time of the Pharaohs, waged war against the ancient vampires to end their evil and regain his humanity. Only Calandra, the most evil of the vampires, escaped into hiding. Michael went to Earth to sleep until her return. Now Calandra has returned to rebuild her legions, and the Glen discovers someone has stolen the vial of blood Michael left behind to awaken him. Somehow the Glen must withstand attacks from within and without, while seeking a means to awaken Michael, without making him an even greater danger than Calandra.
