  "description": "A gifted poet with a strong voice, Gianna Russo seamlessly moves this mature collection of poems out of self-absorption into a expanded world view through excellent pacing and control of tone. Russo is a master of the unexpected yet perfect turnaround, always taking readers a step beyond where they expect to go. \"MOONFLOWER is a book of loss, and of resilience and recovery, from depression, divorce, children leaving home, a mother's death. The moonflower blooms at night, and so do these poems, with an uncanny and luminous glow.\" -Dorianne Laux, author of \"Facts About the Moon\"",
