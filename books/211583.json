  "title": "Monkey Vs. Robot & The Crystal Of Power",
  "description": "This thought-provoking story is told almost completely without words, relying on Kochalka's expressive illustrations of the title characters. For all the book's humorous and charming appearance, beneath the entertaining veneer lies a stirring examination of the dual nature of existence, the dichotomy within the human mind, and our profound effect on the ecological environment. A modern day fable for readers of all ages, based on the age-old struggle between nature and technology.",
