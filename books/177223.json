  "description": "A group of twenty-something girlfriends find themselves in New York City in the midst of the 90s dot-com boom. They've got killer jobs, killer clothes, and each other -- what could go wrong? Everything, and usually in most hilarious way possible. Called \"the perfect New Adult 90s romantic comedy,\" the Girlfriends of Gotham's first book follows the life of NYC newcomer Natalie Pepper. She's a California girl, a fish out of water, and she's going to make it on her own in the big city despite a massive crush on a coworker (a no-no), a boss that can't seem to get her name right, and a group of friends creating all kinds of chaos of their own. If you loved Bridget Jones and miss Sex and the City, this laugh-out-loud series will scratch that itch. Dive in today!",
