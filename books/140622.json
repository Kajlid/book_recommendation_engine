  "description": "How much would you give for a ticket to Paradise? How much would you give for the chance to start anew, without the stresses and strains of modern life? John Carlton and his family just won the trip of a lifetime and they can't wait to get started in the brave new world that awaits them. Simon Swanson wishes he had a ticket. He dreams of walking on fine coral beaches with the sun burning overhead, but for now he watches, happy that some, at least, have the hope of a good life. Michael Judd is going to save the world and he won't let anything stop him. Five lives intertwine in a tale of hope, redemption and salvation on the journey to Paradise. Praise for Jason K. Lewis...\"...leaves you on the edge of a thread, dangling, really wanting more...\"\"...Lewis has a knack for quickly developing characters through their behaviours...complexities are expressed with power and subtlety...\"",
