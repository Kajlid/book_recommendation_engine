To ensure my body parts stay intact, I only need to follow one simple rule.Don’t touch my captain’s little sister.Seems easy enough. She’s snarky and bossy and has a mouth like a sailor. Truthfully, I’m bordering on the edge of terrified when she’s around.The problem is I’ve seen too much. Too much of her, inside and out. And now? Now I want more.But she’s my best friend’s little sister, and nobody’s ever been as off limits as Jennie Beckett is to me.Her collection of toys is impressive, but I plan on showing her how a real man can make her vibrate without all the batteries. These hands can handle a hockey stick; surely they can handle her.C’mon, Jennie. Play with me.",
