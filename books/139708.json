  "description": "When a ventilator prevented her from speaking during her final hours, Jennifer started writing. After her death, her husband turns to those pages to tell her story of courage and faith. James had just walked through the door after a day’s work when Jennifer told him the news that changed everything: it was cancer. In the following two years they would lose their sense of normalcy and their dreams for the future. But along the way, they would gain something even greater than their loss.  Told through the eyes of a grieving husband is this true story of a young woman’s fight for her life. Jennifer’s final words, penned by hand when a ventilator prevented her from speaking, provide a powerful backdrop to this journey of faith and hope.
