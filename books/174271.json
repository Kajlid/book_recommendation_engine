  "description": "Playboy Oliver Aston never hid who he is from anyone. Cowboy Holt Jamison was betrothed at birth to the local town sweetheart, and revealing his true self would hurt his family, at least that’s the justification in his mind to hide his orientation. After a heated lovers’ quarrel in the desert, Oliver is sent back to the States. When Holt leaves the military, he moves far from his Alabama home to Oliver’s hometown, but is it a second chance the two hearts deserve? Or will someone from the past come knocking to claim a birthright?",
