  "description": "Raine enjoys a respite with her dragon lover in the land of the Ha’kan, recovering from the wounds sustained battling the dark demons of the Underworld. Skye is melancholy, thinking she has endangered everyone with her uncontrolled magic. But her despondency does not last long when she meets the ravishing mage who is to be her mentor, one who believes that sexual energy and magical energy are intimately related.The high elves, the Alfar, enter into negotiations with the Ha’kan, and all progresses with promise as the beautiful Queen of the all-female race is gracious beyond measure. It seems the treaty will be signed and the alliance formed when rumors of an assassination threaten to derail all. Raine does not know the target or the assassin, but she must prevent the death of a head of state at all costs. In the end, it is the legends of the Great War that will bring all together, reminding them of the monumental sacrifices of the Ancient Dragons and their Scinterian brethren in the past.",
