  "description": "Samdon Cutter is a Sentinal, a vampire guardian appointed by the Fathers (the five leaders of their species and council). There isn't much room for protecting their race these days, not since humans discovered their existence hundreds of years ago, leading to the birth of an armistice between both races.Vampires do not kill humans. It is forbidden and punishable by death in the form of a silver stake, encoded with a death curse by the Seer, that penetrates both hearts in the vampire body.However, there are humans who are willing feeders, known as Blood Croppers, forced to wear a tattoo in the form of a barcode with a blood droplet beside it to identify them. The Croppers are what make up the blood supply.One night, after leaving Blood Noir, a club owned by the Fathers, Samdon unintentionally finds a woman crying upon the balcony of her apartment. This woman is unlike anything he's come across before. She's a complete enigma... and she's human. He finds himself watching over her nightly, even moves into her apartment building in order to learn more about her and why he feels so tethered to her. But a human/vampire relationship is not allowed. So, even though he comes to desire Dailynn, he can not have her.Unfortunately, stopping himself from wanting her turns impossible the more time he spends with her. And soon, they fall in love.Will their forbidden love stand strong in a world against them being together, or will they lose more than just each other?",
