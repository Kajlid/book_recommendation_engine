  "title": "Deliver Me From Eva",
  "description": "Although DELIVER ME FROM EVA opens with the breeziness of a mystery/romance novel typical for the 1930's & 40's, it quickly descends into a tale of madness and depravity. Mark Allard, a young lawyer with bright prospects, has just married Eva. It was a whirlwind romance and following the nuptials he finds that he knows very little about his bride.After an all too brief honeymoon in San Francisco, Mark drives Eva to her family's estate in Pasadena so that he can meet his new in-laws. Mark is instantly struck by the cool, beguiling beauty of Thalamus. Expecting a pleasant weekend, he instead finds himself prisoner of a clan of brilliant New Age whackos who seek eternal enlightenment through addictive experimental chiropractics.At turns grotesque, unpredictable and darkly humorous, DELIVER ME FROM EVA is regarded as one of the best horror/crime novels of the 20th Century. It is a non-stop, head-spinning, cover-to-cover read.Now, please join us in The Cradle of Light---",
