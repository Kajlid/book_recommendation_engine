But somewhere along the way she stirs up feelings I've long thought myself incapable of.She's my rabbit, my sweet little bunny, and I need to teach her how to run from me so I can catch her and show her what it's like to be devoured by the predator she should be afraid of.Danger lurks in every corner, and the risk of getting caught grows by the day.
