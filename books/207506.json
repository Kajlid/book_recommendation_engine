  "description": "There is only one man that can make Anita Leonidos' heart ache with longing, but the handsome photographer only thinks of her as a sister. With glamorous models parading around him all the time, what chance does a young, kindergarten teacher have of getting him to notice her? Long-term relationships and Michael Williams just don't belong in the same sentence. So any attraction he feels for the girl he's known for over half his life absolutely has to stop. Not only does he owe it her, but also the only man who's ever believed in him - her father. But how long is he supposed to keep fighting this feeling? Will it end up costing him the only woman he'll ever love?",
