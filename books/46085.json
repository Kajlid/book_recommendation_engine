Having found fame and success as a model - the portrait of her astride a chair is iconic - her short affair with the Minister of War, John Profumo, led to the downfall of Harold Macmillan's government and was at the epicentre of the social and political earthquake that followed.

This story Christine Keeler has finally found herself brave enough to tell will shatter all preconceptions and has the power to rewrite history.",
