  "description": "A fantasist without equal, Patricia A. McKillip has created worlds of intricate beauty and unforgettably nuanced characters. For twenty-five years, she has drawn readers into her spell, spining modern-day fables with a grace never before seen.Now, for the first time, she presents a book of previously uncollected short stories--full of beautiful dragons, rueful princesses, and handsome bards, and written in the gorgeous--and often surprisingly funny--prose she is known for. This is her world, wrapped up in the finery of fairy tales...A dragon has held an island in never-ending winter, until a man comes to break its fierce embrace--only to learn the true meaning of wisdom--in \"The Harrowing of the Dragon of Hoarsbreath.\" The \"Lady of the Skulls\" lures men with what's most precious to them--and then kills them with it. \"Star-Crossed\" portrays the investigation into the deaths of Romeo and Juliet--and illustrates how little the world tolerates true love. These stories and twelve others are here in a remarkable collection from one of today's most popular and beloved authors.",
