  "description": "Finally back in Zhakieva with her demon-siblings in tow, Darkrow Katerini wants only to spend the rest of Lonely Winter resting in the capital. Instead, however, the Blue Emperor sends her on an insane mission: climb the formidable Svarinard mountain range in the height of Lonely Winter and bring back the missing Darkrow of Zhakieva. As if circumstances weren't bad enough, Katerini is partnered with the Blue Emperor's heir, the strange and infuriating Darkrow Nikolai, who seems more interested in spinning away his magic recklessly than in the actual mission.",
