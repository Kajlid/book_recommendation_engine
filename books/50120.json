  "description": "The rigid enforcement of The Orders now threatens the people they were designed to protect. Elias has a solution, except it puts him on a course of action that is at odds with the rules that he has been charged to rigorously uphold. On top of every thing else, the solution came to him in the form of a dream; in a time and place where no one dreams.Can he save the last vestiges of humanity, or even himself?'The Deluge of Elias' touches on multiple themes including the formation of religion, the social control it creates and the self destructive nature of totalitarian regimes. Do you dare to dream of another way?",
