  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B01E4VBRC0There’s a serial killer stalking dragon shifters in Sea City, and pretty boy Detective Lachlan Flint wants my help tracking the killer down. I’m a dragon shifter myself. Penny Caspian’s the name. But I’m trying to lie low, not run around interrogating half the dragon community—or one dragon in particular. My ex. Yeah, I left my destined mate. I know, I know. Dragons don’t do that. Trust me. It’s better this way.This detective, though, he’s not taking no for an answer. Did I mention he’s pretty? But haunted and hiding something. There’s some deep-down trouble in that boy’s hollow eyes, and I got enough trouble of my own. Vampire motorcycle gangs. Wounded gargoyles. Locked dragon crypts.Maybe it’s because I saw that shifter’s broken body, washed up on the beach. Maybe it’s her dead, empty eyes. It’s something, the hell if I know what, but I am going to find that killer. This is my city, and I look after my own.",
