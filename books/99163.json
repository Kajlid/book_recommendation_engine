  "description": "This is beyond a book. This odyssey will take your mind on a voyage in which your soul will discover its own truth. It still leaves you traveling on this journey even when the pages end. The narrative manifested through a person who encountered a path that few people had traveled, yet she never touched on the thought of inscribing it. Nevertheless, divine intervention knocked at the door so others could open themselves to accept and embrace their own truth on the map of life. In each vignette, you will discover a familiar life-force, moving you through a series of moments that will reawaken what is beyond your reality.",
