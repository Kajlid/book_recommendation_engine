I will definitely be checking out the next installment!”abcarroll at LibraryThing.comMistakes...Everyone makes them. We are only human.Some of our mistakes are small... like the times you stay up till 2 am studying for a test that you end up failing because you are too tired to think.Others are so catastrophic that they change your life.... forever....Maddison regrets not listening to her parents, not being a 'good girl' and not staying at home like she was supposed to instead of sneaking off with her friends for a Spring Break getaway. How she wishes she could turn back time; then maybe she wouldn't be in the nightmare she is in now. Kidnapped and taken to a different country unaware of where she is or what these men want with her.Maddy's parents can't help her, in fact they aren't even aware she is in Mexico. Who can save her? Or can she save herself?4 STARS“...a roller coaster ride for the emotions. Thought-provoking, angering, sad, and a tear-jerker.”psteinke1122 at LibraryThing.comLearn more about A. M. Hayward and L.
