Addison has sold her first screenplay and Emma has moved onto some new projects as well. But, there are realities in Tinseltown. The love affair between Addy and Emma has heated up, and the two are nearly inseparable behind closed doors. When the lights go up, and the red carpet is laid, it is not Addison walking by her lover's side. A life in seclusion might seem the perfect scenario for a writer, but can Addison remain content to take a back seat in Emma's life? Can Emma find the strength to shine the spotlight on her relationship with Addison? Amid the clicks of cameras, the glitz and glamour of Hollywood; can two women truly find love?",
