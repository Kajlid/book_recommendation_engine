  "description": "Holy fucking hearts.Did you just read that?!If you did, I need your advice.I met fallen angel princes; I met a Savage Duke; I met a Cheshire Cat.And remember—how could you possibly forget—I'm the fabled Alice from the prophecy.Just a twisted, dark version of the girl in Lewis Carroll's old books.Except in those books, there was a happy ending.In those books, Alice wasn't dating nine very different, very beautiful men.But now that I've met the King of Hearts and the Mad Hatter, I'm not sure who the real bad guys are.I'm the only one who can turn Underland back into Wonderland again.But if I have a chance to escape the blood, the death, and the intrigue in this place, should I take it?I'm Allison Liddell, and I've got a choice to make: stay here and fight the darkness, defeat the Anti-Alice, and survive the Torrid Tea Party ... or run.Tweedledee says I can change the world.So if you're reading this, will you help me decide what I should do?I want to go home, but I can't leave this place as broken as I found it, now can I?",
