  "description": "Mark Simms is a humble policy fulfilment analyst who has no idea that the CEO of the insurance company he works for is a 120-year-old psychotic cyborg with plans to destroy the earth. He also doesn’t know that those plans involve a massive international spy network, sinister weather control technology, and a mysterious century-old scientific expedition to Greenland from which no one, reportedly, returned alive. He would have known all of these things if he’d just listened to his friend Max, but he always kind of thought Max was, to put it politely, nuts. One small act of domestic terrorism aside, he only ever hung out with Max to meet women. Now Max is missing and Mark is the only one who may be able to find him. So, yeah. The world is pretty much doomed.",
