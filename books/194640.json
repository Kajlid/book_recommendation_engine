  "description": "Since Ester's death in 1972, at the age of seventy-three, much previously unpublished material has become available to his biographers, who have put it to good use. The story of the artist's life is told here with the help of virtually his entire correspondence, the journals of his travels, and, to supply the facts about his youthful years, the journals kept by his father.",
