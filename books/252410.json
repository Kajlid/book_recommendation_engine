  "description": "When Evie Lancaster met Finn Montgomery, it was anything but love at first sight. Evie was a girl looking for a new start from her difficult upbringing. Finn was smoldering, sexy, and rude. He was also the brother of Evie's best friend, Jacob. Through a series of events no one can predict, Jacob's world gets turned upside down, leaving Evie in total panic. Evie, being the supportive friend, decides to hop in the car to go after him. Only, somehow, Finn tags along for the ride. Just two people in a car with a few bumps along the way, what could go wrong? Evie's sure this will end in disaster. But it turns out, maybe she doesn't know Finn as well as she thought. The two band together to find Jacob, but end up finding an unlikely friendship and possibly a blossoming romance along the way as well. But with her past and his reputation, can they ever make it work?",
