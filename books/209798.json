  "description": "Disclaimer: The pages of this book contain vivid and often times disturbing scenes of blood, sex, gore and cannibalism. Due to the graphic nature of these details, this book is not for the faint of heart and is intended for mature audiences only.  Hollis Jones was never normal.  She was what some might still consider a freak. From a young age, she had been taunted by almost all of her siblings and mocked by her parents until the day she was able to get away.  And that was when she met him ...  Bates Murphy had always been a man of exotic tastes.  He was what some might consider dangerous. A man used to being on his own and indulging in his artistic needs, he never knew what it was like to need, truly need until the day he saw her.  And that was when their worlds collided ...  Hollis quickly had a foreboding feeling being around Bates, but he was the man that was meant for her. He was the one that would never hurt her. He was the one that she knew she would love to death.",
