She’s afraid of him and what he has to offer. Luckily for her, helping patients face their fears is one of his specialties.Kori knows she wants Kai. Her boss is the most amazing man she’s ever met. She’s also smart enough to stay away from him. Having been down this road before, she knows it only leads to heartache. She’s just found a place where she can belong.

It’s better to guard her heart and let Kai think she’s frightened of his dark, dominant nature.When Kai is recruited for an operation with McKay-Taggart, everything is turned upside down.
