She’ll just have to avoid him during the short time they’ll be sharing an address.Except Griffin isn’t so easy to ignore—especially when he’s making her laugh, cooking her late-night pancakes, or parading around in nothing but a towel. Attraction wasn’t supposed to be part of the arrangement, but the man behind that slick movie star smile is impossible to resist.Can Alice let her guard down and learn to trust again? And can Griffin stop trying to please everyone else long enough to realize Alice is the best thing that ever happened to him?",
