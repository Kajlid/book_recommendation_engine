  "description": "In the tall grasses, faceless things with razor sharp claws wait for Sarah and her brother Ben . . . Except they aren't real. It's just a story told by their grandfather, a story he tells them when they find an old sword in his basement storage room. There are monsters, a mysterious white lady, and of course the magic sword itself, a weapon that helped him defeat the creatures that stalked him in the jungles of Vietnam forty years before. At ten years old, Sarah knows that monsters and magic swords aren't real. But then Sarah's school begins to turn into a jungle, and she sees quick glimpses of creatures with no faces peering at her from between long stalks of grass. As her world continues to change around her, she begins to wonder if the story—and the creatures—aren't just made up after all.",
