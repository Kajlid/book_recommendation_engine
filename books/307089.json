Now, a vengeful group of Formulists known as the Voidweavers have returned and set their sights on Genevieve, believing she might be the key to awakening their fallen leader, the Void King. Genevieve must fight to stay alive as she unravels the mystery and danger that have shattered the stability of the life she once knew before the Voidweavers succeed in shadowing the world in chaos and darkness once again.",
