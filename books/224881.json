The murder investigation coincides with a deadly flu virus outbreak, resulting in the university being quarantined from the outside world.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen more Deaf students are murdered, it becomes clear there is a serial killer operating within the sealed-off university. A chilling cat-and-mouse game evolves as the unknown killer targets Valerie and the virus claims more lives.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA stunning, claustrophobic, \"whodunit\" murder mystery, Silent Fear (A novel inspired by true crimes) is the eighth novel by father-and-son writing team Lance & James Morcan. Included is a commentary by Deaf filmmaker Brent Macpherson on the unique aspects of Deaf culture the story covers. Together, the Morcans and Macpherson are currently developing a feature film adaptation of Silent Fear.",
