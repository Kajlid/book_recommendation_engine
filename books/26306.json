  "description": "Dane Stevens lives a well curated existence as a body shop owner in a rural Maine town. He eats lunch at the same restaurant every day, sticks to routine and dreads change.Of course, the more things change, the more they stay the same, and changes like having to hire new cashiers are proving more cyclical than would be assumed in his sleepy little Maine town. Every new hire is inexplicably followed in short order by the arrival of another 1965 Thunderbird, a car that has proven itself both his curse and possible savior. He has only ever worked on one, and has rejected all others since. The obvious question is why, and eventually every new cashier getâ€™s around to asking it.It's a story that he never enjoys telling, but one that has shaped the man that he has become, maybe saved his marriage once or twice, and haunted his dreams for over five years. Sometimes you meet people that irrevocably alter your perception of life, love, and everything else. For Dane, five years ago it was an old farmer and his wifes 65 Thunderbird.",
