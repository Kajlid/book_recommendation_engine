  "description": "A marshmallow alpha with more heart than sense and a stubborn human omega trying to guard his heart fall in love in this first story from the Waves of Fate omegaverse.  “Oops! You dropped your coat!” With these words, waiter Daniel Collins turns alpha selkie Gregory Samson’s life upside down. Because that coat is not some fancy heirloom fur. No, it is Gregory’s selkie pelt, which magically connects him with his seal animal inside.  When Gregory hears Daniel’ voice, he knows the rare human omega is his mate. Too bad Daniel has more than a few misgivings about trusting his heart to a selkie. Because the magical seal shifters have one of the worst player reputations of all shifter kind and Daniel fears a broken heart. How will Gregory convince Daniel to give him a chance?  It wouldn’t be so hard if Gregory’s mother and everyone else would just stop meddling!  Brought together by the magic of Gregory’s coat, can the pair weather insecurities, an interfering mother, meddling friends, and a disgruntled inner animal?  The Selkie’s Coat is book 1 of the Waves of Fate Omegaverse. It can be read as a standalone.",
