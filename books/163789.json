  "description": "An artist can't shake the eerie, cold embrace from the ghost of his jilted love. An enormous rat with baleful, glaring eyes, possesses the spirit of a notorious hanging judge. A hauntingly beautiful woman appears to a student in his dreams--and then in flesh and blood. . . . From old-fashioned ghost stories by H. G. Wells and Guy de Maupassant to chilling tales that defy description by literary masters Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Washington Irving, One Dark Night is an extraordinary collection full of gothic mood and ghastly haunts. Rich in atmosphere and creepy detail, these terrifying tales illuminate the darkest corners of the mind and make real our most innate fears. One Dark Night will sate even the most intrepid reader's hunger for the macabre. Beware of reading them past midnight!Stories included:\"The Face,\" Lennox Robinson\"The Dead Smile,\" F.
