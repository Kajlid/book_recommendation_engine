  "description": "What’s a movie star to do when giving up the spotlight could hurt the ones he loves most?My agent has this idea—an insanely bad idea—to reboot my Hollywood heartthrob status by having my long-lost love dump me … while I’m proposing to her on national TV.The theory? Women everywhere will swoon over poor Lincoln James, scrambling to repair his vulnerable, shattered heart.Trouble is, I don’t have any kind of love—long, lost, or otherwise.To play my fake girlfriend, my agent enlists Hadley Morgan, my secret college crush. The one who dragged me to an audition that launched my career but left her in the dust.Upping the ante, she offers Hadley a slot on the show she missed out on years ago. When the alternative publicity ploy is for reporters to dig up dirt on my family, I’ve got no choice but to go along with the ruse.That’s why I’m in Harvest Hollow now—as one half of the dream couple HadLink—at least until Hadley explodes our relationship during a very public proposal.Our breakup’s built into this deal. Too bad I’ve got real love for this woman.But if I come clean, I risk Hadley’s big break, my family’s painful past, and my own rebooted heart …Faking the Fall is a closed-door fake-dating/celebrity romcom full of sizzling kisses and crackling chemistry. You'll find plenty of humor and heart in the small town of Harvest Hollow, but no spice. * Each book in the Sweater Weather series is a standalone and can be read in any order!",
