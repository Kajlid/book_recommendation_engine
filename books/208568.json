  "description": "Life can change in an instant. Shy, shunned Sterling Ricknagel never expected to become High Princess of Lethemia—or to be betrothed to the handsomest lord in the land. Though she fears rejection, she dutifully represents her House. Every privilege comes with a cost. When an unexpected tragedy throws the country back into civil war, Sterling flees for her life. Anchorless and alone, she knows she must restore her family’s crumbling honor. Love can prevail over any obstacle. Sterling’s only possible ally is the one man she cannot trust: her former fiancé, a notorious rake who harbors his own secrets. Seeking redemption, Sterling sets out on an epic journey, facing despair, deceits, and danger to discover the truth about her family—and herself.",
