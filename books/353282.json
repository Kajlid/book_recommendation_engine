  "description": "Skillen leads the reader on a tour of the present landscape of Christianity.... This book draws the reader into the current debate by providing some basic conceptual tools, some fundamental questions, and the benefit of the author's knowledge... those who seek a Christian political perspective informed by political science will be greatly enriched. (Gregory Bezilla, Dept. of Political Science, Columbia University) The Scattered Voice is a landmark book-for breadth of analysis, clarity of interpretation, and clarity of vision. Skillen has achieved something quite rare here. He has presented his own forceful prescription for how Christians may best contribute to public life through a meticulously fair discussion of several other alternatives. This is a book of light for an often heated subject. (Mark Noll, Professor of History, Wheaton College) Skillen provides the scorecard one might need for identifying the players presenting competing \"Christian\" political options today. He also offers valuable critiques and suggests an alternative worth contemplating. (George M. Marsden, Professor of History, Duke University)",
