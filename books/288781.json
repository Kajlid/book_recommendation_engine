  "description": "Where is Little Bear? In this charming look-and-find book, highlighted by Jackie Morris's gorgeous animal fantasies, very young children explore theatrical and circus settings as they attempt to find the missing cub. The concepts of opposites, colors, and contrasts are introduced in the read-aloud nursery verse, and simple clues and vivid word images help children discover Little Bear, whether he's trying on a hat, standing on his head, or floating in a balloon. Gradually Little Bear moves into a more familiar landscape of tea, bath, and bedtime, a cue for little bears' bedtimes everywhere.",
