  "description": "The world was supposed to end on April 23, but Rainbow Williams’s world ended days before that. The mass hysteria caused by the impending apocalypse claimed everything she’d ever loved. Her family. Her city. Her will to live. Until she met him. Wes Parker didn’t have anything left for the apocalypse to take…he’d already lost it all by the time he was nine-years-old. His family. His home. His hope of ever being loved. Until he met her. Brought together by fate and bound by a love that would last lifetimes, Rain and Wes were prepared to die together on April 23. They were not prepared for what would happen on April 24.",
