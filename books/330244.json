  "description": "It’s time for the Queen to rise. The Snake has gone underground and my husband right along with them. Left to pick up the pieces, I know it’s only a matter of time before the Snake strikes again. My husband left everything to me; the money, the businesses, the title. Now the leader of both families, I have to prove that I can be the leader I know I was born to be. But the rules of the game have changed and everything is at stake–my life, my relationship, and my position. Yet none of that matters because I know just how far I’m willing to go to save it all. The Snake will strike again, I’m sure of it. To succeed, I have to be ruthless. Savage. Merciless. Nothing and no one can stand in my way, no matter the cost. But betrayal lurks in the shadows–one I’m not sure I’ll survive. And it just might be the end of everything.",
