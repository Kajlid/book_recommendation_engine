  "title": "The Alpha's Desire",
  "description": "This is my favorite story. Warning, it is mad and certainly unrefined, there is also head-hopping involved. It has been a mental battle trying to figure out a way to tell this story through the eyes of one libinous werewolf, who happens to be a single father. I had a ton of fun writing about his problems trying to feed two cubs, trying to maintain a household and hold down a new job at the quarry. To add to his problems, Linus' boss is a hot, hunk of a gargoyle who is not easily swayed by a tail and pretty wolf eyes.",
