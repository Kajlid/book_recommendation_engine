  "description": "Seventeen-year-old Hope Fairmont longs for a normal teenage life, but with a gift like hers, normal equals healing illnesses and injuries instantly. A small town is the perfect place for her to heal those who can't heal themselves, and an even better place for her father, James Fairmont, to hide his daughter from the rest of the world. Life takes an unexpected turn when two handsome strangers show up at her high school armed with an alarming amount of knowledge concerning her future and her past.Victor and Tie may say they're high school students, but their claims become suspect as they use every method available to prove Hope isn't the most average of teenagers. Staying away from them would be the smart thing to do, but Victor's gentle, easy manner, and Tie's mixed signals and strange mood swings draw her hopelessly closer to revealing the secret she and her father have been so desperate to hide.Hope's life goes from less than normal to downright crazy when she learns her healing power is tied to an ancient prophecy.With the support of her father, the fiery loyalty of her best friend Angie, and the child-like love of Kirby, a ten-year-old patient, Hope must fight against the forces of a relentless demon god while unwinding the tangled pieces of her past, proving to herself and those she loves that destiny isn't determined by some cosmic reading of the stars, but by the individual choices one makes.",
