  "description": "This book was available for preorder as \"Oktober Shadows\" but will now be published with the new title \"10/31: The Butcher's Story\".One Halloween night, monsters took over our world. No one understands where they came from or why. But those who have survived in the age of 10/31 spend their days and nights in a life-and-death battle against the darkest forces imaginable â€” witches and werewolves, mummies and goblins, and Jacks... sentient pumpkin creatures which may be more dangerous than all the rest.Two young men are among the survivors, living by their wits in a wilderness now occupied by The Butcher's Boys, a cult-like human tribe bent on staking out their own corner of the world. Soon enough the young men are trapped between a goblin army and the Butcher himself, a madman as dangerous as any monster that walks the night... and the only road to safety is sure to be paved with blood.",
