  "title": "My Big Fat Bloodsucker Wedding",
  "description": "It’s all fun and games…until you stake your sister’s fiancé. Okay, fine! I’m not really going to stake Colin or his brother, the insufferable, bossy-fanged Darcy Blackmore. At least not as long as I can find another way to stop our siblings from getting hitched.My sister, Lizzy, won’t admit it, but she doesn’t love Colin. She’s sacrificing herself so we can stay in Nightfall, New Hampshire, and renew the magical shield keeping the paranormal creatures here, including witches like us, safe from human discovery. I have ten days to find another way—aside from a bloodsucker wedding—to secure our legacy and not a lead in sight. So, imagine my surprise when the wretched, though admittedly smoking hot, Darcy comes to the rescue.His scheme? We pretend to be hot for each other, trick Lizzy and Colin into confessing they don’t really want to tie the knot, and sort out how to save the town once the wedding bells are silenced—permanently. It’s not a bad plan. In theory.If only Darcy wasn’t every bit as delicious as he is obnoxious. If only he’d kept his secret sweet side under wraps and kissing him wasn’t the most amazing thing to happen to my lips in my entire life. If only this fake love had stayed fake, instead of creeping into my heart on stealthy little vampire feet. Now I have a decision to make—keep faking it with the world’s sexiest vampire until I lose big at love, yet again, or leave my new hometown and all the people I’m coming to love behind. Forever.",
