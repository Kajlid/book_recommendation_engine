  "title": "HYBRIDS: So you think you are human",
  "description": "Myths, religions and archeological discoveries around the world discuss the presence of intelligent non-human beings who have interbred with humans creating hybrids. Tanis Helliwell offers convincing evidence about the existence of 22 different human-hybrids (elementals, angels, dolphins, giants, dragons, centaurs, pan and many others). People who discover they are hybrids report feeling more authentically themselves—more energized, powerful and self-loving—as a result of their discovery. AM I A HYBRID? If you answer “yes” to these statements, Hybrids will be of special interest to - I often feel I don't fit in - I am hypersensitive to violence - I am deeply committed to helping the Earth - I would describe myself as an independent thinker - I follow my own inner guidance about rightness, even if it goes against the norm. As with her ground-breaking work on elementals in the classic “Summer with the Leprechauns”, Tanis is, with Hybrids, once again at the forefront of an entire new genre of investigation.",
