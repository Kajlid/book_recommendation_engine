I’m not myself and the pain I fight through each day has made me make some really bad decisions. Disorder – Out of control. Not fucking normal. Nowhere even close.I say fuck Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.The life I left behind is gone and everything I’d hoped to return to has been stolen away, all while I was being beaten, starved, and tortured. But being Nate Wilcox, I pick my ass up, ‘cause I’m a fucking survivor. Even if my methods are totally fucked up, it’s all I can do to keep the pain at bay.",
