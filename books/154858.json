  "description": "From the author of the Kellington series of Regency romances, comes the second book in the Emerson saga.  Lord James Emerson has returned to England intent on regaining the land that was stolen from him in America. He has come, with his daughter in tow, to confront the family of the man who cheated him out of his life's savings. But he did not expect to meet the woman who steals his heart.  Miss Irene Wallace is certain her brother could not have acted so dishonorably. Yet it is hard to believe the man who loves his daughter so much is lying. She decides to work with Lord James to resolve the issue in the interest of justice. But instead, she finds herself falling in love with her brother's enemy.  ALWAYS TRUE TO HER is a passionate Regency romance about the bonds of love and family.  ADVISORY: This book is, technically, historical romance. But it's very light on history. Very light. Very VERY light. If you're looking for a history lesson, you won't like this book. It is, however, heavy on passion. It contains explicit language and sex scenes. If you like a clean romance or one with just a hint of passion, this is not the book for you.",
