  "title": "Mum Had a Kingswood: Tales from the Life and Mind of Rosso",
  "description": "It's a book. A funny book. A funny book by Tim \"Rosso\" Ross. But what's in this funny book, I hear you ask? Well, it's all manner of stories from the life and mind of Tim Ross. There are warm, fuzzy childhood stories of billycarts and milk bars. There are teenage stories of angst, girls, bad clothes, and bad hair. There are student tales of share-house madness and misery. And there are adults tales of living out a rock n' roll dream, doing stand up, being on the television, and entertaining the nation on the radio every morning. In between all these wonderful tales, there are rants and raves, ideas and fantastical stories. Just stuff really. Wonderful stuff from the mind of Tim \"Rosso\" Ross. This is his book. It's part memoir, part brain dump. And he's written it just for you.",
