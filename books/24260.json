Unexpectedly, he finds himself alone with Anne Elliot and eventually rescues her from the naughty antics of her nephew, little Walter. In this version, the apothecary, Mr Robinson, has come to check on the injured little Charles and in a twist of the story, declares a quarantine! When Anne and Frederick are forced to stay alone together in one room, with a sick child to care for, will they overcome their pride and anger? This short story combines a little bit of \"Outbreak!\" with a lot of \"It Happened One Night.\" Happy ending included at no charge.",
