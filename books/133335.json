When an opportunity arises in the form of a new business venture—a distillery on Old Mission Peninsula—Delia knows she’s found it. The only problem? She has to nail this meeting with her potential partner first. Owen Lawless is sexy and intelligent, a lethal combination, and Delia knows she’s far from his ideal candidate.Owen Lawless has been a caretaker and leader all his life—both as the oldest of seven siblings and as a former star NFL quarterback. But as much as he hates to admit it, he needs help to make his next passion project a reality. What he doesn’t need is Delia Delatou, with her whiskey eyes and perfect everything, barging in and wrecking all of his plans.Despite an unspoken hands-off rule, the more time they spend working together, the more they both start to realize their feelings for each other go far beyond the simple business partnership they agreed to.Giving in and mixing business with pleasure might end up being the latest in a string of poor decisions…or the best one they’ve ever made.",
