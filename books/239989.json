  "description": "The Prowlers saga continues...and deep in the rural backwoods lies the nature of the beast within. The remnants of the Prowler pack once led by Owen Tanzer has retreated into the hills and woods of rural Vermont, where a number of unexplained deaths soon has Jack Dwyer on their trail. But the woods hide a sacred meeting ground the Prowlers have guarded for centuries, and the quiet town of Buckton is much more than it seems. The town hosts a Prowler community which has existed for generations alongside their human neighbours, sublimating their instinct for blood in order to live undetected and undisturbed. Their patriarch has even written a secret history in which he reveals their true nature and tries to explain the world from their point of view. Then their peace is shattered forever by the renegades in the woods, and the Prowlers of Buckton have to choose once and for all which side they are on. Meanwhile the crucial question for Jack becomes which of the townsfolk are human -- and which are not.",
