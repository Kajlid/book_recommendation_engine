  "title": "#StillWithHer : Hillary Rodham Clinton and the Moments That Sparked a Movement",
  "description": "Foreword by Hillary Rodham Clinton with essays by Chelsea Clinton, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michelle Kwan, and many others. This book is a look forward at all the positive movements that have come forth from Hillary Rodham Clinton's historic campaign for President. Before there were pink-eared protest caps, before a record number of women raised their hands to run for public office, there was Hillary Rodham Clinton. For 19 months, starting with Clinton's declaration of her candidacy for president, women and girls dared to believe that experience, hard work, and homework would trump gender could trump gender and put a woman in the White House, at last. This is the insider's study of those heady, hard days told through the lens of the photographer always at Hillary's side and the words of those who pulled with her. This is an intimate portrait of one of the most resilient and inspirational leaders in American History.",
