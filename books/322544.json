  "description": "The Twin Cities is a place of duality where good coexists with evil. Cadence Morello is adept at this balancing act which is why she has taken to her psychic connection with a prince, a soldier, a mysterious pirate, a former chieftain’s daughter, and a peacekeeper quite well. It has almost been like a dream. However, in this city of illusion, reality cracks along the daydream. Love blurs into hate. Past into present. Selflessness into selfishness. Acceptance to vengeance.The fragments appear: a reunion with a loved one, a locked cave murder mystery, underground negotiations, a limitless bounty, a citywide war, encounters with True Conductors, and the reemergence of ELPIS. The illusion has shattered. It is time to face reality.The bets have been set. The cards have been played. Now all that’s left is to watch the dominoes fall. The secret of ELPIS is finally revealed, and the truth lies close to the heart.Readable on sixchances.com",
