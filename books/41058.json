We looked at the baby, and the baby looked at us.\"A long time ago in a faraway land, a cat lived in a barn. He had to share it with the other animals: cows and goats, chickens and . . . mice! But that was all right; he was a good mouser.Then one wintry night the door flew open and in came a man and a woman to take shelter from the snow. Soon the cat heard the cry of a new baby. Visitors came to kneel before the family. In the crowded barn, every face was turned to the tiny infant.Through the eyes of one small cat, award-winning author/illustrator Michael Foreman retells the wondrous story of the first Christmas.",
