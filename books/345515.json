Benny is equally shocked to find Win doing so well and looking so gorgeous...far too gorgeous. She's convinced Win is wasting her time on this vacuous new lover. In fact, she has a lot of opinions on Win and her new life—the strongest being Benny should be back in it.Nestled in the beautiful Aegean on an island blessed by Eros, the God of Love himself, Benny finds no lack of inspiration in her quest to woo back her lost love. Her methods, however, are the stuff myths are made of.",
