  "description": "Forbidden love shouldn't feel so good.  It also shouldn't hurt so much.  How could the one person I can't have be the only person I truly need?  Florian Harper Riley has my heart and he doesn't even know it. I used to think that was okay, that I'd get over him, but no matter how hard I try, I can't purge his sharp green gaze from my thoughts.  He's a tattoo artist, the love of my life, the man of my dreams. But he's also my stepbrother.  Fate can be wicked cruel.  *This is a 98,000 word, full length stand-alone novel from debut author Violet Blaze (and it's hot!)*  A Bad Boy Stepbrother Romance.",
