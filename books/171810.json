  "description": "My name is Thea Bell and I was murdered. I always assumed that death was the end. So when my life was cruelly taken away from me, I never thought I would get a second chance to say what I needed to. But then I was given a choice, a choice that allowed me to see the people I had left behind, and I knew I had to take it. I wanted to say a proper goodbye. I needed justice for what happened to me. But even in death, things rarely go to plan. I never expected to meet him. I didn't anticipate falling in love. I hadn't considered the repercussions of coming back. I never realized I would put another person in danger. I didn't know my actions were going to haunt us forever. My name is Detective Aiden Mercer, and I think I have gone insane. I am seeing the murder victim of my current case alive and in the flesh, and that is simply not possible. I can see her, hear her, touch her. She’s real to me, however I know this cannot be real. Right? But try telling my heart that, because as I grow closer to catching Thea’s killer, I also fall deeper into trouble. Because love is rarely anything but trouble and I know this love will haunt me forever.
