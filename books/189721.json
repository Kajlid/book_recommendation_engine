Especially a certain quiet bear who’s always been her rock.  Patient. Oliver Campbell knows what it means to be patient. But twenty years of wanting one unavailable woman may have pushed him to the edge. With Allie working every night at his bar, their friendship has begun to fracture.

And twenty years of unspoken truths may finally come to light.  WAKING HEARTS is the third paranormal romance novel in the Cambio Springs Mysteries series.",
