  "description": "The Other Side of Ourselves, Rob Taylor's debut collection of award-winning poems, explores the real and imagined worlds of our everyday lives. Mysterious without denying clear images, plain spoken without being plain, if there is an ongoing Cold War between modern poetry and the general reading public, Taylor's poems are defiantly Non-Aligned. They promote a middle path where complexity does not trump simple pleasure, and pleasure gives way willingly to moments of insight and grace.",
