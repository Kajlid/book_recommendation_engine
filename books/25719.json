  "description": "Ollie Fitzgerald is finally ready to move on.After spending his entire life crafting the perfect plan for every situation, he wasn't expecting his best friend's brother, Nash, to kiss him on the first day of summer.Something else he wasn't expecting? Nash ghosting him a week later when he left for lacrosse camp. Now, hurting from his first real heartbreak, Ollie dives into his Heartbreak Anthems playlist to let go and follow the music wherever it leads him, and hopefully that's away from Nash.But when Nash comes back at the start of the school year, avoiding his feelings isn't as easy as it sounds. And when Dee, Ollie's best friend, confides in him after a school prank puts prom in jeopardy, the three of them decide to work together to save the dance.Even with a well-curated list of pop songs, moving on isn't easy, forcing him to face the idea that he might not even want to in the first place. And maybe moving on means something different than he originally thought.",
