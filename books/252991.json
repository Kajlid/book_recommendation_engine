  "description": "Lily is the only person in Golden City who has no guardian angel, thus cannot be protected from any accidental harm. As a result, no one wants to be near her or have her as a friend, because it might cause bad accidents around. However, Lily still studies hard in a normal school and wishes to enroll in the Angel Host Academy - the institute where all strong hosts of mighty guardian angels study and have battles to hone their skills and receive prizes (which includes money), as well as the title of 'Strongest Yearly Angel Host', in Yearly Championships. Lily's elder sister, Linda, whose guardian angel is the main archangel, Michael himself, is already a long time graduate and legendary champion of Angel Host Academy. Lily is always regarded low, so she wishes to prove her worth, no matter she has no angel. She always strives to find new ways to call upon her angel whom she believes she possesses and tries to find the light within... Only later shall she find out, that light is not the only place to look for angels...",
