  "title": "The Patriot Conspiracy",
  "description": "The Patriot Conspiracy is about an American president who seeks to abolish cash and establish a universal credit/debit card in order to gain unprecedented access to every citizen's private life. The story is told from the point of view of Maggie Trent, the wife of a young senator, as she struggles to understand both politics and her husband. Maggie records the odyssey of an enthusiastic couple, ready to set Washington on its ear, through triumphs and tragedy. Robert Trent must choose between conflicting loyalties—to his party, to his principles, and to his family. We follow Maggie's transformation from observer to participant, as this naïve wife of an ambitious politician comes to the painful realization that it is up to her to challenge the all-invasive government. The shocking ending is a wake-up call to those who disregard the issue of privacy rights.",
