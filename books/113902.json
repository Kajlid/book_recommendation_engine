  "description": "“I admit it. I was one of those people who cheered when the hurricane turned in her direction, who watched disaster movies and read post-apocalyptic books by the dozens, and who secretly hoped for The End Of The World As We Know It. Now that it’s here, I feel kind of stupid. I’m not even sure why I’m writing this down, as it’s doubtful anyone will ever read it. Then again, weirder things have obviously happened...” Ellie Campbell considers herself an ordinary woman. She’s a thirty-something wife and mother who’s a little out of shape and a lot frazzled. She’s always gone along with her husband’s latest hobby of prepping, but never given it much thought, until the day comes when everything stops working. With her husband unaccounted for and her kids across town, she must set out to rescue her children and bring them home. As days go by, she must discover her own strengths, and just might realize that she’s not so ordinary after all. See The End Of The World As We Know It through her eyes in this humorous, tongue-in-cheek tale of the apocalypse.",
