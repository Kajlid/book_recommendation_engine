  "title": "Up, Up and Away: The Biography of BE FAIR",
  "description": "With complete frankness, and a definite touch of humour, Lucinda Green MBE has re-published the biography of her remarkable horse, Be Fair.This timeless story begins back in 1968, when Lucinda acquired Be Fair for her fifteenth birthday. That day the problems began; but it was also the start of an extraordinary partnership. Enroute from Pony Club trials to the OlympicGames, Lucinda tells of the lessons they learned, the mistakes they made, their success and their failures; but above all, she tells of Be Fairâ€™s out- standing personality and of his trust and courage that took them to the top of the eventing world.",
