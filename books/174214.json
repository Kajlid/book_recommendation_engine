  "description": "Sometimes your salvation comes when you have given up. A box full of condoms and a broken carriage were all the circumstances that ‘Lily’ needed. Why shouldn’t she have him show her how they are used? There was no husband, no family and no friends. Widows had certain freedoms other woman didn’t and for once in her life she wanted to take a chance, do something outrageous. It would be a secret just for her. Something to think about as tea was served and time ticked by. Her veil was tightly in place over her face and those blue eyes of his where the color of promised pleasure. Besides, he was a mechanic… of sorts; they didn’t run in the same circles. She’d drop him off somewhere and they would never see each other again……The Veiled Heart is a wonderful Victorian Romance with a moody, sensual, gothic feel.",
