  "description": "Richard Morgan can’t believe his father is considering a rival candy company’s offer to buy out the family business that he loves. Though the confections division is tiny compared to the family’s other ventures, it’s close to his heart. Maybe too close, since the thought of losing it feels like losing his mother all over again. Convinced it’s the best way to continue the Morgan legacy, his father offers Richard control of the company if he’ll secure the family name with a marriage. After a messy, public divorce, marriage is the last thing Richard wants to consider, but according to his father, it’s the only way.Yvette Cruz is the beautiful, savvy mergers and acquisitions rep charged with brokering the buyout agreement between her company and Morgan Confectioners, and Richard Morgan is the only thing standing between her and the promotion she desperately wants. She came from nothing and worked her way to the top of her field, so she’s not about to let his refusal to cooperate stop her from getting what she wants.Corporate rivalry gives way to an unwise attraction when the two meet and spend a night together that ultimately changes their lives forever. Two enemies find love, but a betrayal threatens to tear them apart. Forgiveness and redemption can lead to everything they’ve ever wanted, but some things can’t be forgotten.Sensuality Level: Sensual",
