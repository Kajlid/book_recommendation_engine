  "description": "As I approached my eightieth year, those who care for me were telling me to slow down and restrict my activities to what they considered to be appropriate to my age. Everything being suggested pointed to a loss of freedom and a submittal to the control of others. In dread of being confined to a geriatric life style, I set about finding ways in which cope with the problems of physical deterioration and thereby allow me to continue to function independently. I soon found this to be a positive and invigorating project laced with both practicality and fun.",
