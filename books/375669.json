  "description": "Once childhood friends, Samantha and Landon are now separated by distance and secrets. Will Samantha’s return to Nantucket bring her the peace she longs for? Samantha Owens' estranged stepfather has died, leaving her his cottage in Nantucket—a place she fled years ago, never planning to return. As a single mom, Samantha can't afford to pass up a financial windfall like ocean-front property. So she travels home to fix up the house and sell it . . . never suspecting that Landon Reed still lives two doors down. As their long-dormant romance begins to bud again, Samantha must face a past that separated her from the God of her childhood. And she must tell Landon why she fled the island in the first place—a secret that could tear them apart. Is Landon’s love really as unconditional as he claims? And will Samantha finally realize that the God she found all those years ago never abandoned her? A heart-tugging tale of shattered trust, growing faith, and love that endures . . . all in a romantic seaside setting.",
