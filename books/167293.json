  "title": "Martin Luther: Selections from His Writings",
  "description": "The development of Martin Luther's thought was both a symptom and a moving force in the transformation of the Middle Ages into the modern world. Geographical discovery, an emerging scientific tradition, and a climate of social change had splintered the unity of medieval Christian culture, and these changes provided the background for Luther's theological challenge. His new apprehension of Scripture and fresh understanding of man's relation to God demanded a break with the Church as then constituted and released the powerful impulses that carried the Reformation. Luther's vigorous, colorful language still retains the excitement it had for thousands of his contemporaries. In this volume, Dr. Dillenberger has made a representative selection from Luther's extensive writings, and has also provided the reader with a lucid introduction to his thought.A large number of Luther's works are presented in whole or excerpted, including:• The Freedom of a Christian• A Commentary on St. Paul's Epistle to the Galatians• The Bondage of the Will• The Pagan Servitude of the Church [aka Babylonian Captivity]• Two Kinds of Righteousness• several Biblical Prefaces• several sermons• Secular Authority: To What Extent It Should Be Obeyed• An Appeal to the Ruling Class of German Nationality [aka Address to the German Nobility]• The Ninety-five Theses• Theses for the Heidelberg Disputation",
