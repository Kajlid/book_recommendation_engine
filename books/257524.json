  "description": "Star tried to end it all, but gods and demons will not be denied. Now she is being tortured by Lilith in the demon's realm and has to protect herself. Whatever it takes Satori will keep his promise to find the woman he loves, but Star refuses to accept that she needs to wait to be saved. And what about the demon child? Is he really the result of an unholy ménage à trois? Psychonaut is the second book in the Starblood Trilogy and the sequel to Starblood. With art by Anna Prashkovich, Psychonaut the graphic novel is a colourful treat of fantasy and horror. There are no heroes in this dark fairy tale. \"Carmilla Voiez is more of a singer than a writer. She tells her compelling story in a hypnotic, distinctive voice that brings her eerie world vividly to life.\" Graham Masterton\"Psychonaut is a book of mad impulses, inner vision, sadism, escape and belief. You feel uncomfortable reading it, like Alex strapped to the chair in Clockwork Orange being taught to feel sick at atrocity. Rather than leave us crippled by response, though, Psychonaut bears you through the hurt towards the only paradise we can be assured of...a love past fault.\" Jef Withonef, Houston Press.",
