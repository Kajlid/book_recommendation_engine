  "title": "Friends to the End: The True Value of Friendship",
  "description": "Friends and life. Life and friends. The two are so tightly interwoven it's impossible to imagine one being remotely worthwhile without the other. As Bradley Trevor Greive points out, \"There are very few truly solitary creatures on this planet. And most of them have serious personal hygiene issues.\" What makes friends so special? What does our choice of friends say about us? What sparks the best friendships and keeps them burning? In Friends to the The True Value of Friendship, BTG uses his trademark witty narrative illustrated with irresistible animal photos to explore the daily magic we experience through our friends. Best described as a cross between his famously successful Dear Mom and The Blue Day Book, Friends to the End examines themes such as why we can't live without friends, how great friendships grow from humble beginnings, how to identify different types of friendship, what to do when good friends turn bad, and why it's all so worthwhile. \"When I think back to all the really great or the horrendously bad times in my life,\" says BTG, \"I can't help but think about how my friends made the former all the more enjoyable and the latter at least survivable. I want this book to help people appreciate friendship for all it is and all it can be.\"Friends to the End promises to have the same cultural impact achieved by his previous books. His modern classics The Blue Day Book and Dear Mom have been New York Times best-sellers and made the author a household name in more than 35 countries. BTG's seven previous volumes have sold more than seven million copies worldwide.",
