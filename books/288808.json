  "description": "It's easier to be cruel than kind to humans-  My life has revolved around the shelter for as long as I can remember. It’s easier that way, animals don’t cause pain. Women are a fleeting thought, one doesn’t warm my bed for long before I move on to the next. Until Berkeley Robinson. My newest volunteer burst into the kennels and my life with her gorgeous laugh and baggage, rocking my world. I’ve tried to maintain my distance, but her aura is impossible to resist.  I'm tired of destroying everything I touch-  It’s like I’m cursed. I fail at everything. Motherhood, sobriety, life. Moving away after rehab is my chance to fix things, especially my relationship with my daughters. As a condition of my parole, I’m stuck spending my Saturdays volunteering at the local shelter. At least the animals are sweet, unlike the hot and cold veterinarian, Damon Allen. Something about him drives me wild. I’m inexplicably attracted to this mad man.  We were like magnets- Fighting against the irresistible force pulling us together. But our pasts are as explosive as our connection...and when you play with fire, you're bound to get burned.",
