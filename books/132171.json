And just as they started realizing they had potential to be more, Bobby was unexpectedly uprooted to Las Vegas. Fast forward fifteen years.Bobby is now a guitar hero of a very successful rock band. June is wasting away, working at a local diner, and married to an abusive man. Devastating events send Bobby back to Texas to deal with some unsettled issues. When he runs into June, she’s all grown up. No longer that blonde haired, pig-tailed little girl—now she’s the Queen of the South with tanned legs, sexy curves, and more beauty than all the groupies combined. Problem is, June is a shell of her former self—that is, until—Bobby brings the spark back into her life.What happens when a typical bad boy rocker comes across a sad country song? Why, you get the sweet sound of Rock Country.",
