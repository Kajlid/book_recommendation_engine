  "title": "New American Cooking: The Best of Contemporary Regional Cuisines",
  "description": "\"New American Cooking compiles a six-volume series chronicling contemporary regional fare from coast to coast: California, The Pacific Northwest, The Southwest, The Heartland, New England and The South. All recipes are driven by what's locally raised, be it fruit, fish, or fowl. Regional ethnic influences play a part, too. Traditional recipes are included as they exist today--adapted over generations and attuned to the modern kitchen. The volume is decidedly contemporary, with a clean, graphic treatment throughout and stunning four-color photography that focuses on authentic regional cooking.",
