  "description": "Trista StevensThings went quickly sour with the already married Harry when she found out their affair had a bigger repercussion. Heartbroken, she had to do what was best for everyone. Just as planned, she and Lindsey went to visit Emma in Greece. Trista thought this vacation was going to be a way for her to heal and come to terms with of the gargantuan mistakes she’s made in the past. Taylor Montgomery thought himself a rational man, but meeting the fiery Trista made him think twice. Yet, her mask slips once in awhile. She carried pain and secrets hidden from within. Her fire and vulnerability made him want to protect her all the more. But Trista wouldn’t have any of it. One thing Trista should know about the indispensable man though. He's not the kind who gives up easily. Come what may.",
