  "description": "'Benjy Bunn was in the kitchen,thought he'd make Mama a cake. Grabbed the flour, eggs and butter,spied a tin in which to bake!'Benjy Bunn's Busy Day is a bright and colourful rhyming story book about trying your best. Benjy Bunn, a young bunny rabbit, believes he is being good, trying to help his parents round the house, but it does get a bit messy! Whether he is baking a cake, tidying his room or doing the gardening, Benjy doesn't quite get it right. Bev Scott Prior first wrote her stories in the early 1970's to read to her children at their local nursery. The pages of the first copies of the stories, typed up by her husband 45 years ago, are worn and weathered, each page smudged and frayed by the hands of her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Now, Benjy has been brought to life in picture book form by her grandson James Burns, the main illustrator of the series. The Benjy Bunn Books series is filled with old-fashioned charm, wit and wonderful musicality. Benjy Bunn's Busy Day is the first book in this rhyming story series.",
