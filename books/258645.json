  "description": "'... this Almanack, which all ladies should carry about with them, as the Priest his Breviary, as the Cook his Recipes, as the Doctor his Physic, as the Bride her Fears, and as the Lion his Roar!'Djuna Barnes wrote her Ladies Almanack for fun, a 'slight satiric wigging', as she called it in her Foreword, to amuse her circle of expatriate friends with the tale of Evangeline Musset who took her whip in hand and 'set out upon the Road of Destiny'. It has since become a cult classic, a unique work that combines visual artistry with literary parody, bawdy humour and an unconstrained zest for the sensual pleasures of love and friendship between strong-minded women.",
