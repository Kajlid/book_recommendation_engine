  "description": "If you are expecting a read that is full of anger, and blame and depression, then you will be disappointed. This book is an outline of the life of one survivor of this virus, and the legacy that remains after survival. It is hoped that it will encourage others with this, or other afflictions to see that there is always a life to be led. It may be far from the life you may have wished for, or indeed the life you might choose, but it is still a life, and hopefully with a sense of humour that shines through. This story has not reached its conclusion as yet, as there may well be hurdles to jump in the future, but for now this is the living history. This account is written in the victim's own words, as he lived it and as he viewed his life. It is a personal account....'On the first day the nurse asked \"any pain?\" to which I replied politely \"no thank you\".I really was not intending to make her laugh, I was half conscious I think at the time, and was just answering the question as I had heard it ..'",
