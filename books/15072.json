At least that’s what she thinks until she meets exotic dancer Johnny. John is sexy, even if he is a suspect, but as far as Hannah can tell, he’s also taken.John is definitely taken with his lover, Ben, but he and Ben play sometimes, and they want Hannah. The three have fun, even when a murderer begins stalking their lives. John and Ben love Hannah to death, even if her police partner Ricky disapproves, but they hope it doesn’t become literal.",
