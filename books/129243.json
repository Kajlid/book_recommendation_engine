  "description": "Win every time you gamble? Is that possible? It is if you play for comps. Every year, U.S. casinos give away more than a billion dollars worth of amenities to customers in return for their gambling action. These giveaways, known as “comps” (short for complimentaries), range from parking and drinks to gourmet meals and airfare. Are you getting your share? From nickel slot players to $500 a hand blackjack high rollers, Comp City has shown tens of thousands of gamblers how to get free casino vacations.Since the first publication of Comp City, author Max Rubin has been teaching gamblers how to exploit the casino comp system for fun and profit. A former casino executive (and current comp hustler), Rubin has been featured on CBS’ “48 Hours,” the Travel Channel’s “The Pro’s Guide to Vegas,” and Discovery Channel’s “Casino Diaries.”",
