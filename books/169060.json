  "title": "Doctor Who: The Time Lord Letters",
  "description": "A unique collection of more than 100 never-before-seen letters, notes, and jottings both by and to the Doctor—correspondence by turns entertaining and inspiring, funny and flippant, brilliant and incredible drawn from all fifty-two years of the show. No one could travel through history—past present and future—as much as the Doctor does without leaving an impression. Much of what we know about this mysterious figure comes from what he does— the planets he saves and the monsters he defeats. But until now we’ve had little knowledge of his writings. These rich and diverse documents paint an extraordinarily detailed picture of the Doctor and include his plea to the Time Lords to help end the War Games, an extract from the written defense he submitted at his subsequent trial, his application for the post of Caretaker at Coal Hill School, his apology to the Queen for missing dinner, even telepathic messages to the High Council on Gallifrey and his famous letter to Santa Claus. Like the Doctor himself, the mood can change in an instant. The Time Lord Letters captures the best and most dramatic moments of an impossible life. You’ll never see the Doctor in quite the same way again.",
