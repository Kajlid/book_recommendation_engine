  "description": "The dramatic life story of the entertainer-activist who captured Broadway in her debut in New Faces of 1952. She is still drawing crowds to her concerts and cabaret appearances.

Ms. Kitt is forthright in talking about her relationships with the great and near-great personalities of the past half century.",
