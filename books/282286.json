  "title": "Slick Senator",
  "description": "When my college crush, Talbot Richardson--who didn't even know I existed--was elected to the United States Senate, I bragged a little too loudly that I knew him.Oops.Did I really know the sexiest, slickest guy on campus?Not a chance in hell.Unless knowing someone is following them around campus to see which dorm they live in, and which class they have at eight a.m. on Wednesdays.Oh, and I might have stalked him in the dining hall, too. Turned out he ate a lot of grilled cheese.And thanks to my big mouth, the paper I work for now expects me to do a story on him because he's not granting interviews. Not even to Anderson Cooper.But surely he'll meet me since we went to college together? Right?Logical assumption. Except that he doesn't know me from a hole in the wall.But I wasn't about to blow my chance with the paper. Writing obituaries for three years at one of the country's top newspapers was not my idea of a fulfilling career, especially since the money I'd borrowed for my Ivy League education could buy a small country. I wanted more--I wanted to report on real news. I wanted to prove myself, and even work in the face of danger. A girl's got to have dreams.All I needed was a break. No question, I was getting an interview with Talbot Richardson if it was the last thing I did. If I had to beg, borrow, steal, or... even take my panties off.",
