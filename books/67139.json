It includes a collie named Nipper who shepherded trapped animals out of a burning barn, an Oklahoma kangaroo named Irwin who wore a man's suit and slept in his own bed, an elephant who was an anti-smoking crusader, and the poet Virgil's beloved pet who was given the equivalent of a $75,000 funeral, complete with a full orchestra and love poems—and was a housefly. This wonderful assortment of amazing animal-related antics reveals the wonderful courage, character, and cleverness of our animal friends.",
