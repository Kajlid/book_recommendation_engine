Walls will be broken and secrets revealed, regardless of consequence.*****BLAINEMy throat growls out in distress, desperate for more alcohol to fuel this panic ridden hatred of myself. That’s all this is. I know that. It’s rage and indecision. A barrage of self-loathing and repugnance, one confused and trapped in its own irrational behaviour. The psychologist in me would tell me to quieten down. The magician would play for the fun of it, but the monster in me? He’s ready to rut hell into anything that will take me, just so it can imagine her face and abandon the last drops of my resistance. I’m confused.Losing control.Being torn into three. And no matter how I try to avoid it, the layers keep peeling apart with no sense of clarification or psychological evaluation. They just split for her.",
