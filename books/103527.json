  "description": "\"What are you doing here?\" he asked coldly. \"You brought me here,\" I answered. The man pursed his lips, then slapped me across the face. \"I suggest you keep your glib answers to yourself,\" he sneered. \"You asked,\" I replied, and he slapped me again. This conversation was quickly losing its appeal. Maria Gonzalez is having a bad day. On the way home from school one afternoon, the world as she knows it comes to a sudden and unexpected end. Soon, she is on the run from something, or someone that she hasn't even seen, with rumors of zombies, vampires and even chupacabra running loose around Rochester, New York. Is this an alien invasion, or something much more sinister? Separated from her mother and little sister, Maria is forced to rely on herself, and the few remaining human beings in order to survive. Was this attack centered only in Rochester, or was the whole world affected? Can Maria and the human race hope to fight back, or even survive? Or is all hope gone forever? Join us for the first book in the Blood of Darkness trilogy.",
