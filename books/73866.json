Because Gwen is the keeper of the scarab, and is everything Syrus has ever wanted… and hes not the only one.An Ancient evil is waking, and its servants will stop at nothing to see it seize its rightful place as the new pantheon of earth. And in order for Syrus and his team to save the world, Gwen is going to have to accept him, and show that love does make all the difference.",
