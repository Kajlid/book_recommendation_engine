  "title": "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening",
  "description": "\"The woods are lovely, dark and deep, But I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep, And miles to go before I sleep.\"\nWritten by \nRobert Frost\n in 1922, and first published in 1923, the poem that begins \"Whose woods these are I think I know\" surely holds a special place in American hearts. Frost was a poet who could and did speak to everyone, but rarely more memorably than in this evocation of the quiet delights of winter.For this special edition with a new design, trim size, and three new spreads, \nSusan Jeffers\n has added more detail and subtle color to her sweeping backgrounds of frosty New England scenes. There are more animals to find among the trees, and the kindly figure with his \"promises to keep\" exudes warmth as he stops to appreciate the quiet delights of winter. The handsome new vellum jacket will attract new and old fans as it evokes a frost-covered windowpane. It is truly one to share with the whole family.Illustrated in Full color",
