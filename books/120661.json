  "description": "Luke Madsen loves women, he loves his bike, he loves his country, he loves his MC. Kayla's too good for him, she's better than that lifestyle. She's sworn off bad boys and bikers forever and she won't go down that road again. But when ex-Army Ranger and VP of the outlaw Suicide Kings MC ends up in her Emergency Room all bets are off. His muscular physique, tolerance for pain, and bad ass attitude instantly break down every wall she ever put up. The tattoos inked on his back, arms, and chest tell the story of a truly ruthless and unforgiving lifeâ€”especially the 130 red and black hash marks lining his biceps, each a shred of his blackened soul. How could she fall for a criminal, an outlaw, a biker who's caught up in drugs, gangs, gun running, and murder? Their chance meeting is only the beginning and falling for him is the worst mistake she'll ever make. This contemporary Biker romance contains graphic sexual content and violence. It is intended for mature readers.",
