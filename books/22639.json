The girls pick their targets carefully and blow enchanted dust into the boyâ€™s faces, charming them. The girls give the boys commands, tasks to perform.

The witch with the most power wins a year's worth of saved up allowance from her sisters.This year Kristen chooses the wrong boy to mess with after Brittany dares her to Crush him. Ordinarily Kristen wouldn't dream of doing something so risky, but she's in a bad mood and isn't thinking clearly. Right away she senses something is wrong. Instead of staring at her with puppy dog eyes, Zach Bevian (also known as tall, dark, and scary) glares at her, a look that could kill. Then he hesitates when she gives him an order. Something is definitely wrong.After being Crushed, Zach goes home to the family mansion and lets his anger ripple off him in deadly waves. The house shakes. Zach is also a powerful witch, but he has another dark secret. It involves his impulsive and mentally challenged sister.Kristen almost dies that same day. Someone is trying to kill her, but she has more suspects than evidence. If the spell didn't take, it's possible Zach is trying to put her out of his misery.
