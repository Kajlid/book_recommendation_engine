Still, she could never escape the strange dream that haunted her night after night: a single, disturbing image of a man with steel fingers, reaching for a hypodermic syringe. When she awoke she felt violated, used - and terrified. Alex Hunter desperately wanted to help this beautiful, fascinating woman. He knew he had seen Joanna before - in news photographs of a senator's daughter who'd disappeared ten years ago. Slowly, tenderly, he helped awaken her to a terrifying fact: that she was not who she thought he was... that her mind, her memories, had been created for her...And there was only one was to unlock the dark secret of her soul...
