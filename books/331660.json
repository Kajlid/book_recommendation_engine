But what begins as a simple investigation takes a startling swerve when the social worker who sends the records fails to redact a crucial bit of information. Suddenly, Kathe has more information than she bargained for. And to her surprise, she finds herself combing through vital records, researching every lead she can get her hands on.When an Internet search results in a dead-end, Kathe’s daughters present her with a birth mother search as a gift for Mother’s Day. What Kathe discovers transforms her. With each piece of information she uncovers, the mystery of her birth parents’ identities unravels a little more. But when her investigation uncovers a half-sister that Kathe never imagined existed, she must decide: open her heart and mind to a stranger who shares her DNA, or walk away without challenging her long-held beliefs about what it means to be part of a family.",
