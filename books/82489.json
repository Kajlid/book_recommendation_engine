She and Cannon are together. And there's no longer a curse hanging over their heads. But her new life as a freshman at Wexford University is quickly disrupted by disturbing dreams of Tory Island and the mysterious realm beyond its ancient ruins. Arella discovers that her reality is not normal. And neither is she. She has a secret lineage, and the dreams are glimpses into the legendary Fae realm of Tir inna n-Ã“c. Arella must return to Tory Island to face her enemies, finish what was started, and destroy the Cursing Stone. But nothing comes without a price. And she must decide if ending the curse is worth the cost.",
