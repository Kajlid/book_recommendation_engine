He dreams of becoming a congressman and changing the world, and Jill is ready to stand at his side for the journey. When she discovers she is pregnant with Cade's baby, Jill accepts that she must put college on hold for the sake of their new family. But it won't be the only sacrifice she'll have to make.Relocating to the Olmsteads' New England farm, Jill is excited to welcome the baby surrounded by Cade’s family. But life on the farm isn’t the idyllic retreat she’d imagined. Cade's brother Elias, a soldier newly returned from Afghanistan, is struggling to recover from the experience of war, and Jill is unsettled to find the family home is no less a battlefield than the one Elias left behind.When unexpected tragedy strikes, Cade is afflicted most of all—his idealism quickly transforms into bitterness and paranoia. Before she knows it, Jill’s once-ambitious husband becomes a desperate man willing to endanger them all in the name of vengeance…unless Jill can find a way out.If you love emotionally charged, issue-driven novels, don’t miss Inside These Walls and The Kingdom of Childhood , available now.",
