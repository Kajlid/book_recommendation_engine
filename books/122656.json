Celeste and Corinne Carson are more than sisters-they're bestselling writers, each with a fantasy-fulfilling alpha-male hero. For Celeste, it's Jarred, a conqueror from the future. For Corinne, it's the barbarian Mykhayl from a world long ago. Devilishly sensual warriors, Jarred and Mykhayl have something in common themselves-they're both more real than their creators could have imagined. Fearing that the sisters are about to write them off, Jarred and Mykhayl decide to exact sweet revenge. The plan? Kidnap Celeste and Corinne, spirit them away to the very worlds of which they wrote, and persuade them to surrender to the sublime punishments of their own uninhibited imaginations.",
