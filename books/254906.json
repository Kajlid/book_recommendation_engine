  "description": "Callie has spent her life moving towns every four months in a bid to “stay off the grid.\" Her only family is a paranoid mother who believes there’s a race of supernatural beings out there actively searching for Callie. A race who could destroy Earth if they get their hands on her. Callie’s never seen one thing to suggest there’s any truth to mom’s insane ramblings, and at the age of eighteen now, she’s grown numb to her reality – she’s never going to have a normal life.That is, until they move to New Orleans. The moment Callie steps foot into the Quarter, hears the jazz music, feels the soul of the city, the cold shell she’s built to protect herself starts to thaw. Then they come for her. Turns out her mom’s stories are quite real, and whatever happens, Callie’s empty world will never be the same again.",
