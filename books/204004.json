  "description": "Greg Valdez operates just the other side of the line, as a thief for private collectors. He's known as the best in the business. You name it, he's stolen it-from jewels to fine art. Now his mission takes him to an ancient monastery in Portugal, to steal a priceless artifact-the true Shroud of Turin-from beneath the altar. Centuries-old oaths and traditions come into play as modern day Templar Knights launch an international search for the thief and the Shroud. Glenn Starkey has written a book that will put you on the edge of your seat and keep you there. A real thriller in the tradition of the genre, Solomon's Men will take you on a roller coaster ride you'll wish would never end. You'll be asking yourself when Glenn Starkey's next book will hit the stands.",
