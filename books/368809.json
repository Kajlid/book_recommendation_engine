At only the age of 14, Trenton fell in love with Clive, who tells him they can't be together until he is of proper age. In the meantime, Trenton spy on Clive when he takes his \"special clients\" into his station. Eventually, Clive tells him to accept an exchange program to Paris for 9 months, hoping for Trenton to find someone else before they can be together. Things don't work out very well in Paris, although his host's family's son does show an interest.Note: alternative website source http://www.fhsarchive.com/autoarchive...",
