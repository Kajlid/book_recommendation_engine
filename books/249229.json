As weeks of sleepless nights catch up with him, he faces the fact that he needs his unit brothers no more than ever.  Living in Storm Keep with mixed blood, Serenity fought for everything she has. When she disobeys the dictates of her Elders to help the sick in Noctem Falls she is unprepared for the kindness and support she receives from it’s citizens, including her own witchborne mate.  As both of them are forced to reveal their own long kept secrets to save a city, will they be able to overcome their own deep-seated fears to make their mating last.",
