  "description": "The Greek God of the Underworld has turned my life completely upside-down and made me question everything I thought I knew about my life.And now I don’t even know who I am anymore. An internal war rages inside me, as I try to balance my need for more magic with the knowledge of what power does to people in Olympus. What it may have done to me in the past. The one thing I do know though, is that my feelings for Hades are real. The Lord of the Dead is so much more than I ever realized, and something inside me knows that I need him as much as he needs me. But between the Hades Trials, the other Olympians, and whoever it is that’s trying to kill me, I may not survive long enough to find a way for us to be together.Hades says a light so bright can’t live in the dark. But I’m not sure a life without him is worth living.",
