Back then, Cassie was a scared kid—now she’s a homicide cop. Back then, the suspect was caught and convicted—he died in prison. But now the killing has started again. And all signs indicate that the Bayside Strangler has come back for more. With too many victims and too few suspects, Cassie has her hands full investigating the case, while working through the old trauma it has brought to the surface. Luckily, FBI agent Rick Cisco is dispatched to lend support. Together, Cassie and Rick must uncover the link between the dark past and the dangerous present to bring this small town’s long nightmare to an end. If they fail, an elusive fiend will slip back into the shadows ... to watch and wait—and kill another day. In matters of crime, there are many versions of the truth.",
