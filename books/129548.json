  "description": "I was homeless...Now I have mates. Not one, not two, but more than one woman can handle. For years I was alone, afraid, and being hunted. I ran from my family to protect them. I ran from the devastation I caused because I was a coward. Lastly, I ran from my inevitable future because I was weak. But there is nowhere else to run. Not if I want to protect the people I've grown to love and care for. To do that, I have to be stronger and face my demons. I will save everyone even though I know it'll cost me my life.",
