  "description": "Seeing the future with ease, the Joon live a contented life. Until the greatest of their visionaries foresees a terrible danger that can only be avoided by destroying a world inhabited by ten billion people who have done them no harm. Sojourning through the deeps of space, the Joon capture a monstrous comet and send it to a neighbouring star and the planet called earth. Their objective is not to destroy the earth but to manipulate the future of mankind in three separate timelines and force them to converge. For only then will the long prophesied Forge of Time be born, a prescient human who will build an empire to rule a thousand stars and bend destiny itself to save three species from an implacable enemy.",
