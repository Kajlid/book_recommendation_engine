  "description": "This book stands as the \"source and origin\" of all Father Faber's other writings. It contains a fundamental insight that leads to a proper understanding of Catholic spirituality. Fr. Faber says that men in the modern era accept God's existence but deny His sovereignty in practice. Though written in the mid-19th century, this book is absolutely on target today because humanity's tendency to arrogate itself to the prerogatives of God, although strong in Fr. Faber's time, is epidemic today. A real eye-opener!",
