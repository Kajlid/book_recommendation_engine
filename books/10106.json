  "description": "by Josh SimmonsIn the thick of a dense wood, a young man comes upon a decrepit house and two teen-aged girls. Deciding to explore the abandoned house together, Simmons captures the aloof ennui and deep curiosity of being a teenager. The trio quickly become entangled in a love triangle that is as tense and ominous as the house itself. This adventurous, silent graphic novel demonstrates the solid strength of this young cartoonist and his storytelling ability. House is Josh Simmons' first full-length graphic novel after years of honing his craft on the humorous, underground mini-comic series Happy , and it is a visual and formal tour de force that proclaims Simmons a major cartooning talent of the new century!",
