  "description": "Anne Shirley is unforgettable, and this beautifully packaged edition of L.M. Montgomery&#8217;s classic novel is as memorable as its heroine.When Anne Shirley arrives at Green Gables, she surprises everyone: first of all, she&#8217;s a girl, even though Marilla Cuthbert and her brother Matthew specifically asked for an orphan boy to help around the farm. And second of all, she&#8217;s not just any girl: she has bright red hair, a wild imagination, and can talk a mile a minute.But she also has a sweet disposition and quick wit, and Anne (with an &#8220;e&#8221; of course&#8212;it&#8217;s so much more distinguished!) soon finds her place in Avonlea, making a friend in her neighbor Diana Barry and attending the local school, where she spurns the advances of the popular and handsome Gilbert Blythe when he commits the ultimate sin of making fun of her hair.Anne has a temper as fiery as her hair and a knack for finding trouble, and she also has a big heart and a positive attitude that affects everyone she meets. This classic and beloved story makes a wonderful gift and keepsake.",
