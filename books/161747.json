Formerly known as one of the most notorious hackers in cyberspace, he now works to keep Hawk Global Industries one step ahead of its competitors. But there's a catch.

When an old flame crosses his path unexpectedly, Glitch and company learn that betrayal is on the horizon for them. It's time to put a plan in motion and reclaim their freedom, once and for all. Things are going to get pretty nasty along the way, even a little sexy, but it's all in a day's work for a Corporate Hitman.*Part 1 of a 3 part series*",
