His company, the Crimson Hawks, is made up of the leftovers and unwanted of mercenary society. Fortunately, James has a gift for making people trust him.Unfortunately, mercenary companies need contracts and money. So, when James receives a lucrative offer to help a king put down a rebellion, he can’t refuse it. Even if he knows that there’s something terribly wrong with it. Things get even worse when he stares into the gorgeous eyes of the leader of the uprising. Sometimes, mercenaries aren’t on the right side, but they still have to honor their contracts.",
