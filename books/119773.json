  "description": "One year ago, I graduated from law school and embarked on a career as a purveyor of high priced legal shenanigans. Six months ago, my boyfriend dumped me when I thought he might be proposing. Two weeks ago, I got drunk and joined a secret sex club. Two days ago, I had a torrid one-night stand with a stranger. Today? Well, today I’m contemplating having an affair with my boss. Matt Connover is all kinds of forbidden temptation wrapped up in a deliciously wicked package, and he’s made it clear… he’s only interested in sex. My name is McKayla Dawson but everyone calls me Mac. I work at the powerhouse firm of Connover & Crown, LLP, where the law has never felt so hot. But between you and me, I’m afraid my heart won’t survive these Legal Affairs.",
