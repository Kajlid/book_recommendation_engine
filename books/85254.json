  "description": "Wimberry Picking follows the story of a young man who tries to readjust to life in South Wales after the mother of his child ends their relationship in London.Living without his childhood sweetheart and wide-eyed daughter, Tim McCarthy is forced to look for the security and support of his immediate family. Only too pleased to fill this void and revel in the associated drama are his practical but unconventional mother and a host of other vibrant personalities in and around the small Welsh town of Abergavenny. While village life seems simpler than city survival, it brings its own fair share of crises, comedy, romantic trysts, heartbreak and poignant realisation.Wimberry Picking is a tale of the strengths and weaknesses of the human spirit, the complexity of family ties and the power of unconditional love. It explores the constraints and gritty reality of rural life in Wales, while highlighting the sense of belonging, freedom and natural beauty of the area.",
