  "description": "I’ve always been the guy who plays the field. I like variety and my career ensures that I can have my pick of women.  Until her…  I’ve always been the girl who wants more. I want the white picket fence, the two point five kids and the dog. That’s what all little girls grow up dreaming about.  Until him…  Why is it that she’s all I can see? I no longer want the variety instead all I want is her. I won’t stop until she believes that she’s mine.  I assure you…  He’s not the kind of guy I usually date. He’s cocky, and famous and that hair. He says I’m what he wants, but I know his type. He likes to play the field. Only with me he’s different.  He’s assured.",
