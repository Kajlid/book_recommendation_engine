  "title": "Individualism",
  "description": "Today, our culture is inundated with collectivism, the idea that man belongs to the group and must obey the group’s moral pronouncements. We are told we belong to the family, the community, the church, the race, the ethnic group, etc. We are told that only the collective is important and that sacrifice to the group is the only moral act. This book seeks a different perspective. It holds that the individual is supremely important and an end in him or herself, not to be used by collectivist leaders for the sake of \"common\" goals. This book is “succinctly written and conveys complex concepts to the lay reader with unique clarity and excellent real-world examples.” It expresses a “well-drawn depiction of people who choose (and, perhaps, need) to go along with the herd, rather than defining themselves as truly individual selves with individual goals, values, and life philosophies. Finally, it is a refreshing, enjoyable read. Many professionals might refer the work to their patients.” Individualism holds that the essence of human life is the singular being and that the individual is a self-creating entity whose goal is to obtain as much experience, love, pleasure and accomplishment as possible. Man, says Individualism, is a being of self-created soul, a being whose thoughts, feelings and morals proceed from his independent, thinking mind.",
