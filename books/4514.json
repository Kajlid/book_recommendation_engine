  "title": "The Lost Dialogues of Table 18",
  "description": "When I sat down at a table to talk to this pirate, I was not prepared for the ride he would take me on. The meaning of life, the marketability of boogers, the angst moths feel at porch lights, and the nightmares of lint and sand; all explored. This is where humor slams against reason and logic for some belly-bouncing laughs!",
