  "description": "It had been so many generations since the mage-lights were last seen that they'd become the stuff of legend. But for seventeen-year-old Jenna Aoire legend became reality one night on Knobtop Hill when she found the stone--not much more than a large pebble yet there was something about it that drew her. And then the mage-lights filled the sky, bringing trouble and magic with them that would irrevocably alter Jenna's life.",
