  "description": "When you're young, handsome, and professionally successful, the world is your oyster-especially if you live in Miami-the Magic City. In Miami it seems like everyone is beautiful, half-naked, and ready for a good time.Meet Ariel, Reggie, Jack, and Junior, four guys who work together at a company that makes drones...and who meet in the conference room each month to tell stories of their romantic and sexual conquests before a panel of judges. Based on the outrageousness of each story, the guys are awarded xs or Xs, the score is tallied, and, at the end of each year, the winner gets a prize.With their own personalities, styles, and motivations, each man approaches interactions with the ladies differently. And it's through these four different lenses readers come to see when it comes to sex and dating in Miami, all that glitters isn't necessarily gold.Equal parts erotic, honest, and thought-provoking, \"Sex, Love, and Xs\" is a seductive work of fiction with the power to raise important questions about the way hungry, young, beautiful men and women relate to each other-and how the games we play can take a toll on ourselves and others.",
