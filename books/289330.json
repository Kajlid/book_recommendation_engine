  "description": "This year was supposed to be the best of her life, but after finding her boyfriend cheating in front of half of the school, the last thing Jessica Bryant wants is to face her classmates. Noah Russell still feels ashamed of what he did last year. He isn’t one of the bad guys. So, when he hears people bad-mouthing Jessica, he reacts without thinking. It was supposed to be just a kiss, to give people something else to talk about, but now that they’re the ones controlling the rumors, why not continue? A few weeks, just until homecoming, and then they’ll break up. Jessica won’t be the girl her boyfriend cheated on and Noah will get his redemption. Should be easy, right? Maybe if her stand-in boyfriend wasn’t also her mortal enemy…The Stand-In Boyfriend is an interconnected standalone, sweet YA novella in Greyford High universe.",
