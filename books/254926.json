  "description": "An accidental pregnancy, a hunky hockey star, and a surprise twist you will never see coming, this swoon-worthy and heart-felt romance from bestselling author Meghan Quinn will keep you on the edge of your feet as you fall head over ice skates in love with your next book boyfriend, Hayden Holmes.  \"What are you doing now that your team is out of the running for the Stanley Cup?\"  Forget.  I need to forget. I need an escape.  Only one person isn't falling for my reputation as the NHL's Golden Boy; she captured my attention the minute she called me out for snooping through my best friend's house. She didn't want to hear my reason--she only wanted to playfully give me a hard time.  Adalyn is bold, sassy--and the perfect escape.  She's everywhere. In town and in my dreams, and suddenly I need to spend every waking moment with her.  And I do, making this summer the best off-season I've ever had.  But in the midst of getting lost in Adalyn, what I don't expect is to get her pregnant.  And what I definitely don't expect is having to fight for her affection.",
