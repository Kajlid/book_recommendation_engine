  "description": "Who knew it’d be hard to start new when you’re on the hook for murder?Someone’s out to get me in Midpark. They want to make me look bad, guilty of a crime I didn’t commit. The only question right now is who could play the game better than all of us? The truth is set to come out. Things are going to get worse before they get better, and soon more blood will be shed in Midpark. The puppet master wants to make me look bad, but anything he does only brings me closer to my guys—to Dante and Vaughn. Even Jacob. Archer? I might forgive him for what he did. Maybe. Someone in Midpark is wearing a mask. By the time I find out who it is, it might just be too late. **Reckless is the third and final book in the Midpark High trilogy. There are steamy scenes, along with multiple love interests. This trilogy gets darker as the series goes on.**",
