Dana Di Grazio is fearless and feisty, but struggling to find her purpose in life. Hiding behind a hardened exterior, she’s erected walls to protect herself from the devastating losses of her past. When thrust into the role of caretaker for pro motocross rider, Peter Fontenot, her fortitude is threatened and she fears he might be the one man to finally break down her walls.  When an unexpected accident forces X Games champion, Peter Fontenot to rely on a foul-mouthed, Italian spitfire, he’s surprised to find himself drawn to someone so crass and ill-suited. Suddenly, Peter must rethink the expectations of his well-planned life. Dana is the one thing he doesn’t want, but she may be the only thing he can’t live without.  Can the spark between two opposites create a lasting fire? Or will it detonate an explosion that leaves them both alone...forever.",
