  "description": "Reprinting Cerebus Issues 81-111Church and State, Volume II , is the second part of a story that exists as a whole and as part three of the Cerebus the Aardvark series. Many consider this volume to be Dave Sim and background artist Gerhard's best visual work to date. The action picks up right after the cliffhanger at the end of part one of Church and State . Cerebus attempts to regain his lost throne amidst warnings of a larger crisis. Mountain climbing, the introductions of Prince Mick and Prince Keef (exactly who you might think they are), the Super Secret Sacred Wars, and an Ascension to Vanaheim mark this second half of the Church and State opus. The major plot lines, which started 10 years earlier in Cerebus and High Society , are resolved (to some degree). The ending sets the stage for the more restful and introspective volumes-- Jaka's Story and Melmoth --that follow.",
