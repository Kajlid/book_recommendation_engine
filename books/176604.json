  "description": "For those followers of \"Conversations on the Rifle Range\":This has been published as a book with a different title: \"Teaching Math in the 21st Century\"The reasons for the change in title are many and varied but here are two: 1) It's more accurate to the theme of the book and 2) It may result in people buying the book who think 21st century learning is a legitimate and respectable thing, as well as those who know it for what it is.\"I am not an outright proponent of the philosophy that ‘If you want something done right, you have to live in the past’, but when it comes to how to teach math there are worse philosophies to embrace,” Barry Garelick explains as he continues from where he left off in his last book (“Letters from John Dewey/Letters from Huck Finn”). He describes his experiences as a long-term substitute teacher at a high school and middle school. He teaches math as he best knows how while schools throughout California make the transition to the Common Core standards. It is the 50th anniversary of key historical events including the JFK assassination and the Beatles’ arrival in the U.S. It is also the 50th anniversary of his first algebra course, the technical and personal memories of which he uses to guide him through the 21st century educational belief system that surrounds him.Includes a forward by Ze'ev Wurman.Available at Amazon: http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Math-C... .",
