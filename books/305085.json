They want to see a princess brought low, and they’ll do whatever it takes to make me fall.Money was the language of my old world, but violence is the language of my new one. The only way I’ll survive until graduation is to make a deal with three gorgeous, dangerous devils—the ones everyone calls the Lost Boys.If I accept their bargain, Bishop, Misael, and Kace will protect me.But they’ll own me too.  This is the first book in the Crazy Vicious Love series, a reverse harem bully romance. It contains mature themes and is intended for readers 18+.",
