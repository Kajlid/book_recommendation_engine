  "description": "Set during the French Revolution, The Vampire's Angel traces the lives of three characters: Xavier, a Parisian priest, Catherine, his noble sister, and Thomas, a vampire from America. The priest and vampire fall in love but hardship ensues as they struggle with separate demons. Thomas resists his impatience and temper, while hiding his undead nature from the man he loves. Xavier combats a devotion to the church and societal obligation, both of which speak against following his heart. As France crumbles around them, Catherine fights to maintain the family's fortune, even as she falls prey to the schemes of a witchdoctor who casts a spell upon her. Will the death, danger, and catastrophes of a revolution doom these three, or will they find solace from one another and ultimate harmony? Find out in The Vampire's Angel.",
