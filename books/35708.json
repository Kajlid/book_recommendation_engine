  "title": "Our Inner Conflicts: A Constructive Theory of Neurosis",
  "description": "Unlike Freud, Horney does not regard neurosis as rooted in instinct. In her words, her theory is constructive because \"it allows us for the first time to tackle and resolve neurotic hopelessness. . . . Neurotic conflicts cannot be resolved by rational decision. . . . But [they] can be resolved by changing the conditions within the personality that brought them into being.\"",
