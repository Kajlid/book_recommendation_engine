  "title": "Playground: A Childhood Lost Inside The Playboy Mansion",
  "description": "In the vein of Running with Scissors, this is the glitzy, glamorous and surreal story of a young girl who never learned where the party stopped and the real world began. The daughter of Hugh Hefner's personal physician and closest friend, a man who was immortalized in Motley Crue song Dr. Feelgood, spent most of her youth in the Playboy Mansion (and still visits every weekend). In this wholly original coming-of-age memoir, Jennifer Saginor recounts her time living a double life - as a child who had to teach herself how to survive, and as a fixture at the Playboy Mansion, where life was always a party, and where anything she wanted was at the touch of her fingertips. This is a great summer read for anyone who wants to take a look inside the walls of the Playboy Mansion, as well as a heart wrenching look into the psychological effects of a glamorous, yet broken, upbringing.",
