  "description": "Alt cover for ASIN B00CS7O54UStay tuned and stay patient, GNASH was originally self-published but will be re-released by Permuted Press summer 2015! As such, I had to pull it from the market until then.An ancient fundamentalist organization chooses to lash out against its enemies by conducting several simultaneous attacks across the globe. One of these assaults unleashes a deadly virus within the Pentagon, which sets off a chain reaction of events that the United States may not overcome.When the virus mutates beyond anything the terrorists expect, the nation's capital is plunged into a violent zombie outbreak that threatens to infect everyone in the region. A desperate, misguided attempt to stop the potential global epidemic backfires as the undead survive the brutal pre-emptive strike and continue to wreak havoc on the human population when they reemerge from the bowels of the ruined city.Grayson Donnelly, a former Army officer who is stranded in the Midwest during the outbreak, is forced to fight for his life and for the survival of his adopted community while his fianc√©e Emory is trapped in the Washington, D.C. quarantine zone. She struggles to come to terms with her own survival while living in a government-operated refugee camp just outside of the city.Both Grayson and Emory must learn to adapt and do whatever is necessary in order to survive in a nation that is nearing anarchy as the terrorists' heinous scheme takes on a life of its own.",
