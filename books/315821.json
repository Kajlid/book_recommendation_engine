  "description": "Bound by depravity, sealed with blood, and severed only in death, Luke Greene’s bloodline continues to thrive in the Greene household. We live by our own set of rules without regret, knowing no earthly penance could ever atone for our transgressions. Our acts so vile that evil itself awaits each generation, etching its claim upon our souls at conception. Know this: There is no hope found within these pages. No white horses or hand kisses. No light at the end of the tunnel, waiting with your feel-good, fade-to-black happily-ever-after. Our story will make most readers uncomfortable, but for the worthy few… This. Is. Home.This is Dilectio…",
