  "description": "Harry Fonstein is an immigrant, rescued from Nazi-occupied Europe by an underground operation masterminded by the legendary Broadway producer Billy Rose. When he arrives in America, Harry wants nothing so much as to thank Billy Rose, to shake his hand, to take a few minutes of his time. But Rose refuses to see him and Harry is somehow denied final passage to his adopted homeland. That is, until his wife, Sorella - a shrewd woman, a tiger wife - undertakes the mission. When she confronts Billy Rose, she has with her the means of undermining the famous producer's reputation.",
