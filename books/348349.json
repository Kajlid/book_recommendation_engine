  "title": "The Double (Doppelangelg√§nger): An Annotated Novel",
  "description": "In Greg Boyd's novel The Double, neither the protagonist nor his double can tell which one is the imposter and the fictions the protagonist reads seem more real than his own life. The novel proceeds through its mystery, while the protagonist, and the book itself, is taken over by interlocking fictions and fairy tales and photo collages and block prints that enter in footnotes and take about half of the book in the form of 14 appendices.",
