  "description": "Brought in chains as a slave girl to the court of ancient Egypt, Nofret knew intimately the key players in an extraordinary era: The Pharaoh Akhenaten, who defied the ancient Egyptian deities to worship the One True God, and his beautiful queen Nefertiti. Tutankhamon, the young boy-king murdered in a ruthless struggle for power. Johanan, the handsome young Hebrew laborer who captured her heart, and made her a traveler on a miraculous journey. And the legendary prophet and lawgiver who came out of the desert to defy Egypt's power and lead his people out of captivity.Acclaimed as one of the finest authors of historical novels today, Judith Tarr has crafted a daring and provocative new interpretation of a crucial turning point in human history.",
