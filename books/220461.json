  "title": "The Big Black Mark",
  "description": "The fabulous career of John Grimes from ensign in the Galactic Federation to admiral of the Rim Worlds has been chronicled over the years in dozens of gripping novels and short stories. But the pivotal account of Grimes' career - the big black mark on his service record that forced him to change his loyalties had never been recorded. DAW Books is proud to welcome A. Bertram Chandler to its lists and doubly proud to present that major novel of Grimes, the only character in all space fiction with the scope and depth that Captain Hornblower achieved in the field of sea fiction.This then, in a full-length novel, is the key story of Commander Grimes and of the voyage of the Discovery - a spaceship which bore an uncanny kinship to a certain legendary vessel called the Bounty.",
