  "description": "Are you ready for the next instalment in the award-winning, bestselling John Cardinal mystery series?A year after the death of his beloved but troubled wife Catherine, John has moved into a new, but very humid, condo. He has fallen into an easy routine of work on cold case files and platonic movie nights with friend and colleague Lise Delorme. But the quiet of a snow-covered Algonquin Bay is shattered when the decapitated bodies of two people are found in a summer home on nearby Trout Lake. The victims are Russian; they were in Algonquin Bay, Canada to attend the annual fur auction. By no means is this a routine murder investigation as Cardinal soon discovers; the murders are a horrific piece of a very twisted puzzle.Giles Blunt has, once again, given us a page-turning plot, a remarkable cast of characters, and the comfort of John Cardinal at the helm.Librarian's note: there are six novels in the author's John Cardinal series.
