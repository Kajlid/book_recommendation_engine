  "description": "Anthony Sher’s enthralling account of the struggle—and the triumph – of bringing Primo Levi’s Auschwitz memoir to the stage. Sher tells how he first came across Levi’s book, of how he conceived the notion of adapting it, of the long-drawn-out negotiations, research trips to Auschwitz and of the struggle to stage his adaptation and remain true to Levi’s precepts. A critical success in both London’s West End and on Broadway.",
