  "description": "The bars of West Hollywood, California, have always played host to a fair share of life-sucking monsters, but until now that's been mostly metaphoric. After three prime cuts of gay male beef turn up filleted and drained of blood, Sheriff Clive Anderson, Coroner Becky O'Brien and City Manager Pamela Burman are forced to the realization that something possibly not human has taken up residence in Boys' Town- something with more than the usual taste for male flesh. Fortunately, Becky's college pal Chris Driscoll is something of an expert on serial killers, but when she calls him in for a consult, she is startled to find that he hasn't aged a day in 10 years. When she accidentally stumbles over him napping in his coffin, he lets her in on his little \"Yep, I'm a vampire!\"He also informs her that the serial killer is a rogue vampire and that she andSheriff Anderson are going to need to think about some unorthodox crime-fighting techniques. Exciting and very, very funny, Bite Club is a rollicking black comedy in which the crime-fighting community and the undead community create an uneasy alliance to stop a monster!",
