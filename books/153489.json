  "description": "In the latest Sugarland Blue novel, Detective Tonio Salvatore always puts his job first—until a beautiful piece of trouble has him questioning the rules he’s sworn to live by… Tonio knows that loneliness is the price he has to pay to avoid being hurt again. But the strictly by-the-book cop never expected to be blindsided by a woman who pulls him right out of his self-imposed isolation. Angel Silva isn’t just from the wrong side of the tracks—she’s on the wrong side of the law. She’s desperate to break free from her dangerous brother and his gang, but when a sexy new recruit joins them, Angel is more trapped than ever—because the ruthless Tonio Reyes isn’t what he seems. When she discovers the man she’s falling for is one of Sugarland’s finest, she’s forced to go on the run. Instead of taking Angel into custody, Tonio finds himself risking his career to keep her safe. And as the beautiful woman tears down all his defenses, Tonio realizes he’ll risk his very life to set her free.",
