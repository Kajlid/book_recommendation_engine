But defending herself is not on her mind when sexy instructor Riley Moore has her pinned to the mat.THE GOOD GUYWith Regina vulnerable beneath him on his gym floor, Riley breaks out in a possessive sweat. He wants her, but first he has to protect her. She needs more than her \"don't-muss-my-hair\" style of defense and that ridiculous so-called dog. Riley is ex-SWAT -- and his new life as an evidence tech hasn't softened his lethal training one bit. But Regina isn't quite the princess she seems, and she's about to catch him off guard!",
