  "description": "nerdgasm (noun): an emotional climax at the peak of intense (sometimes sexual) excitement, characterized by a deep attraction to nerdy things and/or people. My stutter makes it easy to become the center of attention for all the wrong reasons, so I try hard to stay out of the spotlight.But when Addison Mitchell breezes into the class I TA for, she turns my world upside down, shaking me out of my comfort zone.Confident and bold, her wandering hands set my body on fire.She sees the real me, and she’s still interested.I’m completely out of my element, yet I’ve never felt more alive.Fingers crossed we're not a one-off fling.I have a lot to learn, but I’m willing to make this work.I’m going to give her more than a nerdgasm.I’m going to give her my heart.",
