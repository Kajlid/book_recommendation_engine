  "description": "McKenzie Bishop is fresh out of the Army after getting wounded overseas. Estranged from his family, he decides to attend college as far away from home as possible; ending up at Buchanan State University, in Crescent Falls, Pennsylvania. He doesn’t know a soul there; so, it’s the perfect place to begin the next chapter in his life. After two weeks of immense boredom, loneliness, and his own form of alcohol therapy, he decides to pledge a fraternity, something he always wanted to do prior to joining the Army. Enter, Delta Iota Kappa, the animal house of BSU. Bishop is the oldest one in his pledge class and wary about what the pledging process will entail, but like everything else in his life prior, he fully commits. Everything goes smoothly until the night he’s arrested at a fraternity party. Faced with jail time or a Veterans Affairs substance abuse program, Bishop chooses the latter, and to his surprise, falls head over heels for his much older female counselor. He finds this elusive woman intriguing and suddenly, his sessions become about much more than learning how to overcome his addiction to alcohol.",
