  "description": "The former director of special events at Vogue and producer of nine legendary Met Galas, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff met Melania Knauss in 2003 and had a front row seat to the transformation of Donald Trump’s then girlfriend from a rough-cut gem to a precious diamond. As their friendship deepenedr, Wolkoff watched the newest Mrs. Trump raise her son, Barron, and manage her highly scrutinized marriage.After Trump won the 2016 election, Wolkoff was recruited to help produce the 58th Presidential Inaugu­ration. Melania put Wolkoff in charge of hiring her staff, organizing her events, helping her write speeches, and creating her debut initiatives. Then it all fell apart when she was made the scapegoat for inauguration finance irregularities. Melania could have defended her innocent friend and confidant, but she stood by her man, knowing full well, the author says, who was really to blame. The betrayal nearly destroyed Wolkoff.",
