  "title": "Beneath Creek Waters",
  "description": "In 1845, there were 200 coin s born when Texas joined the United States. They were to be given to all major players that helped Texas into the US. These coins were loaded on to a wagon one rainy night near Dallas, Texas and never seen again. Parks Leslie and Stan Atcher, both treasure hunters and historians, were always looking for their next big find. When the coin resurfaces after a couple of local kids stumble upon what appeared to be one in a Southeast Texas creek, it reopens Parks interest and the hunt is on. What the two did not know is that the coins had been guarded by a local family for years, and they were not about to let them go now. Ultimately, Parks and Stan have to team up with the local family to get out of a deadly situation when a gold hungry militia group enters the picture unexpectedly.",
