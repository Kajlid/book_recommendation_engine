  "description": "Collaborative Photography and the Written Word Some pictures DO speak better than a thousand words possibly could, and then sometimes a few simple words can take a viewer somewhere they might otherwise not have gone. Throwing two artists of varied temperament into the same pen and making them stay there until they no longer nip at the others heels, until their two worlds no longer collide, until their individual nonsense finally makes some added sense for others, was the goal of this project: to produce some synergy by combining our inner and outer worlds. It has been said Salvation can result from the interaction of human will and divine grace. What we both have observed, and tried to demonstrate, is, all around us, within and without, are miraculous surprises.",
