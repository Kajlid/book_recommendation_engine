  "title": "Sound Generation: The Resonant Voices of Teen Girls",
  "description": "In Sound Generation, the teen girls of WriteGirl share poems, stories and songs about their identity and dreams, relationships and challenges, midnight phone calls with friends and international adventures – both real and imagined – across Los Angeles, the United States, South America, Europe and more. Many pieces in this anthology are inspired by music – how melodies and lyrics connect girls to their lives, and connect them to the world. From the soundtrack of a grandmother’s kitchen, to a cassette playing when a girl first realizes she is in love, to vinyl records shrouded in well-worn sleeves, the sounds of these writers’ words transport readers to places where we can rejoice, reflect and resist together. Tune into the soundscape of your own life as you listen to the voices in this book...and enjoy an entire symphony of writing advice and experiments to help you compose your own stories.",
