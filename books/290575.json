  "description": "My best friend is still missing, time's running out, and I'm all out of ideas...My five guys and I travelled to Europe to rescue Zoe from her dragon kidnappers, but my newly developed powers are failing me. Instead of pinpointing her location, the most I can manage is a little static and a lot of frustration.When we team up with a group of local rebels, we learn more about our common enemies -- including exactly how dangerous they are. An unexpected attack also proves they're always one step ahead of us.Only the strengthening bond my boys and I share seems to be going right -- until an unthinkable betrayal threatens us all.The Fire of the Dragon's Heart is the fourth book in the Harem of Fire series, a medium-burn reverse harem fantasy romance featuring five dead-sexy dragon shifters and one sassy human heroine with a propensity for finding trouble.",
