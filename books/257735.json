  "description": "“I’m what’s been made of me, a product of someone else’s depravity. There are scars going deeper than the eye can see, they’re carved into our blood, placed there by the actions of others. You, of all people, should know this. Threatening Caius was the only way I knew of to assure your undivided attention. If you couldn’t love me, at least you’d hate me. But you would notice me.”\tWhat secrets hide in Marianne’s past?\tAfter being thrown to a time portal by Nora Bell’s magic, Marianne finds herself face to face with her own past, one she must now share with Marcus. Will witnessing the life events that led to having met her at Stuart Harlow’s mansion change the way he sees her? And will his worry about having left Cai alone back in their own time allow him to stay focused and clear headed, around a woman who once held such allure over him?\tWill Cai and Nora find a way to bring Marcus back from the past?\tAnd will they condemn Marianne to stay locked there, with her own demons?",
