  "description": "Heavy lies the crown…I thought getting my revenge would give me some kind of peace. Instead it seems to have brought an even worse villain to my doorstep.Or rather, to the Nobles’ doorstep, which the big boss of Paradise Bend’s most powerful gang is not at all happy about. I may have won over Wylder Noble and his men, but his father is another story entirely.A brutally murderous story.Stuck between a vicious gang king and a psychotic stalker set on total domination, I’m not sure yet whether I’m going to win this war or go down fighting. If I fall, will these men who’ve set my body on fire—and somehow worked their way into my heart—fall with me?Not if Mercy Katz has anything to say about it.I’m the heir to my father’s throne, and I’m going to wear the hell out of that crown as long as I’m still breathing.*Perilous Lady is the second book in a new gritty contemporary romance series from bestselling author Eva Chase (writing as Eva Chance) and Harlow King. No major triggers, but be prepared for domineering men who make their own rules, a rebellious heroine who's not afraid to get her hands dirty, and an enemies-to-lovers romance where the girl gets all the guys. It's going to be a wild, bloody ride!*",
