  "description": "With Study Guide by David and Karen Mains for private study and group discussion -From the Introduction by David and Karen Mains \"In a real sense, revival is what Charles Shel- don wrote about in In His Steps. His material was first delivered as a series of sermons in his Topeka, Kansas church. The installments were then published in book form in 1897 when In His Steps became an immediate bestseller. \"The story turns on the response of key church members to the challenge of their minister, Rev. Henry Maxwell. He requests that they join him in a pledge that for one year they will make no major decisions without first asking, 'What would Jesus do?' Through this simple yet profound challenge, the life of Christ is manifested through individuals in this story in amazing ways.\"",
