He's determined to win her back.When Emerson hears a rumor that her ex-husband, NFL quarterback Vincent Lake, is bringing a plus-one to a wedding they're both set to attend, she signs up for online dating and hopes to find a guy impressive enough to make her famous ex jealous for the night.Vincent should be on top of the world when he leads his team to the playoffs, but when his best friend accidentally matches with Emerson, it's like a dagger to his heart. He knows she deserves happiness after his betrayal broke their family apart, but watching her move on is proving harder than winning the Super Bowl.

And even though forgiveness seems impossible, Vincent dares to hope the best love stories can come after the biggest heartbreaks.",
