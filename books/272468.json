  "description": "We were Army Rangers, the best of the best. And then one day, everything that we worked so hard to become was ripped away. Now, we’re in some podunk town, trying to find a sense of normal amongst the crazy, and learn how to live again. That gets a hell of a lot harder to do when a virus spreads mercilessly across the country, killing 85% of the people who contract it. In the midst of the panic, we’re tasked with one last rescue mission. It’s just our luck that the fool we’re rescuing doesn’t believe that the world as we know it is actually ending. Looks like the apocalypse is about to get real interesting.  This is a stand-alone Reverse Harem Romance. This book is intended for readers who are 18+ due to strong language and graphic sexual content.",
