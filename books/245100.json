And then, when August Watt, Ness’s childhood friend, comes home to Boulder.Although August’s plan was to pledge himself and return to active duty, he finds himself incapable of leaving. This becomes problematic for Liam and Ness, because a mating link has clicked into place between Ness and the ex-marine. If not consummated, the link will fade, but that’ll take months.

But when an enemy pack arrives and threatens the Boulders, she has two choices: step aside and let the wolves who have pushed her away fend for themselves, or step up and help them fight the newcomers.Ness has never stepped aside…not for anyone.Why would she start now?",
