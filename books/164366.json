  "title": "Stubby Pringle's Christmas",
  "description": "Here is a story perfect for reading aloud when the family is gathered together at Christmastime. Its setting may not be traditional, nor is Stubby Pringle, the patched-clothes cowhand on his way to whoop it up at a Christmas Eve dance, a likely hero for a Christmas story. But what happens to Stubby on this particular Christmas Eve will touch a responsive chord in any listener's heart and leave young and old alike a little richer and more filled with the spirit of Christmas.",
