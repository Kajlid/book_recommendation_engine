  "description": "A Nanny/Boss Romance\nHiring the woman who wrecked me to nanny the kid I just found out I have is a dumb idea. Getting naked with her in the back of my truck is even dumber. But old habits die hard. Amelia Fox was my high school sweetheart, the girl who broke my heart and nearly ended my football career nine years ago. It was all I could do to put one foot in front of the other, much less make a comeback. But I did come back. And I’m not about to let go of everything I fought for just because my world is imploding again. When I find out I’m the father of a two-year-old boy, I’m ready to start my final season in the pros. It’s my last chance to nab the championship I promised my dad I’d win before he died.  Enter Amelia: teacher, toddler whisperer, and—oh yeah—my ex-girlfriend. We haven’t spoken in almost a decade, but I’m desperate, and she’s looking for a job. I need to focus, which means I need help with this kid. Which means I need her. The arrangement works until one night of bad decisions and great sex threatens to ruin everything.  Can we make it work this time around?  Or is she just another bad habit I need to break before she breaks me?SOUTHERN PLAYBOY is a full length, standalone novel.",
