  "description": "Hello kids! Patches is my name. I'm a Tennessee hound dog and, sometimes, a livestock guardian to some dumb clucks or chickens, as my owners call them. My people adore me so they make up nicknames for me like Rocky Top Rover, or, when I get into trouble, Stinkaroo. At the end of the story, there’s a chilly aura that’s hard to shake off. It gives a dog shivers. Will that cold, clammy feeling lead to the end of my happy family life?Lea Beall enjoys training her funny dog, Patches, who will warn the family if the cats get too near the goldfish. Patches finds time to chase coyotes away from the chickens on the wooded acreage where he lives. Lea resides near Kingston, TN, with her husband and six children where she homeschools and writes.",
