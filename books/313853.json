  "title": "Unlovable",
  "description": "A soon-to-be teen classic: Esther Pearl Watson loosely based this graphic novel on a teenager's diary from the 1980s found in a gas-station bathroom. Unlovable is a first-person account of Tammy Pierce's sophomore year in 1985. The comic has a devoted following because it is serialized Bust magazine: this is the first-ever collection and Watson has created over 100 new pages for the book, which details Tammy's the sometimes ordinary, sometimes humiliating, often poignant and frequently hilarious exploits. Her hopes, dreams, agonies and defeats are brought to vivid, comedic life by Watson's lovingly grotesque drawings, filled with all the eighties essentials - too much mascara, leg warmers with heels and huge hair - as well as timeless teen concerns like acne, dandruff, and the opposite sex (or same sex, in some cases) It will have special resonance for women and young adults. Unlovable will be handsomely packaged in a unique hardcover format with sparkly blue glitter.",
