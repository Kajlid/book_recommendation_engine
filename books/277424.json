  "description": "Page Edwards's third novel dramatizes the life of a feisty, energetic woman whose name aptly places her among the salt of the earth. Both at the turn of the century in a small upstate New York town, Peggy is a product of the surrounding wilderness and mountains. These natural forces shape her character far more decisively than her drunken, \"dough-headed\" father. Throughout her life Peggy continues to feel more at home outdoors than caged indoors with her brutal husband Charlie. Long before Charlie abandons her, Peggy enters an affair with Alston Tucker, an artist and society heir whose family owns a nearby summer home. The sensitive Alston treats Peggy as kindly as he would a Muse and, inspired by his mistress, produces some of his best paintings.-- Diane Cole",
