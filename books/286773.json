  "title": "Through Love and Sorrow: Poems and Short Stories",
  "description": "Poems Through Love and Sorrow is a collection of poems and short stories that I had written over the last forty years before my children were born, and when they were little and all of them facing serious medical conditions. At one point I was in a bad relationship that caused turmoil in our lives. I prayed and wrote poems about the situations going on around me to help me deal with stress. Thank you for interest and bless you and your family and friends.",
