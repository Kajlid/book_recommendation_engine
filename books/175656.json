  "description": "New Biker Romance series from New York Times and USA Today bestselling author, Victoria Danann. No cliffhangers.\n\nTwo brothers, one a player, one a playboy, are on a crash trajectory with destiny and two broken hearts.\nBONUS PREQUEL INCLUDED: Intro to the Sons of Sanctuary MC. A Season in GeminiBrigid was a graduate student at the University of Texas. She had no trouble getting her thesis approved, but finding a Hill Country motorcycle club willing to give her access to their lifestyle was looking impossible. Then she got a lead. A friend of a friend had a cousin with family ties to The Sons of Sanctuary. Perfect. Or was it?  What Brigid wanted was information to prove a proposition. The last thing she had in mind was falling for one of the members of the club. Especially since she was a feminist academic out to prove that motorcycle clubs are organized according to the same structure as primitive tribal society.  Brash was standing in line at the H.E.B. Market when his world tipped on its axis. While waiting his turn to check out, his gaze had wandered to the magazine display and settled on the new issue of “NOW”. The image on the cover, although GQ’d up in an insanely urbane way, was… him.  After reading the article, Brash threw some stuff in a duffle and left his only home, a room at The Sons of Sanctuary clubhouse, with a vague explanation about needing a couple of days away. He left his truck at the Austin airport and caught a plane for New York, on a mission to find a mysterious guy walking around with his face. \nSENSITIVITY WARNING:\n Sometimes this book is profane. Sometimes it's obscene. And sometimes it's both at once.",
