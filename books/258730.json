There is something Poe Blythe, the seventeen-year-old captain of the Outpost's last mining ship, wants far more than the gold they tear from the Serpentine River. Revenge.Poe has vowed to annihilate the river raiders who robbed her of everything two years ago. But as she navigates the treacherous waters of the Serpentine and realizes there might be a traitor among her crew, she must also reckon with who she has become, who she wants to be, and the ways love can change and shape you. Even - and especially - when you think all is lost.",
