  "description": "\"The trick is not to fear the shadows but to embrace them… Night-time has become a good friend,\" says Justin.But for how long?Twenty-five-year-old insomniac Justin Brooks opens an all-night café for something to do, to fill the long nights. But soon after opening, one of his customers is found murdered in a side street. What Justin doesn't know is that his insomnia is connected to the murder. Even before the murder, inexplicable things were starting to happen in Justin's life. But after it, life becomes very strange indeed........His eyes stream when it rains outside..... Another café appears, out of the fog, out of nowhere..... Footsteps follow him everywhere..... The dead person talks to him, though it's not a ghost..... And a magician waits for him, perched on a high wire, high up in the night sky.....Strange things indeed. But these strange things can't possibly have anything to do with the murder. Can they?Nobody who visits Café Insomniac can ever look at the world in the same way again.\"I don't know what's real and what isn't -- and which is most dangerous.\"",
