  "description": "Drew’s had a crush on Matthew ever since they started working at Pendragon Bay Hotel. They may have been friends since day one, but he’s never been able to inspire a desire for more, from the other man—not until Matthew gets a promotion. For years it’s been the unofficial company tradition for any newly promoted employee to have another member of staff act as his “slave” for a week—waiting on them hand and foot and following his every order. Drew’s more than happy to be Matthew’s slave. Unfortunately, for some reason, Matthew doesn’t seem quite so enthusiastic about the idea—not even when he finds out they come with a free supply of blow jobs.",
