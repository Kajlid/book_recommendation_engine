  "description": "DeaconI was born an Alpha with no desire to lead. My role is to protect my pack, support my Alpha, and pretend to be less than I am. If I do that, I can have the life I want—the one with Grace by my side far away from here. She is the only one who sees the real me. Not the spare. For the next eight months,  I must prove my loyalty to my pack, establish alliances, and survive. All without her. She can't come with me, not yet. But I will be back to claim what's mine.MarcusI'm the replacement. The Alpha who was never supposed to be here. My lineage never allowed me opportunities to mingle with the elite, and I won't let this chance go to waste. I need alliances. I need to prove my wolf can stand with the best of them. Being the new guy is hard enough, but I love a challenge. They underestimate me, and I plan to use that to my advantage to take what's rightfully mine.A journey of young lovers, friends who become brothers, and betrayal from within. Torn apart with nothing left, this is a villain origin story; one that only the Fates saw coming.",
