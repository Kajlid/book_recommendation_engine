Yet, so often, parents, educators, and caregivers have trouble communicating with kids. Conversations can feel trivial or strained--or worse, are marked by constant conflict.In The Art of Talking with Children,  Rebecca Rolland, a Harvard faculty member, speech pathologist, and mother, arms adults with practical tools to help them have productive and meaningful conversations with children of all ages--whether it's engaging an obstinate toddler or getting the most monosyllabic adolescent to open up.With a winning combination of engaging storytelling, the most up-to-date research, and practical advice, The Art of Talking with Children is an essential blueprint that empowers parents to navigate everyday behavior issues, put an end to the battles, build better, more peaceful, and more fulfilling relationships, and set their children on the path to a successful adulthood.",
