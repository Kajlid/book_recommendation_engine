  "description": "Dr Karl has taken on Santa Claus, atom bombs, 'friendly' dolphins and 'killer' whales, meteors, black holes, string theory and camel's humps. In his 27 mega-selling books, he demolishes myths, tells readers how to spot bogus science and advises readers to be wise, sceptical and to always challenge authority. In his 28th book, he continues his crusade to keep the world a rational place by answering vital questions like \"Are white cats deaf?\" and \"Will lemon juice make you slimmer?\"",
