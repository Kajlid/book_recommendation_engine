  "description": "After the bombs, the world changed. Alcide’s Circus is proof of that. Freaks, outcasts, abominations, they have been called it all, but they found freedom within the big top to embrace themselves and each other. They have never been slaves—until now.  Last Stop is a mecca in a destroyed world, filled with riches and treasures from the times before, yet under the decadent, utopian façade hides a darker underbelly, and when the circus rolls into town, things start to get interesting.  Fate has its cruel eyes set on Rhea, and will test everything she thought she knew, not only about herself but her family as well. Sometimes you have to lose everything to find the truth about who you are, and what you are capable of.  When the Circus falls and the freaks are forced to fight for their lives in the dust, will there be anyone left to pick up the pieces?",
