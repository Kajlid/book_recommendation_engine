  "description": "It began with \"Road Rage\" and quickly expanded into \"School Rage\", \"Work Rage\", \"Air Rage\", \"Antigovernment Rage\" and \"Antibusiness Rage.\" America, the world's most influent and prosperous nation, leads the world in murder, violent crime, divorce, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, teen suicide, cocaine consumption and pornography. American virtues are breaking down and violence is increasing. We see it in movies, Tv, sporting events, in schools, at work and in homes. Terrorism threats increase the contributing paranoia. Life Rage examines these rages. . .their causes and effects, and offers hope and solutions. Americans can come together and make our lives and businesses safer and better.",
