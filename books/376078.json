  "description": "Fiction. Denton Pike, a divorced translator, is stuck, stalled in a moment of inertia...until the reappearance of his old friend, Peter, a roving journalist, sets into motion a series of watershed events. Denton and his handful of thirty-something friends each face a choice: Seize the day and change your surroundings or bite your lip and perpetuate the status quo. This finely crafted narrative explores the motivations and mettle of a close-knit group of 21st-century knowledge workers, and examines the interpretation of history, the translation of language, and most of all, the dynamics of modern-day relationships. With spare, tightly written sentences, Joseph Zeppetello's debut novel sparkles with a Raymond Carver-like economic use of language. The effortless dialogue speaks volumes about human nature and illuminates man's daily struggles to make the right choices in life.",
