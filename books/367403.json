  "description": "Nerlin and Mordonna Flood have seven children, most of whom were not created in the traditional way like you or me, but were made in the cellar, using incredible mystical powers, some very shiny Jamie Oliver saucepans and a small chemistry set. The youngest child, Betty, is a normal, pretty little girl - but she's a useless witch. Her attempts at magic often go wrong, with unexpected yet welcome results. The next-door neighbours should've known better than to rob a family of witches and wizards. But they did, and they're about to find out what the Floods do to bad neighbours. Look through the cobwebbed, murky arched window in deepest Patagonia, and this is what you might see...Every day five of the Flood children travel halfway round the world to Quicklime College, the ultimate school for witches and wizards. There's no time for silly games flying around on broomsticks. Sports day is coming up, and before you even wonder how four-legged Satanella copes with the three-legged race, here's a secret for you. Orkward Warlock, the vilest child in the school, and his sidekick, The Toad, hate the big happy Floods family. And they're plotting to kill the Floods - on sports day.",
