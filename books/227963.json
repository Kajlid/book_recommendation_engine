  "title": "Maimed",
  "description": "All Tate Vasilievich wants out of life is to go to her job at the gyro shop, play some video games and maybe kill a few vampires without getting maimed in the process. Is that really too much to ask? Adjusting to her new life as a vampire has been hard enough, but the hits keep coming with blackmail, a threateningly nosy neighbor, and hookers going missing. Just when Tate thinks things couldn’t get any worse a new vampire hunter shows up on the scene. They say “the enemy of my enemy is my friend” but is a shared hobby of dealing out carnage grounds for a budding new friendship, or a cause for concern? Tate’s not sure she’ll survive long enough to find out. Is her inhuman strength enough for Tate to come out on top, or will the fragile new life she’s built for herself come crumbling down?",
