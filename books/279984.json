  "title": "Men Who Hate Women",
  "description": "The first comprehensive undercover look at the terrorist movement no one is talking about.Men Who Hate Women examines the rise of secretive extremist communities who despise women and traces the roots of misogyny across a complex spider web of groups. It includes eye-opening interviews with former members of these communities, the academics studying this movement, and the men fighting back.Women's rights activist Laura Bates wrote this book as someone who has been the target of many hate-fueled misogynistic attacks online. At first, the vitriol seemed to be the work of a small handful of individual men... but over time, the volume and consistency of the attacks hinted at something bigger and more ominous. As Bates went undercover into the corners of the internet, she found an unseen, organized movement of thousands of anonymous men wishing violence (and worse) upon women.In the book, Bates explores:Extreme communities like incels, pick-up artists, MGTOW, Men's Rights Activists and moreThe hateful, toxic rhetoric used by these groupsHow this movement connects to other extremist movements like white supremacyHow young boys are targeted and slowly drawn inWhere this ideology shows up in our everyday lives in mainstream media, our playgrounds, and our governmentBy turns fascinating and horrifying, Men Who Hate Women is a broad, unflinching account of the deep current of loathing toward women and anti-feminism that underpins our society and is a must-read for parents, educators, and anyone who believes in equality for women.",
