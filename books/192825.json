  "description": "From the bestselling author of the Inner Movement trilogy and the Cosega Sequence, comes The Last Librarian, (book one of the Justar Journal).  In the year 2098, there is no more war, no more hunger and no more pollution. The world is secure and Earthâ€™s 2.9 billion people are healthy and happy. There is also only one remaining library that still houses physical books. In addition to the dusty volumes, the library holds many secrets. But the government has decided to shut it down and burn the contents. Unless an unlikely trio can save the books, humanity will lose more than just what is printed on those antique pages.  With a single government ruling the entire planet, one currency, one language and no religion, the population is unified and enjoying the prosperity that comes with more than seven decades of peace. Free healthcare for all and guaranteed employment make the future a dream. But this future may only be safe if they can hide the past. The books must be saved . . . the impossible task is up to an angry author, a brazen revolutionary and the last librarian.   When everything is perfect, the only thing left to fear is the truth.",
