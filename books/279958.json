  "description": "Senan Molony caused a worldwide media flurry in 2017 by revealing publicly that there was an uncontrolled coal bunker fire aboard Titanic. Experts held the fire would have significantly weakened a forward bulkhead, the failure of which hastened the sinking. Indeed, a shipyard worker aboard the Titanic from Southampton to Cherbourg is said to have warned passengers about the ship's defects. Titanic might otherwise have lasted into daylight, with hordes being saved by a flotilla of arriving ships. In Titanic: Why She Collided, Why She Sank, Why She Should Never Have Sailed Molony makes a series of further startling revelations. He provides lost evidence for the true circumstances that led to the Titanic's collision and ultimate loss. Molony appeared on CNN, NBC, CBS and ABC, along with NPR (National Public Radio) in the US after his Channel 4 documentary Titanic: The New Evidence, which provides the platform for this book -- and the springboard for many added insights.",
