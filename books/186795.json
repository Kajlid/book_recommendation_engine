  "title": "Lord of the Wings",
  "description": "It's another holiday and Mayor Randall Shiffley has turned Caerphilly, Virginia into Spooky City, USA. The residents are covering every window with cobwebs and roaming the streets in costume to entertain the tourists, and Meg's grandfather is opening a new “Creatures of the Night” exhibit in the zoo. When a suspicious fire burns down the Haunted House, Meg Langslow reluctantly agrees to lend her home as the replacement. But all too soon a real body mars the town's creepy fun, and it's up to Meg to save Halloween. Like Meg Langslow, the blacksmith heroine of her series, Donna Andrews was born and raised in Yorktown, Virginia. She introduced Meg to readers in her Malice Domestic Contest-winning first mystery, Murder with Peacocks, and readers are still laughing. This novel swept up the Agatha, Anthony, Barry, and a Romantic Times award for best first novel, and a Lefty for funniest mystery.",
