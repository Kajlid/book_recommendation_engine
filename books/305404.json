  "description": "Vampires exist. As strange as that sounds, they do. Michael knows this because one attacked him when he was twenty-one years old. What Michael doesn’t know is who she was, how it happened, or why she did what she did. What little he does know about being a vampire, he learned the hard way. The self-taught way. He’s also alone. Michael knows THAT better than anything else. In fact, he’s become quite adept at being isolated, because he’s never met or even sensed another being like himself—another vampire. Not once, not ever. Outside of his two loyal dogs, Michael's circle of friends has become nonexistent. But a chance encounter will drag him out of exile and thrust him into an adventure stranger than anything he could possibly imagine. He won’t be ready for most of it, either, because not even an immortal creature of the night could predict what comes next. Not even close. Did we mention the dragon?",
