  "description": "Eleanor Emberton isn't sitting around waiting for a handsome prince to rescue her. In fact, she's determined to save not only herself, but her entire family from her stepmother's headlong plunge into financial ruin. The situation is dire, though, and her work as a seamstress isn't going to keep her stepsisters from the poor house. That is, until the king declares a month long celebration in honor of his daughter's engagement. Suddenly everyone needs new outfits for the royal ball, and Eleanor begins to feel some stirrings of hope.Max Wellesley is a loyal and true blue friend, which is the only reason he let Princess Vivienne talk him into this mad scheme of a fake engagement in order to outsmart her father. He hasn't really considered the consequences of his actions, though, not to himself, his father, or his friend--and certainly not to the mysterious young woman he meets, ironically, at a ball for his own fake engagement.Before the Midnight Bells is a fresh look at the Cinderella story, filled with humor and intrigue, and a modern sensibility about how fairy tales ought to go.",
