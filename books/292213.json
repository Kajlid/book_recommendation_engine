  "title": "A Predator and A Psychopath",
  "description": "After Jason is committed to a mental institution, he begins to uncover things he never knew before or things his mind shut out to protect him. He finds himself questioning what's real and what's not. What happened to his wife, Lisa? Where is Lea? Why can't he remember what happened?  Meanwhile, Jerry is dangerous and unpredictable. He envisions a world where boundaries are broken down and he is free to enforce his narcissistic belief that he has a divine mission.  An explosive ending that is anything but expected, forgive yourself for shuddering throughout and after you close the book.  Drawing inspiration from real cases, and with well-researched, realistic characters, this thriller is not for the soft-hearted.",
