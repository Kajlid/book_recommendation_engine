Nope.He's had a life of luxury before Bluebell, being the star of his own reality show. But here, with me, his attitude doesn't work.I'll give him what he needs.I'll give him the discipline he's begging for.And he'll like it. He'll get addicted to it.Because a woman in control is what Trace needs.I'm what Trace needs.He'll see.",
