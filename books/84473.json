Yet as happy and boisterous as they appear to be, the Callahans have long harbored a heartache. Some twenty years ago, Patti's younger sister, Barbi, placed her infant daughter for adoption. The whole family respected Barbi's decision and admired her fortitude. Still, they couldn't help but wonder: What ever became of the beautiful baby who had been placed with a chosen, but anonymous family? On April 20th, 2010, Facebook gave them the answer they'd been looking for. It was a life-changing moment—one that inspired Patti to write this unforgettable true story.Advance praise for Patti Callahan Henry's And Then I Found You:\"[It] will surprise you, provoke you, and rearrange your heart.\" —Jacquelyn Mitchard\"Henry at her best, brimming with heart and compassionate wisdom.\" —Joshilyn Jackson\"The most soulful book Patti Callahan has ever written.\"—Dorothea Benton Frank\"Explores the labyrinth of a woman's heart—mother, daughter, sister, friend, lover.
