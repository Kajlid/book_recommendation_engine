  "description": "Once unmasked, can beauty love the beast?...My name is Lena Seagull. I should still be in school, hanging out with friends, meeting boys, falling in love—just like you. But on my eighteenth birthday my father sold me. Now, those are yesterday’s dreams. My home is now a remote castle. And the man who owns me? I have never seen him. Guy Hawke keeps his face hidden under a mask. At first, I knew only fear, but now his voice and touch make me unashamedly want him. Each night, his hired help blindfolds me, and takes me to his room. He whispers that I am beautiful and we have wild, torrid sex. When I awaken he is always gone.  He and his castle hold dark secrets that I must unravel, but what he fears most—being unmasked—is my deepest desire. Will either of us survive the consequences of my desire?",
