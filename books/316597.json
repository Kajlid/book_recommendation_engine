  "description": "I, Iris O’Sullivan, have drawn the short stick. Literally. My family drew sticks to see who had to take Yiayia on a cruise to scatter Papou’s ashes around the Greek Islands.I knew the whole thing was rigged, but here I am anyway, smuggling a Ziplock bag of ashes—don’t ask—halfway across the world with my four-hundred-year-old grandmother in tow. She is on a mission to tell the world that this generation doesn’t know how to make a good baklava, too. The woman is fueled solely by spite and fig newtons.Needless to say, the absolute last thing I need is to spend the trip with an actual Greek god. Apollo Nikas. The man my parents hired to make sure Yiayia and I don’t end up on the next episode of Locked Up Abroad, because the only person they trust less than Yiayia is me. The man is allergic to wearing properly fitting shirts. And now that I’ve seen him in a speedo, there is no going back. Zeus help me.",
