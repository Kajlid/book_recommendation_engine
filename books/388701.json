  "description": "If God wanted April Grace to be kind to her neighbors, He should have made them nicer! Growing up in the country is never easy, but it sure is funny―especially if you happen to have a sister obsessed with being glamorous, a grandma just discovering make-up, hippie friends who never shower, and brand new neighbors from the city who test everyone’s patience. From disastrous dye jobs to forced apologies and elderly date tagalongs, you’ll laugh ‘til you cry as you read the Confessions of April Grace !Here are just a couple of April's On her sister, Myra \"How anyone can be that dumb and still be able to eat with a fork is beyond me.\" On senior citizen \"What if they started smooching right at the table in front of God and everybody?\" In spite of all the loony characters in her life, April Grace is able to learn from her parents as they share the love of God―to even the craziest of characters!",
