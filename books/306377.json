  "title": "Living with the climate crisis: Voices from Aotearoa",
  "description": "The devastating summer of Australian bushfires underlined a terrifying sense of a world pushed to the brink. Then came Covid-19, and with it another dramatic lurch away from business as usual. Some observers are worried that the all-consuming effort to control the pandemic will distract us from the long term challenge of limiting catastrophic climate change. At the same time, many people are hoping for a 'green Covid-19 recovery': a cleaner, fairer and safer world. This BWB Text brings together Mātauranga Māori and Pasifika perspectives, voices from academia, activism, journalism and economics to bear witness to these troubled times",
