Now all she expects is to secure her future and marry Charles, Duke of Castleberry, as arranged. But Amelia has a dangerous secret that could not only destroy her in Charles's eyes and the eyes of society, but could also very well condemn her to Bedlam.Baron Endsleigh, Amelia’s oldest friend, has other ideas.

Not even a duke as powerful as Castleberry. That duke has hated Baron Endsleigh and wanted Amelia for, what seems to him, forever. Charles will stop at nothing to make her his, and his alone, even if that means destroying the one thing he knows she loves most in this world—Endsleigh.Will Amelia be able to choose when one man speaks to her head and the other her heart? None of them will find happiness until they all three learn to embrace absolute surrender.",
