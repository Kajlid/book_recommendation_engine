Feeling her absence, her father, Jacob, has found himself newly interested in pursuing a second chance of happiness. A unique dressmaker who is new to the region, Emma is a widow with independent thinking and the level of determination to achieve all that she sets out to do. Her passion for business and success is like a magnet to Jacob. She is unlike other ladies in the small town. She has caught his eye.  Meanwhile, Jacob's sister in law has invited her young sister, Isabella, to come and stay in the small western town. Upon her arrival, Isabella encounters a new man with skin like she's never seen before. Identifying a similar loneliness in him as she often feels, she embarks on a friendship that will be scorned and criticized by others in the town. It will be enough to test the resolve of both young people, but they have no doubt. Regardless of different skin tones, they are meant to be together. They'll do whatever it takes to make that a possibility.",
