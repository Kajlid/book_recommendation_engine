  "description": "1988: For rookie officer Herman Faust, a routine, late night traffic stop turns into the apprehension of a high priority defector, one with ties to the Soviet bio-weapons program, Obolensk. After bringing the woman and her brother in for questioning, the man disappears, and the woman is found inside her holding cell - dead. The American CIA intervenes, confiscating the womanâ€™s corpse and demanding answers even as more bodies pile up around them. Faust has none to offer, but begins receiving anonymous calls threatening his family, and his own life. As clues come to light linking his superior to the woman, and to a Soviet plot to launch a biological weapon on the American Ambassador, Faust knows he must stop the deadly pathogen from being released on. Democracy is under attack, the stability of West Berlin is at risk, and if Faust fails to solve the case, it will be war!",
