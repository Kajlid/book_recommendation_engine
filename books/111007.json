  "description": "[Siren Everlasting Classic Erotic Alternative Fantasy Romance, M/M, vampires, shape-shifters, light bondage, light spanking, flogging, food play, HEA] Life is not easy for a carnivorous rabbit. I would know. I am one--Vesper, the white, hunting-challenged carnivorous bunny. I've always been completely unappreciated by my warren because of my inability to hunt. Finding a mate was next to impossible. Until now. The wait was worth it, because I've met Count Vlad Dracula. A vampire. My mate. Suddenly, sucking is very appealing. As is every other form of intercourse my libidinous bunny mind can come up with. But Vlad has other ideas. He wants to woo me properly, to introduce me to the lifestyle of a vampire's mate. Despite my lustful instincts, I've respected his decision. Being thrust into a vampire family is strange, especially when fur-obsessed sisters are involved. Sadly, Vlad's plan backfires when a mysterious witch attacks us. Now, it's up to Vlad to rescue me from her clutches. I only hope he will do so before the damn bitch slaughters my fur with her abusive petting. This book is written in first-person point of view. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
