  "description": "BEYOND YOUR DARKEST DREAMSFrom the deceptive safety of your very own bed to the seeming stillness of country roads and the bustle of urban streets, your darkest realities reveal themselves as you enter hidden realms, crossing the threshold into one man's tortured minda mind haunted by the mocking, derisive voices of his youth. Quench your insatiable thirst for terror at a bar where the drinks are abominable and the patrons never leave. Relive the infamous, harrowing Middle Passage that brought millions of African slaves to America, but this time with a spellbinding twist. . LIE YOUR DEEPEST FEARS.  From scenes of pulsating ecstasy to unspeakable tragedy, surrender yourself to a world inhabited by bizarre sex cults and violent gangs. Meet the malevolent entities that feed on human misery in the midst of a hurricane's wrath. Endure a sweltering summer on a swamp inhabited by mischievous spirits intent on possessing the most innocent within their slimy grasp. Submit to the tantalizing temptation and the irresistible pull of the unknown in eighteen stories that will illuminate the horrors withinand without. And whatever you do, don't turn off the lights. \"Showcases the best in horror and suspense by noted African American writers.\"Library Journal on Dark Dreams\"Funny. horrifying. the end is always unexpected. a book worth reading if you like looking over your shoulder or peering into dark corners.\"The Rawsistaz Reviewers on Voices from The Other Side: Dark Dreams II\"Strong. a volume whose universal human themes will resonate with many readers.\"Publishers Weekly on Dark Dreams.",
