  "description": "Vicky Banning is many things to many people, making friends with smooth aplomb, but quick to recognize chicanery and deceit. Drug pushers and crooked politicians come under her scrutiny and -- posing as a Madam, then as a reporter from The New York Times, complete with a Streisand Brooklyn accent -- she manages to charm them into jail time.Having started life as a pampered child, Vicky views the world as her playground and causes havoc at her “finishing school” in Boston before she returns to her parents’ grand home in Newport, Rhode Island. There she meets her future husband who, with British stiff upper-lip, leads her into the exciting world of show business and travel.Gay lovers Roger and Steve become Vicky’s closest friends. But even they don’t know her completely. She keeps mum on her efforts to smuggle endangered children out of Europe to the U.S. during WWII, and their aftermath.Whether she is nearly arrested at Mardi Gras for impersonating an undercover policeman in drag, or masquerading as one of her many alternate personalities of the Countess of Comedians, or simply playing the grandmother while helping a boy keep his dog, Vicky lives life to the fullest. Join this fabulous lady on a zany romp through a whirlwind world of show biz and shenanigans!",
