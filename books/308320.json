  "description": "Sage Taylor is a stranger in her own family, an unasked guest on the farm she's grown up on in rural Kansas. She's dreamed of emancipation for so long and toiled her childhood away making up stories to distract from her disturbed parents' theatrics. Now, an unlikely friendship with a longhorn calf has given her a sense of belonging, the first she's ever felt.Then, it happens. A rumbling in her belly climbs up her throat and whispers in her ear. \"Once upon a time,\" it says. This twisted parable comes to life as Sage wrestles against her own blood to prove she'll do anything to keep the voice inside of her alive.",
