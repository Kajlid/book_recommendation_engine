  "description": "EmiliaIt was hate at first sight for Carter and I. The day we met he pushed me and I bit him. Mind you, we were only eight and ten. We’ve graduated to bigger and better things now. Just a few days ago I threw fake cockroaches all over his bed, and he retaliated by throwing itching powder over mine. Carter has upped the stakes though. He’s playing an entirely different game now. One where he infuriates me with his annoyingly hot body and the way he looks at me. I’d be all over that.. If he wasn’t my best friend’s brother.CarterShe’s the bane of my existence and the center of my universe. Who could’ve known that the line between love and hate would be so thin? I love the way her eyes light up in anger far too much and I hate the way she makes me feel when she looks at me with barely concealed longing. The stakes in our little feud have never been higher. I’m playing for keeps.",
