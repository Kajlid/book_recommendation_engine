  "title": "Tuscan Terror",
  "description": "An abandoned baby. A teenage boy brutally murdered.  It was early morning. There was ice on the roads but the sun, climbing the blue sky, promised to melt it. A man got out and stood for a moment scrutinising the area, then placed a plastic bag on the ground in front of the largest green bin. When he left, the baby began to cry...  Dr. di Girolamo is the local magistrate for Borgo San Cristoforo, in Tuscany. Still recovering from a sensational murder the previous summer, the community is now faced with the mystery of an abandoned baby and the hideous murder of a popular young man whose body is found in the woods.  Once again, Dr. di Girolamo must search for a killer in Tuscan Terror, this suspenseful new Tuscan mystery by Margaret Moore. But time is running out...  Margaret Moore was born in London, England, but has spent all her adult life in Italy where she lives with her Italian husband, large family and seven cats, and works as a freelance translator and interpreter. Tuscan Temper is the third novel in her series set in the fictional hill-town, Borgo San Cristoforo, in Tuscany, and featuring Dr. Ruggero di Girolamo.",
