If you have the remotest level of enjoyment from these stories, Osric's Wand will definitely be one for you. ~J Bryden Lloyd A great novel. Well written and inventive. The authors create a wonderful new world to explore and characters to fall in love with. A book to get lost in! ~ Lauren, Amazon.com reviewer Osric was content with his life, keeping the peace in a bustling trading town and honoring the tradition of the hunt. All was well in the world of Archana as leaders from every realm gathered to sign an unprecedented peace treaty--when disaster struck. Osric’s life will be forever changed as he sets out on a journey to find the culprit behind a murderous attack. Osric is joined by Archana’s greatest wand-maker, an argumentative prairie dog; an Empath and Maiden of the Unicorn; his closest childhood friend Kenneth, an exceptional hunter; and a dual-wielding dwarf with a soft spot for dragons. Soon the companions realize that something more sinister has been brewing for decades, and their long-held beliefs are challenged. They must master new magic and solve the riddles of prophecy, and Osric must accept that the quiet life he dreamed of may never be his reality. The Wand-Maker’s Debate is only the beginning. Look for the other novels in the Osric’s Wand series--Book The High-Wizard’s Hunt and Book The Well of Strands Watch for Book The Weaving of Wells coming soon!",
