Returning to the music world after a turbulent split from her former band, Lilli Morgan has risen like a phoenix and has the industry at her feet. “Before the split, it was: ‘Lilli? Everyone always wants to know if there has ever been anything romantic between Adam and you?’‘No not at all. I'm quite content being young, free, and single,’ was my standard reply. Now it's: ‘A special man in my life? No, I'm very happy being single. No time for all that.’ I've been peddling that line for years and it's never failed me.Problem is, I do have a special man in my life. A wonderful perfect man … It's just a question of keeping it a secret. But for how long?”",
