  "description": "Welcome to the Japanese seaside café The Chibineko Kitchen, where a soul-nourishing meal in the company of the resident kitten will transport you back in time to reunite with departed loved ones—for fans of Before the Coffee Gets Cold and The Midnight Library.It’s a beautiful morning, and nineteen-year-old Kotoko Niki is far from home. Whispers of an enigmatic café whose kagezen, an extra portion of a meal for someone who has passed away, promise the impossible—a reunion with the departed—have led her to a seaside town outside of Tokyo. Still devastated in the wake of her beloved older brother’s sudden death, Kotoko can only hope for a miracle. As Kotoko struggles to heal from her loss, the restaurant’s kitten, the young chef, and the other patrons—each in search of answers of their own—teach her that she is not alone in her grief. Told in a succession of voices, memories, and even recipes, Yuta Takahashi’s touching debut is sure to linger long in readers’ hearts.",
