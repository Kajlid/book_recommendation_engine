  "description": "Sometimes broken hearts need whiskey. Sometimes they need music. Other times, only a night with a stranger will soothe the pain. On the night Isaac and I met, we tried all three. When it was over, we went our separate ways. We planned to never see each other again, but I should really know by now that plans don’t work out the way they're supposed to. It has been four years since that night, and it’s a bizarre twist of fate that lands me in need of help only Isaac can give. I don’t want to be attracted to him, but I am. I don’t want my heart to skip a beat when it sees him, but it does. And I really don’t want him to look at me that way, but he won’t stop. Because things aren't like they were four years ago. And this time? We don’t have the option of parting ways when the sun comes up.",
