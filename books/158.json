  "title": "Robert's Rules of Writing: 101 Unconventional Lessons Every Writer Needs to Know",
  "description": "Although there's no shortage of books on writing and publishing, there's none quite like Robert's Rules of Writing. Drawing on his many years of experience as an award-winning journalist, TV writer, and the author of over twenty books, Robert Masello addresses all the issues that confront, and all the problems that beset, writers of all stripes. Whether you're working on a novel or a script, a memoir or a blog, an epic poem or a newspaper piece, you're going to have to find the best way to express yourself clearly, persuasively, and entertainingly. You'll have to find your own personal voice (much harder than it sounds) and use that unique voice to convey your story, your thoughts, and your opinions, to the many readers out there that you're eager to reach; with complete candor and welcome irreverence, Robert's Rules of Writing offers the inside knowledge that will help you do just that. In well over a hundred short but pithy takes, Masello guides you over hurdles, around obstacles, and through the seemingly insurmountable barriers to completion and ultimately publication--hooray!--of your writing. It's a lively, thought-provoking, and often downright funny addition to any veteran, or fledgling, writer's shelf.",
