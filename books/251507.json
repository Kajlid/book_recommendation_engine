  "description": "Forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest.It had been years since I had seen her.Years since I last saw those eyes with pure, raw innocence.So much time had passed since I lusted after what I knew I should resist.But she was so right.And I was so wrong.To claim her as mine was breaking the rules. Boundaries should not be broken. But temptation weakens my resolve.With the pull of my dark desires...I know that I can't hide from my sinful thoughts—and actions—forever.",
