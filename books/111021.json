  "description": "This serial concludes with romance, tragedy, and one last bucket of eroticism as the American werewolf('s lover) in England once again is torn between the pack and the religious fanatic Dreyer - this time, almost literally torn. Part 3 of the series and the final chapter in this story.This volume contains 8700 words with some pretty strong language in regards to:- Group sex (yes, again)- Rough sex- Romantic sex and love- And some related things that come up when the above three are the subject at hand. Nothing too crazy this time (maybe you'd be interested in volume 2 for that?).",
