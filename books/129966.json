Confusion over her feelings for Charlie, residual resentment over losing Hannah, and a continuous stream of unwanted assignments leave Dez restless and argumentative.In a missed encounter with Crosby, her prying gaze lands upon a single entry in the datebook on his unoccupied desk.

Reed continues the story of Dez Donnelly, pushing her to her limits and surprising readers at every twist and turn of the vast world that is Atman.Death was only the beginning.",
