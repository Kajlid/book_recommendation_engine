  "description": "\"Hard Fall\"That's what my mom is always saying: \"The bigger you are, the harder you fall.\" She's talking about love—I've never been in it myself, but that doesn't stop me from secretly matchmaking for my friends. Who would suspect me, a world class athlete, of meddling in other people's love lives? I love Love, especially when it’s not me who’s doing the falling…\"No Thanks.\"That's what Hollis Westbrooke said when I asked her on a date. Well, propositioned her, actually—but it was all a big joke; one she doesn't think is funny. My stomach is in knots since I might actually like this girl so the joke is on me. Hollis’s father is my boss—and she doesn't date players.The bigger they are, the harder they fall—especially when biggest player is me.",
