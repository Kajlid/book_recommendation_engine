  "description": "Johnny Wilson has never been love. Though women adore his golden-blond good looks, he never seems to connect. Still trying to convince himself he's straight when he checks out a local gay bar, one look at the handsome stranger is enough to set his heart on fire. Half-acknowledged fantasies and dangerous dreams are challenged as Johnny finally faces his own secrets. Eric Mendez, the handsome, much-sought-after Dom in the BDSM gay Manhattan scene, is used to getting just exactly what he wants with a snap of his fingers and a glance from his smoldering eyes. When he first lays eyes on Johnny Wilson, he assumes he's just another pretty boy cruising the clubs for a good time. When Johnny disappears without a trace, he unknowingly takes a piece of Eric's heart with him. Sizzling passion and hidden yearnings to experience the ultimate submission at the hands of another man are brought to the fore in this explicit but romantic exploration of a gay D/s lifestyle. Johnny must come to grips not only with his sexual orientation, but must also find the courage to submit in a loving exchange of power.",
