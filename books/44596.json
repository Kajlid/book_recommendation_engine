  "description": "Ricki's dad has never been there for her. He's a bounty hunter who spends his time chasing parole evaders―also known as \"skips\"―all over the country. But now since Ricki's mom ran off, Ricki finds herself an unwilling passenger in a front-row seat to her father's dangerous lifestyle. Ricki's feelings get even more confused when her dad starts chasing seventeen-year-old Ian Burnham. She finds herself unavoidably attracted to the dark-eyed felon who seems eager to get acquainted. But Ricki thinks she's ever in control―the perfect manipulator. Little does she know that Ian isn't playing their game by her rules.",
