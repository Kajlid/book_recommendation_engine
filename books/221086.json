Their hopes and fears and, most of all, their courage in the face of adversity are revealed in excerpts from journals, letters, and oral histories. Illustrated with a fascinating collection of seldom-seen photographs, Pioneer Women reveals the faces as well as the voices of women who lived on the frontier.The authors portray a wide variety of women, from those who found liberty and confidence in undertaking \"menâ€™s work\" to those who felt burdened by the wind, the weather, and the struggle of frontier life.",
