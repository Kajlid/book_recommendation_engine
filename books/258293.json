  "description": "Nick Twisp is back! America's most literate teen diarist returns with more riotous adventures through the land mines of 21st century adolescence. This sequel to C.D. Payne's acclaimed first novel \"Youth in Revolt\" finds love-struck Nick Twisp still on the lam from the law and his parents. Our 14-year-old hero (and his multiplying alter egos) now must battle blizzards, back-stabbing aliens, vengeful parents, and school officials determined to schedule him into girls' gym. He conspires to play cupid, journeys south of the border on a secret mission, takes some gunplay lessons from his distraught mom, and still finds time to confide all to his diary while inadvertently wreaking havoc in cyberspace. A must-read for Nick Twisp fans.",
