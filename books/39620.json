  "description": "In order to stop his magic from eating him alive, Chalice seeks out a man strong enough to dominate and control him.Chalice might be a prince on his planet but his submissive tendencies prevent him from dealing with the incredible energy coursing through his body. Magic users need a second to balance them out, but there has never been a case where the one with the power didn't hold the dominant position. Chalice's ability as a rare four elemental magic wielder already marks him as different, though. And with the king in denial of his son's needs, he has no choice but to look off—planet to find a powerful partner.He runs into a diplomat on a mission who leads Chalice to agree to be the pet of an emperor—one whose reputation for tossing aside subs is only balanced out by the fact that Chalice thinks he's the sexiest creature he's ever seen. Chalice takes the plunge, hoping the biggest gamble of his life won't prove to be his biggest mistake.",
