  "title": "The Coldest Case",
  "description": "Years before, when the teenage daughter of a U.S. Senator inexplicably disappeared on a residential street in an upscale Washington, D.C., neighborhood police pulled out all the stops to find out what happened to her. Despite a major law enforcement effort that included not only the Metropolitan Police Department, but also the FBI, there was no success. There were no witnesses, no clues.Thirteen years later a young detective, Ted Samuels, who inherited a number of unsolved cases of a just-retired investigator, delves into the matter after the girl's mother pays an emotional visit to the precinct; one she makes every year on the anniversary of her daughter's disappearance.Besides the difficulties of finding evidence from a very more-than-a-decade-old-and-very-cold trail, Samuels is also stymied in his efforts to pursue the cold case investigation. His acting commanding officer hasn’t made it a secret that he wants to have “acting” removed from his title. He doesn’t want a case that was unsolved by his predecessors years ago to frustrate the detective, and have the reopened matter noted by the higher-ups at headquarters as his failure.Despite the obstacles put before him, Samuels covertly continues.What he didn’t realize at the onset of the investigation was that he was headed for a long journey to dark places where he would never have wanted to go.",
