  "description": "Henny had just graduated from high school when the Germans invaded Lithuania. Her care-free life rapidly changed from a life of privilege to a living hell. Simply because she was Jewish.The horrors inflicted upon the Jews of Kovno, taken place in the old forts built during Czarist Russia, are not as well known as what happened in the German Nazi camps during World War II.Henny recounts her beautiful life in Kovno before the invasion by the Nazis when she and 35,000 other Jews were put in the ghetto. We hear about the acts of cruelty done to her family and friends. How can one describe seeing friends and relatives ripped from their lives and being cruelly and viciously murdered?Travel with her to the filth and stench of the Kovno ghetto and the Stutthof concentration camp, and walk with her on her death march. Hear about the shoes that miraculously saved her.Hennyâ€™s story is one of courage, hope and the will to live. It is the heart-breaking story of surviving the most horrible experiences imaginable. Hopefully, her story will inspire those in dire conditions and remind us of what we as humans are capable of doing.",
