  "description": "The bitter cold of winter settles over the mountain, sweeping through the zombies and freezing them solid where they stand. A welcome reprieve, but Jane and her group of rag-tag survivors aren't out of the woods yet. It's a struggle for survival for Jane and the others, who are out of touch without modern conveniences like electricity and heat. This causes a steep learning curve for the group, one with deadly consequences if they fail. The weather isn't the only thing causing dissension within the walls of the cabin- the discovery of immunity to the zombie virus has the group divided on how to move forward. Living with other people can be difficult during the best of times, but trying to hold it together in the apocalypse, can seem impossible.",
