  "description": "Dissecting Wobbles is Andrew talking to himself, and to you, at the same time. It's him remembering other times when he ran and jumped and landed on his face. It's about how his Mom searched for answers, and eventually found the big bad diagnosis.His story goes from early childhood, through the diagnosis and his weird and rebellious teens, then into 'adulthood' and his real decline, which morphed from a limp, to a crutch, to a wheelchair, to right here and now.Ultimately, Dissecting Wobbles is a book about what it is to be human. Andrew Marshall has walked a road seldom travelled, and he continues to push past barriers that would stop many people in their tracks. He tells his story in a voice rich with humour and wisdom, and in the process explores some of life's most complex philosophical questions.",
