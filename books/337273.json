  "description": "A queer retelling of Satan's fall that's part cozy coming of age and part fast-paced tragedy, with a little love story in between –In an eternal paradise, the most beautiful angel, Lucifer, struggles with shame, identity, and timidity, with little more than the desire to worship his creator.It isn't until the strongest angel, Michael, comes into his life that Lucifer learns to love himself. Along the way, their friendship begins to bloom into something else. Maybe the first romance in the history of everything.But this God is a jealous one, and maybe paradise is not paradise.",
