  "description": "Janie Lawson's life hasn't turned out quite the way she'd hoped. Nearly 40, she's in a marriage that has stalled with a mother-in-law she despises. Before Janie can make the final step toward divorce, her fate is taken out of her hands. Janie wakes up in her old bedroom and finds it just as it was in her teens. She stumbles downstairs to the kitchen where her mother greets her, looking radiantly young. But it isn't until Janie looks in the mirror, to be confronted by her 15 year old self, sporting the most diabolical 80s perm, that the reality of her situation sinks in. For a woman who scoffs at anything science can't prove, being swept back decades in time is a particularly ironic twist. She's gone back to 1981 and all the signs suggest that it's a one-way trip. But there's an upsideâ€”Janie has the chance to make her life turn out the way she wanted it. She's determined to help her parents, make her fortune, and do some good in the world, starting with saving Lady Diana Spencer from her fate. But things don't quite go to plan and pretty soon Janie realizes that even second time around, nothing is guaranteed. Clever and compassionate, this laugh-out-loud novel speculates the possibilities if you could turn back the clock and be given a second chance.",
