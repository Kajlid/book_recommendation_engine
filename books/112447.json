  "description": "Susie Duncan Sexton loves art, Doris Day, theatre, literature, William Faulkner, musicals, pop culture, Annie Lennox, classic television, movie stars, Kurt Vonnegut, thoughtfulness, kindness, love, wit, words, canasta, conversation, smoking, martinis, Mad Men and mad men, and most of all animals of all shapes and sizes, souls and temperaments. This grab bag of biographical influences (and more!) can be found here—look for the clues, play with the text, and enjoy the images and thoughts offered.In Susie Duncan Sexton's follow-up to Secrets of an Old Typewriter, she offers her second essay collection of provocative, funny, and heartwarming/heartbreaking observations. Entitled Misunderstood Gargoyles & Overrated Angels, this volume celebrates the underdogs and the unappreciated among us... and sets its sights on the hypocritical and the hyped among us as well. Through the context of a life fully lived—with an affinity for pop culture, an aversion to small town small-mindedness, and a passion for animal rights—Susie weaves a rich tapestry of punditry and advocacy.",
