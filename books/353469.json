  "description": "Rebel meets by-the-book businessman. Love doesn-t stand a ghost of a chance. A Karmic Consultants story. Jo Banks has been seeing ghosts since she was six, so normal was never really an option. Embracing the weird and shunning normalcy makes her the top Ghost Exterminator in her region. Then she meets Wyatt Haines, the uptight, materialistic and irritatingly sexy owner of a successful resort chain. Wyatt-s new Victorian inn is extremely haunted and the Commando Barbie Ghost Exterminator is just the girl for the job. Except Wyatt doesn-t believe in ghosts, or Jo, or anything outside the norm. He-ll have to start believing fast, though, because Jo-s extermination goes awry and accidentally throws two prankster ghosts into Wyatt-s body to haunt him. Every time he falls asleep, the mischievous ghosts take over, turning his perfectly ordered life into chaos. His waking hours are no less chaotic, with his thoughts possessed by Jo-s quirky appeal and Playmate physique. Unfortunately, Jo-s ghost-exing mojo is on the fritz just when she needs it the most to unhaunt Wyatt and figure out why his inn is swarming with ghosts. Preferably before his spirit is permanently separated from his mouth-watering body. And before her heart is permanently attached to the most sexy, frustrating, normal man she-s ever met. This book contains prankster ghosts, PG bondage, and a not-so-PG trip to the mile-high club.",
