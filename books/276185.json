Gold.And when he crosses paths with a traitor of the kingdom, he has a chance to get his hands on more than he ever could have dreamed of.There's only one rule: he can have everything in the hidden cave except a mysterious lamp.But Aladdin doesn't do rules. Just like he doesn't do princesses. Although...he's starting to change his mind on the latter.\nFor fans of Sarah J. Maas and Marissa Meyer, this is an Upper YA fairytale romance, an Aladdin and Rapunzel retelling with a dark twist on the original tales.",
