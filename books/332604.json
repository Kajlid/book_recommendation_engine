  "description": "Christmas in the backcountry of Tennesse is pretty slim for Haesel Moss and her family. When a homeward-bound soldier appears to help out, Haesel can't help but fall for him. Her mother is petrified someone will hang her for the witch's scar on her back, but her mark is far from wicked. Haesel faces uncertainty as evil lurks in the mountain mist. Will the handsome stranger guide her to safety or will his demon lineage lead her astray? This book is also available in Kindle Vella.",
