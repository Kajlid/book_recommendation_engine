  "description": "In 1950, a little boy is born to upper middle class parents whose roots are in the Great Depression. They are loving and nurturing and his father is a brilliant engineer who teaches through individual stories that amuse, enlighten, and ignite the curiosity of this bright little boy. Then his mother becomes addicted to prescription drugs and his parents divorce while he is in the 5th grade. His mother is awarded custody and over the next 5 years, he lives in 6 different locations and attends 5 different schools, including a military school. The years that should have built his educational and emotional foundation are wasted and he shows signs of psychological problems. By age 15 he can barely read.Then his mother admits she cannot raise him properly and he begins a new life, in the town where he was born, at an elite college preparatory school. He is back to where he would call home with his father and a new step-mother, but his struggles continue through college and a divorce of his own, until finally he finds true love and happiness.When his father dies from Alzheimerâ€™s, he realizes how little he knew of his parents and out of concern that the disease might be passed down to him, he writes these stories to his children. Many of them are oral histories with historical references or a recounting of stories from his father. They are told to his children in a relaxed manner befitting a conversation by the fire and you are invited to listen.",
