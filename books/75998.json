  "description": "The world has changed since Parry Pretty closed the Slipstream, but all is not back to the way it used to be. Parry is now trapped inside The Realm of Possibilities, uncertain if it is even possible to get back home! To make matters worse, a war has broken out between those who have joined with the Dark Lady and those who are against her. Now, clan is fighting clan, friends are against friends, and even Parry is having trouble deciding who to trust. For in the midst of it all, darker secrets are unfolding--secrets that those closest to Parry have known all along. In a place where islands float in the sky, mad Gnome Kings rule the underground world, and the shadowy Tarteareans soldiers roam freely in all the land, Parry must choose her path wisely if she ever hopes to return home once again and escape the prophecy that ties her to the Dark Lady.",
