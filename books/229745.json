  "description": "Nico had one goal at Again NewYork’s spaceport: to welcome her lover Heloise with flowers. Involved in a budding romantic triad and set to enjoy the rock concert of the galaxy with Damara Airship, what more could a young vampire want? But amid the intragalactic, Other-being, and human travellers, something every creature and person feared came in on the plane: faeries.  When the spaceport goes down, it’s any survivor of the fae incursion for him or herself, and Nico’s not going to let hoodlum wee folk stop her from getting to Heloise’s arrival gate. Until they do—repeatedly. It’s a bloody and deadly gauntlet run of Nico and Bear versus Darqueworld’s most feared boogeymen: the faerie kind.",
