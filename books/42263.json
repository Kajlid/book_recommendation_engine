  "description": "Combining political intrigue, time travel, family drama, and all the perils that come with being the first at anything, Hugo Award–winning author Philip K. Dick's Martian Time-Slip follows a group of exiled colonists on Mars and the ten-year-old psychic among them, a boy so powerful he not only looks into the future, but can send people there.\"The writing is humorous, painful, awesome in its effect on both mind and heart . . . There are few modern novels to match it.\"— Rolling StoneOn an arid Mars, local bigwigs compete with Earth-bound interlopers to buy up land before the UN develops it and its value skyrockets. Martian Union leader Arnie Kott has an ace up his sleeve, an autistic boy named Manfred who seems to have the ability to see the future. In the hopes of gaining an advantage on a Martian real estate deal, powerful people force Manfred to send them into the future, where they can learn about development plans.But is Manfred sending them to the real future or one colored by his own dark and paranoid filter? As the time travelers are drawn into Manfred's dark worldview in both the future and present, the cost of doing business may drive them all insane.",
