When Mousie is little, Mama sings him lullabies about the sky, repeats back his DA DA DEES and BA BA BEES, and reads him poems and stories about wonderful things like forests and bears. Then one day, on a playground next to the library, Mousie sounds out a word, then two, then three . . . and a reader is born!Inspired by the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation to read aloud to your children from the day they are born, here is a charming picture book that celebrates families reading together.",
