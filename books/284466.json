  "description": "Mike and his best friends, Triton and Brazon, had been plotting pranks at Zeek's expense for years. At first the stunts were jerking his chair away when he sat, dunking his head as he drank from the fountain, or hiding his clothes after gym class. But the game became more devious and dangerous. The night they dared Zeek to scale a corn bin, forcing him avoid a barrage of BB's from their guns, Mike decided he was fed up with the pranks. However, his evening became even more troubling when he was drawn to Zeek's home to silently witness a disturbing scene of abuse.
