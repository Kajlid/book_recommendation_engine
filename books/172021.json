  "description": "Who is Logan’s father? The question has been whispered behind his back all his life. He’s ignored it, forced himself not to care, but when Belos starts demanding an answer to this very question, it takes on a new and disturbing significance. As the race to answer this question begins, others rise in its wake, unearthing a mystery that could shake the very foundation of Earthmaker life, a mystery that could shake the whole world apart. But Astarti has more immediate concerns. Logan is in grave danger, and she’s desperate to get to him before he is destroyed--body, mind, and soul.",
