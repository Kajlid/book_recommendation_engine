  "description": "I knew today would be no different from any other. Not a single person remembered that it was my birthday. I thought about skipping school altogether, but I was already falling behind in Algebra and was dangerously close to failing for the year. The last thing I wanted was to be a senior again. I needed to graduate so I could move as far away from this place as possible and start a new life. There was only one thing standing in the way of my goal, and that was Mr. Knox.Hard Knox is book one in my Quick and Dirty Series. If you like a short and sweet story with instalove and a happily ever after, this book is for you. Be warned â€“ the sex in this raw and taboo. It is not for the faint of heart. Now dive in, you dirty little kitten.",
