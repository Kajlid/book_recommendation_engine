  "description": "Contains graphic sex, drug use, and violence. Not recommended for anyone under 18. Troy Donovan has it all; respect, legacy, and women. Men envy him, and women just want to be with him. All women except for Kaci Quinn. Kaci made the mistake of falling for Troy once when she was twelve. After finding him making out with her cousin she vowed never to fall for his games again. But how will they handle fate throwing them together as Troy tries to prove himself to the organization by avenging his mother's murder? Not to mention the news of an unwanted pregnancy. Will desire bring them closer than ever, or will fate tear them apart for good? \"I was a powerful man by birth. My life chosen before I’d taken my first breath, it was a blessing and a curse. Fianna Fáil owned Palms, Florida. Half the cops were on our payroll, and the other half weren’t brave enough to stand against us.\"",
