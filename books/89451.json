  "description": "The Bad-Girl and the Boy-Next-Door...After getting completely wasted at a wedding reception, bridesmaid Anna Hart wakes up in a strange bed and can't remember what she did or who she did it with. The stranger in bed with Anna is Brett Conner, a nerdy guy who she vaguely remembers from college, but only because everyone called him Clown Hair. Only Brett isn't quite as nerdy as Anna remembers. His clown hair is long gone and Brett is almost cute--and kind of sexy. Over the course of four weddings, in four cities, in one crazy summer, Brett and Anna start a mismatched relationship. But is there a future for the bad-girl and the boy-next-door?",
