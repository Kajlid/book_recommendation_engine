  "title": "Sweet Jones: Pimp C's Trill Life Story",
  "description": "A pioneer in the South's quest for respect in the Hip Hop world and one of the most colorful characters to emerge from the music scene which ultimately topped rap charts at the turn of the century, Chad \"Pimp C\" Butler's controversial life - and suspicious death in 2007 - left behind many unanswered questions, a family divided, and scores of talented new artists inspired by his group UGK's music. Sweet Jones pays tribute to the extremely talented - yet bipolar and complex - musician who embodied the Southern dream. Written by the founder and Editor-in-Chief of esteemed Southern rap publication OZONE Magazine and compiled from interviews with Pimp C himself, his mother and manager Weslyn \"Mama Wes\" Monroe, UGK rap partner Bun B, and hundreds of friends, family members, and collaborators like Snoop Dogg, Scarface, Too $hort, 8Ball & MJG, Jazze Pha, David Banner, Mannie Fresh, Paul Wall, Slim Thug, Trae, and Willie D of the Geto Boys, Sweet Jones is a must-read for any Southern rap fan.",
