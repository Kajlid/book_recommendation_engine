  "description": "This book is available at http://nutrition-for-children.weebly.com/The \"Web Edition\" of Nutrition For Children: Practical and To-The-Point is based on the Third Edition with several refinements. This book is a science-based comprehensive quick reference guide that is easy to read and will be useful for years as your children grow. It covers all of the known essential nutrients for which data is readily available, and all of the factual information is derived directly from the Dietary Reference Intake guidelines prepared by the Institute of Medicine and the nutritional data provided by the USDA.The approach taken in writing this book was to present as briefly as possible a comprehensive nutritional guide that is not oversimplified. It looks to food sources as much as is practical, given general food availability in the U.S.A., and suggests supplements when it is difficult to meet the DRI recommendations using these foods alone.",
