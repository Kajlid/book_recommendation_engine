  "description": "DISCOVER WHAT'S HIDDEN--a powerful, mythic race, an ancient Egyptian prophecy, and a love strong enough to shatter the boundaries of time. Alexandra Larson isn't quite human, but she doesn't know that. Lex simply considers herself an ambitious archaeology grad student with a knack for deciphering ancient languages. When she's recruited to work on her dream excavation, Lex's translating skills uncover the location of the secret entrance to an undiscovered underground temple in Egypt. She is beyond thrilled with what she's found...as is the enigmatic and alluring excavation director, Marcus Bahur. As the relationship between Lex and Marcus heats up, a series of shocking revelations leaves the young archaeologist reeling. Together, the couple is all that is standing between an ancient, evil god and the power to alter the very fabric of time. Events set in motion by a dying god over four millennia ago pull Lex and Marcus away from Seattle and into the heart of Egypt, where they learn that the fate of the world is in the hands of a single person: Lex.",
