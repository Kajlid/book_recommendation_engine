  "description": "Mishka, the five-hundred-year-old vampire master of the city of Cleveland, prides himself on having one of the largest covens in the Midwest. Although he has a life envied by many, the only thing he is missing is a mate. How to begin to find the right female for himself is a mystery, and the lonely nights are starting to get to him. Musical muse Harmony Celeste has been traveling the states for the last two years trying to find her beloved mate. After a vision showed her with a golden-haired male with fangs, she knows for sure that he’s a vampire, but his location is a mystery. With her band in tow, she visits every major vampire coven in the states and uses her muse power to not only feed herself but also, she hopes to find her mate. When Mishka and Harmony meet, sparks will fly, but they won’t be the only ones who notice. Human enemies have never stopped watching, and they take every opportunity to try to destroy vampires and those they love in the name of humanity. When Harmony is taken, Mishka knows it’s only a matter of time before she’s killed. This is a Wiccan-Were-Bear story with a vampire who has been alone long enough, a muse who likes to play, and an enemy who will stop at nothing until all vampires are wiped from the face of the earth. Expect fangs, blood, and scorching sex between a vampire and his beloved mate.",
