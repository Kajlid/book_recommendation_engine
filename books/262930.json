  "description": "When our unlikely hero runs into a murderer, he ends up killing the killer. Then he goes through his attacker's wallet and finds another shocker: an invitation to a party hosted by Errol Flynn. Errol Flynn? Isn't he dead? Intrigued, our hero crashes it - and discovers the Serial Killers Club. Its mission: share thrills and make sure members don't target the same victims. With aliases from old Hollywood, they include \"Tallulah Bankhead\", \"Richard Burton\", and soon, \"Douglas Fairbanks Jr.\", our hero himself. But \"Dougie\" isn't going to waste the innocent. Instead, he plans to knock off the \"stars\" one by one. And when they notice their numbers dropping, he'll have to answer a killer question: is he one of them - or not?",
