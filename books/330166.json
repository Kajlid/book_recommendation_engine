When a once-in-a-lifetime job on a tropical island comes up, she eagerly packs her parrot flip-flops and sets off.Expecting cocktails with tiny umbrellas and singing at dawn, Creena isn’t at all prepared to be stranded in the middle of the ocean on an island supposedly haunted by tree spirits!During her time on the island, Creena finds hidden strengths she didn’t know she possessed, and unusual ways of making friends. She even makes a scientific discovery about trees the world would love to know.If she feels a little chilly at night, that’s only to be expected—everyone wants someone to snuggle with at the end of the day.
