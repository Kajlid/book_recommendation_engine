  "title": "Voodoo Child",
  "description": "Often cited as one of the most innovative and influential rock musicians, guitar legend Jimi Hendrix had a short and turbulent life, succumbing early, as did many other rock icons of his generation, to pressures generated by the conflicts between their creative visions and the economic imperatives of the music industry. He died of an overdose in 1970 at the age of 27. This collaborative tribute to Hendrix, described by one of its creators as \"not so much outright biography as speculative fantasy,\" explores the excitement and the pitfalls of rock stardom sympathetically and perceptively.",
