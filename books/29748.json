  "description": "Journalist Sara Sinclair is still waiting for her big break. Until one night, she finds it—in the form of a little black book. A book containing X-rated details about an exclusive club where powerful political men play. It could be the story of the century—or it could be the last story Sara writes....Sergeant Rafe Delgado has no use for journalists...even one as hot as Sara. But once he realizes she's in danger, Rafe knows he's the only thing standing between Sara and a pair of cement shoes. Only now, there's nothing standing between them ...and Sara's about to learn that powerful politicos aren't the only ones with unbridled desires!",
