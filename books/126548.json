  "description": "Liam Dakota, a polar bear shifter, has never needed anything but a female to warm his bed. But all of that changes when he sees his mate up on stage stripping in front of a room full of men.  Olive Brownstone, a lamb shifter that has always been there for her brother, Holden, has had to sink to lower depths to make sure he is safe. When she's demanded to degrade herself by Trent, a sadistic leopard shifter, she has to submit or watch her brother die. But Olive and her brother have found a way to escape, and she now finds herself staying with Liam, the mate she has been pushing away since they first met.  But it is clear Trent isn't going to let Olive go, and that means Liam will have to go head-to-head with the leopard until only one of them is left standing.",
