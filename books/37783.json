  "description": "Perhaps it’s the fact that her puppy has grown to be twice the size of a normal German Shepherd and has started talking. Perhaps it’s that mysterious evil figures are searching everywhere for her and her family, intent on ending her life. Or perhaps it’s the fact that Scarlet Hopewell has just learned that she is one half of a prophecy that will decide the fate of two worlds, one that she didn’t even know existed. Whatever the reason, Scarlet Hopewell is having a very interesting year. The barrier that separates the magical and non-magical worlds is about to be broken and Scarlet is caught right in the middle. With an ancient wolf who she thought was her family dog, a wizened old Tounder (the elder of the Keepers of the Light), and her family, Scarlet will embark on a great adventure to learn how to wield magical power beyond her wildest imagination. But time is running out. An evil is rising in the south and he too will amass powers equal or greater to her own…and he has a head start. Before the end, her world will be destroyed, and the only hope for those that remain is Scarlet.",
