  "description": "On a foggy London night, Samantha feels a strange, dark inner heat which blossoms to a shocking lust which all-but consumes her in the middle of a crowded subway car. Yet none of the other riders see as she strips naked and begs to be used by a smirking young man. So begins her introduction to the world of vampires, to a world of enslavement, of uncontrolled lust and shocking cruelty. Samantha becomes a \"welf\", a sexually and physically enhanced slave to her vampire mistress, used by her, her human servant Geoffrey, and anyone else they choose. Every small spark of rebellion is mercilessly crushed by a woman who was old a thousand years gone, and whose sadistic cruelty is legendary. But Sam is determined to escape, determined to learn more of her new powers, and an innate magic she had never realized she possessed. With the aid of a roguishly handsome young vampire who makes her writhe with pleasure she must hold to her sanity and find a way to break free of the sadistic and perverted mental chains binding her.75,000 words",
