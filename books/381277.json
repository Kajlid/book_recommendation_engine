  "description": "A classic picture book featuring the beloved Harry the Dirty Dog! Harry is the not-too-happy recipient of a handmade sweater, and what makes matters worse is that it’s a sweater with a pattern of roses. Harry does everything he can think of to get rid of that sweater. But when it seems like he’ll never lose the sweater, an unexpected visitor helps him solve his problem… This is an irresistible story featuring a classic picture book character, especially perfect for young dog lovers and fans of  Harry the Dirty Dog .  Harry the Dirty Dog  has been recognized by the National Education Association as an all-time top-100 children's book. It has also been welcomed by a new generation at home, as Betty White's 2020 reading of the story on StorylineOnline has been viewed more than 8 million times. For more fun with Harry the Dirty Dog, don't miss Harry by the Sea and  Harry and the Lady Next Door. As Children's Books and Their Creators said about all three \"There is a droll, seemingly effortless union of art and text in the Harry stories, a delicious mastery of everyday foolishness.\"",
