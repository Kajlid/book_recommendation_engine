  "description": "\"An engaging, realistic journey into drug addiction and bad decision making. Grosso's Ferocity Summer is a riveting read.\"―A.S. King, author of the Printz honor book Please Ignore Vera Dietz Would you rather be dead and know it, or alive and not know it? Scilla Davis is haunted by a horrible accident that she was involved in last summer―a drunken, reckless joyride that ended in tragedy. With a big trial looming, life seems empty, unreal, and utterly hopeless. It’s especially painful watching her best friend, Willow, slowly destroy herself with pills and booze. Yet Scilla can’t seem to wrest Willow―or herself―from a path of self-destruction. But there might be a possible escape from this nightmare. As a dangerous new drug called Ferocity sweeps the nation, an FBI agent asks Scilla to turn narc and help locate the Ferocity kingpin. In exchange, she could avoid conviction for her role in the accident. All she has to do is deceive and betray people she’s known all her life . . .",
