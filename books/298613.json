  "description": "What I expected on Saturday morning: Books.What I got on Saturday morning: my ex-best friend and first crush in front of me.Let it be known that I, Holley Stuart, do not give a single rat’s behind about pro baseball’s star pitcher Sebastian Stone.I definitely don’t care that he’s standing in my bookstore.Nor do I care that he seems to have forgotten about the last time we saw each other—senior prom, when he both humiliated me and broke my heart, albeit unknowingly.Now, he needs a date to his sister’s wedding.Don’t ask me how I ended up being it, because I have no idea. But that’s the least of my problems.His grandfather is adamant we’re dating, and Seb isn’t in a hurry to convince him otherwise, so I have no choice but to go along with it.The problem? The only thing I’ve ever faked is… well, you know.I’ve definitely never faked my feelings for someone.And judging by the way I feel whenever Seb looks at me, it doesn’t look like I’m starting now",
