  "description": "When my brothers all but force me to go out with them the weekend before the school year begins, I don’t expect anything more than a few drinks and some laughs. What happens is better than I could’ve hoped for. I meet a strikingly beautiful woman who’s new in town. Our night starts with us laughing and drinking in the bar, moves to my bed, and ends with her disappearing into the night without any exchange of information. Monday morning, she walks into my calculus class and knocks the breath from my lungs. My one-night stand is now my student. Never one to cross the line and always one to play by the rules, I make sure to tell her nothing more can happen. But as time goes on, I start wanting to erase the line and throw the rule book out the window. Because even though it’s against the rules to be with her, I feel like, with Nova, I can find happiness again. But she deserves more than becoming my dirty little secret.",
