  "description": "Scrumptious as a cherry peach parfait . . . or a sinfully kinky foursome.The popular cooking show, Brunch with Laura, is T.S. Larkin's brainchild. Rather, it was. Because her boss couldn't keep it in his pants, Truly's unemployed and not sure what to do with herself. When a juicy tip leads her to the best-kept secret in Denver-three mouthwatering chefs whose restaurant image needs a makeover-her PR instincts start tingling. And her imagination simmers with private fantasies.Ever since the last woman he, Clay and Louis shared nearly ruined everything, Nate has worked hard to get things back in order. Truly's ideas could rescue their business, but her non-stop curves, luscious lips and cherry-on-top hair are a sure-fire recipe for another disaster.But when the ingredients are right, the reaction is inevitable. A kiss in the walk-in explodes into a wild night of indulging Truly's every sweet and spicy whim. She is the missing ingredient for the perfect foursome. Except Nate is suddenly not so sure he's willing to let the others lick the spoon, much less share.Warning: Explicit sex, bisexual m√©nage, delicious recipes, sexy chefs who like to share. Threesomes, foursomes, kinky food tastings, excessive use of shower toys and chocolate . . . Hungry yet?",
