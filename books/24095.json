  "description": "Enter a dark, gothic land of elvin assassins, mythic demons and dangerous women. In the world of Amrahlynn, magic is a constant and science has yet to gain a foothold on civilization. Roaming through this hazardous land is a misanthropic elf named Lusiphur. A wanderer without allegiances, Lusiphur (no relation to the guy down below) encounters demon-summoning wizards, bumbling thieves, serial killers, purple-festooned misogynists, and plenty of shallow love interests. This series of books, which collects one of the biggest cult-favorite comics of the 90s, is perfect for any fan of gothic fantasy or vampires.",
