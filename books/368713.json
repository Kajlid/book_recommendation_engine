  "description": "\"No Good Like It Is\" is a winding tale of violence, tolerance, and changing racial acceptance. In it, two hard-bitten Confederate cavalrymen barely survive the Civil War, riding with the famed Eighth Texas Cavalry. They then must struggle home to the Texas Panhandle, while accumulating enough misfits and strays to populate a small village. This rowdy historical fiction is filled with rich characters, both real and should-have-been. A sequel, \"What Goes Round,\" is in the works.",
