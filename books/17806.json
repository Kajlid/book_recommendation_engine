  "description": "The Gathering is called. The spell is cast. There is no escaping the Midnight Matings. When Ifan Vashnikov is summoned to the Great Gathering and learns of the plan set up by UPAC, he decides he'd rather go feral than be forced to take a mate. Before he can voice his decision to the elders, he finds himself mated. But his mating is not the usual mating. For one, he didn't drink the spiked champagne like everyone else, so he isn't in heat. Two, his mate is being protected for his own safety. Misha is a dreamwalker, the most powerful dreamwalker in over a thousand years. Because of that, he is being hunted. People want to use his powers for evil. Misha just wants to settle down somewhere quiet with his dream mate. When he's rescued and taken to the UPAC headquarters, he finally meets the man he has been sharing dreams with for over a year—the man he fell in love with—but Ifan doesn't seem to know him. When danger comes, Misha doesn't know whether to turn to Ifan or run for his life.",
