  "title": "The Zen Poetry of Dogen: Verses from the Mountain of Eternal Peace",
  "description": "Although best known for zazen meditation, Dogen felt that poetry could act as a complement to the enlightenment experience, and this collection beautifully confirms this belief. Dogen scholar Steven Heine provides clear and revealing translations that capture Dogen's unique voice, echoing the master's Zen naturalist and aesthetic philosophy. More than a collection of enlightened poetry, this collection will appeal to both students and non-students of Buddhism alike.",
