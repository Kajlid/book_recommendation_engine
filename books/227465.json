  "description": "One of the earliest examples of the classic murder mystery, Hoffmanâ€™s remarkable book has been the inspiration for a host of thriller and crime writers. Parisian goldsmith Monsieur Cardillac is a genius at his craft. Greatly admired throughout Paris, he is renowned for his works of exquisite and matchless beauty. So much so, that it seems the desire to possess his creations is enough to lead to murder. Composer, writer, and painter E.T.A. Hoffmann is an important figure in the German Romantic movement; he is perhaps best known as the author of The Nutcracker.",
