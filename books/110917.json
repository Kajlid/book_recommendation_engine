  "description": "Can he take on the mother and son challenge before she decides he’s not worth the risk? It’s tough going for single mom, Meagan Hutton. She has to keep up with an active three-year-old son, her job as bartender extraordinaire at Red’s nightclub, and her online college classes—all while doing whatever she can to make ends meet. Throw in paranormal activity of the creepy kind, happening with disturbing frequency in her home, and she’s struggling just to stay sane. The last thing she needs is a handsome, though hesitant, Marine sniffing around her or her son. Master Sergeant Mitchell Hebert, recently retired from the U.S. Marines, likes keeping things simple. He’s had an easy time of it, right up until a pretty barmaid with a Texas twang crept her way into every thought his last several months in the middle east. When they met a year ago, a relationship seemed promising, until he discovered she was a package deal. Turns out, her ex-fiancé, a fellow Marine who lost his life in Afghanistan, left her with a son to raise on her own…and a little something extra. Note from the author: The Halos and Horns series is filled with new characters you’ll love, along with frequent appearances of old favorites from my La Fleur de Love series. Enjoy! ~ Lori Leger ~",
