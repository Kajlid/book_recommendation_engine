  "title": "Valentine's Vindication",
  "description": "The dreaded day had arrived. And this year, February 14th had a dual meaning. Since his breakup a month ago with his boyfriend, Valentine Giovanni, Deke’s life seemed meaningless. What had he expected? The moment Val found out he’d cheated on him, the shit hit the fan . . . and Deke’s shoes hit the pavement.He didn’t have time to explain why he cheated, and Val wouldn’t believe him. Val deserved better, a submissive that completely trusted him, who’d commit wholly to his rough sex and demands. So rather than talk over his fears and insecurities, Deke forced a breakup by admitting he’d cheated.It was a painful scene, an angry, gut-wrenching, debacle that ended in a screaming match. Deke thought he’d feel relief when it was over, but every day was more dismal than the last, and all he felt was emptiness. He’d never loved anyone like he loved Val. He realized that now.And tonight, he planned to grovel and beg for forgiveness, prove his love to the man.WARNING: Bondage, submission, spanking, domination, submission",
