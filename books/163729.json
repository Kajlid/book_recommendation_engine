  "description": "... from the back cover of The Scientists...My darling husband has odd ideas of propriety.He thinks that having a non-writer do the backs of these books will keep the surprises from coming out too early. That is both true, and an essentially bad idea. People want to know what is in a book before they spend their time reading it.So, since I can say anything I want... here it is.1. The book explains exactly what and who we triples really are.2. It gives you the story of how Thunder Valley came into existence.3. It’s full of sex.The third point is not Pat’s fault. Neither is it mine, nor Jane’s nor Eowyn’s. Those two women were shown the events, I remembered the events, and Pat made the events into a story in the common language. We are the messengers only.I don’t mind that it is full of sex. I’m a triple. If any of you reading this are a triple, you know exactly what I mean. It is hard keeping it straight when you are always in heat... at least until you find the right two men to marry... isn’t that right?Now imagine you didn’t know you were a triple, because you were one of the first triples.Imagine that you could not understand why you had the impulses you were having as you reached the golden eighties.Would you be like twisted Shanta and Bria in the book?I’m sure I would have been.After my experiences in Ireland during the Rebellion, I went down a very dark road, for many years. It is only because my cowife Colleen is such a dear and generous heart that I’m finally rid of all that... all that. I don’t want to even talk about it any more.l just want to tell you that I’m going to see William again after all these years. Thank you, Jane. It’s going to be quite a month, or two, or... however long it takes.I hope you enjoy the book.-- Heather Shinehane-Tamelyn Conner",
