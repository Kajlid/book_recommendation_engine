  "description": "Roommates Kobi and Merin have a problem. They live in a carefree, utopian society where oppression and inequality have been eradicated, everyone has a say in the government, and everyone has plenty of food, clothing, and sex. The problem? Kobi and Merin harbor secret taboo desires, fantasizing about slavery and sexual domination. Through their computer networks, they begin to seek out others who share their desires. But when their society opens diplomacy and trade with a war-like, domineering culture, suppressed desires burst forth. Is it the end of the world as they know it? First published as a chapter-by-chapter serial in the magazine Taste of Latex, The Velderet left many readers unsatisfied when the magazine folded after only six chapters had appeared. After email entreaties from readers to finish the story, author Tan has brought the tale to a thrilling finish with six more never-before-seen chapters.",
