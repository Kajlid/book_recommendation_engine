  "description": "Found. Desired. Changeling.The Court of Frost is not meant for the feint of heart - or for a bumbling changeling and her human friend. Cress has found herself plopped smack dab in the middle of Alfheim, otherwise known as the Realm of the Fae. Which wouldn’t be such a bad thing - considering she has finally proven herself to be one of them - except she’s brought along her best friend who is most certainly 100% human.A spur of the moment announcement from Prince Roan, leaves Cress and the two remaining court heirs in a mess of a situation. As a potential crimson princess, Cress must somehow find a way to get through intercourt politics without getting herself - or her friend - killed.Only one person can play the game of Fae politics better than anyone else. If she wants to survive, Cress is going to have to rely on the one prince she hates the most - the Prince of Frost.",
