  "description": "Rosie was a fey-born in a magic starved-world, able to see the magic spark in others, but unable to see the intentions of her abusive boyfriend. Hatter was a lonely fey-born world jumper, able to manipulate himself and the worlds around him, but lasting connections in unstable settings eluded him. When he heard Rosie's psychic call, Hatter knew he had found a kindred spirit that he needed to help. Despite living in different worlds, and Rosie's worries that her new guardian angel was all in her head, the soul mates are drawn together across dimensions to save each other; and through their love unintentionally fulfill a greater magical purpose. In Madness and Wonder, their gifts begin the return of magic to Rosie's world that will take years, assuming they survive literally monstrous obstacles.  Madness and Wonder, like the rest of the upcoming Wonder series, is an erotic urban fantasy with horror elements and is intended for adults over the age of 18.",
