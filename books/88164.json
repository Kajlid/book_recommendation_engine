  "title": "A Razor for a Goat: Problems in the History of Witchcraft & Diabolism",
  "description": "First published in 1962, Elliot Rose's A Razor for a Goat is a study of witchcraft as a religion, whether the religion was a form of pagan survival or a depraved Christian or anti-Christian heresy. Rose surveyed witch-scares, fairy folklore, 'ritual' deaths, the Canon Episcopi & goliards for evidence for witchcraft, & to make some suggestions about the reality behind the popular beliefs on witchcraft societies & Sabbats. One of the first studies to debunk the dominant theory of the time that witchcraft had been an organized pre-Christian religion, A Razor for a Goat is listed on many anthropology, religion & history course bibliographies. Closely reasoned & written with a rare wit, A Razor for a Goat is a classic study & excellent survey of the literature & history of witchcraft.",
