  "description": "A cathartic hike becomes a dangerous race to solve a mystery... Imagine yourself deep in a forest. You notice your travel companions rifling through your backpack while muttering to themselves at half-volume. Unsettled, you retire to your tent where you find a mysterious key. You don't know what lock it might open, but you have a hunch the others will do anything to get it... Filled with intimate and visceral details about hiking and backpacking in national parks, Reagan's Ashes mixes the genres of amateur sleuth mystery, psychological suspense, thrilling wilderness survival, and action adventure, with a touch of romance. Plenty of twists and turns will keep you turning the pages to find out what happens.",
