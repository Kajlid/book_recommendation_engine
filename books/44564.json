  "title": "What I Did On My Midlife Crisis Vacation",
  "description": "Are you curious about spoon-bending, energy healing, communication with dead people, and the Big Picture of life? You're certainly not alone. This humorous, sassy and oh-so-honest memoir brings you along on a string of compelling adventures, ideologies and introspective moments in hot pursuit of magic, miracles, healing, love, and a deeper grasp of the metaphysical nature of our reality. In a delightfully unique style akin to \"confessional reporting,\" Debbianne shares with you her revelations and keen insights into human behavior as you meet colorful characters and occasional charlatans. She sorts out the wheat from the chaff, both within herself and in the wacky New Age world she's romping through, emerging clear-headed and self-empowered with inspiration to spare.",
