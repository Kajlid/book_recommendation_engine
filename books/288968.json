  "title": "Audra: Here she comes.",
  "description": "Philadelphia's homicide department is in search of a new writer, someone who has the talent to transform gritty detailed official documents into something the public can read. Audra, a broke novelist in need of a job, accepts the position of the unit's copy editor and social media manager. Even though she knows it will be a lousy idea, working for cops, Audra decides to take a leap of faith.  As predicted, Audra doesn't fit in right away, especially with prized homicide detective, Kamilia Arrowwood. Forming relationships with the detectives is not easy for the writer, which comes as no surprise. What is a shock? When someone from Audra's past ends up dead, and Detective Arrowwood has to solve a case that now hits close too home.  Brought together by their shared interest, can a hate-filled glare turn into a lustful stare? Or will this romance end in before it can even begin? After all, Audra's hot and cold, right and wrong, sensual and reserved, selfish and selfless. How are two complete opposites supposed to make it work?",
