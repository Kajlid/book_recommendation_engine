  "description": "China is a lovely young woman, the kind of beauty people write songs about or name stars after. She's as spectacular as Fourth-of-July fireworks and as striking as lightning, and Jim Floyd  the technical assistant to the crazed Professor Breckenridge  just got struck! In fact, he'd give China the moon if he could. Odd thing is, he can. So that's just what he intends to do. Spirit of Wonder is a delightfully touching tale by one of Japan's most respected manga masters.",
