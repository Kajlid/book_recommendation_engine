  "description": "My name is Holly O'Brian and I am a cautionary tale. I saw a sexy man across the bar, I let him walk me home, and now I'm pregnant. Obviously, I left out a few minor details, but I think you get the idea. I've lived a quiet adult high school librarian by day, book editor by night (glamorous, I know), and I was fine with it. I loved my jobs, I loved my cute little house...so why did I tempt the fates and go all cave woman over Dean Slade and drag him home with me by the hair (okay, that's a slight exaggeration)? Well, he is the most handsome man I've ever laid eyes on, it's true. He is broody and gruff and so, so sexy, also true. And the storm that hovers in his eyes, I can't help but want to be the calm to, at least for one night. So I guess there is no answer, I guess I followed my heart (a.k.a., my loins) and decided to spend a night with a sexy Marine. Only now I'm pregnant. And I have to tell him. And I have to let his family into my life. And I have to figure out how I'm going to make room in my schedule for a big, stupid, sexy Marine. Oh. My. Lanta, my life.",
