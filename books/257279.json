  "description": "In the opulent town of Northwynne, where everyone sees everything and rumours spread like wildfire, Cheyenne Fator wishes not to be seen at all. Afraid that people will be able to look past her facade of perfection, she tries to hide her scars underneath. But when a familiar face shows up with secrets from her past that she doesn't remember, her life is flipped upside down. If she breaks down her walls and tells her friends, she might love everything she worked so hard to protect. Will she risk letting them find out what goes on within the four walls of her house or will she push them away and face her challenges alone?",
