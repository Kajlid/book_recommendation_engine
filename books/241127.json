  "description": "Danny, a college student with long hair and an androgynous look, wears his sister's sorority shirt to class one day. Living the life of a loner, Danny had few friends and was easily ignored by everyone in classes. However, several people, who were unaware of his existence, notice Danny in the sorority shirt and assume that Danny is not only a girl but a member of the sorority. What happens to our intrepid hero as the school year continues. When some of the sorority girls want to befriend Danny, they create a study group. The sorority girls make it their mission to cure their new tomboy friend. As his new friends work to feminize him, Danny reluctantly accepts certain changes in clothing and personal grooming. But, he seems oblivious to the major changes all around. The girls need to take him shopping. How will the sorority deal with this new/unknown sorority member? This is a nice story where Danny learns about friendship, loyalty, love and certain truths about himself. Crossdressing, reluctant feminization, gynecomastia",
