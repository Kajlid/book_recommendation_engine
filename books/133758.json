  "description": "The world has hardened. Opportunities are few and dwindling. Society has changed, and not for the better. Every day robots and machines replace humans in the workforce, not just in the most menial jobs, but also throughout the cubicles of the corporations that dominate the cities. Peter Harkness is one of the few humans lucky enough to still have a job, and works next to automatons all day long. How long will his job last? What secrets do the roofs of the city have waiting for him? Peter is left wondering who his allies truly are in this near-futuristic dystopian world, reminiscent of Asimov, Heinlein and the golden age of science fiction.",
