  "title": "And Still the Earth",
  "description": "Welcome to Sao Paulo, Brazil, in the not too distant future. Water is scarce, garbage clogs the city, movement is restricted, and the System--sinister, omnipotent, secret--rules its subjects' every moment and thought. Here, middle-aged Souza lives a meaningless life in a world where the future is doomed and all memory of the past is forbidden. A classic novel of \"dystopia,\" looking back to Orwell's 1984 and forward to Terry Gilliam's Brazil, And Still the Earth stands with Loyola Brandao's Zero as one of the author's greatest, and darkest, achievements.",
