  "title": "The Provocateur",
  "description": "For years, rumors, myths, legends, facts and fictions have circulated the globe about the connection amongst all things. Crazed babblings of radical notions about government, wealth, and those currently in power have been dismissed as nothing more than conspiracy theories. But what if they were all true? As the Vangranel family finds out when a young stranger moves into their home, the answer to that question couldn't be more frightening... or more provoking. The Provocateur invites the reader to traverse through a normal family's home and life as it slowly becomes more perverse, eccentric, and ultimately devastating. A thought-provoking ride through the mind of the titular character, Michael Stephenson has woven a tapestry of bizarre fact and fiction as the novel calls for you to be provoked or defiant. You must take this enthralling journey along with the Vangranels and... be changed forever.",
