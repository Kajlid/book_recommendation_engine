  "description": "BACK COVER TEXT: Sex, Drugs & Rock-n-Roll with a hefty twist --  a ride on this mom's skateboard tops any rollercoaster On the morning of May 17, 1995 Beth dropped off her 14-year-old daughter, Zoey, at school on the way to work. That afternoon Beth received a phone call from her daughter’s father, Eric, informing Beth he had taken Zoey out of school and checked her into an out-of-state lock-down drug rehabilitation facility. Eric added, “I’m not telling you where she is.” It is this day and the following 1,100 days until Zoey’s high school graduation and emancipation from her father—when Beth could legally be with Zoey again—that moves Beth to open the book of her life. In this true crime memoir, to avoid prosecution and up to fifteen years in prison, Beth signs away her right to parent Zoey and to have any contact with her. You will read Beth’s journals and correspondence, including the letters she writes to Zoey and keeps on her closet shelf in bags marked with the year written. Beth muddles through a range of fear, shame, anger, and remorse, until she stumbles onto the path to recovery while immersing in Seattle’s Post-Grunge music scene and Poetry Slam, working with the skateboard industry, and reveling in her new-found sex goddess role. Ultimately she involves in a calling to regain her spirit. \"Clips & Consequences\" is a fervently rollicking ride. Hang on to your hat.",
