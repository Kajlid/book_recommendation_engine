  "description": "A Florida beauty who hides her stunning good looks. A childhood friend who’s made a career of seduction. A thrilling story of mystery, secrets, and romance—as only New York Times bestselling author Suzanne Brockmann can tell it…Sunrise Key native and aspiring private investigator Frankie Paresky has her first bona fide case—a client has hired her to find the missing heir to a priceless property. But there’s one Simon Hunt, her best friend’s brother and a notorious heartbreaker, insists on being Frankie’s assistant. For Frankie, even Simon’s street-smart know-how isn’t worth the cost of dealing with his distracting good looks and overactive libido. But Simon’s on a mission to prove he’s not the man Frankie thinks he is. The truth is, he’s been dreaming about Frankie since they were teenagers, and not one woman on his endless list of conquests has managed to stop him. But he needs to work fast. Because the real Frankie—every gorgeous inch of her—isn’t under wraps anymore, and a stranger is already moving in.From the Paperback edition.",
