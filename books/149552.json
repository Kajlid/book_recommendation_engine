I have lived amidst the untamed wild of the rainforest, in a society that reveres me and where every woman falls before me in subjugation.Now I’ve been discovered. Forced to return to a world that I have forgotten about and to a culture that is only vaguely familiar to my senses.Dr. Moira Reed is an anthropologist who has been hired to help me transition back into modern society. It’s her job to smooth away my rough edges… to teach me how to navigate properly through this new life of mine. She wants to tame me.She’ll never win.I am wild, free and raw, and the only thing I want from the beautiful Moira Reed is her submission.She wants it, I am certain.I will give it to her soon.Yes, very soon, I will become the teacher and she will become my student. And when I am finished showing her body pleasure like no other, she’ll know what it feels like to be claimed by an uncivilized man.",
