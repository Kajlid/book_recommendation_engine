  "description": "They think I can’t remember… What they don’t know is I can’t forget.The car accident should have taken my life, but it only took my memory. At least for a little while. But I’m keeping that part a secret.I know who did this to me. And when I get my chance to ‘start over’, I end up at Bay Falls High, in the same building as those who tried to hurt me. I remember everything. They still think I can’t. It’s my turn to lie.It’s my turn to plot. It’s my turn to set up an ‘accident’ … or three. I have help from someone nobody would ever guess..I’m going to break them. One by one. Even if they each tell me they’re falling for me. This isn’t the game they think it is. It’s kill or be killed. And I’ve survived. I now own these m*therf*ckers.",
