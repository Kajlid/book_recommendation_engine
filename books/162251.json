Some years later, in a world in which civilization is faltering, with a climate that grows harsher and wilder with each passing season, he no longer sees the sense in his ordered existence, and feels that he is working towards nothing. With his fianc√©e Tina, who has distant roots in Brazil, he steps out of his conventional programme and they set off on a voyage of discovery to South America.While they are away, rioting and crackdowns at home in England cut them adrift from their country. Fate brings them together with their friends from around the globe and these carefree and irrepressible misfits, a generation in microcosm, acquire a camper van and journey among the myriad landscapes and cultures of the South American continent in search of a place where they can ride out epic world events, while absorbing the wonders along the way.",
