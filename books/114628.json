  "description": "Millie is unlike most other cows.  She chews her cud and grazes in the fields with the others, but she doesn't enjoy that nearly as much as she loves scaring the mail carrier.  It's too bad the mail carrier doesn't have as much fun each time Millie comes up with a new way to surprise him.  Who knew delivering the mail was going to be such a difficult job?Reading Level: 4 and up",
