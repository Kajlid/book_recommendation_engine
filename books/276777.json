  "description": "In Sorrow, Cinderella is much more than a forgotten stepdaughter and chimney sweep. She is a girl with dreams of a bright future, despite the hardships she faces at home. Told in her own perspective through letters, poems, journal entries and more, Cinderella learns how to stand up for herself, how to reclaim her future and how to face her fears. She not only dares to dream of love and freedom, this Thornskinned Heroine dares to reach for it. Through a detailed re-imagining of classic fairytales, Saiteru presents a fresh, fully realized take on our favorite heroines.",
