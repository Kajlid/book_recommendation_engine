  "description": "In the 2nd Century AD, Rome's Ninth Legion was sent to Hadrian's Wall in northwest Britain to quell an insurrection. They were never heard from again. Historians have speculated for centuries about what happened - THE LAST FREE MEN presents one intriguing possibility as seen through the eyes of Marcus Gettorix, son of a Roman general and a British woman. Marcus is an undercover scout for the Romans, but during a battle he is captured and sentenced to work in the mines with the rest of the native prisoners. The Druids act to use Marcus as a figurehead to fan the flames of resentment into an insurrection that joins British and Scottish tribes against the Romans. Now allied with the Druids, Marcus lures the ambitious Roman general in charge of the Ninth Legion into a deadly trap destined to create one of history's greatest mysteries.",
