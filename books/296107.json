The garden is full of an assortment of flowers, especially a certain flowery group made up of an orange Tulip; a Violet flower, a white Orchid and a very tall and beautiful Sunflower. Rosaline has been bullied by the flowery group since she budded out of the ground. It has made Rosaline very sad, she doesn't like herself anymore and does not enjoy her daily activities as she used too. One day a swarm of Bumblebees arrives to collect pollen from the flowers, well all but one bumblebee. Bobbee the Bee is different from the other bees. He has a short-wing that makes it difficult to keep up with the other Bumblebees. Bobbee befriends Rosaline and notices how badly the other flower's treat her. Bobbee stands up against the annoying flowers and explains to Rosaline what it means to be different and they quickly become buddies.This inspiring and emotional story is the perfect way to explain to your child how much bullying affects a person. It is a way to show children how to be empathic to someone being bullied. It also shows how a bit of compassion and concern from a buddy can do so much for someone being bullied.",
