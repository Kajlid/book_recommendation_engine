  "description": "The alternative scrapbook that documents a baby's truly important memories.Millions of people think children are the cutest, cuddliest, most wonderful, saintly creatures in the entire world. These people do not have children. They have nice things. They collect fragile pottery. They have candlelit dinners in fancy restaurants. They go to the movies. They have white carpets. People with small children haven't been to a restaurant without plastic silverware in years. The last movie they saw in a theater is now on American Movie Classics. Their house looks like it was decorated by Pee-Wee Herman. Baby's First Tattoo is for them.For years parents have been buying baby books to document all the precious moments in their new baby's life—Baby's First Tooth, Baby's First Haircut, Baby's First Step. What have been ignored for too long are those “alternative” precious moments that really should be written down, celebrated, and remembered—Baby's First Projectile Vomit, Baby's First Tantrum in a Crowded Grocery Store, Baby's 10,000th Dirty Diaper. Otherwise you might forget them and think of becoming parents once again.",
