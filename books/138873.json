  "description": "An intimate look behind the scenes and into the life of a professional athlete: Jason Wagner has worked his whole entire life to have a chance at getting his name etched on the Stanley Cup. Being a hockey player is all he knows, it’s all he’s ever wanted to be, and for as long as he can remember, it’s all he’s been. Fast-forward to now: He's almost thirty, has just finished his last season on his NHL contract, and has yet to hoist Lord Stanley’s Cup. His fear of being forced into an earlier than anticipated retirement briefly subsides when he signs a two-year, multimillion-dollar deal with a real contender. The events that follow take him in different directions that ultimately put him onto a new path of discovering who he really is and what he actually wants to be in life. It’s a tough and gritty love story about change, family, and forgiveness.",
