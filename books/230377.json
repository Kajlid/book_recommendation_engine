  "description": "Arthur Beauchamp is Vancouver's leading criminal attorney. He's also an alcoholic with an unfaithful wife and a desperate need for solitude. So when he turns his back on his life and settles down on an island off the Pacific coast, it looks like a premature but very permanent retirment. Then one last case draws him back. The dean of law at a local university is charged with the sadomasochistic rape of one of his students. The evidence against the defendant is overwhelming. And he's lied again and again—to the police, his therapist, his attorneys.If anyone can save him, Beauchamp can. But first Beauchamp has to save himself—from the memories of his painful past and the torment of his inner demons. And then he has to face the choice that has haunted him throughout his career: does he serve his client—or tell the truth?",
