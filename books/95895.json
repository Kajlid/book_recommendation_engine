  "description": "Shannon Hunter, an eco-terrorist member of the elusive Earth Liberation Front (E.L.F.) discovers real elves bent on more than petty sabotage...Plunged into the a world teeming with magic she never really imagined to exist, Shannon discovers the terrible reality left to both Mankind and herself. The Elves have decreed - \"Mankind stands upon its own terminus, heedless of ruin\" - and its high time the real protectors of nature strike back.The only person able to do anything to prevent a supernatural war mankind cannot hope to fight; Shannon must find a way to overcome her misanthropic ways, and prevent the Elves from making a mistake that threatens not only Mankind but all life on earth.The contemporary fairy tale, \"E.L.F.\" is set in a dystopian vein, somewhat akin to the Harry Bates' classic, \"The Day the Earth Stood Still\", only fantasy, not Sci-fi, and with far more epic action.",
