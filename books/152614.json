  "description": "Does true love, love at first sight, really exist, or is it just a figment of our imaginations, a fairytale? The Girl Who Made Me Sing tells the story of a naive young man who had an obsession to find true love as described in fairytales and be able to sing a song that uplifts those around him. He embarks on a spontaneous love affair that allows him to believe again and fulfil his long-term obsession. The Girl Who Made Me Sing takes you on an emotional roller coaster and highlights the missed chances and possible regrets we all had. It allows you to remember that special moment when you first found true love and the devastation of a heartbreak. But most importantly, it gives you the Hollywood ending we all dream of.",
