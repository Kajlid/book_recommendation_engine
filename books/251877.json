  "description": "Excitement, danger, and falling for the man of her dreams all have Grace Under Pressure. College professor Grace Michaels has enough on her plate with her research, her ex-fianc showing up in town, her parents parking their RV in front of her house, and her attempt to entice her sexy neighbor, new sheriff, Ren Morello, into having an affair, when someone breaks into her house and office. Ren wants nothing to do with Grace. So what if she looks like a pinup girl from the 50s or that every time shes in his vicinity, he sports a hard-on? She is a woman who would demand commitment and after his nasty divorce from his cheating ex-wife, Ren wants nothing to do with marriage. All he wants is hard fast sex. The problem is, the only woman he can picture it with is Grace. When the threats to Grace turn almost deadly, Ren finds himself in her company more often than not, and keeping his hands off her becomes impossible. But as the danger grows closer, the attraction grows deeper, and Grace must choose between protecting her heart or her life. Warning, this title contains the explicit sex, graphic language.",
