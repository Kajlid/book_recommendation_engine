  "description": "An enlightening \"intellectual biography\" of Lincoln, Allen Guelzo's peerless account of America's most celebrated president explores the role of ideas in Lincoln's life, treating him as a serious thinker deeply involved in the nineteenth-century debates over politics, religion, and culture. Written with passion and dramatic impact, Guelzo's masterful study offers a revealing new perspective on a man whose life was in many ways a paradox.Since its original publication in 1999, Abraham Redeemer President has garnered numerous accolades, not least the prestigious 2000 Lincoln Prize. As journalist Richard N. Ostling has noted, \"Much has been written about Lincoln's belief and disbelief,\" but Guelzo's extraordinary account \"goes deeper.\"",
