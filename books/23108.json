  "title": "Escaping Entry",
  "description": "Entry used to be a pleasant city, rating as high as fifth on Malcolm Tebby’s annual list of places to visit if you couldn’t afford to go anywhere nice. But then a plague came, and just like that, the cobblestone metropolis, known for its bell towers and strangely uncomfortable benches, became a ghost town. For seventeen year old Billy Stun, plague survivor and blossoming artist, Entry is an exercise in boredom, so when an eccentric nobleman named Harold asks him to be his personal photographer, he agrees. Harold, though, is not normal, and when Billy discovers part of his job is taking photographs of Harold murdering creatures of legend, it isn’t long before he begins pining for the eerie quiet of home.",
