  "description": "‘Welcome to Dark Haven Finishing School for Young Ladies’, read the old sign. Beneath the inscription, presented like a rather frightening crest, was a hand-painted picture of a riding crop and a school cane, crossed like a pair of fencing swords.  From the book:  To Dee, the whole thing suddenly seemed to be happening in slow motion. She watched as the guard moved to one side of the frame, and began to haul on the rope. Her arms began to raise. She staggered forward as they were drawn higher, mesmerised by the dreamlike absurdity of the entire scenario. This was like a scene from one of those old Arabian Nights movies she had watched on Saturday mornings all those years ago; the one where the damsel in distress ends up bound and at the mercy of the evil overseer. Her mind told her this couldn’t be real; it was too ridiculous. How could she suddenly find herself starring in one of those movies; movies that had stirred her imagination in such strange ways? Oh, how she had stared at those beautiful heroines as they struggled in their bonds; how she had gasped at their labours as they recoiled from the terrifying whips of their tormentors. They had seemed so helpless; so vulnerable. They had seemed so striking, so … so sexy? So turned on?  Welcome to Dark Haven … where nothing is as it first seems.   This is Book 3 of the ‘Slaves of Dark Haven’ Series. These tales are intended for mature readers only (18+) as they contain themes of a sexual nature. You have been warned!",
