  "description": "In the System of Federated Nations, a new religion is growing fast. The Electric Church offers eternal life - the only catch is, you've got to be killed first. Millions have had their brains placed in advanced cybernetic bodies, making them immortal. But rumour has it that the new converts aren't quite as willing as the Monks make out.Avery Cates is a low-life contract killer, prepared to slit anyone's throat for a few measly Yen. But even he gets the heebie-jeebies from the plasticised, eternally-serene stare of the Monks. He'll have to come face to face with them soon enough though, because Cates is on the run from the System Cops and can only redeem himself by taking out the head of the Electric Church. That's if the gun-toting, super-augmented cybernetic Monks don't get to his own head first . . .",
