  "description": "Sometimes, to see the eyes of your greatest enemy, you need to look into a mirror.In this final chapter of Mitch and Eden's story, everyone will be tested. Morality and honor weighed against getting the job done. But desperation can make people do things they never thought they’d be capable of. And returning from hell is a pretty damn big wake-up call, especially once Mitch realizes that the woman he loves has been in a different kind of hell…and she can’t get out of it.*** STRANGE CASE is the conclusion of Mitch and Eden’s story and may prove confusing to those who haven’t read the first two books. This novel is intended for adults. It includes lots of cursing, biting sarcasm, descriptive sex, and some seriously bad team morale.Other books in this trilogy:Hyde, an Urban Fantasy (Book I)Jekyll, an Urban Fantasy (Book II)Dear reader,Although Strange Case marks the end of this trilogy, it isn't the end of the Hyde world. Thank you for your support and for taking a risk on a series that can be crude and cruel but is, at its core, a love story.Go to my website and sign up for my newsletter to receive an announcement when the book is available, as well as a deleted scene between Mitch and Eden (it's a dramatic one btw)www.ReadLaurenS.com",
