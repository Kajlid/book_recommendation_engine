Her mother and sister were annoyed that they were going to have to take her place on the charity boards and foundations she sat on in her family’s name. Her father could change that by just taking back his demand. She knew he wouldn’t do that. So Tiffany was going to live her life the way she wanted.Tiffany and Ace Fentonworth don’t have the best first meeting, or second, or third, but each time she ends up in his arms with his mouth on hers.

He knows the only way he’s going to figure it out is to spend more time with her.But could they work past their assumptions about each other and find out why they couldn’t stay away from each other?",
