  "description": "What is the Bastard Bachelor Society?It’s a  gentleman’s club—like the dignified men of the past used to have.Except, we’re not gentleman, and we’re not dignified.We’re ineligible bachelors; bored, jaded and not looking for relationships. Quite the opposite actually… We’re so committed to being single, we’ve created a high stakes bet to see who can remain single the longest. Rules are involved. Prizes.Laugh it up, but I’m no loser. Enemy number one to my single status? My irresistible neighbor, Abbott Margolis. She with her evil cat Desdemona, and Sexy AF pencil skirts. She’s kind and beautiful and hilarious. We can’t get involved, no matter how much her meddling grandmother pushes us together. But if I was going to lose this bet for anyone? It would be for Abbott. Let’s face facts: I’m a bastard, unwilling to settle down. Especially when there’s a bet to win.",
