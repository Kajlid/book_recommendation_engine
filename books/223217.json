  "description": "Why is the government deliberately destroying all trace of Man's past? Why are the laws of gravity and momentum strangely altered? Why has the world's population continually increased without the predicted eco-crisis taking place? Why is there an international conspiracy to conceal the future of the human race? These are just some of the reality-shattering questions that face Manalone, a brilliant computer scientist, when he tries to find out exactly what has happened to humanity. Manalone, outcast from society, must fight the entire machinery of a ruthless police state to discover the truth. And the truth is an awful, chilling one, that sounds only too real in today's world.",
