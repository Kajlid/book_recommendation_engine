While she was learning the ins and outs of the fashion industry, her friends were getting ready for senior year. Settling back into her old life proves to be harder than Chloe thought. As much as she tries to fall into her old routine, she can't help feeling left out and left behind. Chloe is ready to realize her dream of being a designer, but deciding on a fashion school is another story â€” especially when that means deciding between California or New York. And when she agrees to design dresses for Winter Formal, the pressure grows even more intense. Can Chloe handle the stress of senior year and figure out what her future holds?For ages 9-12.
