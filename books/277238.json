  "description": "The fires are lit. Everyone take a seat. It's time to paint the cave walls. What story should we tell? How about the time our warriors fought a flock of pterodactyls atop a brontosaurus? Or when the Pathfinders were ambushed by a pack of bloodthirsty raptors? Or what about Jawinger and his showdown with the T-Rex? Would that scare the children too much? Maybe. But perhaps a hero's story will inspire them. Do I really have to choose one? Why not tell all of them? These events happened at the same time. Triumph, then tragedy, then victory. A grand tale. I'll need lots of red. Grab my palette, it's time to get to work.Chapter 1: Harvesting the GiantChapter 2: Raptors AttackChapter 3: FeastChapter 4: QuakeChapter 5: Terror of the T-RexChapter 6: King of the ValleyChapter 7: Closing the GapChapter 8: Golrata's ShadowChapter 9: Final AttackChapter 10: EruptionHope you enjoy the adventure.
