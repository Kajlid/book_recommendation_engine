  "description": "A New York Times Business Book Bestseller\"Shrewd and optimistic. . . . [ The Good Life and Its Discontents ] combines first-rate analysis with persuasive historical, political and sociological insights.\" — The New RepublicToday Americans are wealthier, healthier, and live longer than at any previous time in our history. As a society, we have never had it so good. Yet, paradoxically, many of us have never felt so bad. For, as Robert J. Samuelson observes in this visionary book, our country suffers from a national sense of entitlement—a feeling that someone, whether Big Business or Big Government, should guarantee us secure jobs, rising living standards, social harmony, and personal fulfillment.In The Good Life and Its Discontents , Samuelson, a national columnist for Newsweek and the Washington Post , links our rising expectations with our belief in a post-Cold War vision of an American utopia. Using history, economics, and psychology, he exposes the hubris of economists and corporate managers and indicts a government that promises too much to too many constituencies. Like David Reisman's The Lonely Crowd and John Kenneth Galbraith's The Affluent Society , the result is a book that defines its time—and that is sure to shape the national debate for years to come.\"A smart, balanced epitaph for an era—with a few clues for what's ahead.\" — Business Week\"Lucid [and] nonsectarian . . . Samuelson traces how the reasonable demand for progress has given way to the excessive demand for perfection.\" — The New York Times",
