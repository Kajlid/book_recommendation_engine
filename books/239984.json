  "description": "KAIJA   With my background, you’d think I’d know how to avoid trouble by now - but it finds me anyway. Harlan’s got me all twisted up and he’s not what I want at all…  He’s high-handed, your typical arrogant athlete, too damn good looking... And I go up in flames whenever he so much as looks at me.   HARLAN  I’d put her out of my mind, or tried to at least. One impulsive encounter. One taste, and I’ve got it bad.  Something about Kaija makes me think about everything I never thought I wanted. Fast and free has always been the name of my game, but this woman…  She comes with her own playbook.  A hockey player and a head-strong woman walk into a bar...  Who comes out on top?  Ache For Me is a 45,000 word standalone romance with an HFN, explicit sexual situations, and no cliffhangers.",
