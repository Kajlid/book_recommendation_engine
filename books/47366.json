  "title": "The Heretic",
  "description": "When Domincan monks raged through Spain in the early 1400s, their message to Jews was clear - convert or die! Gabriel Catalan's father was one of those who converted. Years later, after the violent death of his father, Gabriel secretly returns to his Jewish roots and becomes, in the eyes of the Catholic Church, a heretic. Gabriel's wife Pilar is horrified at the danger he has brought to his family. The Dominican monk Friar Perez is sent to Seville to uncover and arrest secret Jews. Gabriel Catalan becomes his prime target. Gabriel and his son Tomas learn about Gutenberg's new printing process and set out to print Hebrew books to save the legacy of Spanish Jews before it is burned by the monks. Tomas falls in love with Esther Ardit, a Jewish girl who is forbidden to one who is outwardly Christian. The story is set at a time when the Moors still controlled Granada, and Prince Hasan becomes a steadfast friend of both Tomas and Esther. Desperately trying to cope with political and religious upheaval, Queen Isabel is drawn inexorably to instituting the heresy trials of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite the fact that both Gabriel and Tomas have become her allies and strong supporters, Friar Perez is intent on bringing both to the torture and death by fire that awaits a convicted heretic.",
