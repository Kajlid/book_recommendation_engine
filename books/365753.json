  "description": "A roughneck, redneck, and brawler, Jebediah Shaw had a wild streak wider than a country mile when he left home, and he was happy to have a war to fight. Now, battle scarred and weary, he's returned to the girl of his dreams and the small East Texas town he calls home. Jebediah is anxious to start the \"real life\" he'd promised himself in the desert of Iraq.",
