Together, they discover the fine line between duty and justice.Commander Draylon Aravaid doesn't hide his lineage as the emperor's son but doesn't advertise his origins either. Loyal to a fault, he relies on his hard-won reputation rather than his family name, which his duplicitous father uses to full advantage.Prince Yarif DiRici trained his entire life to become a consort in an arranged marriageâ€”all while secretly yearning for love. The death of his father and older brother suddenly thrusts an unwanted crown upon his head, and Yarif into a whirlwind of dangerous plans within plans as he and Draylon are forced into marriage.The political game is set, and Yarif is kidnapped. It's up to Draylon to mount a daring rescue to prevent all-out war.The two men must get past each other's mistrust, find common ground, and defeat an enemy neither knew they had...and may not survive!",
