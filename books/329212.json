  "description": "An exciting addition to the New York Times bestselling Stone Barrington series.Dumped by his glamorous Russian girlfriend during dinner at Elaine's, and running low on cash, Stone Barrington is having a bad week. So his luck seems to be improving when he's hired to locate the missing son of a very wealthy man. Lucky because the job pays well, and because the son is hiding in the tropical paradise of Key West. But when Stone and his buddy Dino Bacchetti arrive in the sunny Keys, it appears that danger has been lying in wait. Stone very nearly loses his life after being blindsided at a local bar and realizes that the young man he's been hired to track may have good reason for not wanting to be found.Suddenly Key West is looking less like Margaritaville and more like the mean streets of New York...Librarian's note: the characters, settings and other information for the first 25 books in the series are complete as best possible (corrections are welcome!) for: #1, New York Dead, 1991; #2, Dirt, 1996; #3, Dead in the Water, 1997; #4, Swimming to Catalina, 1998; #5, Worst Fears Realized, 1999; #6, L.A.
