  "title": "Epic: The Story God Is Telling And The Role That Is Yours To Play",
  "description": "We don't usually identify with the author of a great story. Instead we bond with the hero and heroine-the ones that the story is about . We share in their heartaches and triumphs. We cheer their accomplishments and mourn their losses. When we think about our own story, we may see God as the author-an omniscient and omnipotent cosmic mastermind-but fail to recognize Him as the central character. In Epic , a retelling of the gospel in four acts, John Eldredge invites us to revisit the drama of life, viewing God not only as the author but also as the lead actor, exploring His motives and His heart. Eldredge examines the power of story, the universal longing for a \"plot\" that makes sense deep inside us, our desire for a meaningful role to play, our love of books and movies, and how all of this points us to the gospel itself. It's a story better than any fairy tale! Our human hearts are made for great drama, and the gospel, with its tragedy and grandeur, truly is epic. Also available as an unabridged audio on CD, as well as hardcover Spanish edition.",
