  "description": "These are two standalones, now available together for the first time ever. The Tie That Binds is Daniel and Alyssa's story told from Alyssa's point of view, while Serendipity is written from Daniel's point of view. The recommended reading order is The Tie That Binds first, and then Serendipity.Book 1 - The Tie That BindsWhen Alyssa Moriani loses her father, she's faced with an impossible choice: fulfil her father's last wish and marry Daniel Devereaux, her best friend's older brother... or lose her father's company to the one person that'll burn everything she's worked for to the ground.Her marriage to Daniel was never meant to be more than a business arrangement. They were never meant to be so perfect together, and they were definitely never meant to fall in love. After all, they started their marriage with an end date in sight.Book 2 - SerendipityYou've read Alyssa's side of the story in The Tie That Binds. Now it's Daniel's turn.I thought I could stay away from her.I thought wrong.What was I supposed to do when I found out that Charles Moriani's last wish was for me to marry his only daughter? I owed the man everything - he taught me all I know and took on the role my late father was unable to fulfil, never asking for anything in return.Until now.The choice was easy to make. Too easy, perhaps.I tried to make myself believe I married her for honourable reasons, but nothing could be further from the truth. Alyssa was never meant to find out how I feel about her. She was never meant to end up in my bed. And she was definitely never meant to love me back.",
