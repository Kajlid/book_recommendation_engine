That is when Joy was born, into a planet that has lost its own magical loving light. When Joy begins his adventure he finds the beings of Water-Bright frightened and lonely, sad and angry. They had forgotten about friendship. They had forgotten about courage and who they are. Joy embarks on an adventure to restore courage, friendship and magic to the world.",
