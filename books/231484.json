But one can't escape one's inner nature - or in Mandy's case her high IQ. Drawn to brains as well as brawn, Mandy searches for that elusive package that contains both an intellect to match her own, and an appetite for steamy abandon that's downright indecent.The S'expert is a detailed, dirty-talking, cerebral sexcapade of a relationship on the cusp of creation. Fall in love with Mandy as she falls head over heels for 'The S'expert', in an astoundingly-erotic, brain-feeding, life-affirming literary spectacle.(Originally published as 'The Violin's Puppeteer', this 27,000 word erotic romance came second in the novella section of the BDSM Writers Con 2016 Golden Flogger Awards)",
