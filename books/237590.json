  "description": "“A sensitive look at the social and political barriers that deny disabled people their most basic civil rights.”— The Washington Post“The primer for a revolution.”— The Chicago Tribune“Nondisabled Americans do not understand disabled ones. This book attempts to explain, to nondisabled people as well as to many disabled ones, how the world and self-perceptions of disabled people are changing. It looks at the rise of what is called the disability rights movement—the new thinking by disabled people that there is no pity or tragedy in disability and that it is society’s myths, fears, and stereotypes that most make being disabled difficult.” —from the Introduction",
