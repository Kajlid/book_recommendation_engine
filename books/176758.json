  "description": "It's the end of the road for the Merc with a Mouth! First, our red-clad hero is stalked by a classic Spider-Slayer! Wait, this isn't a Spider-Man book. Deadpool had better fi nd out what's going on before it mashes him into spider-paste! Then, inverted by the events of Axis, Deadpool puts down the guns...and goes Zen! So how can he possibly save his friends from an attack by the also-inverted X-Men?! In the aftermath, Deadpool takes a relaxing vacation to the Middle East, clashes with Omega Red, journeys into the Tomb of Scariness with Shiklah...and battles the revenge-crazed ULTIMATUM organization! Oh, and he dies at the end. Is that a spoiler? COLLECTING: DEADPOOL 35-44, 250",
