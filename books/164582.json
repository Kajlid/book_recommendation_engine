  "description": "In the dark world of mollies and incubi, who can Damon really trust? Incubus and prostitute Damon Snow wants nothing more than a repeat of his last fateful visit with his long-time patron Byrne. Not that he’d actually admit that. Week after week, Byrne’s door remains closed, until Damon discovers he’s not the only one paying Byrne a bedside visit. Even Damon’s only friend Rogers seems ready to discard him if he ever does get into Damon’s pantaloons. So when a dapper rake reveals himself as an incubus and offers to teach Damon how to bend men to his desires, Damon is quick to take him up on his offer, even if it means breaking a few of his own rules. But the rake has a secret of his own, and men keep disappearing around him. In a world of only users and the used, who can Damon really trust? Here’s what reviewers say about Damon’s first lesson in Nocturnal  4 Stars “One word kept coming to mind as I read the Darling. It was hot and sweet yet realistic, giving you the darker emotional side of being a Molly. I cannot wait for Damon’s next lesson.” ~ Wicked Reads 4 Stars “Part romance, part erotic, part mystery, and part suspense, and totally intriguing. I thought this was just going to be some erotic short story, but instead I got a lot more.” ~ Sharing Links and Wisdom 4 Stars “The story, while short, develops wonderfully and kept me engaged.” ~ Wicked with Ink If you love a mysterious, erotic and deviant historical romance novella, download Incubus Rake now.",
