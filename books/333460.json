  "description": "After the tragic death of his fianc√©, twenty-two-year-old Damon brings a dozen white roses to the cemetery to adorn Viktor's gravestone with. When his tears fall on the petals, a mysterious voice thanks him and offers him a unique gift in return. Viktor has the miraculous chance to come back to life for twelve days, albeit with some drawbacks from the fatal attack. Nevertheless, Damon is grateful to even have the love of his life back, even if temporary.Unfortunately, Viktor's new state means he can't be seen in public without a disguise, especially not by his grieving parents. He can't even see his own reflection because it's forbidden and goes against the conditions of the gift. This complication puts his happiness at risk because he might not like what he sees in the mirror, and it's something that needs to be avoided at all costs.Damon must make a difficult decision. A sacrifice of some sort is the only way to permanently restore Viktor's life beyond the twelve days and bring him back to normal, but it comes with untold consequences that Damon must blindly accept. Will he make that sacrifice, or will he face losing Viktor forever?",
