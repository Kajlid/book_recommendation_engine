  "description": "Paul Remmich sweated while he slept. His subconscious mind spun traitorous thoughts to control his actions and satisfy his handler’s quest for secrets. He’s powerless to refuse.The US Army acquires a new top-secret energy source. News of this discovery leaked into the wrong hands, Iraq’s Tariq'Allah. They offer Captain Eric Miller a bribe to participate in espionage for a kickback. The military intelligence officer refuses. This clandestine encounter leaves one of the foreign emissaries dead.The lethal outcome forces Miller to flee Stockholm and take refuge at a US Army station in Germany to work with his West Point friend, Captain Paul Remmich. But the pursuit is renewed, and the Iraqi agents devise a new strategy to achieve their goal that ups the ante. Then Remmich makes a crucial mistake that plays into the Iraqi agents’ hands. Remmich now functions from a controlled personality while his true self lies dormant. His colleagues are oblivious to his duplicity except for Miller, who senses something is off.\"The taller, older man motioned toward the pile of money with his left hand, and his partner’s eyes followed. As the two looked down at the bundles of cash, Miller stepped to the side and quickly pulled the 9mm out of his coat’s inner breast pocket. The short thug with the silencer looked up and turned as Miller fired two rounds in quick succession.\"All that stands between the agents and their prize is intrigue, twists, and high-octane confrontation. If you like deception and determination, you’ll love this tight, fast-paced adventure.",
