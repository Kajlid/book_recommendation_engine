  "description": "In Love by Design is the third volume in The Adventures of Anabel Axelrod series.  Anabel Axelrod returns...but the sexy, blonde bookstore owner with a sassy attitude and a brain that never stops doesn't get to prove what a fabulous girlfriend she'll make for even one day before Luke disappears out of town. Let the troubles begin! Instead of getting to enjoy being a girl passionately in love, Anabel’s shiny new feelings and trust in her boyfriend are immediately put to the test. Who is the powerfully charismatic Luke Drake? What are his dark secrets? Does he really love Anabel, or has he been coldly manipulating her feelings to further an intricate design of diabolical revenge that has been in the making for years?  In Love by Design finds the confident Anabel desperately beginning to wonder if she’s wrong to believe in her incredibly hot, yet very tricky boyfriend. Or is this one fairy tale where love cannot conquer all?  Author’s note: Please read A Date with Fate, Courted by Karma, and In Love by Design sequentially for the most pleasurable reading experience. This series is not written to be stand alone books.",
