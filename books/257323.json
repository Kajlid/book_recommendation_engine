After being crowned the Gods' heroine, she must now become their emissary. For centuries, the Gods have been isolated from the human world, which threatens their immortality. Hope becomes their best chance at eternal survival and she's sent off on a quest to find the Fountain of Youth. If she fails, she loses everything...but winning may very well mean the same.",
