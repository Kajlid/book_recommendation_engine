  "description": "On the surface, Peter McAllister has a good life: a good school, good friends, good times. So what if his best friend is a girl -- and sort of a geek? And so what if she might be more than a friend.Underneath, it's a different story. It's been years since the death of his parents landed him in this small town with his hardly-there uncle, but he still feels as if his life in Clarksbury is just an inch deep. Does he really belong? Only Rosemary seems real. But that reality comes crashing down the first time he kisses her -- and she rejects him.Then a mysterious woman named Fiona appears. She tells him he's a changeling -- a fairy child left to live in the human world -- and that it's time to come home. Can Rosemary convince him that Fiona is lying? Or is it possible that Fiona is telling the truth?",
