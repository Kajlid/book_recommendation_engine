  "description": "Keita thought being a princess was nothing but trouble even before Stygians took over the Spectra kingdoms. Her abilities, including changing to animal form, are nothing against the Stygians, who hold abilities from all six clans. Trying to change her life would require facing Jasper Smelt, a former friend who insists he wants to keep her safe, though his dungeon and fiery threats suggest otherwise. How can she face someone who fears everything...except her?",
