  "description": "Anna quit the London police force because it was a dead end for women, but her job with Brierly Security isn't a whole lot livelier, and her assignments tend toward the frustratingly genteel. The Jackson case doesn't look like a big improvement. Ambitious, unpleasant young Deirdre Jackson has died, the apparent victim of a car accident on a lonely stretch of highway, and her parents want to know what their black-sheep daughter was up to. But the more questions she asks about Dee's life, the more questions arise about her death. Answering them could land Anna in the hospital or the morgue. But it could also be her ticket out of the pink-collar ghetto.",
