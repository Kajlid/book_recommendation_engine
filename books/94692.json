  "title": "Bisexual Vegetarian Zombies",
  "description": "An homage to B movies (e.g. Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Santa vs the Martians, etc), this is a social/political satire wrapped up in a zombie parody. Tara and Ken are looking for important issues to add meaning to their shallow lives. After accidentally becoming infected with the Zombie virus they find themselves out of their depth in a struggle between vegetarian zombies and the more aggressive brain-eaters. Can they adapt to their new lifestyle? Can they find a way to save mankind? And most importantly, why do they like watching Fruit of the Loom commercials?",
