  "description": "“I would welcome a friendship with Lynne Hinton. I would welcome an invitation to sit down at her table, but mostly I would welcome her next book.”—Maya Angelou   Lynne Hinton’s beloved bestselling classic, Friendship Cake,  is a beautiful, poignant, and funny novel of five small-town women friends that offers inspiring life lessons in faith, love, strength, survival, and community—as well as a host of delicious Southern recipes! A heartwarming delight reminiscent of Jan Karon’s New York Times bestselling Mitford books, Friendship Cake , in the words of Rita Mae Brown ( Rubyfruit Jungle ), “will give you plenty to chew over. Delicious!”",
