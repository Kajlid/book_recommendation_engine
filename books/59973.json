  "description": "Leothius Hollen arrives in Presque Isle, Maine, home of the dragon rulers, to investigate the murder of the mage ambassador. The last thing he expects is to run into the sexy as sin guy who stood him up when he was in gryphon territory. No, that’s not true, the really last thing he expects is the guy is actually King Gundhram. Wait, nope, the absolute last thing he expects is that Gundhram is his mate. What did he do to the universe that the guy who humiliated him, turns out the be the guy he has to spend the rest of his life with? Gundhram never wanted to rule, but the death of the mage ambassador left his sister in a bad spot, and he returned to Presque Isle to help her deal with the mage inquisitor sent to investigate the murder. How much did karma hate him that the inquisitor turned out to be the guy he’d rejected ten months earlier, but couldn’t get out of his thoughts? Or that this hotter than dragon fire mage still singed his scales like no one else. Finding out they were mates, however, was the ultimate pay back.",
