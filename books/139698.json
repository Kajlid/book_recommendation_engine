  "title": "The Four Sectors Wars",
  "description": "Six hundred years into mankind’s unexpected exodus from Earth’s solar system due to a prematurely exploding sun, humanoid species have spread far and wide to form a trans-galactic empire. This is in part due to the pioneering genius of Frakas and his bioengineering prowess which allows humanoids to accommodate to new planets readily. It is also secondary to special pod ships and spirit ships left behind by long dead civilizations that allow for teleportation across massive chasms of spacetime. But the empire is torn. War rages in four sectors. The gods of war governing each sector want to unite the entire kingdom under one banner, theirs. But each of the sectors has unique challenges and pitfalls that stymie the other warlords, maintaining a stalemate seemingly without end. Enter Raikin and his entourage of followers. In his teens, he is the youngest of the hundred year clones to intervene in celestial matters, and he may also have his hands the most full. Will he and his followers be enough to upset the stalemate and bring peace to the universe? Or will the intense fusion of cutting edge science and magic he introduces to the equation simply spread these battles beyond this universe into parallel universes, and the multiverse as a whole? More ominous still, there appears to be outside forces influencing matters in the four sectors beyond anyone’s knowledge or ability to grasp. Some of the tech bequeathed to them by long dead civilizations may have a life and a mind of its own, begging the question, are these distant parties relegated to history, or just to a dimension beyond their current reach?",
