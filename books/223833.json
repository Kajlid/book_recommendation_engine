  "description": "Tegan Raccini's heart has been hardened her parent's divorce, and by the recent loss of her bad boy biker lover to a life-long prison sentence. She isn't bitter; in fact, she's rather upbeat. But, she simply doesn't trust men. When she causes an accident with a motorcycle on the freeway, she's immediately attracted to the handsome biker, but knows she can't stand another heart break. Even though she's unemployed, she agrees to pay for the damages, hoping to never see him again. To earn the money for the repairs to his motorcycle, she accepts a job as the in-home caregiver for an elderly man who is confined to a wheelchair. There's one problem when she shows up at his home. A BIG problem. He's the biker's father. ROUGH is a stand-alone MC Romance with no cheating, no sex outside the relationship, and no cliff hanger. It has an HEA, and although it is book II of a series, no other book is required to tell this tale. For the complete experience, and to understand the ancillary characters fully, reading HARD before ROUGH is recommended.",
