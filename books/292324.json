  "description": "Levi McCoy took me under his wing when we were kids. He was my protector. My best friend. My everything.And I was sidekick.We stayed close, even when relationships and life in general tried to tear us apart.Years later, he landed an internship at Montague Enterprises, competing with my childhood nemesis, Conner Daniels, for the final coveted position.That's when things got messy. The two bargained for the official job offer, using me as their pawn.And I fell for it. The scheming. The stolen kisses. The late night texts. My heart was being torn in two, and neither one of them cared. All good things must come to an end, right? Except our ending was one I didn't see coming. Hell, it should've never started in the first place.",
