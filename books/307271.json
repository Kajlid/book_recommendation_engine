  "title": "TRANSFORMATIONS: A Whimsical Medusa Tale",
  "description": "This is an irreverent retelling of the Medusa myth from her point of view. Though the story takes place 1400 years B.C., the telling is modern; anachronisms of speech are acceptable, and often intentional. While the following story was researched, it does not slavishly follow the mythological legend. I, the author changed the story to suit the plot. Hollywood does the same thing all the time.",
