  "description": "I just wanted an easy summer job…That didn’t happen. Now, I’m in a living nightmare as I work alongside this monster of a man with mesmerizing emerald eyes that look at me inappropriately every time I see him. To add insult to injury, he has a tan I just want to lick, and a butt worth drooling over every time he purposefully walks by me. But, he's an asshat, and looks are everything. I mean, aren't. LOOKS. ARE. NOT. EVERYTHING. Why do I have to keep reminding myself of this?His job is to clean, cook, and tend to the house we work in. That's why I call him the manservant. Oh, and because it drives him nuts. That's what he gets for torturing me. This is a story of little restraint, too much desire, questionable actions, no strength whatsoever, and the best sex I've ever had.The question is: Do I fall for this crude manservant whose idea of a fun time is to tie people up and do obscene things, or do I give him a taste of his own medicine?All I'm going to say is . . . Things get weird, then hot, then weird again, and—you get my drift.Go ahead and laugh. It might not be so funny if it happened to you.",
