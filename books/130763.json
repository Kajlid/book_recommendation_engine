  "description": "Children are disappearing in the deep forest high in the California Sierras. ‘Kidnappers’, is what the sheriff believes, but Lucy Doran knows better! She saw the elf-man in the woods that day, not to mention the horrible sight she saw in the window the night she baby-sat!Unfortunately, she can’t get anyone to believe her...least of all, her best friend, Candy English. Lucy finally begins to doubt herself. Maybe it was in her wild imagination after all. Will Lucy learn too late that you must become your own person, not a follower, and stand up for yourself if you know something is not right? Or will she be the meek follower and get led into trouble...trouble so bad she might not ever get out!",
