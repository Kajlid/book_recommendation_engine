  "description": "The Collected Poems of one of the world's greatest living writers, Tomas Tranströmer, now available in this comprehensive edition.In day's first hours consciousness can grasp the worldas the hand grips a sun-warmed stone.Translated into fifty languages, the poetry of Tomas Tranströmer has had a profound influence around the world - an influence that has steadily grown, and now attained a prominence comparable to that of Pablo Neruda's during his lifetime. But if Neruda is blazing fire, Tranströmer is expanding ice. The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems gathers all the poems Tomas Tranströmer has published: from his distinctive first collection in 1954, 17 Poems, through his epic poem Baltics (\"my most consistent attempt to write music\"), and The Sad Gondola, published six years after he suffered a debilitating stroke in 1990 (\"I am carried in my shadow / like a violin / in its black case.\"), to his most recent slim book, The Great Enigma, published in Sweden in 2004. Also included is his prose-memoir Memories Look at Me, containing keys into his intensely spiritual, metaphysical poetry (like the brief passage of insect collecting on Runmarö Island when he was a teenager). Firmly rooted in the natural world, his work falls between dream and dream; it probes \"the great unsolved love\" with the opening up, through subtle modulations, of \"concrete words.\"",
