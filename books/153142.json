  "description": "from the back cover: \"When, late one night in bed, I finished Within the Palace Gates, I could hardly wait until morning to open my Bible and read, with new understanding and excitment, the book of Nehemiah. Anna Siviter, by weaving the rich tapestry of the Persian court as a backdrop for the story of Artaxerxes's noble cup bearer, allows us to graps the deep significance of Nehemiah's devotion to God, to Jerusalem and to his people. \"It's a lovely story, hard to put down, but far beyond its lively plot, is its sacred focus. At the end, I stood right beside old Ezra, willing Israel to hear God's call and build a new nation committed to His will. And I heard it as a call to my own heart. You will too.\" -June Strong",
