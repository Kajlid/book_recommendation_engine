  "description": "Torn apart by lies and a hail of bullets… Georgia Randall is a government-trained killer with nothing left to live for except the burning need for revenge. She’s lost everything she cared about, including the only man she ever loved, and now her past has caught up with her. Shadowy enemies are on the move, determined to silence her before she can kill her remaining targets. But when the man she’s been mourning suddenly turns up to confront her, Georgia must face the consequences of the lies she told to conceal her double life. And even if she wins him back and survives what’s coming, she knows a happy ending isn’t possible for someone like her. Only revealing their darkest secrets can bring them back together. Against all odds, notorious assassin Miguel Bautista clawed his way back from the brink of death. Now he wants answers. For months he’s been tormented by the devastating truth about the one bright spot in his dark and violent past: the woman he fell in love with was nothing but a lie. When he learns she’s in danger and is offered the chance to save her, he signs a deal with the devil to protect her. They already lost each other once. If any of what they shared was real, this time he’s not letting her go. But if they’re going to have a prayer at a future together they must first evade the enemies closing in on them—and fight to stay alive.",
