  "description": "Still in the thick of the Chūnin Selection Exams, the student ninja unleash their signature techniques as they spar in a series of one-on-one elimination matches. The heated battles bring out a new side in many of the opponents as they fight to advance to the third stage of the test and, in some cases, struggle to survive! Naruto looses an explosive new move on his foe—but will it be enough to win? And when Hyuga clan members Neji and Hinata are pitted against each one another, will old family grudges make their duel even more vicious than the others?",
