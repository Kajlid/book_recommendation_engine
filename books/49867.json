  "title": "Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary",
  "description": "Doctor Dolittle and the Green Canary is a Doctor Dolittle book written by Hugh Lofting. Although much of the material had been printed originally in 1924 for the Herald Tribune Syndicate, Lofting planned to complete the story in book form but never finished before he died. Lofting's wife's sister, Olga Michael, completed the book and it was published posthumously in 1950. Everything except the first and last chapter are by Lofting. Much of the material in this book is repeated from the earlier novel Doctor Dolittle's Caravan; and tells the story of the Doctor's friend Pippinella the Green Canary, in slightly greater depth.",
