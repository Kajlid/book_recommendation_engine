  "description": "Thirteen-year-old Esi is reluctantly on her way to London, England. After many happy years with Grandma in Ghana, she is joining Maggie, the mother she hasn’t lived with since the age of six. Her move to London, not only forces Esi to deal with challenges she’s never faced before, but it brings up lots of questions about Solomon, her absent father, and Maggie - the answers to which in the end change her life. A compelling, family drama about faith, friendship, relationships, overcoming difficulties and the resilience of love, Looking Up will be enjoyed by older children and adults alike.",
