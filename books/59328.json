  "title": "A Foxfire Christmas: Appalachian Memories and Traditions",
  "description": "This captivating book of recollections celebrates the holiday traditions of Appalachian families as passed from one generation to the next. Based on Foxfire students' interviews with neighbors and family members, the memories shared here are from a simpler time, when gifts were fewer but perhaps more precious, and holiday tables were laden with traditional favorites. More than just reminiscences, however, A Foxfire Christmas includes instructions for recreating many of the ornaments, toys, and recipes that make up so many family traditions, from Chicken and Dumplings to Black Walnut Cake, and from candy pulls to corn husk dolls and hand-whittled toy cars. The students who created this book attended Rabun County High School, where the innovative Foxfire program originated, in the mountains of northeast Georgia. They conducted the interviews, shot and developed most of the photographs and edited the final manuscript.",
