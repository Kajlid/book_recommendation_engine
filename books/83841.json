  "description": "Things are always a little wonky in the small town of Pine Oak, Florida. But lately reporter Sue-Ann McKeown, feels like every crazy thing is landing on her desk. For starters, a former mental patient demands that Sue-Ann write his story—or else. But why her? What is the meaning of the new coded messages she hears on the local pirate radio station? And why has her new girlfriend quit her job and left town for parts unknown? Her investigations lead her behind the walls of a mental institution and into a secret compound in the woods where broken ex-soldiers hide from the world. And, oh yeah, Sue-Ann’s post-traumatic stress syndrome—a souvenir of her time reporting on the war in Iraq—is kicking in again. This is the second book featuring Sue-Ann, who is not only a reporter, but a champion archer and talented dressage rider. She is forced to use all of these skills to get her life back on kilter and bring some semblance of normalcy back to Pine Oak. Bonus. The e-book version of this novel also contains Chapter 1 from the next book in the Small Town Series, Secrets in Small Towns.\"",
