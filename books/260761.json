  "title": "Exhibitions: Tales of Sex in the City",
  "description": "Steamy sex is in the eyes of the beholder―for some, it means doing it in public, where the risk factor heightens the pleasure potential. The protagonists of the stories in Exhibitions take that idea one step further by bringing sex out of the shadows―brief yet thrilling encounters in public, from well-known venues such as the Sistine Chapel, the Sydney Opera House, and London's Picadilly Circus, to a church in Vienna, a cemetary in Paris, a steambath in Istanbul, and a night train in New York. These sexy tales, which feature straight, gay, and pansexual scenes, are imbued with the exotic sights and sensations of their locales, and share a belief in the intoxicating power of sex and its various manifestations. The collection is, above all, an erotic traveller's guide for tourists and armchair travellers alike, for whom sex is defined only by its possibilities. With a foreword by Debbie Stoller, editor of Bust magazine and co-editor of The Bust Guide to the New Girl Order . Contributors include Thomas S. Roche, Lawrence Schimel, Marcy Sheiner, M. Christian, Leo Cullen, Nell Carberry, Robin Metcalfe, Ron Smith, Simon Sheppard, Natalee Caple, Stan Persky, and Jean Smith.",
