  "description": "Dylan thought he was an average man, with a dead-end job and no great aspirations. When he finds a black book with peculiar words and markings, he discovers the universe is bigger than he imagined. The Guardian of Earth, who kept the book and its immense power safe from falling into the wrong hand, was killed. Now Earth needs a new Guardian. The battle to protect the book begins early for Dylan as he must rely on his newly discovered powers to defeat the creatures sent to take the book. Dylanâ€™s life is sure to be full of adventure, danger, and magic. To protect his book and the world that now relies on him, he must learn to survive on a foreign world, fight fierce horrors beyond imagination, master the magical arts, and ultimately battle a dark god who has already destroyed one world.",
