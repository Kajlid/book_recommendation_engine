  "description": "TA is a model for understanding human personality, relationships and communication. It was first developed by Eric Berne. Since then, TA has continued to grow. Theory has been expanded, reappraised and tested by observation. In the years since Berne's death in 1970 TA practioners have introduced new concepts and techniques that are now at the very heart of the discipline. TA today enjoys international recognition as a professional approach, aiding effectiveness in fields as diverse as psychotherapy, counselling, education, communications and management training.",
