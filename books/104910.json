  "description": "He trains men for war…\nThe only thing Sergeant First Class Reza Iaconelli cares about is taking care of his men and making sure they’re ready for the next combat deployment to the Surge in Iraq. Nothing will stand in the way of him taking care of his soldiers — especially not some direct commission captain who doesn’t even know how to put on her body armor. He has no idea what she’s even doing in the Army, other than getting under his skin.\nShe’ll fight for his men…\nArmy Captain Emily Lindberg knows one thing about the Army and that is it is terrible about taking care of its Soldiers. She may not know much about the Army but when Sergeant Iaconelli attempts to tell her how to do her job, she’ll stand up to the big NCO and dare him to be better than he thinks he is. Behind the angry exterior, she sees a man who’s hiding — using war as a means to escape the demons from his past.\nHe needs her more than he knows…\nWhen one of his soldiers commits suicide, Reza faces his toughest challenge yet. As his efforts to remain sober start to fail, he’ll need to find the strength to ask her for the one thing she alone can give him — and it may be more than he’s capable of.",
