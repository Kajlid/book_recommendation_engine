  "title": "Words to Win: The Making of Amar Jiban: A Modern Autobiography",
  "description": "The first autobiography in Bengali was written by an upper-caste rural housewife called Rashundari Debi (1809–1899). Published when she was 88 years old, Amar Jiban (My Life) is a fascinating first-hand account of life for women in Bengal at that time. Mother to eleven children, Debi reflects on her experiences and her spiritual development across almost an entire century. Words to Win incorporates translations of major sections of this remarkable autobiography. Tanika Sarkar studies the making of an early modern subject – the woman who wants to compose a life of her own, who wishes to present it in the public sphere and eventually accomplishes her goal: for it is her words that win out in the end.",
