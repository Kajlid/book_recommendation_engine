  "description": "The exciting beginning chapter of the H.A.R.T.S CEOs series. Follow five devastatingly handsome best friends and business partners on their roller coaster rides to find the women who break them, tame them, save them, teach them and most of all, love them.  The day my mother overdosed when I was fifteen, I made a promise to myself that I would leave my past behind and not let it define my future. Even if that meant leaving behind my one true love, singing. With time I slowly built a life for myself where my days were filled with school and my nights volunteering. Months after graduating college, a lucky chance landed me the position as the personal assistant to the gorgeous billionaire CEO of H.A.R.T.S Marketing and Advertising firm, Reece Knight. He brought me into a world of limousines, private jets, world traveling and nights (and days) filled with indescribable pleasures I never thought I would know. I began living a life someone like me could have only ever dreamed about. A life I wouldn't give up at any expense, even if it meant denying myself once more of something I loved. But while Reece spent his time trying to help me get over my fears, I realized my past wasn't as far behind me as I thought.  WARNING:This book contains strong language and graphic sex scenes. Enjoy! ;)",
