  "description": "The year is 1970 and Elaine’s adventure in Greece began as she enrolled in a course for the Greek language in the city of Athens.  She had been teaching in a Greek-American elementary school in Brooklyn and the Greek teachers there often spoke so enthusiastically about their native country that she decided that she’d love to see it for herself.  Learning a bit of the language was a must since the few words and expressions she had already learned in her school were a beginning but certainly not enough, especially if she planned on a month’s stay. She luckily found a girlfriend who was happy to go with her and share her experiences.  Their introduction to the language was full immersion style and although at times they were discouraged, they were determined to learn all they could and then try it out on the locals whenever they got the chance.  Fortunately, they met wonderful people who took time to help them explore the incredible city of Athens,. The Greek islands that they visited captivated them and led them on interesting adventures.  And during their stay the mythical Zorba whispered in their ears, “Enjoy!”",
