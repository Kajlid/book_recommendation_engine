  "title": "The Secret Order of the Gumm Street Girls",
  "description": "For seven years, bad luck has followed Ivy around like a dog on a leash. Her father disappeared, her mother is a washed-up beauty-pageant winner, and now Ivy and her mother have moved into a ramshackle house on Gumm Street. Ivy's new neighbors--bookish Pru, stuck-up Cat, and wannabe adventurer Franny--are worse than unfriendly. But then a mysterious pair of ruby red slippers turns up, and the four girls are swept away...not to OZ, but to the jaw-droppingly strange lands of SPOZ, and SPUDZ, and OOZE, pursued by the fashionably mad Cha-Cha Staccato, who bears a frightening resemblance to a certain wicked witch....Ages: 8 -12",
