  "description": "The title doesn't pertain to gore and violence, but fun plot twists. The twists are designed to act like 4x4s boards striking you across the side of the head. Sorry! Did that hurt? These stories also move quickly and range from humor to thriller and plenty in-between. It's a fun, fast-paced ride. 41 stories included.",
