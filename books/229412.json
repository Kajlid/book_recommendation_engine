  "description": "\"Cuno Massey has been holing up in the New Mexico town of Nopal, trying to give up his gunslinging ways and return to freighting. But a gang of cutthroats who call themselves \"the Boys\" led by the savage killer Cecil Craig run Cuno's freight wagon off the road and into a canyon, killing his mules and setting the young freighter afoot. That's only the start of the desperados' depredations. They take over Nopal intending to settle up for past grievances by raping all the women and killing all the men before burning the town to the ground. Their first mistake was not making sure the beefy young freight wagon driver was dead. Because that was not just any young freighter. Cuno Massey straps on his .45 and takes on the gang . . . with a little help from some lovely, Winchester-wielding ladies and his old lawman friend, Spurr Morgan . . .\"--",
