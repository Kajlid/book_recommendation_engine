  "description": "Ben was a human. Whisper was a witch. When a witch tells you to help her, you do what she says. Not because she's beautiful, but because you don't want to live the rest of your life as a frog. Or something worse. Now Ben is thrown into a world hidden deep within his own, where the impossible is possible, and nothing is what it seems. As Whisper fights to save her own kind, Ben struggles against his own rational thinking while helping to stop a danger that is greater than any human could imagine.",
