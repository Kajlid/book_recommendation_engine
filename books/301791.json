  "description": "“Life, fate, the universe, they all broke the rules.\"  I was the luckiest girl in the world. I had it all. Everything I never knew I wanted. Until one day in June, it all came crashing down. My best friend, my life, my love. All gone. I live in the Valley of the Sun, but I’m the darkest storm cloud. \"Heal,\" they all tell me. \"Move on.\" But how? One person tries harder than the rest, and I know why. He was sent to me. Fulfilling a promise he never knew would be this difficult. He's full of grief too, but he’s not dark like me. He’s bright and warm. I can feel his sunshine creeping in, chasing away my darkness. It doesn’t feel right that I should ever be happy again. But the scariest part of all? It doesn’t feel wrong either.",
