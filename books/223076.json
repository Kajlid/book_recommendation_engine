  "description": "Spanning the length and breadth of the twentieth century, Alice Mattison's masterful In Case We're Separated looks at a family of Jewish immigrants in the 1920s and 1930s and follows the urban, emotionally turbulent lives of their children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren against a backdrop of political assassination, the Vietnam War, and the AIDS epidemic. Beginning with the title story, which introduces Bobbie Kaplowitz—a single mother in 1954 Brooklyn whose lover is married and whose understanding of life is changed by a broken kitchen appliance—Mattison displays her unparalleled gift for storytelling and for creating rich, multidimensional characters, a gift that has led the Los Angeles Times to praise her as \"a writer's writer.\"In case we're separated --Not yet, not yet --I am not your mother --In the dark, who pats the air --Brooklyn Sestina --Election day --The bad Jew --Future house --Change --Ms. Insight --Boy in winter --Pastries at the bus stop --The odds it would be you",
