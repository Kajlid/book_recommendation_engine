  "description": "Solve a mystery and fall in love…. The cold case trail of a serial killer – a big city private investigator returning to his old home town – an unhappily married woman whose hubby is overseas…. Sparks fly but nothing is simple.  What if you were each other’s first love, but not at the same time? What if a boy loved a girl, but it wasn’t until 20 years later the girl, now a woman, found her first true love in the boy, now a man? What if teen lovers separated by adult life were thrust back together in the investigation of human remains being unearthed at a soccer field?  April’s grandfather was charged and convicted of murder back in the 80s and has served his prison sentence. Will he return to a hostile hometown or can private investigator Jason Ford clear his name? Why the old man confessed to the murder in the first place is the question to be answered. The investigation leads Jason on a road trip out into the desert, and there’s no way known April (married yet infatuated) is letting him go without her!  The Soccer Field Bones: Jason & April is the 3rd in a five book series of powerful stand-alone mysteries with strong romantic persuasion. You will find the dual plots quite balanced. Fans of either genre have plenty to delve into here.  Some moderate level erotic content.",
