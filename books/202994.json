  "description": "“Follow me. We’ll go into my office.” He stood back to let her in the door, but her arm brushed against his chest as she stepped in, and that little point of contact sent a tingle through her body. It was either a crime that this man had been a sex therapist or that he no longer was – she couldn’t decide which.Sarah has a little problem with her sex life, so her friend recommends a sex therapist to her. Her recommendation comes in a very attractive Aiden, who isn’t a practicing sex therapist any longer, but he’s willing to help her out…and he’s willing to take a hands-on approach.",
