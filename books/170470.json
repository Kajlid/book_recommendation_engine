  "description": "Smut-Shorties: A great on-the-go short to satisfy your craving for smut! *Please be aware that this is an Erotica SHORT*  A new city, a new choosing...  The Midwinter Ball...a time when the lycan packs of the city are required to send an offering to please the Mistress of the City; a male wolf...young, virile and eager to please the Mistress in her bed.  Archer isn't a wolf, but his younger brother, Seth, is. The only unmated male in their pack, he's about to be served up on a silver platter for the Mistress, and only Archer seems to have an issue with Seth's age. He might be an adult in the wolfy world, but to Archer's mind, he's still too young. Trouble is, if Seth doesn't go, someone else does... Which leaves just one person crazy enough to walk into the Mistress's den and pretend to be a wolf.  Reena is bored stupid. She hates the Midwinter Choosing, hates the fact that all the males are paraded in front of her like damn peacocks, and hates the fact that her normal cover story is happily mated, which means she HAS to pick a partner this year.  Then a handsome alpha asks her for a dance, obviously unaware who she is, and all bets are off...  *Please be aware that this is an Erotica SHORT*  **NB: This is the first story in a new city. You do not need to have read the other Smut-Shorties to enjoy this one.**",
