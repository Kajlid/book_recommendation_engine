  "description": "A desire that defies all limits. . .and a love that was meant to be. . . Scotland 1502. Akira Neish has been raised as a peasant, her belly often empty and her family subject to the cruel whims of her clan's laird. To the clan's children, the horned shaped birthmark she bears means she is a witch. But she is neither peasant nor witch--and now the man who knows the truth has returned to claim her for his own. Calin MacLeod has kept Akira's secrets and to avenge his father, the sensual young laird must marry her. He is more than a match for the fiery nature of the woman he adores. Yet the passion they share--and truths that can no longer remain hidden--could rip all of Scotland apart. . . \"Fascinating. . .well-crafted romance. The appeal of Killion's characters comes from their honor, intelligence and humanity.\" â€“ Romantic Times, 4-star review",
