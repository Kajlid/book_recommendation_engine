But the late night emails, the stories about women losing their children to abusive husbands in divorces, people being thrown through sliding glass doors, broken arms, rape? Like the rest of her life, it's all starting to feel unmanageable.A Toxic Past.Dylan stopped looking for her years before, convinced Rachel was still the same fascinating, stunningly beautiful girl he remembered, and probably the same tortured and sadistic bitch he'd tried so hard to forget.A Broken Woman.When a tragic accident brings them face to face again, Rachel finds herself confronting demons long buried, and her already fragile world threatens to shatter around her. She helps people in crisis for a living, so why does her own body warn TOTAL SYSTEM FAILURE when she faces conflict of her own? Will she ever learn to fight for herself without damaging the people she loves?**Disclaimer: This story is not a fairy tale. This story is a romance drama about real people with real problems and how they find their own version of an old fashioned Happily Ever After. Adult Themes and Content - Potential Trigger Warning**",
