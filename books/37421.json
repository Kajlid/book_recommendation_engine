  "title": "The Third Floor",
  "description": "A fifteen-year-old girl, raised in a rural farming community is sent to an inner city to live and hide in a home for unwed mothers. The Third Floor is written in the voice of the fifteen-year-old from letters saved from her best friend since the summer of 1962. She tells of daily life inside the home, chores, military rules, and lack of counsel. The girls, about 50 with a waiting list to enter, live out their time and go up to the third floor to labor and deliver their babies, relinquish them, and return to society and act as if nothing had happened and keep this secret for the rest of their lives. That summer was also her racial awakening and the beginning of a lifelong friendship.",
