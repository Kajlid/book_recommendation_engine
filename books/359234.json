  "description": "\"A fable for grownups that will be fun for children. Sit down with the book and get your own bearings.\" â€” New York Herald TribuneWith the first signs of approaching winter, the Bear's thoughts naturally turn to a cozy cave and a long snooze till spring. But when he awakes a few months later, he is surprised to find himself smack dab in the middle of a sprawling industrial complex! To make matters even worse, every one he meets keeps insisting that he's not even a bear--just a silly man who needs a shave and wears a fur coat.Written by the beloved director of such classic screwball comedies as The Girl Can't Help It and Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?, this wryly humorous tale has long been an underground favorite with readers of all ages and attitudes. Poking fun at a fast-paced, high-tech society, it follows the Bear's repeated attempts of finding out just where he belongs. On an assembly line? In a zoo? At the circus? No one seems to know for sure.Tashlin's 46 delightfully original and whimsical illustrations add to the charm of this unique and entertaining fable.",
