Highly respected in his field.He also happens to be an ex-collegiate quarterback with a classically handsome face.Are you catching on yet?He’s horrible.Beautiful.A walking Ralph Lauren ad.He’s also so off limits he should come with a warning label: This way lies heartache.Not only is he an attending at the hospital where I’m training, he’s also my brother’s best friend. If you’ve lost count, that’s two reasons why I plan on putting this ridiculous crush behind me. Besides, it’s definitely not mutual. Dr. Easton has never once paid me special attention. No tempting smirks. Not even one subtle innuendo.

A walking temptation I’ve been forced to ignore. For so long, I’ve wanted her in silence. By the time fate finally gets around to throwing me a bone, my patience has run out.Natalie’s brother is leaving town, and he wants me to watch over her while he’s gone.He has no idea how I feel about her.Neither does she.But she will.Haven’t you heard good things come to those who wait, Natalie?Well… I’ve done my waiting.",
