  "title": "The Silenced Majority: Stories of Uprisings, Occupations, Resistance, and Hope",
  "description": "In their new book, Amy Goodman and Denis Moynihan provide a vivid record of the events, conflicts, and social movements shaping our society today. They give voice to ordinary people standing up to corporate and government power across the country and around the world. Their writing and daily work at the grassroots public TV/radio news hour Democracy Now! , carried on more than a thousand stations globally and at democracynow.org, casts in stark relief the stories of the silenced majority. These stories are set against the backdrop of the mainstream mediaâ€™s abject failure, with its small circle of pundits who know so little about so much, attempting to explain the world to us and getting it so wrong.",
