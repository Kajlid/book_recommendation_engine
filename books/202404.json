  "title": "Commentaries on the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita: The Three Branches of India's Life-Tree",
  "description": "This book brings together in one volume Sri Chinmoy's commentaries on the Vedas, the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita, three ancient Indian scriptures which are the foundations of the Hindu spiritual tradition. His approach is clear and practical and at the same time profound and richly poetic. In a style unmistakably his own, Sri Chinmoy establishes direct and personal contact with the reader, who joins him on a journey through the wisdom of these celebrated classics. This book is both an excellent introduction for readers who are coming to the subject for the first time, and a series of illumining meditations for those who know it well.Only Sri Chinmoy could have written this book. On the strength of his own inner realisation, he is able to enter into these ancient Indian treasure houses of spirituality, and also into the needs and aspirations of seekers of today. He achieves the communication to our present lives of truths first taught thousands of years ago, so that they can be understood, appreciated and used. He is fresh and powerful in expression, but also lyrical and soulful as only a spiritual Master who is also a poet can be.",
