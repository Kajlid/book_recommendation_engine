  "title": "I AM Sitting Down, Teacher!: Happenings That Entertained Me at School",
  "description": "You know what your kids are like at home, but have you ever wondered what they really do when at school? Well, wonder no more.I AM Sitting Down, Teacher! is a riotous selection of antics by schoolchildren in kindergarten through sixth grade. During her nearly forty years of teaching, Susan E. Hamilton recorded every creative answer, inappropriate remark, and innocent question that made her laugh—and now these experiences can entertain you.Hamilton has no shortage of amusing anecdotes, including one about a beautifully chaotic Christmas performance, another about an accident involving a classroom pet, and one about the time a student sneaked a bottle of tequila from home. And that’s not all—parents, she has found, sometimes behave just as unpredictably as their children.Whether it brings back memories of your own mischievous childhood—or makes you shudder at the thought of what your child might be doing at school—you’ll get a kick out of the schoolroom capers presented in this book.",
