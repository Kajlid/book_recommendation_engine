  "description": "When Chen goes on holiday, his demonic partner Zhu Irzh finds himself alone in Singapore Three. The missing body of a brutally murdered socialite and the strange experiments of a well-connected, beautiful, young heiress leads Zhu into a maze of death and corruption. Chen returns to the city just as Zhu's baser instincts seem to be getting the better of him. While the rest of the police department thinks the worst of Zhu, Chen suspects something more malignant, particularly when the forces of Heaven begin manifesting themselves in Singapore Three, taking sides and leaving a trail of death and destruction in their wake.Skyhorse Publishing, under our Night Shade and Talos imprints, is proud to publish a broad range of titles for readers interested in science fiction (space opera, time travel, hard SF, alien invasion, near-future dystopia), fantasy (grimdark, sword and sorcery, contemporary urban fantasy, steampunk, alternative history), and horror (zombies, vampires, and the occult and supernatural), and much more.
