  "description": "Winning nationals wasn’t the only dream that came true. I also walked away with the heart of the one boy I couldn’t live without. I knew the being Jace Wilder’s girlfriend wouldn’t be simple. But how could I have known all the hurdles we would face? Drama at school? That’s a given. Jealous girls? That I expected. Family secrets? Not so much. At least I can always hit the trails to clear my head… or so I thought. The high expectations from my winning cross country season still haunt me, and hold me hostage. I can’t seem to get psyched up for what comes next. My competitive spirit is fading and I’m lost without it. What will I do when my one constant is no longer my safe place? Life on and off the track is spiraling out of control, leaving me in its wake as I struggle to remember who I truly am.",
