Vapor shouldn’t crave her caresses, steal her kisses, make her scream with ecstasy. The cyborgs want her dead and they would question his loyalty if he didn’t kill her. The humans would shoot him on sight if he dared to touch her.Their love is forbidden. Their desire could be lethal. One human and one cyborg will risk everything for a moment of passion.",
