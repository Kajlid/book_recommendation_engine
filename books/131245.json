Pencil’s next installment of “Beneath the Trap Door.” ˃˃˃ The Reunion C. Moore Catholic High School's 10-year reunion was organized as many reunions are; to reminisce, to see who had made a success of their lives, and in truth, to gossip on who had not. But this party in the secluded, 1890's mansion once owned by a long dead, paranoid WWII Veteran, was to become anything but typical. After a horrible accident within the mansion, the alumni realize they are locked in and fighting for their lives. Instantly, tempers rise and fingers are pointed as the number of living alumni begins to rapidly decrease. Theories range from there being a murderer in the midst to the mansion possibly being haunted by the previous owner's ghost. Who or what is responsible and will anyone make it out alive? Find out for yourself in this combination of a mystery and psychological thriller, with a twisted ending! ˃˃˃ High School Reunion Horror: New Book Raises Funds (and Chills) For Good Cause  \"To celebrate the release of AA Pencil's debut novel \"The Reunion\" - During the months of November, December 2013 & January 2014 - 1% of the gross sales of all novels with Lavish Publishing, LLC will be donated to the Lupus Foundation of America.
