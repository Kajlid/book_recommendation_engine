  "description": "In STORM FORCE TO NARVIK, Nicholas Everard is captain of the destroyer Intent. A crash of gunfire leaves her crippled, wallowing through heavy seas to find shelter in a Norwegian fjord. But it is 1940 and Norway is being invaded by the Germans. With engine defects and all her technicians killed in that action Intent is trapped and helpless while the Nazis blast their way into a neutral country, and London dithers. In LAST LIFT FROM CRETE, the Navy's ships, with no air cover, have to contend with a force of 2,000 German bombers, with only darkness in which surviving ships can lick their wounds. Nick Everard, commanding the Tribal-class destroyer Tuareg during these Cretan operations in 1941, finds himself in company with the cruiser Carnarvon in which his own son Jack is serving. In ALL THE DROWNING SEAS Japanese invasion fleets sweep across the Pacific, and at Surabaya a handful of Allied ships prepare for a last- ditch battle. Nick Everard, commanding the cruiser Defiant, is badly wounded in the Battle of the Java Sea. Ships and crews face destruction unless Nick can find some way out of the trap.",
