  "title": "Why People Do What They Do",
  "description": "On this eleven-chapter compilation Iasiello delves into complex and controversial topics, which we have seen in the news or have experienced personally but most have not questioned. Each story will leave you asking questions such as “Why?” -“What if?” - and “Did this really happen?” Only the author knows for sure. The stories in this collection center on people, mostly working-class men and women – who have invariably taken a wrong turn in their lives and are confronted with character-changing crises. Neighbors, mothers, sons and brothers struggle to find balance and meaning in the face of deceit, loyalty, shame and pride. Why People Do What They Do communicates how our decisions reveal who we are and how these decisions must be made even if they aren’t the right ones.",
