  "title": "Educating Alice: Adventures of a Curious Woman",
  "description": "This funny and tender book combines three of Alice Steinbach’s greatest learning, traveling, and writing. After chronicling her European journey of self-discovery in Without Reservations , this Pulitzer Prize—winning columnist for the Baltimore Sun quit her job and left home again. This time she roamed the world, taking lessons and courses in such things as French cooking in Paris, Border collie training in Scotland, traditional Japanese arts in Kyoto, and architecture and art in Havana. With warmth and wit, Steinbach guides us through the pleasures and perils of discovering how to be a student again. She also learns the true value of this second chance at educating the opportunity to connect with and learn from the people she meets along the way.",
