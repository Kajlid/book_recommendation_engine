  "description": "The New York Times Bestseller, Beyond Me, captured reader's hearts. Now the stunning story of Quinn and James continues... It was supposed to be a love story....I knew she was out of my league but I didn’t care. Looking back, I wonder if I hadn’t pursued her, would things have turned out differently? Is it Fate that determines our choices in life? God? Free will? Or just plain old innate selfishness?I got her, of course. There hadn’t been a girl I wasn’t able to seduce. Problem was she seduced me right back, body, mind, and soul. She possessed me, tormented me, and showed me a world that was so bright and pure I was almost blinded. Didn’t she know after such a drug I could never settle for less? Didn’t she realize no matter how many times I screwed up, or broke her heart, or bent her to my will, I’d never be able to let her go? If I hadn’t known such intensity existed, would it have been better for both of us?True love, the real kind, isn’t nice and sweet and pure. No, it’s dirty, and sinful, and messy. It’s like ripping a chunk of flesh from your body and watching yourself bleed out in slow, helpless intervals until you thankfully pass out.This isn’t a love story. But it’s the only story I got.James and Quinn steam up the pages again in Chasing Me. Their chemistry will pull you in and keep you on the edge of your seat in this deliciously sexy story of love, trust, and forgiveness. --NYT and USA Today Bestselling Author Kelly Elliott",
