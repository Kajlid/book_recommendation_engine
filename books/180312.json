  "title": "Breach of Faith: The Fall of Richard Nixon",
  "description": "The Nixon crisis of 1973-74 threatened the state in ways not immediately understood. Stripped of drama & confusion, however, the problem was that the President had placed himself above the law. The nation had to decide whether that could be allowed. Theodore H. White starts this story with the last days of Richard Nixon in the White House--as those closest recognized he'd deceived them & that they must force him out. He follows the thread of manipulation back to its origin 20 years earlier & shows how the Nixon team came to see politics as war without quarter, in which the White House was a command post where ordinary rules didn't apply, where power could be used without restraint.Let justice be doneThe politics of manipulationPoor Richard: how things workThe team: from politics to powerThe White House of Richard Nixon: from style to heresyThe underground: from crime to conspiracyVictory 1972: design for controlThe tapes: a tour inside the mind of Richard NixonThe systems respond: Spring 1973Firestorm: Fall 1973The question period: Winter-Spring 1974Judgment: Summer 1974Breach of faithAppendix A: The articles of impeachmentAppendix B: Richard Nixon's farewell statement, 8/8/74",
