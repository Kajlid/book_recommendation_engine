And, uh, could you float him a couple bucks?Life as the only human sorcerer isn t all it s cracked up to be for James Black, the Lightning Rod. Between gremlins in the closet, paladins crashing through skylights and working spells in a storage locker, hunting a body-hopping spirit is a welcome distraction. If only he didn t have to partner with a Coyote.After being punted to the curb by his roommate (with benefits), things are looking dire for trickster Spencer Crain, until an old friend offers him a shot at a big score scamming the best of a vampire. Thing is, he ll have to work with his worst enemy to pull it off.With lives in the balance, James is learning the hard way what being a sorcerer really means and that he picked a hell of a time to quit smoking. Spencer is faced with the choice between his future and his friends. Yeah, like he s never seen \"that\" movie before This is a work of urban fantasy containing arguments for and against Dungeons & Dragons, a closeted My Little Pony fan, awkward flirting, switching POVs, heist-movie logic, and a Dwarf who can t hold his liquor.",
