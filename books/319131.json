  "title": "Lost In Thought; A Book of Poetry",
  "description": "Lost in Thought; A Book of Poetry is a collection of daydreams, put to pen and paper and finished with poetic flair. This book features over 30 poems, from a young girl's perspective, and is meant to make you simply think. These poems have no theme connecting them all or even a set rhyme pattern throughout the book. This book is only held together by the sheer transparency of thoughts, and the ebb and flow of the poetry. Lost in Thought; A Book of Poetry is written by a young teenage girl, but the ideas within are relevant to all ages and genders. So cozy up in your favourite armchair, with the rain pounding on the window, and dive into Lost in Thought; A Book of Poetry.",
