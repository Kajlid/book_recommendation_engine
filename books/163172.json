  "description": "A perfect Christmas book for the season. Full of magic and wonder, \"Flight 308 to Christmas\" reminds us that anything is possible on Christmas Eve. 11-year old Connie MacDonald, recently orphaned, is forced to fly through the Colorado Rockies in a tiny single-engine Cessna on Christmas Eve night. Her pilot is Frank Schulbert, a good old boy intent on delivering the spitfire of a girl to the grandfather she's never even met who lives in the tiniest of mountain towns. But a storm is heading straight for them--buffeting their little Cessna in wind and snow and turbulence. It's a wild ride, made even wilder when Frank passes out and Connie has to fly the plane on her own! Having never flown before, Connie quickly loses control. It's only through sheer luck and the intervention of a \"Shepherd\"--an old war vet flying nearby--that Connie doesn't crash immediately. Now, with the military pilot flying beside her, Connie must find her way through the Rockies and on to her new life. And, of course--there's a little Christmas magic along the way. \"Flight 308 to Christmas\" is a safe book to read this holiday season. For children and adults who believe or disbelieve in Santa, this is a story that will charm you, that will make you smile, that will make you cheer, and for some--perhaps even make you cry a little. PLEASE NOTE: You can absolutely give or read this book to a child who believes in Santa Claus.",
