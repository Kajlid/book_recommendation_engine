  "description": "*available 8/27/13*For many years, mountain lion Alek Fallon believed he was fated to be alone forever. But after meeting Lachlyn, he knows that he’s found his mate in the sweet she-bear and opens his home to her and her second mate, were-bear Jericho. Lachlyn is a shifting dud and cannot transform into her bear self. When Jericho’s father tries to force her into her bear form using a cattle prod, she nearly dies. Jericho’s father swears to find them, and now Alek, Jericho, and the lion pride are working together to keep everyone safe. When the mountain lions’ enemy interferes, it’s not only Lachlyn’s life that is on the line, but all of theirs.This book contains plenty of m/f/m loving, two men who will love their woman to the best of their ability, interfering female lions who don’t know when to give up, and a camper used as a honeymoon suite. Be prepared for growling, neck biting, ceremonial marking, and a lot of sweethearted male mountain lions who just want to find love.Word Count: 53,060",
