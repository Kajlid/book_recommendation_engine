  "description": "Magnificent Beasts. Buried Gods. Unforgiving Magic. Epic Battles.Perfect for fans of Avatar: The Last Airbender and Naruto, this propulsive high fantasy debut features intricate world-building, and a scientific hard magic system inspired loosely by the law of karma.The world is governed by Toranic Law, an ancient magical force that segregates people into upper and lower realms based on their morality. It’s said that if the sinful lowers commit themselves to kindness, their souls will lighten, allowing them into the blissful upper realms.But Aina, one of the few lowers to ever ascend, just wants to go back. Desperate to reunite with her mother, who remains stuck in their horror-infested homeland, Aina joins the Balancers—a group that defies Toranic Law by bringing aid to those condemned to a life of suffering in the lower realms.Alongside Aina are two new recruits: Aranel, a spoiled noble spying for the upper authorities; and Meizan, a ruthless fighter trying to save his clan from extinction.Before long, Aina, Aranel, and Meizan find themselves in the midst of a brewing war. On one side, a violent lower king is bent on destroying Toranic Law; on the other, the upper authorities will do anything to stay on top.The trio must face both sides head-on if they want to stop a conflict that could break not only Toranic Law... but the universe itself.\"An exhilarating series opener.\" - Kirkus (Starred Review)",
