  "description": "The Sheriff of Nottingham is hosting an archery contest to trap Robin Hood! Robin goes along with it, fat-head that he is, and rather than look like a coward in front of the lovely Maid Marion, Much the miller's son goes along too. As each of the Merry Men gets up to his own brand of mischief, can Much avoid getting burned at the stake by a drunken Friar Tuck? or gelded by a spiteful Will Scarlett? Will any good come from stuffing a sausage down his trousers?",
