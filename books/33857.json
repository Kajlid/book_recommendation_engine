  "description": "On December 7, 1941, the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor took the United States by surprise. But what if someone saw it coming?Many believe that a war with Japan is imminent--and unavoidable--but world-famous author Edgar Rice Burroughs is too busy basking in the Hawaiian sun to pay the rumors much mind. That is, until he finds Pearl Harada--a popular Japanese-American singer--murdered on the beach. . . .Soon the island is buzzing with speculation. Was one of Pearl's many ex-boyfriends involved in her murder? Could it have been a race-related attack? Burroughs believes she died because she knew too much. But before he can figure out who silenced Oahu's sultriest songstress, bombs decimate Pearl Harbor--and leave the entire country shuddering in their wake. . .",
