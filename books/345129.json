  "description": "Book One in the Trinity saga. Seventeen-year-old Imogen Stromholdt lives with her father, Jeff, in the seaside town of Eden, Oregon. Her life consists of a daily routine of school, homework, and books, while Jeff makes a living writing the obituaries for the local paper. She has a dream one evening of a man with a golden pocket who is murdered. After dreaming of this mysterious man's death, she meets two strangers that change her life forever; Lucius Knight, and Necklan Nixies. Things get stranger when Imogen discovers that Necklan is a fire-wielding warlock, and Lucius is far from human. After coming into possession of the dream watch itself, Imogen becomes the center of a dangerous plot hatched by a madman named Byron Barrowite. With the help of the House of Bekker, an elite organization of warlocks and witches, Imogen will dive into the dark world beyond her front door filled with angels, dragons, voodoo, premonitions, magic, science, and her own mysterious past. But as an average human girl facing off against terrifying obstacles, including a dragon made of pure hellfire, her only weapon is the freedom of choice. Imogen's bravery wavers but her will is stronger in this charming and darkly romantic urban-fantasy of magic, murder, and destiny.",
