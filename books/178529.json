  "description": "Jennifer Mills enjoys her San Diego soccer-mom lifestyle. But it all changes the day she meets Jadan, an attractive paraplegic day trader, with a turquoise gate tattoo. He can read her mind and press his thoughts into her head without speaking. SHE IS SUPERNATURAL: Jennifer discovers her new identity as the daughter of Zyon, head military guard to the King of the Realm Beyond. For now she can only visit in her dreams and visions. Can she make their world part of her own reality too? SHE IS MYSTICAL: Jadan gives Jennifer three mystical gems-- red for hiding her identity, yellow to calm her, and orange to guide her in flight. Each one draws her closer to her new nature, pulling her away from the earthly realm. Will she be able to hang on? SHE IS CONFLICTED: Jennifer must leave her children to go on a save-the-world medallion hunt. But that means she must choose a divided life, and she's not sure she can do both well. She also has major concerns for her best friend, Kristin, who gets mixed up with bad blood. Can she save her too?  Book 2, SOUL JUMPER, is now available. Book 3, SOUL SLAYER, is coming soon!  Dianne Bright enjoys being a full-time author and book reviewer. She lives in southern California with her husband, their children, dog, cat, and parrot.
