  "title": "Steampunk Magic: Working Magic Aboard the Airship",
  "description": "A glove full of Goth, a helping of SciFi, and a vial of Cyberpunk all neatly wrapped inside a Victorian Satchel--the popular new genre of Steampunk is reverberating throughout our culture in art, fashion, style and music. Now you can hop aboard the airship and embark on a spiritual adventure that brings dramatic ritual and practical magic into your everyday life with Steampunk Magic . Gypsey Elaine Teague draws on her experience as a practicing High Priestess and magician and her love of Steampunk to bring readers an entirely new magical system. Steampunk Magic is a compendium of altar arrangements, spells, and magical tools--traditional Wicca and magic with a Steampunk twist. Teague shows how to craft and use a compass instead of a pentacle, use a rigging knife in place of an athame, and join an airship in lieu of a coven. Beautifully illustrated with photographs and art. From \"This book describes the new magical system that stems from the tools and philosophies of Steampunk--the alternate Victorian history genre, and incorporates many of the tried and true methods of other crafts while applying quite a few very unique visioning and application tools specific to Steampunk. I believe that you will find this new system extremely interesting and applicable to your day to day magical and nonmagical life.\"",
