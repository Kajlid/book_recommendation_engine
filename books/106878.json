  "description": "Time passes . . . sometimes too quickly, other times not fast enough, but that’s not what’s important. The essential thing is what we learn about ourselves during that passage of time and how we apply it. Will we continue to follow the destructive paths we find ourselves on? Will we give in to circumstances that seem completely unchangeable? Or will we desperately fight to hold onto those we love and to what’s good inside us—no matter how terrible the cost?I only know I would do whatever was required of me to keep Portia, but in a world of witches, warlocks, and demons, anything can happen.My name is Vance Mangum, and this is my story.",
