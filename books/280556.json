Instead, it's built on corruption, lies, and murder.\"Charlie Raised by the chief of police, I knew tangling with the mafia leader of Northridge Heights was a bad idea. Yet as I gazed into his dark eyes, I couldn't resist Teddy's offer. We made a deal. He helps me find my fathers murderer, and I'll stand by his side as paid protection. But nothing could protect my heartâ€”from him. I saw a side of him few ever do, and it left me aching for him. Now, there's a new deal. Stand by his side and reign as his queen. Am I ready to join the seedy underbelly of mafia life, knowing one among them murdered my father? Teddy When I made the chief of police a deal, I never knew he had a daughter. After his death, I felt compelled to watch over her and keep her safe. Somewhere along the way, I fell in love. But helping her fit into my world wouldn't be easy. She had to be trained. Groomed. Educated. To my great relief, my beautiful Charlie exceeded my wildest expectations. Still, I live in fear that if the secrets I've kept come to light, my queen will become my enemy.",
