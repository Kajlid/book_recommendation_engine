  "description": "Olivia Blake has been taken. Out of the bed where she slept. Out of the nice, safe apartment filled with all her ordinary things. Out of the quiet, Northwestern town where no monsters could possibly exist. Out of her whole human world. But the worst thing about monsters is, they don’t always want to kill you. Sometimes, they want to keep you. OLIVIA is the uncut, uncensored edition of R. Lee Smith’s first full-length novel—the tale of one young woman’s descent into a dark, savage new world she must not only embrace, but ultimately fight to save.",
