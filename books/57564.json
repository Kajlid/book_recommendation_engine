  "description": "\"Successor to James Wright and John Keats, with a marvelous ear for the music of contemplation.\"―Rita Dove In his new collection, Stanley Plumly confronts and celebrates mortality―in the detailed natural world, in the immediacy of the loss of friends, and in personal encounters. Archetypal, sometimes even allegorical, the poems in Old Heart amount to a sustained meditation. The American Academy of Arts and Letters declared of Plumly that \"he has in the last thirty years quietly, steadily, expanded the range of lyric poetry in English...[and] reinvigorated our poetry.\" His ethical rigor and literary modesty combine in Old Heart ―his finest book of poetry.",
