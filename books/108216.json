  "title": "A Song for Nero",
  "description": "History tells us that in 69 AD, Nero fled his palace in Rome, stabbed himself in the throat with a pen, and was trampled to death by horses in a muddy ditch. But here's another possibility: Nero did not die in that ditch, but somebody who looked very much like him did. This gives Nero the opportunity to start a new life in pursuit of his first love—music. But Nero is being pursued by two people who have reason to suspect he is still alive—one wants him dead, the other is a passionate fan of his dreadful music and wants his genius recognized.",
