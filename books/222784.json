Zeus is furious, but Hermes has more to worry about than his father’s anger. Retrieving the sandals becomes a race against time as others are after the precious artifacts, too. Hermes knows the identity of the thief: the lovely Greek studies professor, Penelope. Now, not only does he have to get to his sandals first, but he has to do so before Penelope steals something else: his heart.",
