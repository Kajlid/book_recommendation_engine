  "description": "For so long, football was my life, but in one moment, it was ripped away from me forever. Forced down another path, I opened one of the hottest nightclubs in Miami.The Takedown became my new playing field. Women threw themselves at me, and I happily caught them, tossing them away as quickly as I could, sated and with a smile on their faces.Until the night I caught Dixie Sinclair falling off her barstool. I should have walked away. She was precisely the type of woman I had avoided my whole life. She was stuck up, judgmental as hell, and thought she was too good for everyone. Everything I typically wanted nothing to do with.One look into her blue eyes had me questioning my assumptions about her. Dixie was a puzzle that needed to be solved, and I was willing to forget years of self-preservation to help her piece herself back together.I wanted her to be mine.I needed her to be mine.She was the game I was willing to play for the rest of my life.",
