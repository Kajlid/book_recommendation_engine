  "description": "For years, Kari Hunter's fooled the world into thinking she's just an everyday girl. Sure, she's the lead singer of world-renowned band Vis Viva, but outside of that, she recycles religiously, is an avid supporter of the environment, and a certifiable coffee addict. But Kari has a secret she keeps from her family, friends, and her fans.Kari Hunter is a necromancer.The rarest and most powerful of all magic-born, necromancers are notorious for leaving a trail of sacrifices in their wake. But Kari isn't interested in hurting anyone. She works hard at being as un-necromancer-like as possible: everyone she stabs gets a bandage and a lollipop, and whenever her sacrificial knives get too excited at the prospect of violence, she puts them in time-out... in her lingerie drawer.But when an agent of voodoo master Ruairi O'Bryne catches Kari using her powers, her secret's out. And if Ruairi finds out who Kari is, he'll stop at nothing to make her his next sacrifice.",
