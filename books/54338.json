  "title": "Believe and it is True: A Story of Healing and Life Lessons",
  "description": "This book is a personal narrative detailing a transformative healing journey. Fifty years after polio struck Deborah's little three-year-old body, she was diagnosed with post-polio syndrome, with its overwhelming fatigue and muscle weakening. But, she did not accept the possibility of losing the use of her legs, again. Instead, she met the challenges head-on, healing her emotional wounds and strengthening her physical body. Her story is told through her experiences of learning essential life lessons - life lessons available to every person - to manifest a healing journey. Although her strong faith was developed through traditional religious beliefs, she discovered other spiritual realities, leading to an exploration of alternative healing methods. Learning the energy healing method of Reiki, finding solace in connecting with deceased relatives, and working through emotional issues with a shamanic intuitive healer are just a few of her experiences along this amazing path. Deborah's story resonates with anyone seeking mind, body, and spiritual healing. Every person can discover the power to heal. Believe And It Is True is a reality for all.",
