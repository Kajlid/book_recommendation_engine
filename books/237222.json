  "description": "Through the lens of political poetry this collection focuses in on what is behind the structures that form modern society. By dissecting ideas around what constitutes a 'good life', barriers such as patriarchy, unsustainable economic ideologies, climate change etc, begin to become more visible. As they highlighted the glaring realities of inequality reveal themselves in stark contrast to the billboard facade that promised us freedom and democracy.",
