  "description": "In an interview with Bustle, she said, \"I’m working on a retelling of Shakespeare’s [The] Tempest right now. I’ve learned so much about storytelling from theater, and specifically from directing Shakespeare’s plays, and I always love working with his characters. That said, I think I’m drawn to The Tempest precisely because I wouldn’t want to direct it. The things I want to say about it need a novel, because I want to travel outside the bounds of the text.\"",
