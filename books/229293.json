  "description": "From USA Today best selling authors, Willow Winters and Lauren Landish, comes a sexy and forbidden series of standalone romances. I knew she'd ruin me. But I wanted her anyway. I was born into wealth and my name comes with a reputation. One I've upheld and leveraged for power. Now everyone owes me and I plan to keep it that way. Until she's offered to me. Only for a single month to repay a debt. Her tempting curves call to me and beg me to risk it all. I shouldn't take her, I shouldn't even consider his offer. Women like her bring men to their knees. But there's something in her baby blues. They're haunted by what lies behind them. She sees through me, leaving me nowhere to hide. I knew taking her would destroy me, but it only took one taste. Now I'm addicted. And I'm not giving her back.",
