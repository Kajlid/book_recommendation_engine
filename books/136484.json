  "title": "Lone Cowboy: My Life Story",
  "description": "1930. Illustrated by the author. The narrative of Lone Cowboy tells how a little boy, hardly more than a baby, becomes an orphan in the West; how an old French trapper, whom the boy calls Bopy, adopts him and takes him on his long, long hunts; how when he is hardly more than a little boy Bopy is lost in an icy river and the child, heartbroken, rides down into the prairie region alone-on his own. James gives a complete and varied idea of how a cowboy lives as he moves toward his remote objective-becoming an artist. See other titles by this author available from Kessinger Publishing.",
