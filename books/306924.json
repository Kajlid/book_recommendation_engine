  "description": "How often does it happen that a single tiny mistake causes an entire civilization to collapse? More often than you think! Readers of Jared Knott's book, Tiny Blunders/Big Disasters, will be amazed at the little things that changed history in a big way. Here are a few examples:A single document poorly designed by one single clerk in one single county changed the outcome of a presidential election and led directly to a major war.A soldier accidentally kicks a helmet off of the top of a wall and causes an empire to collapse.A small mechanical device several inches long fails to function, which changes the outcome of WWII and leads to the death of millions of people.A man fails to gather his army in time to defend against an attack because of the temptation of opium and a young slave woman.And many more!",
