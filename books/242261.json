  "description": "Does a curse only work if you believe it does?   Chosen to be a priestess from childhood, Athena knows everything about aligning her energy with the universe and spreading hope, healing, and wisdom to people. But her inner balance is disturbed when Finn shows up on her doorstep.  The large, annoyingly flirtatious man kept her imprisoned in the past and now demands she lift the spell she cast on him. Rather than explain to him that the spell wasn’t real, Athena sees her chance of teaching him a lesson in karma and makes demands of her own. Finn will allow her full power over him for five full days or live with the curse forever.  The Seducer is the fourth installment in Elin Peer’s wildly popular series Men of the North. Like all her other books it offers humor, a fast pace, and an emotional roller-coaster that will leave you breathless.  Get this book and go on an epic romantic adventure today!",
