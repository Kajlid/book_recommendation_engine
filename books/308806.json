But when handsome drummer Zander enters her life and rattles all her defenses, she can’t deny the fact that their chemistry is through the roof. Problem is, she’s not sure she’s ready to dive into a relationship. Especially since her divorce isn’t finalized yet. The more Drew gets to know Zander, the more she’s attracted to him. But Zander’s simple gig unravels his old demons, and Drew’s demons are gaining on her. Now they both have to face their fears.Will love give them the strength to do it together or will they each have to do it alone?*Deliverance can be read as standalone, but for a more fulfilling experience and to better understand the world of The Deviant, it’s recommended to read Rapture first.",
