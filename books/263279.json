  "description": "I wanted to know Bella in every way, but she didn’t want to know me, not the man I really am—not with the secret I swore with a blood oath to protect. I swore this secret would die with me. The truth is hidden within the darkness of her past and it’s fuelin’ a war with the Bratva. They’re comin’ and it wont be long before they threaten everything I love.I hated him for the things he’d taken from me. I hated him for the love he’d refused me. I know now that being forced to marry him wasn’t the worst that could’ve happened to me. I'm a woman born into a man's world. I've stood tall and held my own, but now the people that want my family dead, aren't far behind.",
