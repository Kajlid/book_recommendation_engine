  "title": "The Affair of the Mutilated Mink",
  "description": "The Earl of Burford hosts another slightly batty, thoroughly baffling house party....George Henry Alwyn Saunders, 12th in his line, has taken a fancy to films. He's nearly killed with delight when a movie mogul wants Alderly, the Burfords' 17th century country estate, for the set of a new Rex Ransom epic. The bronzed, handsome star has long thrilled the loopy lord with dazzling deeds on the silver screen.Less than thrilled is the Countess, who's suddenly playing hostess to a Hollywood crowd and a growing guest list that includes a long-lost cousin and a shady second spouse, two suitors for the Burford's willful daughter Lady Geraldine, an eccentric screenwriter protesting the pirating of his work, a sultry, sparky femme fatale, a professional blackmailer.... Oh yes, roles from James L. Anderson's first zany whodunit, The Affair of the Bloodstained Egg Cosy, are reprised by Merryweather, ther imperturbable family butler, and the perspicacious Ins. Wilkins of the Westshire constabulary. And what does a mutilated mink coat have to do with anything?.... Nothing can top the merrily murderous 1930s house party for a puzzler!",
