  "description": "Death Club. Join and die.  'Up there with Mitch Rapp, Pike Logan, and Jack Reacher'  U.S. Special Forces operative Zeb Carter didn't know about the Death Club when he stumbled across the dismembered body, left to desiccate in the Oregon high desert.  But the body wasn't his problem—for once, he could hand it over to the local sheriff and trust in his competence.  At least, it wouldn't have been Zeb's problem, if he hadn't found out who dead man was and what he meant to his teenage daughter.  Now he's asking questions—and the wrong people have noticed.  No, Zeb doesn't know about the Death Club.  But it knows about him.  It's already tracking him.
