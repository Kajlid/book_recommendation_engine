  "title": "Bodies We've Buried: Inside the National Forensic Academy, the World's Top CSI Training School",
  "description": "In Bodies We've Buried, the very first book to reveal the inside workings of the National Forensic Academy, two NFA administrators offer readers and CSI fans exclusive access to a world normally off-limits to all but law enforcement officials, doctors, and scientists: inside the only hands-on crime-scene investigation school of its kind, where students are trained in burial recovery with actual human remains. This is the shocking, uncensored, and sometimes darkly humorous reality of forensic investigation. It features firsthand stories of the students themselves and shows how the remarkable science of CSI has solved some of the most famous cases in recent history.  From the world-wide authority on crime scene investigation, Bodies We've Buried is the never-before-told story of CSI investigation as it really is.",
