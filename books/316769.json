  "description": "I Want You To Want Me is a slow burn, enemies-to-lovers, rock star romance about two people who’re bad at love but want to be good for each other. Even more than wanting to be a rock star, Derek Valencia wants respect in the music industry. But right when his band hits the big-time, the guys spiral out of control, and the record label threatens to pull its support. So, when their manager hires a minder to keep them in line, Derek’s pride takes a hit. Still, he can’t refuse the help, not when he’s this close to getting everything he’s worked so hard for. And he can’t help the blazing attraction for the babysitter he’s so intent on disliking.What does Violet Davis know about love and trust? She grew up in the foster care system, shuffled from one home to another. But when she falls for the bass player in the band she’s been hired to look after, something changes in her. She wants him more than she’s wanted anything in her life. For the first time, she’s in love.For Derek, he’s finally found something that matters more than music—and he’s not letting her go.But can a woman who craves stability really make it work with a man whose life is spent on the road with his band?",
