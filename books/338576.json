Before That Morning, these were the words most often used to describe straight-A student and star soccer player Devon: responsible, hardworking, mature. But all that changes when the police find Devon home sick from school as they investigate the case of an abandoned baby. Soon the connection is madeâ€”Devon has just given birth; the baby in the trash is hers. After That Morning, there's only one way to define attempted murderer. And yet gifted author Amy Efaw does the impossible: she turns Devon into an empathetic character, a girl who was in such deep denial that she refused to believe she was pregnant.
