  "title": "Prototype: What Happens When You Discover You're More Like Jesus Than You Think?",
  "description": "Jesus is God and we are not. Most of us get that. But what we don’t always understand is that God loves us just as much as He does His son. Many times in the Old Testament, God refers to human beings as His “beloved.” But when God called Jesus His beloved, Jesus did something truly He believed Him. He lived every moment of His life fully convinced of His identity. And unlike every other person in history . . . He never forgot.In Prototype , Jonathan Martin creates a vivid understanding of what it means to be beloved by God. To completely trust, as Jesus did, that God loves you. To live life without fear, confident in your identity and purpose. To handle life’s wounds as Jesus did, and to wake every day with a deep awareness of God’s presence.Martin reveals a startling truth at the heart of the Jesus is our prototype. And as we discover how the knowledge of being God’s beloved changed everything for Jesus―how it set Him free to live out his purpose and love God, others, and the world―it will begin to do the same for us.",
