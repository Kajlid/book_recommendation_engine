My purpose is to show you the truth about me, and to prove that I am not the hero that everyone says I am.In the Hushlands — those Librarian-controlled nations such as the United States, Canada, and England—this book will be published as a work of fantasy.Do not be fooled! This is no work of fiction, nor is my name really Brandon Sanderson.I know the events of my life may seem wondrous and mysterious. I will do my best to explain them, but please remember that my purpose is not to entertain you. My purpose it to open your eyes to the truth.This is my story—the story of a selfish, contemptible fool.The story of a coward.The story of Alcatraz Smedry.",
