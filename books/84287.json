  "description": "All three thrilling books in Neal Shusterman’s New York Times bestselling Unwind trilogy, together in one boxed set.After the Second Civil War, the Bill of Life states that human life may not be touched from the moment of conception until a child reaches the age of thirteen. However, a loophole allows parents to retroactively get rid of a teenager through a process called “unwinding.”Three teens defy the system and run away from their unwinding: Connor, a rebel whose parents have ordered his unwinding; Risa, a ward of the state who is to be unwound due to cost-cutting; and Lev, whose unwinding has been planned since birth as a religious tithing. As their paths intersect and lives hang in the balance, Connor, Risa, and Lev have to work together to survive.The complete riveting trilogy, which VOYA calls “smart, intense, and thought provoking,” is packaged together in this boxed set that includes Unwind, UnWholly, and UnSouled.",
