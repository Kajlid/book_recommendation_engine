  "description": "One summer evening Sam and Kate's parents go for a walk.\"We're just going around the block,\" says Mama, \"We'll be back in fifteen minutes.\"But they do not come back in fifteen minutes. Where could they be? The next morning Kate and Sam discover a mysterious special delivery letter in an iridescent green envelope. It's from Mama and Dad, and it says, \"Dear Kate and Sam, We are very sorry we did not get back home on time last night as we promised. Unfortunately, just as we turned the corner of Elm Street, a large, fierce yellow dragon swooped down and carried us off...\" So begin Sam and Kate's adventures to rescue their parents. Along the way they learn from their pet cat how to speak with animals, and they make many friends - which is lucky, because they'll encounter wolves, robbers, angry bees, fairies, magical traps and puzzles, the yellow dragon, and more. But have no fear! Sam, Kate, and their companions are kind and resourceful enough to solve any problem.",
