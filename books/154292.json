  "description": "A Prophecy  A Shipwreck  The Battle for Britain begins...  They hardly remember the May-children. The one hundred and forty children King Arthur exiled from Britain.  Mordred – he’s the one they talk about. They say he was the only May-child who survived. They were wrong.  This is the story of the children King Arthur sent to their deaths on the strength of Merlin’s prophecy. This is the secret history of the Children of the May.  Children of the May is the first novel in S. J. Moore’s Children of the May saga. Inventively adapted from tales in Thomas Malory’s Le Morte d’Arthur and other medieval sources, the Children of the May stories are full of action, adventure, mystery, humour and romance - a version of the Arthurian legends for today.",
