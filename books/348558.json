When she attends her cousin's Halloween party, she never expects to end up between two men. Literally. Naked.

When she disappears before they can reveal their identities and make their intentions clear, they know they'll be traveling their own rocky road as they set out to persuade Jahz, that she should surrender to pleasure in their arms - a pleasure that will be no phantom at all.This story has male male interaction as part of a polyamorous relationship and some BDSM play.",
