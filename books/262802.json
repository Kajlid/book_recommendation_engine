Not with him, her alpha, the bane of her existence ruling over her with an iron fist. She loathes the way he makes her feel, but she cannot escape him, not while outside forces move in to eradicate her kind. Will Kaylin be strong enough to face them, and her alpha when her past returns to bite her?",
