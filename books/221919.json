  "description": "How far would you go to save the one you love?  Sixteen-year-old Maia Graystone lives in a world of fear. Trapped inside the hellish pit below Rhine prison with psychopaths and murderers, she spends every second worrying about the brother she left behind, knowing that if the other inmates don’t kill her first, the asteroid hurtling toward the earth definitely will.  When a mysterious benefactor rescues her from prison and offers her a spot in the Shadow Trials, she jumps at the chance to receive a coveted place for her and her brother on the space station in the stars. Forced to change her appearance and identity, she’ll enter the very court that sentenced her to prison and fight for her survival. She’s dead-set on doing whatever it takes to win, until she’s paired with a mysterious prisoner harboring his own secrets.  With the asteroid days away, the Trials looming, and her brother’s fate hanging in the balance, Maia discovers the only thing more dangerous than the Emperor’s court is her conflicted heart.  Fans of Divergent, Throne of Glass, and the Maze Runner will love this gritty tale of survival, intrigue, and hope in a dying world.
