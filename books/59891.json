  "description": "Ever wonder if those nightmares are real, if the scary stories are true, or if the myths...aren't really myths? Escape into the world of the unknown where expectations meet limitations and dreams are nothing but an illusion of the mind. When no one is home...the creatures come out to play.*All proceeds from this title are donated to the Pajama Program, an organization that provides books and pajamas to children awaiting their adoption.",
