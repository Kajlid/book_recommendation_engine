  "description": "When a 21st century property developer meets a Regency gentleman- what could possibly go wrong?A great deal, it turns out. When Natasha Rowlands steps through a door in the house that will be her home she finds herself in 1810 with not only a Regency gentleman, but also a murder victim on the premises.If it is a shock for her, it is equally disconcerting for Lord Halwell's steward, his natural son, but neither of them are prepared for a serial killer, the mystery of Lord Halwell's second wife or the growing attraction between them.There had been a time – quite recently, in fact – when he had been a decent, hardworking, respectable gentleman. One who did not break the law and did not lust after respectable young ladies. One who had never seen a murdered person or imagined that time did anything but flow in one direction like a river.That, Matthew thought as he attempted to make himself invisible under what had proved, unfortunately, to be a holly bush, was before he had met Miss Natasha Rowlands.Love’s Vengeance is the first of The Clock House Mysteries and some familiar faces from the Time Into Time series will make an appearance.",
