Similar to his patients, Dr. Edminson has built his life on a narrative created in childhood. While working on the case of a serial killer of prostitutes and strippers, he learns that his adored grandfather may not have been the great man he thought he was. Dr. Edminson then goes on a journey to discover the truth about his life and the family from which he has been estranged. What he learns shakes the very foundation upon which he has built his life sending him into an existential crisis.",
