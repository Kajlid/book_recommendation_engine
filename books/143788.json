  "description": "In \nChimaera and Other Stories\n, Steven Bruce delivers a chilling collection of flash fiction that plunges readers into fractured realities, grotesque transformations, and eerie confrontations. Bruce masterfully explores the fragile boundary between sanity and madness. Each tale is a tightly woven tapestry of horror, desperation, and suspense, where ordinary lives spiral into inescapable nightmares.Winner of the 2024 Literary Titan Gold Book AwardThis collection of flash fiction reminds me of the dark genius of Stephen King or Clive Barker, particularly the latter’s Books of Blood series. Bruce has a sharp eye for detail and doesn’t shy away from taking his readers to some truly gruesome places. Each story is a doorway to sleepless nights, and Bruce doesn’t hold back in making sure you regret opening them. Chimaera and Other Stories should be at the top of your reading list if you’re a fan of psychological horror with a sharp, bloody edge.— Karen Almeida, Literary Titan Book AwardA creative and inventive writer, Steven Bruce has a real knack for drawing you into a story.— Stephanie J Bardy, World of Myth MagazineBruce splices together the surreal and the all-too-real in this volatile collection of confrontational horror. An atmosphere of classic literary significance doused in blood, Chimaera and Other Stories manifests a darkness that will keep your brain churning and the pages turning.— Joe Clements, High Fells",
