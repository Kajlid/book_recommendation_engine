  "description": "\"Your friends knew you were into the taboo. You'd known this guy for a few years, but only recently did you find out you were cut from the same cloth. It's not exactly the kind of thing that comes up in normal conversation, but somehow you both figured it out. He'd nervously asked you a few weeks ago if you'd be into hanging out at his house sometime in the future. You both knew what that meant.\"",
