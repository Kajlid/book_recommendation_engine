  "description": "Tomor—a gang leader accustomed to a hard life on the outskirts of society—is a shrewd, ruthless bastard with a price on his head. He lives a lonely life, and that suits him just fine...until the day a traitor in his ranks betrays him to the police. After a shoot out that nearly kills him, Tomor is saved by a young woman who hides him from the cops. Though he should be more concerned with the traitor who set him up, he can't get the gorgeous girl out of his head—or shake the feeling she can fill the emptiness that has become a way of life. Luz has survived her boring, lonely existence thanks to her two best photography and alcohol. But her world shifts on the night a breathless man approaches her, asking for help. From his wild hair to his stony expression, he reeks of trouble. And he sends a shiver up her spine—one that makes her burn with excitement for the first time in her life. After a lifetime of lonely hell, Tomor and Luz might just be able to save each other...if Tomor's past doesn't kill them first. contains mature content. Intended for readers 18+",
