  "description": "Selected Stories of Roald Dahl combines stories from two previously published volumes, Someone Like You and Kiss Kiss. A pungent blend of the macabre and the humorous, Mr. Dahl's stories are guaranteed to keep the reader in a state of delightfully horrified surprise. They are the work of a superb craftsman; and beyond that, reveal the subtly seasoned mind of a social satirist and moralist.",
