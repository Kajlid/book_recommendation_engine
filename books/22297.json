Overwhelmed by a freak winter storm, the town finds itself cut off from the outside world, and its residents consumed by paranoia and bloodlust. Little do they know there is a purpose to the storm, and the malevolent ghosts of long-dead neighbors might have something to do with it. This is Spring City's last night, but its citizens won't go quietly.",
