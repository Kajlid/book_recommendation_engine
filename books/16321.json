  "description": "I have come to terms with the idea of Peter becoming Lesser-Bred. See, sometimes I can look at the glass of milk as being half-full instead of close to empty.Besides, it’s not all that hard. Look at the benefits. More time alone with him, my greedy bastard self, and the bed. Granted, it’s time we could be spending in the Gray Zone. I did promise to take Peter there to find a Lesser-Bred to meet his needs.But since Peter hasn’t mentioned going, I haven’t bothered to remind him. What can I say, the idea of another man satisfying Pete in a way I can’t doesn’t exactly put me in my happy place.Maybe, with any luck, Pete won’t kill me.Kill me and eat me.",
