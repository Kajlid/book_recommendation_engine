  "description": "When three warriors, weary of the havoc wreaked on them by the High Mage, take a leave of absence, they get a rude awakening when their number-one threat finds them - on Earth. Armed with little more than their powers, their wits, and their experience, they have to contain the threat - but nothing is as it seems. As they hit the ground, they find that they’re left with more questions than answers, and a perilous procedure may either pay off with great possibilities or cos them everything. For Arriella, Shourron II, and Makkian, the battle is just gettingstarted.Break time’s over.",
