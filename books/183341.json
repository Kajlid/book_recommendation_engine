  "description": "Desperation had set in. The fight or flight life she led had to stop. She couldn’t handle it much longer. Lisa Hill's only wish is to be able to stay in one place longer than a few months. When she finds herself in the small town of Lake Duchess, Washington, she hopes this will be where her flight will end. Although charmed by the welcoming townspeople, and enthralled by the attentions of the strong and handsome Sheriff, Ryan Jacobs, she isn't fooled into thinking she can start planting tulip bulbs in the backyard for next spring. Ryan is immediately drawn to the newcomer in a way he’s not so sure he wants to pursue. His bruised heart has built a wall against women like her. But, she awakens feelings in him that he’d thought were well hidden away, and he doesn’t seem able to resist. Soon brought back into reality, Lisa’s assailant catches up with her yet again. Engulfed by her fears, the glimpse of a perfect life is again thrown away. Are her growing feelings for the Sheriff, and the need to finally stand up to defend what is right, enough for her to risk staying to face her past head on? Or will the threat of death finally become a reality?",
