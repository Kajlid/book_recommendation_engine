  "description": "Almost 2000 years ago, there was a sacred city called Aresteros. This was the home of some of the most powerful shifters history has ever the phoenix shifters. They were not only invulnerable to any form of magic, but were said to be eternal, coming to the end of each life only to be reborn in a blaze of fire. But 2000 years ago...they vanished overnight, never to be seen or heard from again. Until now. Katra is the first Phoenix shifter since their disappearance all those centuries ago. She has traveled from place to place with her father since she was 7, after her mother was killed trying to protect her secret from a group of fanatical witches. She's learned not to talk to other supernaturals, not to form relationships, and most of all, not to trust. Until Kaster, Marclan, and Finley, 3 mercenary dragon shifters, are hired to track her down. They know there's something different about her, and that they have a contract to take her in, but even with all that, there's something about her that is... compelling. Intriguing. All-consuming. Something that, in the wrong hands, could destroy everything. A slow-burn RH fantasy romance novella.",
