  "description": "What's a girl to do when her life is in danger and the only person she can trust is a bad boy One Percenter?  Addison Delaney may be too trusting, too naive, but she's not stupid. She realizes now that she's been in denial, but when her ex-fiancé Owen turns out to be a murderous psychopath she has no one to turn to but Cutler Remes, the enigmatic and dangerous muscle of the Devil's Reapers Motorcycle Club.  Tragedy seems to follow in Addison's wake as she travels to Las Vegas seeking the protection of the club. But she gravely underestimates the power and reach of her ex-fiancé's family, and the extent to which they're willing to go for revenge. When her cousin Salem, her only family in the States, falls victim to Owen's vengeance, Addison has no one to turn to but biker bad ass Cutler.  Unfortunately for Owen, one of Cutler's brothers is gunned down in a car chase, and now the Reapers are out for blood.",
