  "title": "Genetic Suicide",
  "description": "In Genetic Suicide, new author James Cooper examines the resilient and fragile world for all its charms, heart-stopping glories, and dangerous pitfalls. Set in Florida one hundred years in the future, this action-driven plot hangs between the often-demanding cultural extremes of lifestyle versus technology, comfort versus integrity and love versus existence. Life is different in the year 2108—and eerily similar. While there have been countless advances in the human way of life, the world is in turmoil. Tabol, an extraterrestrial searching for a willing apprentice, happens upon Chris Harris, who lives life with exuberance. To save humanity, Tabol alters human DNA, which first proves destructive, but is ultimately worthwhile. As Chris risks life and limb for mankind’s survival, he is forced to sacrifice absolutely everything he holds dear.",
