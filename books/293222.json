  "description": "Two ancient courts at war. One Unseelie prince that yearns for peace.The first time I see him the world tilts off its axis. His eyes flash like quicksilver as they travel up my body. His lips, sensuous and wicked, tick up into a small smile that says I see you looking at me. I should have listened to my instincts: no one that attractive could be human.When I wake up in another realm, I very quickly learn three things about Cassiel: he's stupid hot, he's a Dark fae prince, and he's terrifying.So, like any sensible girl, I run away, looking for a way back home. But the surprises keep on coming as I try to stay alive in a world that's as beautiful as it is lethal.It turns out I’m not as mortal as I thought I was. There are secrets about my past I can't escape.And the Dark prince?He's my blood enemy.Aria Lovely’s debut novel is a sweeping, sumptuous fantasy romp with a dash of sizzling romance. If you enjoy a slow-burn enemies-to-lovers saga, the Fae Wars trilogy is for you!",
