  "description": "Perry Mason is dining peacefully at the Golden Goose cafe when he receives a mysterious phone call. The frantic woman on the other end of the line is desperate to retain Mason's services, but suddenly vanishes during their cryptic phone conversation.The only clues: a newspaper clipping about a blackmail case, and the combination to a safe scrawled on a paper. The case: a tangled web indeed, strung between an eccentric widower with something to hide, a sexy cigarette girl with plenty to cry about, a real estate broker with his own home on the selling block, a wife, a lover, and too many loose ends. The common denominator: murder, of course.",
