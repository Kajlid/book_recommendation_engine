  "description": "When my local hospital calls to say “I’m sorry to tell you this, but your husband has been in an accident” I try to explain the basics to them.1. I am not married—anymore. (Archie Dunmore is a thing of the past.)2. If there’s a husband in the hospital, it’s not mine.Except Archie is back, and he's been in an accident. One that has left him with amnesia. Yup. He believes we’re still happily married. Oh joy.Too bad for me, the doctor believes it would be best for Archie to remember things on his own. He needs familiar surroundings to heal. No big shocks.No emotional trauma.Which means I can’t tell him the truth.Archie bursts back into my life with all the warmth and joy of a freshly married man, confident that I’m the love of his life, and determined to fix the rift between us. Except how do I tell him that he walked out on me? Especially when Archie is desperately trying to remember what I’ve worked so hard to forget. What’s a girl to do with an amnesiac ex-husband at her breakfast table?",
