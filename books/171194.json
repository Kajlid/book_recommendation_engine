  "description": "Sam Wallace entered the Air Force as a spoiled, rich boy. Years later, he emerges a changed and troubled man. None of this matters to Amy, his oldest friend and staunchest supporter. Perhaps the weary soldier might finally find solace from his nightmares in the arms of the girl who has always loved him. The only thing that gives Sam hope his scarred soul might heal is the love he desperately wants, but doesn't deserve. Haunted by a war he can't forget, Sam struggles to move forward. But the darkness in Sam is greater, deeper and more dangerous than anyone realized. Can he fight off his demons, or will Amy pay the price for his inability to let her go?",
