Who is the mysterious Dougan Redhammer, and what perils are in store for Sturm, Tanin, and Palin, the young mage haunted by the legacy of Raistlin? In nine short stories by superlative writers, the companions confront wizards and dragons, magical spectacles and daggers possessed, and survive memorable encounters with the minor races of Krynn. Plus, a rolicking new novella by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman chronicling the outrageous fortunes of the next generation of heroes. The Dragonlance Saga, with three million copies sold, continues!",
