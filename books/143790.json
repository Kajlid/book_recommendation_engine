  "description": "ACE for ASIN B00KDCEAII“The blood is the life!Isn’t it?In which movie did I hear this, Dracula?Most of the things you hear in movies are crap: this one is not. The Blood is truly the life and because of that, it is in the blood that the soul wallows.”A problem with authority figures, an awful temper and a marked propensity for cursing certainly are not features that would push you to give heed to someone, but you are bound to make an exception, there is simply too much at stake.The mysterious and immortal narrator of this story has all of those flaws and he has something important to tell you. Will you listen to him?Will you open to that somebody when, least expected, he comes knocking on your door or will you save your soul?Is he really sharing the story of his life with you or is he lying to you?Come sneak a peek through the door and choose what to believe.",
