  "description": "SSA Rain Christiansen used to be the agency's golden boy. It just takes one moment of weakness, one slight, tiny, itty-bitty paranormal sighting, and all of a sudden, he's the agency's embarrassment. His boss gives him one last chance to redeem himself - go down to Brickell Bay, play nice with the local police, and leave the ghost sightings behind. Rain is determined to do exactly that, even if it kills him.  Cold-case Detective Daniel McKenna's latest investigation is going nowhere fast. Five years earlier, high school student Amy Greene went missing after leaving her part-time job and was never seen again. Daniel is glad to finally have the FBI help his department requested, even if it does come in the form of his ex.  It doesn't help that Rain is pretty sure he's falling in love with Danny all over again - if he ever stopped. Add to that the frustration of seeing ghosts at every turn while he works a case that's stalled in its tracks, and Rain is starting to wonder if second chances and happy endings are just for fairy tales.",
