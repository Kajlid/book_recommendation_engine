Near the end of life, many people--including those who have suffered brain injuries or strokes, or have been silenced by mental illness or deep dementia--experience what seems a miraculous return. They regain their clarity and energy, are able to talk with families and caregivers, recall their lives, and in some cases report conversations and details that occurred while they were unconscious or seemingly unaware of their surroundings.In this remarkable book, cognitive scientist and Director of the Viktor Frankl Institute and Viktor Frankl Archives Dr. Alexander Batthyány offers the first major account of terminal lucidity, utilizing hundreds of case studies to explore the mind, the body, the nature of consciousness, and what the living can learn from those who are crossing the border from life to death.Astonishing, authoritative, and deeply moving, Threshold opens a doorway into one of life's--and death's--most provocative mysteries.",
