  "description": "Templar Enterprises has built the Naiad, the world’s most advanced spacecraft. Poised for its maiden flight, the revolutionary single-stage orbiter promises to make space travel safe and affordable. After FBI agents raid Templar’s offices, company executive Samson Tyler uncovers a criminal scheme within his organization. As Tyler struggles to prevent a company shutdown, he discovers that others have framed him for their crimes. When a malfunction threatens to destroy the Naiad in space, events of the past and present collide - forcing Tyler to choose between his personal ambitions or exposing a deception that will change the fledgling space industry forever.\"There are thirteen federal regulatory bodies, two international organizations, and four global treaties that my legal department has to contend with on a daily basis. Believe me; we can handle a few trigger-happy G-men and an Assistant U.S. Attorney.” - Samson Tyler",
