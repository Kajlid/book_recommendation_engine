  "description": "When Scott Alan gets a phone call that his brother was hurt on a logging job, he rushes to Brian's side, only to find that his injuries are minor-but not before he meets Hank Ballam, an adrenaline-seeking logger who's an outcast among his co-workers. Hank is a study in contrast: he lives for the rush of climbing and cutting trees almost as much as he loves the peace he finds exploring the mountains he calls home. Scott's attraction to Hank is immediate and mind-blowing, and it's what Scott has always wanted: to know what it's like to love someone he can't live without. Scott needs to know if Hank's true feelings will be a roar of passion or simply a quiet friendship, one that doesn't match Scott's devotion. But it may be too late... Scott simply can't help himself from falling hard for Hank.",
