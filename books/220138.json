  "description": "Lucy is a perfectly reasonable person, up until she isn’t. She bottles up incidents, willing to forgive and forget, but when someone crosses the line, she becomes what her friends have affectionately called The Psychobitch. There’s one person who has it coming; from their very first meeting, Trick Johnson, CFO of Harris Toys, has been a contemptuous ass to her, but she held her tongue… Until her boss asks her to work with him for a month.  Trick has a huge problem. He has a life plan – a simple, straightforward plan – and the gorgeous ball-buster his best friend employs isn’t part of it in any way, shape or form. He’s managed to keep her out of sight and mostly out of mind quite successfully… Until Carter Harris makes them work together.",
