  "description": "Author's note: An updated version of the manuscript with additional editing/corrections and four new chapters has been uploaded HERE.\"TORN\" is a romantic, Regency Pride and Prejudice variation. The road to happiness is set with obstacles to overcome, making the journey more arduous for our beloved characters—and readers.Separated by pride, prejudice, and misunderstandings, betrayed by their temper and wounded by vanity, Elizabeth and Darcy take separate paths in the heat of anger—and are tormented when they must reap what they have sown.Darcy struggles to avoid the woman he loves more every day, but Fate keeps bringing them together. Elizabeth’s thoughts wander to Mr Darcy and, even in his absence, her feelings for him improve, until she realizes he is the only man in the world with whom she could be truly happy. Such revelations come far too late when both are bound by promises to others. Can they live a lifetime torn between love and duty?Stealing a moment of passion one hot summer night, how can Elizabeth and Darcy continue without the other after knowing such true happiness?Rated Moderate for hot romance but not explicit sex scenes.Lory Lilian has a golden rule when it comes to reading and writing Jane Austen fan fiction: Elizabeth and Darcy only belong to each other, with no one to separate them. This story might appear to break this rule, but the author kindly asks the readers to trust her.\"Torn\" might tear your heart out but Elizabeth and Darcy surely find a way to put it back.",
