Shay Garrett leaves her 20th-century life and boyfriend (by whom she has discovered she is pregnant) and assumes the existence of her grandmother Brandy, in the frontier days of the late 1800s. At the same time, Brandy looks into the mirror just before she is to be married to a man she does not love, and wakes up to find herself in the body of a young woman surrounded by loud music, fast cars and unfamiliar codes of conduct.",
