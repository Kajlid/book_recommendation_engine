  "description": "There is a war to save the rainforests of BorneoEarthLove, a satiric eco-adventure, chronicles the history of the global conservation movement and exposes battles pitting ego and greed versus noble intentions. Who has the power to stop the rape of the Borneo rainforest? Rich, virile senator Rod Lawrence promoting left-brain economic arguments? Proto-pagan ethnobotanist Kristin Borin who leads a sensual \"Love the Earth, Love Yourself\" movement? Or perhaps two powerful and brilliant eco-saboteurs-women who so love orangutans they attempt to destroy the oil palm industry, regardless of legal, financial, ethical, or moral consequences?EarthLove, which has been compared to Catch-22, in the way it addresses a serious issue with dark humor, highlights the hidden underbelly of the global conservation movement, links between our consumer culture and the natural world, man's seemingly insatiable greed, and the struggle to save orangutans, arguably everybody's favorite wild animal. Sochaczewski, who lived with people of the rainforest in Borneo and spent decades leading international rainforest conservation campaigns, poses critical questions about one of the most important conservation issues we face. Is there hope for the people of the rainforest? For the orangutans? For the forces of good to outlast the armies of evil?",
