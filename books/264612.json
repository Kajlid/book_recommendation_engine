Most women I know like a gentleman.Protective, opens doors, treats women with respect, typically follows the rules.But a gentleman doesn’t fall for his best friend’s woman. Current or ex.And that’s what I’ve done. During the Christmas season of all times — that magical time for decorations, gifts, family . . .Yes, the girl who was off-limits for so long, who I’ve loved all my life, has come back in town and possibly back to me.I can’t follow the gentleman rules this time. There’s too much at stake. I let her go once. I won’t let her go again.What happens under the mistletoe, stays under the mistletoe.Or does it?",
