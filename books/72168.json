  "description": "He's a resurrected World War 2 vet, and they're... any fertile woman within reach of his pheromones. Philip Young's consciousness has been recycled into an alien-enhanced body designed to rapidly breed a more evolved wave of humanity. Every woman who gets him in bed (or any other flat surface!) finds herself swelling rapidly with a belly-full of eggs, each one just as phenomenally irresistible to fertile women as Phil himself.This 22,000 word novella involves pregnancy, rapid growth, egg-laying, and a lot of sex.",
