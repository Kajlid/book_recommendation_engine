  "description": "WHO WOULD YOU BECOME IF LIFE GAVE YOU A SECOND CHANCE? What would you do if your world was turned upside down? If the things that defined who you were as a person were stripped from you, leaving nothing more than an empty shell of forgotten dreams and regret, for the road never taken? Carnegie Lane found herself in that very situation when her husband left her for a younger woman. She runs away from the comfort of her trendy Sydney suburb, dragging four reluctant children with her and heads for Bundaberg. All in the hope of disappearing completely. Instead of getting lost, she finds a talent she never knew she had, a Rock Star who loves her like she never believed possible and a journey to make her dreams come true that will take your breath away. “Suddenly and unexpectedly, Carnegie Lane, mother of four and idol to inanimate objects, found herself in the most unlikely place.”\"Carnegie Lane is a book about a book, and a few 100 songs!\"Maree Furniss - Publisher and editor!",
