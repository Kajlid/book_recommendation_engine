  "title": "They Lived With God: Life Stories Of Some Devotees of Sri Ramakrishna",
  "description": "This Book narrates in great detail the attraction held by Sri Ramakrishna over lay disciples by the power and depth of his spirituality. It is interesting to note that these lay disciples even after Swami Ramakrishna's death continued to live the same transformed lives. They accepted him as as a Divine Incarnation, as God manifest in human form. This Books presents a more complete picture of Ramakrishna himself, including many new stories about life which have never been recorded in English.",
