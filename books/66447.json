  "description": "Are you Brave Enough to Face the Shadow?Only humans with the purest and brightest souls can resist the beautiful facades of Cipes, vicious soul-stealing shadows from a black realm. The Cipes covet these humans. If caught, Cipes do worse than torture and devour them, they transform the pure ones into soulless demons. But there is hope: the Traveler and his Hunter. The Traveler is a powerful being from the Cipes' realm. He is the last one with the capability to kill the demons. He and his companion seek out and destroy the evil shadow within each of the Cipes.During their journey, the Traveler and the Hunter come across Dr. Marc Belize and Professor Bryan Johnson. Haunted by their tragic pasts, the two men have more in common than the untimely deaths of their loved ones. They are intertwined with the demons. The men's survival and souls depend on being able to embrace their fates while unlocking the dangerous mystery that surrounds them.Like Jim Butcher's and Ann Rice's novels, Chasing Evil's Shadow is fast-paced with twists that keep readers on the edge of their seats.",
