  "description": "I’ll tell you a secret, Delilah.It doesn’t happen often, but when I doubt myself, I seal my eyes shut. When I do, the blackness inside is replaced by images of you— I see is the silk of your hair, falling gently onto your shoulder; the way you smile at me when you want to break through the tough exterior I show to the world. At those moments my heart swells and races, and my thoughts replicate themselves until I have more than I know what to do with. They all involve you. They all wear your beauty. They all smell like your skin. And the darkness is chased away.We’ve been through so much together, but the best and worst is yet to come. You left everything behind to follow me into my world—a world of scoundrels, bikers, killers, and gangsters. We survived together, but I lost a part of myself in the process. With my wounds still healing you offered me solace, offered me peace, offered me an opportunity to be the man I always knew that I could be. I want to be a Wordsmith—to tell people our story. It’s one for the ages.*Not Intended for readers under 18!",
