  "title": "Palekh: The State Museum of Palekh Art",
  "description": "The album The State Museum of Palekh Art is devoted to original Russian folk art. Palekh craftsmen today use the hereditary icon-painting skills of their fathers to make miniatures [paintings] on papier-mache lacquer wares that sparkle with exquisite colors. The subjects of these pictures are images inspired by poetry and fairy tales and scenes of contemporary life. The album presents the most interesting exhibits from the Palekh Museum for samples of present-day miniature painting.",
