  "description": "My past is a poisoned prayer... Whispered to me by a devil with an angel’s smile. Twelve years ago, he stole me from the streets, Only to leave me stranded in a nightmare. Luca Esposito isn’t just a painful memory. He’s a front-page headline—an accused killer. And I’m the public defender who set him free. Once again, I'm trapped in his web with blood on my hands. But I didn’t crawl out of the fire to be tossed into an inferno. There’s a new nightmare coming, And this time we’ll be stranded together. They cast the first stone… We’ll cast the last. My Heaven. His Hell. Our final sin.Cast Stones is an extremely dark and taboo romance novella with multiple triggers such as sexual assault (not by the hero) and referenced child abuse. This book is not for the faint of heart. If you are easily offended or triggered, PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Remember, you have been warned.",
