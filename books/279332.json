  "title": "A Fair Country: Telling Truths About Canada",
  "description": "In this startlingly original vision of Canada, renowned thinker John Ralston Saul argues that Canada is a MÃ©tis nation, heavily influenced and shaped by Aboriginal ideas: Egalitarianism, a proper balance between individual and group, and a penchant for negotiation over violence are all Aboriginal values that Canada absorbed. An obstacle to our progress, Saul argues, is that Canada has an increasingly ineffective elite, a colonial non-intellectual business elite that doesn't believe in Canada. It's critical we recognize these aspects of the country in order to rethink its future.",
