  "description": "What If Jesus Had Not Come Until Today?Who Would Follow Him?Who Would Kill Him?A fiery car crash hurls TV journalist Conrad Davis into another world exactly like ours except for one detail―Jesus Christ did not come 2,000 years ago, but today.Starting with angels heralding a birth in the back of a motel laundry room, the skeptical Davis watches the gospel unfold in today’s society as a Messiah in T-shirt and blue jeans heals, raises people from the dead, and speaks such startling truth that he captures the heart of a nation.But the young man's actions and his criticism of the religious establishment earn him enemies as ruthless as they are powerful.An intense and thought-provoking novel, Eli strips away religious tradition to present Jesus fresh and unvarnished. With gripping immediacy, Bill Myers weaves a story whose truth will refresh your faith.",
