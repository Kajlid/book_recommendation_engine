  "description": "Ten years ago, an impulsive eighteen-year-old Shay White kissed Caleb Martinher brother's best friend. The resulting chemistry was hot enough to send Caleb running. Now he's backan ex-special forces operative getting his skydiving business off the ground. But Shay figures that all that sexual tension was a \"forbidden fruit\" sort of thing. A simple kiss should put that fantasy to rest, right?Wrong. Instead, Shay and Caleb find themselves caught in a web of need and decide to finally do something about itin the most exquisitely carnal way possible. Now Shay and Caleb are tumbling into a lust-fueled freefallare they headed for a safe landing or the kind of crash that will change their lives forever?",
