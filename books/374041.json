In a highly personal style, he shares the revelations, discoveries, and growth he discovered by his father's deathbed.In our world of highly effective medicine and life-support, most of us will face difficult and wrenching decisions at some When does life begin and end? What are the complexions of distinction between bare and primitive \"life\" on the one hand, and \"human-ness\" on the other hand? Where and when and how do we \"play God\" with our decisions to provide or withhold feeding tubes and respirators? How do we face these questions, and work our way to effective answers?Woven through the story are descriptions of magical and mystical encounters that inform and guide the life of the narrator, helping to open honest questions about how religion aids and obstructs the journey through faith that most of us explore.AWARD",
