  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B00N5XZM7U. Other editions can be found here and here Psychic and paranormal PI Harper Hall isn't that surprised when her business partner skips town. The moral of the story: never trust a guy named Romeo.  But if Harper wants to consult for the police on a high profile case, she'll need a new partner-- preferably one with some supernatural skills of his own. Enter Noah Riddick, a slayer left jobless by the legalization of vampirism.  Riddick's dark secrets and shady past forced him into exile from human society--an exile he was comfortable with until gorgeous and exasperating Harper waltzed into his life. Now, all too aware of how...unlifelike his life has truly been, he agrees to partner with her. (As if saying no to Harper Hall was ever really an option).  Fighting vampires, making immortal enemies, engaging in semi-sadistic interrogation techniques, staging daring rescues...it's all in a day's work for this paranormal odd couple. But falling in love? Well...that's a little trickier. Even for the Semi-Charmed Harper Hall.  Semi-Charmed is a full-length, adult paranormal romance novel, completely free of cliffhangers, and filled with kick-ass heroines, sexy alpha males, nerdy pop culture references, and plenty of laughs. Oh, and snark. Lots and lots of snark. (And just so you know, the dog lives. No dogs will ever die in my books. Pinkie swear!)",
