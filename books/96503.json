  "title": "Win No Matter What: A Guide to Hyping Up Your Life",
  "description": "Whether we like it or not, our daily life routine can quickly turn into a repetitive mechanical process of dullness. When we go to school, work, or practice, do we actually engage 100 percent in the activities that we decide to take on? Well, probably not. The reason for this is our level of engagement in an activity is constantly influenced by mood, attitude, and the staggering number of people that we interact with throughout the day. In other words, the terrible trio-mood, attitude, and those around us-subjects us to the mechanical motions of life. Perhaps the most comforting thing, though, is that as independent human beings, we have the ability to determine which parts of the trio actually end up affecting our everyday lives. This guide to hyping up your life provides several incredible tips on how to own the terrible trio. Once you implement these strategies in your life, nothing can bring you down. You can win-no matter what.",
