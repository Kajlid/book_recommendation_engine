  "description": "WSJ bestselling author Ilsa Madden-Mills returns with an all-new, enemies-to-lovers second chance romance between the football hottie and the feisty nerd girl he can’t forget.  I want you . . . even when I hate you.  Blaze Townsend: I hate you. Charisma Rossi: I hate you more.  She’s been expecting this ever since their latest showdown. She had good reason.  Hottest guy she’s ever seen. Former fling. Dumped her in front of all her friends. At her own party.  So no, she’s not about to forgive and forget just because he sits next to her in class. He thinks all he has to do is turn on those baby blues, and she’ll melt right back into his arms. Please. She’d be crazy to let this cocky player affect her again. (Tell that to her body.)  Charisma Rossi. Brainy girl with a dash of bad. The one who got under his skin. The one he cut loose.  Blaze knows she’s the riskiest prospect at Waylon University, but none of the interchangeable girls he hooks up with have ever made him feel the way she did. There’s absolutely no way he can have the girl and the game.  So why can’t he stop trying to win her back?  Can this wide receiver score the girl or will he make the biggest fumble of his life?  *Steamy and flirty with all the emotional feels, I Hate You is a new adult standalone romance.",
