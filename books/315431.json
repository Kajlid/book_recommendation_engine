  "description": "Vlad is the most powerful vampire that has ever died and he has depression. So he starts a support group for the supernatural. When a banshee, a ghost, a werewolf, a zombie, a witch, and a faerie all appear for guidance, Vlad realises the scale of what he’s begun, and no amount of coffee and snacks will be enough to satisfy their hunger for self-worth and meaning from beyond the grave.When secrets darker than the emptiness of Vlad’s soul emerge, the Support Group is thrust from one shocking situation to the next. Twists, turns, blood, and neuroses worsen as the most dysfunctional of pseudo-families grows, but what happens when one of their own no longer thinks they can carry on being dead? Moving on is not so easy when reality’s convinced you already have…From religion and ponderings on life to revolting fried chicken shops and Jaffa cakes; from a deadly battle between vampire and werewolf to text messages gone wrong; from humans discovering where they don’t belong to monsters finding hope in unlikely places: Blood and Biscuits is dark, funny, and like nothing else out there.",
