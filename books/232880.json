  "title": "The Non-Disclosure Agreement",
  "description": "I left my old life-and my broken heart-back in Michigan. When I moved to New York City for a fresh start, I didn't know I would be made a sinful offer I couldn't refuse... My billionaire businessman boss has decided that being the most powerful man on the East Coast isn't enough. He needs political power too. But who would vote for a womanizing playboy with a different model on his arm every week? If he wants to win, he needs a respectable wife...he needs me. I have the looks, the small-town charm-I'm already his employee, and I've already signed a non-disclosure agreement, making me the perfect choice. But am I willing to pretend to be even more? And will there come a point when pretending isn't enough?",
