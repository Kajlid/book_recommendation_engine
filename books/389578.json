  "title": "More than a Mistress/No Man's Mistress",
  "description": "From New York Times bestselling author Mary Balogh come two classic tales of Regency-era romance, where scandalous liaisons kindle passions too powerful to conceal. MORE THAN A MISTRESSHired to serve as nursemaid to the wounded Duke of Tresham, Jane Ingleby tries to pretend it’s strictly a business arrangement. Surely there could be nothing more perilous than being the lover of such a man. Yet when she gets past his devilish façade and sees the noble heart within, she knows the greatest jeopardy of all—a passion that drives her to risk everything on one perfect month with an improper gentleman who thinks that love is for fools.  NO MAN’S MISTRESSLord Ferdinand Dudley is accustomed to getting what he wants—until he tries to claim his rightful estate from the bewitching Lady Viola Thornhill. Refusing to cede him the home she calls her own—and unwilling to consider marriage—Viola knows that this is a battle she cannot afford to lose. Each day under the same roof brings its share of frustration—and temptation—as both sides in this contest of wills find their resolve melting in the heat of passion’s bright flame.",
