  "description": "On the tiny Caribbean island of Mill Walk, the rich play tennis, polo and golf, trying to ignore the distasteful, uncomfortable adn irritating realities of life. So when Tom Pasmore, the grandson of a powerful establishment figure, develops a passion for detective work - particularly murder cases - his reputation undergoes a subtle darkening. And his growing friendship with his strange neighbour, Lamont von Heilitz, the once-famous 'amateur of crime', only adds to Mill Walk society opinion that Tom Pasmore is perhaps not entirely reliable. One murder in particular fascinates Tom - the 1925 killing of Jeanine Thielman at Eagle Lake, a resort patronized only by the cream of the island's upper crust community. But when he starts investigating the case, Tom arouses much more than mere disapproval. On the edge of a sinister web of corruption, deceit and violence, he is in danger of uncovering the darkest secrets of the people who own and run Mill Walk.",
