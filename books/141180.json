  "description": "Public Offerings continues as the threat to Liv Clement and the Lokoma village mounts in this second of four installments, The Price of a Life.... Revenge! Claire McQuaid has been obsessed with it for decades. Now, as the CEO of a large pharmaceutical firm, she holds the future of the world in her hands. She and powerful associates in banking and oil assemble an ingenious plan designed to wipe out AIDS and malaria…or so it appears. The real mission is far more sinister. Millions of innocent people will be sacrificed to accomplish the vengeful plot behind the plan. There’s one problem: Dave Clement… Survival! Dave has dedicated his career to wiping out AIDS. Claire needs his network and skills to execute her grand scheme. Dave's conscience won't allow it. So Claire forces Dave to make a choice no father ever wants to face: keep her secret and help the plot advance unimpeded – or lose Liv, his 15 year old daughter, to the very disease he set out to eradicate. This breathtaking roller coaster ride ascends the snowy peaks of northern Colorado and hurtles through the rainforests of West Africa as Claire and her associates drive their new world order forward. With everything that ever mattered to him on the line, Dave races the clock to outwit the powerful plotters and to save Liv.  Public Offerings won the prestigious Writers League of Texas manuscript contest for best thriller. It is available in four parts as a serial eBook novel. This volume, Public Offerings Part 2: The Price of a Life, is the second installment. All four parts can now be purchased in one volume in the Kindle store under the title Public Offerings: Complete.",
