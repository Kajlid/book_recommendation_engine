  "title": "Evangeline's Fantasy Man",
  "description": "At a very young age, Evangeline Anderson had fallen madly in love with a handsome, tall, dark, romantic figure, while slowly steering her horse through the woods and daydreaming about the man shead one day marry. Since then, the place became like a shrine to her, and she visited the spot often in hopes of seeing him again. Though the sightings were few, and always from afar, she never stopped fantasizing about him. Not even after he growled at her to get off his property, making her feel like she was not worthy to be on the same ground as he. Now, many years later, Evangeline finally meets her fantasy man. But Jerald Drake does not believe in love. He always gets what he wants, and what he wants now is Evangeline, the rare, enchanting beauty dressed in the ruby-red gown. Will either of them get what they want, or will they lose one another forever?",
