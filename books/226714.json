  "description": "Three months ago, Romy emerged from the cultivation tanks after a year floating inside. Body intact. Mind broken. Memory gone. Now she undergoes regular testing as doctors work to find out ... well, she’s not exactly sure what. The tests must have something to do with the reason she can’t remember her knot—the single lucid memory the other insane soldiers on Orbito Four still possess. Whatever the researchers are searching for, if it aids the soldiers in the deathly war against the lethal alien invaders—the Critamal—the excruciating pain is worth it. But a grey-eyed man has other plans. Boxed in and caught, Romy is taken hostage by people who shouldn’t exist! They dress in black and carry weapons she’s never seen in her genetically enhanced life. Reunited with Knot 27. Memories returned. *********************************************Fifteen months have passed since her world shattered into bright red, ringing chaos. Things have changed—people have changed. How long until what was once as familiar as breathing is familiar once more?  Friendships. Love. Freedom. Can the new Romy reconcile with the old, or will the two halves of herself remain locked in an internal battle?And if a victor should arise from this silent war . . . will it be the part of her that kills without hesitation, without mercy? All it takes is for the cracks to join and blood will pour.... The Return releases June 29th.",
