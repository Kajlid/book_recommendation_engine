  "description": "From Harm and Medical Execution of Joseph Zima  by Mark M. Zima By conservative standards medical errors are the third-leading cause of death in United States. They are more likely  the  leading cause of death in the country.   From Harm and The Medical Execution of Joseph Zima  is the story of one of those casualties and why healthcare is failing in America.  Joseph Zima, a few years after retirement, began experiencing some chest pain. Diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse and assured by his surgeon that surgery was only a low risk,   he underwent surgery. During the surgery Mr. Zima suffered a stroke. This stroke was the first in a series of medical missteps and malpractices that would include eight hospitals, nine other strokes, and his heart stopping for fifteen minutes. His treatment ultimately resulted in his death.  It was a death sentence that spanned one hundred ninety days of pain and suffering; not only for Joseph Zima, but for his family.Do medical professionals play a part in the skyrocketing cost of healthcare? Do doctors always know best? Can the medical merry-go-round be avoided? Are all medical professionals victims of frivolous lawsuits? How do I avoid such suffering?  From Harm and Injustice  addresses these questions as it unfolds the medical care and death of Joseph Zima.",
