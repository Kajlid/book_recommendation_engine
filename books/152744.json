  "description": "In a life full of yes, no is the sexiest word he's ever heard.David Beauchamp might as well be in jail. After one too many misunderstandings with the law, he's chained to the city by the GPS and alcohol sensor strapped to his ankle. Awaiting trial, cut off from usual forms of entertainment, he goes looking for a nameless sexual encounter and winds up with almost more than he can handle.Reality comes crashing back the next day with a summons for another random drug test, and the man behind the badge turns out to be the very man who took him for one hell of a ride.Probation Officer Tai Fonoti is used to handling other people's problems, but he's horrified when one of the clients his boss dumps on him is the sweet piece of ass he screwed the night before. It makes getting a urine sample a pretty loaded situation.That single encounter left Beach craving Tai's unique brand of control and discipline. But while Tai relishes laying down the law in the bedroom, the letter of the law stands between them and kinkily ever after.Warning: This book is kinky. I mean kinky. With lots of sex. It describes a fully consensual, intense D/s relationship which changes a character's life. It includes impact play and bondage along the way to a very happily ever after.",
