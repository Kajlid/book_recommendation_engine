  "description": "The Last Ryder, indie author, Damien B. Feral’s debut novel is a grand and occasionally dark tale about fate. The first book in the series, with its clever links to many well-known and much loved fairytales, opens the story of a girl on an epic journey. Harmony Ryder is about to turn fourteen when she receives a letter bequeathing her Darkfern Cottage. What starts out as a wish coming true soon turns into a matter of life and death and sees her, unwittingly, cross The Webway into a world ruled by witches.Her journey will be dangerous, deadly even, and surviving won’t be easy…not when Nocturna and Natura, the two ruling queens, want her dead and most of their subjects are only too willing to oblige the request. With allies in short supply she must learn to trust her instincts and stand on her own two feet if she’s going to become who she was born to be…the last Ryder.",
