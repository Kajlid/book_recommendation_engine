  "title": "The Bullpen Gospels: Major League Dreams of a Minor League Veteran",
  "description": "From the humble heights of a Class-A pitcher's mound to the deflating lows of sleeping on his gun-toting grandmother's air mattress, veteran reliever Dirk Hayhurst steps out of the bullpen to deliver the best pitch of his career--a raw and unflinching account of his life in the minor leagues. Whether training tarantulas to protect his room from thieving employees in a backwater hotel or absorbing the gentle mockery of some not-quite-starstruck schoolchildren, Hayhurst reveals a side of baseball--and life--rarely seen on television. Upon its release, The Bullpen Gospels became a New York Times bestseller; and with comparisons to Jim Boutons's Ball Four, The Bullpen Gospels is slated to be a classic of the genre.",
