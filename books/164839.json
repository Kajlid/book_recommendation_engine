  "description": "A Master Chef's Signature BookAvailable in paperback for the first time in a decade, The New York Times 60-Minute Gourmet is the bestselling cookbook that catapulted Pierre Franey into the front ranks of American chefs. After a successful career as a restaurant chef, Franey became a food writer for The New York Times in 1975, accepting the challenge to write a regular column featuring recipes that would take less than an hour to prepare. Through his column and the cookbooks that soon followed, Franey created a national sensation with his revolutionary style of cooking, and American kitchens haven't been the same since. The presentation of quick, healthy, and enjoyable meals was a revelation, introducing the home cook to choices beyond spending hours in the kitchen or settling for \"fast food.\" This cookbook -- the first that collected his New York Times recipes -- captures all that was great about Pierre Franey's fresh, flavorful, low-fat ingredients, ease of preparation, and the injunction \"Don't spend all evening in the kitchen!\"  As a step-by-step guide to better cooking and delicious eating, this great cookbook allows all cooks to employ Pierre Franey's signature methods and create memorable meals in their own homes.",
