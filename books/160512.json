  "description": "Hunger is irrepressible. One can only ignore it for so long, and then the emptiness refuses to let go. The ache to be filled becomes a constant companion, with an opinion on every thing—and everyone—one sees. After that, hunger eclipses all other considerations. All other sensations dull, all other thoughts fade. There's only the hungry, demanding flesh and its strange appetites.Presented for your consumption are eleven tales of hunger and obsession. Here are jaded sexual adventurers, lost souls, frustrated dreamers, and a few who find themselves willing to pay any price to survive. There are monsters, as well, but they aren't always the villains.Take this book home to devour at your leisure. Nibble just one story a night, or wolf the whole thing down at once, however satisfies your desire. And if, when you're done, something doesn't feel quite right, ask yourself: What's eating you?Jaded Appetites by Richard FreemanOasis Beckoning by Jacqueline BrockerFrogger Says by Konrad HartmannBlack Paint by Nobilis ReedHunter's Tree by Konrad HartmannWitch's Price by Ann GimpelStrange Hospitality by Kailin MorganRavening Season by Jacqueline BrockerSleep of Reason by Richard FreemanScreen Siren by Annabeth LeongLittle Henna Hair by R.W.
