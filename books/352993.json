  "description": "Humans are animals. When three biologists are captured in the remote woods of northern New Hampshire and forced to make pornographic videos, they are surprised by their own response—biology overrides fear and inhibition and primal desire takes over. When they escape and resume their normal lives, they find the animal passions they conjured are not so easily forgotten. Even though it was the young intern, Kevin, that Jessy was forced to be with during their captivity, it’s Conrad she’s crazy about, and has been since he took over the job as the fisheries crew foreman. After a summer of watching his gorgeous 6’5” body keep a cool distance, Jessy hopes the abduction has opened his eyes. Maybe he'll finally be ready to give a relationship a try. But their kidnappers are not happy with the way their three porn stars ran away. Just when Jessy’s aimless existence seems to be finding focus—on Conrad—she finds herself the target of more dangerous games.Humans are animals. And sometimes...they're prey.Publisher's Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language, and situations that some readers may find objectionable.
