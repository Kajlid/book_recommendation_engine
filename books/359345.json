  "description": "I’m looking for Mr. Right. Date after blind date, they’re all duds. None of them meet the requirements on my Man List. Until Dex James. My brain? It says he’s all kinds of wrong. He’s young. In town on vacation. A lazy billionaire. He’d only be a fling. A muse for the spicy book I’m writing. Nothing more. My body? It’s telling me to jump that big piece of man candy. Check off guy-given O’s from the list with Mr. Right Now. Which is right? Maybe neither. Maybe my heart has to decide because it turns out Dex is so much more than I ever imagined. Maybe Mr. Right Now could be Mr. Right after all. Find out who wins in this steamy small town, reverse age gap game of love. With all the books in the On A Manhunt series, it’s open season on men.",
