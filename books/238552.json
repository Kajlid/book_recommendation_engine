  "description": "He’s an ultra-private, ridiculously handsome Crown Prince. I’m an anti-royal blogger who insults his family for a living. So why did he just ask me to move in with him?Prince Arthur claims it’s so he can win over his ‘harshest critic,’ but let’s just say I’m skeptical to say the least. What does he really want? What if the rumors of a dungeon in the palace basement are true and I’m about to wind up shackled to the wall for insinuating the royals are an inbred plague on society? What if he says, “Off with her head!” as soon as I walk through the door? The smart move would be to turn him down. But I can hardly do that. Not with the entire kingdom waiting for my answer. Lucky for me, having me beheaded isn’t on his regal to-do list. Unfortunately, what happens is nearly as bad because I’m falling for him. Hard. And it seems like he’s falling for me too. I must put a stop to this, like right freaking now. A relationship with him will cost me my career (and every shred of pride I’ve got). Besides, I can’t trust my sworn enemy. He’s got all kinds of reasons to pretend he has feelings for me. And yet I don’t seem to be doing anything to keep a safe distance. In fact, I’m doing whatever I can to be with him every chance I get… The Royal Treatment is a swoon-worthy, snort-laugh-inducing fairy tale featuring a woman so far out of her comfort zone, she can’t even see it from here, a prince who makes all the right moves for all the wrong reasons, and the cutest pet pig to ever roam the halls of a palace.",
