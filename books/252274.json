  "description": "Donovan Beckett is a recluse who wants no commitments or entanglements of any kind. He works hard to ensure no one can penetrate the wall he’s carefully constructed around himself—until the day his new neighbor stumbles into him. It isn’t anything like instant love. Far from it. Eden Avery doesn’t want to be curious about her neighbor. He’s the most infuriating and closed-off person she’s ever met—not to mention the rudest. She doesn’t want to find the uptight bastard irresistible and she shouldn’t be able to sense the minute he’s within spitting distance, but does. She really shouldn’t fantasize about his hands on her body, but that’s happening too. They can fight it all they want, but nothing can stop the mutual attraction that’s about to disrupt both of their lives.",
