  "description": "Ten thousand kilometers, two Australians, twelve weeks, and one 47 year old Fiat 500. The Great Fiat Hunt was a slow trip from London through Italy over three months in our own 1967 Fiat 500 “Gina, searching for one of its most iconic vehicles, and the people who own and love them. What was once a ‘hey wouldn’t it be cool to…’ idea years ago, turned into the Great Fiat Hunt. Covering 10,000km, we travelled from the North down the middle to the southernmost tip of Italy and across to Sicily and Sardinia. All the while scouring for Fiat 500’s. While we had some pre-arranged meetups with other Fiat 500 owners, the aim was to track down the owner when we came across a Fiat 500 on the road. We knocked on doors, approached many locals, and serendipity often played a part, setting in motion yet another adventure to add to the one we were already on - these were some of the most memorable moments. The book is hardcover, and with 208 pages it is a mixture of selected stories accompanied with photographs of our time on the road and interviews with fellow Fiat 500 owners. It is written in English and Italian.",
