  "description": "Kendra Henson is a twenty-eight year old independent professional black woman fed up and frustrated with the state of her relationships with black men. Kendra takes issue with how she and other single black women are treated on a daily basis by men that should be holding them in high esteem. Even one of her closest girlfriends disappointed Kendra with a show of disrespect related to her status as an unmarried woman. Without warning Kendra suddenly found herself the object of attention from two men that could not be more different and she could make an impulsive decision that would lose a man like one she had been seeking for years.",
