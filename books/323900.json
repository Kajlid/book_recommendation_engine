I don’t know how, but I will get myself out of here, even if it’s the last thing I do.Giovanni will not win this, and I won’t stop until my fingers are curled around his throat and my knife is sinking into his flesh.

I will lose myself, and I like this new life too much to give up on it now.This wicked game of life and death just took a turn for the worst and in this war, loyalties will be tested, but just as in war—not everybody will make it out alive.Eenie, meenie, miny, moe.Which DeAngelis has got to go?Depraved Sinners is a New Adult, Dark, Reverse Harem, Contemporary Romance series.
