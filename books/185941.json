  "description": "Out of the terrifying mists, Anita Vance, saw the ancient House of Moline for the first time. In place of the warm welcome she had expected, she was treated as an uninvited intruder. Hoping to be greeted by her new husband, she was formally ushered into a great hall where a coffin rested ominously on an ornate catafalque. Twenty flickering candles illuminated the face of a dead man. The face was her husband. Desperate and alone, surrounded by unfriendly relatives, she knew with fearful certainty that the unnamed menace which had taken the life of her husband would soon reappear and threaten her own life.",
