  "title": "The Quiet Place",
  "description": "There, across the distance, sitting upon a hill surrounded by a very well groomed and beautifully manicured field with large oak trees scattered sparsely about, giving it a remarkably panoramic view, was the mansion called The Quiet Place. It was given that name by a very wealthy southern gentleman, who in 1875 was traveling with his family when his wife noticed the area and said how quiet and peaceful it looked. He subsequently bought the piece of land for her, and a year afterward had the mansion built. They lived in it for thirty years, and although they never had any children they were happy, loving, peaceful years. The mansion was left to the state when they died, as too, approximately four million dollars. The only specifics was that the mansion not be destroyed, so it was transformed into a rest home for the elderly. It remained so for approximately ten years until that fatal day it burned down, killing everyone inside while a lone figure stood and watched, then hung himself from one of the oak trees. The place was never rebuilt, but yet, there it stood as beautiful as it was the day it was constructed, and it was now 1991, one hundred and sixteen years later.",
