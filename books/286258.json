Hate. Love.*Siena Calabrese’s life revolved around cooking numbers and scrubbing books clean until Johnathan rolled through her life like a hurricane. A woman is only useful to men in the mafia, if she isn’t totally useless. If she does what they want, then she can maintain the illusion of freedom. But how much is she willing to risk, how far will she go, for the man with secrets that sets her heart on fire?Betrayal. Loyalty. New York’s streets won’t be the same. A war is coming. *Note: John + Siena: The Complete Duet features the full-length novels Loyalty and Disgrace, as well as the companion novella, John + Siena: Extended.",
