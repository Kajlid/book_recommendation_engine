  "description": "David and Nathan are twin brothers who just can't seem to keep a babysitter around for long-they've had 347 after all. Or is it 734?Either way . . . there's got to be someone who can handle these two. Martin Healey Discount, or “Murray Poopins” as the boys dub him. When they first meet, Martin is all business-well, business and a very bushy mustache. The boys must brush their teeth and clean their rooms and there is absolutely no television allowed. But is there more to Martin than meets the eye? When David and Nathan's parents leave, the twins aren't the only ones acting like children . . .From the hilarious mind of Alan Katz comes a brand-new series with a cast of characters that will tickle more than your upper lip.",
