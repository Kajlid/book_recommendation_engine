  "description": "Mandy Hope and James know how desperately Ben Hardwick wants a puppy of his own. He watches the dog rescue programme, \"Give A Dog A Home\", every week without fail! But when Ben phones the TV hotline to offer a gorgeous spaniel a home, he gets turned down. To add to his problems, Ben's mum is making it quite clear that she is not keen on getting a pet at all - it looks as though poor Ben will never have his dreamed-for puppy. But Mandy is determined to convince Mrs Hardwick that puppies aren't always noisy and messy - it's just a question of Ben picking the right one for him and his mum! At last, a visit to a special dog home brings a result, and Ben gets an adorable Spaniel Surprise!",
