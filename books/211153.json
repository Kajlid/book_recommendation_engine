But how is it that his native timeline is so different from the one he left behind? Can Spidey escape his tormentors, find a way back to the past and fix the future? Or will the Sinister Six reign supreme in 2099? Meanwhile, Roberta Mendez, aka Captain America 2099, returns to her own time in a bid to find her family. But little does she know that the heroes of this era are being hunted. Will this be the end of 2099 as we know it? And what does it all have to do with Civil War II?Collecting: Spider-Man 2099 #11-16",
