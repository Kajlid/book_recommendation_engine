  "description": "This book is no longer available.Liam O’Shaughnessy wasn't expecting to fall in love again, not so soon after yet another painful break up. Then Oliver Sutton, paramedic in training, walked into his Aunt's Irish Pub, and shocked Liam's wounded heart back to life. The fiery eyes were irresistible; the magnetic draw between them was undeniable, but the man himself was an enigma. Still, Oliver had much to teach Liam, and Liam was a very willing pupil. Oliver Sutton only expected to have a brief, summer fling with Liam O’Shaughnessy, but as the young waiter eagerly learned all about gay sexual pleasure, Oliver felt less and less willing to give him up. Yet Oliver knew the relationship could not last. Sooner or later, Liam would come to know Oliver’s other, less civilized self, and that would be the end. Unbeknownst to Oliver, however, Liam, too, had another self, one he also was keeping secret: his twin.",
