  "description": "In the second book of the series, Grae Barragns, an officer in the Laraytian Standards, leads a squad of misfits into the forest of Maug Maurai to slay the marauding Beast within. His soldiers fight with one another and the civilians on the squad refuse to follow military decorum, but Grae's greatest struggle is with himself. The secret secondary assignment he was given shreds his conscience, and the beautiful archer that joined his squad keeps him unfocused. As the squad of Standards marches ever deeper into the lethal forest, the hero Black Murrogar struggles to lead a group of lords and ladies out. The contentious Sir Wyann continues to challenge his every decision and the nobles all but lose their will to live. But Murrogar's greatest threat is a creature from his worst nightmares; a creature that stalks the group, killing them one by one and reveling in their terror. Home is a only a dozen miles away for Murrogar, but to reach it he must get past the Beast of Maug Maurai.",
