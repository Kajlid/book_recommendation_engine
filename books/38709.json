  "title": "Small g: A Summer Idyll",
  "description": "Finally published in the United States ten years after Patricia Highsmith's death, Small g, in the words of her biographer Andrew Wilson, is an \"extended fairy tale suggesting that…happiness is precarious and…romance should be embraced.\"In unmistakable Highsmithian fashion, the novel opens in a seedy Zurich bar with the brutal murder of Peter Ritter. Unraveling the vagaries of love, sexuality, jealousy, and death, Highsmith weaves a mystery both hilarious and astonishing, a classic tale executed with her characteristic penchant for darkness. Small g is at once an exorcism of Highsmith's literary demons and a revelatory capstone to a wholly remarkable career. It is a delightfully incantatory work that, in the tradition of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, shows us how bizarre and unpredictable love can be.",
