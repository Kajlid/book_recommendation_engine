  "description": "**This is book 2 of the Unbroken Series and it is recommended that you read book 1 Escaping Heartbreak first, before reading book 2**Sometimes in life we can’t help who we fall in love with, no matter how hard we try. No matter what type of person they make us become. Wren Porter knew that first hand. Her best friend’s brother, Dane Evans’ was the only guy she’d ever had eyes for. He was, “The One.” The one she was supposed to marry someday. To grow old with, but it was hard to love someone that would never love her back. After revealing to Dane that their one-night-stand had resulted in a pregnancy, she knew that the baby would be her only real link to the boy she loved. After tragedy strikes, Wren was left feeling like her heart would be broken forever. But hearts were made to mend, and people were made to love. And when an unexpected person comes into her life, it forces her to feel, something she hasn’t done in a long time. She thought it was too soon, and that she wasn’t ready. What she didn’t know was that love doesn’t come when you expect it or when you’re ready. It came crashing in at the craziest of times, and when you thought you’d never be able to love again. Would she ever fully recover from the boy that would forever cause her heartbreak? Because the green-eyed boy wanted her whole heart and nothing less? It’s time to stop running, stop hiding, and start learning where the true escape lies. Everyone will face heartbreak, but not everyone will find love.Recommended for ages 18+ due to graphic language, sexual content, & mature subject matter.",
