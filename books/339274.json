  "description": "\"When the dragon came to claim him, Karl knew his great plan had gone horribly wrong. If he had known the creature was real, he wouldn't have scoffed at the villagers ... and he certainly wouldn't have been so quick to let them chain him to a rock. Mattaen Initiates trained as warriors, but no man could defeat a dragon. She had vanquished the beast and named her one night with the virgin sacrifice she'd saved. He'd taken a vow of chastity, but Karl still had a man's needs--and Elera's sultry curves made him ache to taste his first woman. With a scorching kiss she shattered his defenses ... and led him into a world of deception and seduction, where he'd be forced to choose between the brotherhood that had raised him and the woman whose courage set his heart on fire.\"--p.
