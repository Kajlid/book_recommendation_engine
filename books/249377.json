  "description": "It is the summer of 2028, well into the third term of the president.  In the small town of Lockhart, Texas, 15 year-old Jesse Cartwell finds a sleeved newspaper in the driveway of the trailer home he shares with his dad. But the paper is not supposed to come today. This is a special delivery, and the headline reads just one word in giant, bold print:  RESIST  Jesse has grown up in a town where no one questions their country and everyone fears the Lord. It is a place where young men in red caps patrol the streets in pickup trucks, enforcing one law above all else: Do what you are told.  This summer he will meet Deidre, a girl a year younger who will change the way he thinks about the world, and may give him the courage to change it.",
