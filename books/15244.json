  "description": "A genetically engineered cure for the common cold-a simple, inexpensively grown plant-turns out to be a cure for cancer and threatens to make most other drugs obsolete. The discovery triggers a crisis of medical and corporate greed that sweeps the country as the government and the media conspire with Big Pharma to keep the miracle drug off the market. Alex Farmer, a drug-addicted doctor with a shattered life, and Cyd Seeley, a research assistant with a deadly secret, are inadvertently thrown together to protect a medical breakthrough that could change the face of healthcare forever. Amid the suspense of harrowing kidnappings, manhunts, political and corporate intrigue, Wall Street corruption, suicides, arrests and terrifying escapes-in the Montana wilderness, in the high-tech world of Houston, Texas, in the political cesspool of Washington D.C., and on a vast Indian reservation-Alex and Cyd fight to survive a perilous journey where the fate of a healthy planet hinges on the survival of a tiny seed. A critically acclaimed work of literature reviewed as one of the best new books of the year, A Cure To Die For is a timely thriller that is part adventure, part mystery and part love story; a novel about two people who stand against a broken world.",
