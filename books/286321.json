  "description": "New York is where dreams come true. Or at least that’s what I’ve been told. Despite my love of planning, my dream of working on Broadway and meeting my Hollywood superstar crush seem to be running into more brick walls than necessary. Still, I could never have anticipated my crush on Hunter Stone was just one Ambien trip from an unexpected reality. Now, I find myself lost in his charms and enamored with his passion for acting. Beyond his good looks and brooding reputation is a man who sends my heart racing and leaves me wondering if fictional boyfriends are real.***Passion and drive have made all of my acting dreams a reality. All I’ve worked for is at my fingertips, but I can’t seem to settle. In my life or on my future.Meeting Celeste Pumper… Pumper-Something was never part of my plan. Her own passion for the stage has reminded me of a life beyond the big screen and celebrity. Holding her in my arms and staring into her eyes should frighten me but instead I feel more solace than my lifestyle normally allows. Our paths didn’t cross by happenstance. It was always meant to be. Sometimes truth is better than fiction and our story is better than the book.",
