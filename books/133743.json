  "description": "The bluest of blood;the boldest of hearts;the de Montforte brothers will take your breath away.MEET LORD ANDREWBlessed — or perhaps cursed — with a fiery temper, a strong will, and a blatant disregard for his brother's wishes, Andrew's only desire was to be left alone. But after being caught in a compromising position with tempting Lady Celsiana Blake, the defiant Lord Andrew is forced into marriage. This solitary man knows he has been duped by his brother, for Andrew would never have taken the lady into his private chambers if it hadn't been for the Duke of Blackheath's machinations. After all, the reluctant groom's sudden, unbidden desire for the woman who would be his bride could only be called a mere chemical reation—or was it something more?Celsie can't account for her shameless behavior with the brilliant but brooding lord she was to wed. So how was she supposed to act now that she was sharing her life with him? There is only one thing a new wife on the verge of falling in love can do—try to win her husband's wary heart.",
