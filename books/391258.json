  "title": "The Last Place You'd Look: True Stories of Missing Persons and the People Who Search for Them",
  "description": "Former police detective Carole Moore interviewed the families of dozens of missing persons across the county and around the world to compile The Last Place You'd Look , which also focuses on the efforts of police, search and rescue, nonprofits and volunteer organizations. According to the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), there are about 100,000 active, open and unresolved missing persons cases that sit on the books in the U.S. each day. The numbers are similar in Canada, where annually more than 60,000 children are reported missing.  Additionally, in the U.S. alone there are more than 40,000 John and Jane Does in cemeteries and morgues across the country, still waiting to be identified. The anguish of having a loved one vanish is unthinkable, yet thousands of families face this heartbreak every day.  The Last Place You'd Look provides searchers a starting point and gives readers an overview of \"the club no one wants to belong to.\"",
