  "description": "ROUGH. TOUGH. HARD. DIRTY. I've been called all that and more. I don't care, as long as she gives me what I want... Her.Frannie Turner spends all her time with her nose in a book. It's been a few years since she graduated High School, but the way boys treated her back then has made her shy away from dating. She hasn't even noticed that she's grown into her curves, and that her big wide eyes, wild curls and tawny skin have got the attention of every male she comes in contact with. Jace Singleton hasn't lived a charmed life. Nothing has been handed to him and he likes it that way. He works in his Uncle's auto shop by day and drag races at night. He's the only one on duty when the rich college girl comes in with the wild hair and even wilder curves. Something about her makes his body respond immediately. He decides it's worth crossing to the right side of the tracks, at least long enough to nail the hot little book worm a couple of times. The last thing he expects is to fall in love with her... *A Bad Boy For Summer is a stand alone novella with a guaranteed HEA!*",
