  "description": "Returning to her home world of Agorai, Larissya expects to find the peaceful land she left behind, untainted by the evil of the Triad which she and her companions had vanquished at the Battle of the Scar. But things have changed in the years she has been away, and new forces are at work. Her crystals are uneasy, and the glimpses they show her of the future are disjointed and fluctuating. An ancient evil stirs under a pile of stones. The stream of time will be altered. She looks down at the world spinning beneath her, and then at her friends, wondering if any of them will survive.",
