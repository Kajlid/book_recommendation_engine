  "description": "A poignant and enduring story of a young woman’s struggle to maintain hope amidst desolation.With characters so real they seem to be made of breath and bone, Campbell draws us into the nucleus of this Appalachian family as if we are relatives. We feel their heartaches and yearn for their healing as though our own happiness depends on theirs. This is Southern fiction at its finest.— Sandra Kring, author The Book of Bright Ideas",
