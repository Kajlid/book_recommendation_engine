Recipient of the prestigious MOM'S CHOICE AWARDS® SILVER MEDAL Honoring Excellence! AWARDED THE READERS' FAVORITE® FIVE STARS SEAL OF APPROVAL!\"I really enjoyed reading The Tale of Jane Sadear! The story is very well written and it rhymes. The rhyming is very well done and gives the book a fun rhythm that children will enjoy. The story is very inspiring, because Jane is a young girl, and everyone underestimates her, but she was the only one brave enough to even try to slay the dragon. The book is full of many likable characters, especially Jane, who is kind and brave. The story is filled with lots of action and suspense. The pictures by Liana Melissa Allen are very well drawn and clearly depict each scene. I would definitely recommend this book to all young readers.\" -Readers' Favorite® FIVE STARS \"Young readers of any gender can enjoy this refreshing tale, whose rhymed verses make the book a delight to read aloud.\" --CS Editor *****MOM'S CHOICE AWARDS® Silver Medalist Winner honoring excellence!*****READERS' FAVORITE® FIVE STARS SEAL OF APPROVAL!",
