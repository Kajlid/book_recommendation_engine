  "description": "Three Princes, one Beauty. Triple the fairytale, triple the scandal. They’re rich, dominant, gorgeous and toe-curlingly undeniable. One’s my boss. Two are his friends. All three are real, honest-to-goodness royal princes.  …And they say they want to share me.  There’s a place they want to take me, and things there they want to show me. It’s called The Triple Crown Club - the filthy, dark, secret playground of the royal elite. A place from the darkest corners of fantasy.  I know it’s wrong, and forbidden, and if the world found out, the media scandal would destroy us all.  But with three filthy mouths, six powerful hands, and three big, huge, gorgeous…um, crowns?  Well, it’s getting harder to say no. In fact, it’s getting hard to say anything but “yes sirs.”  Cinderella never had this problem.  …Too bad for her.   *Please note that each of the Triple Crown Club books are completely standalone stories centered around one heroine, with no cliffhangers.  Royally Shared is a modern fairytale involving three utterly obsessed alpha heroes and enough insta-love, kindle-melting steam, and sugary-sweetness to make you swoon. This mfmm romance is all about her – no m/m. If you love over-the-top, slightly unrealistic, and wildly dirty stories, this one’s for you! HEA with NO CHEATING!",
