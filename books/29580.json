With her best friend and co-conspirator at her side, she embarks on a week-long cruise, intending to sit back, relax, soak up the sun and a few daiquiris, and just get away from the disaster her life has become. The last thing she expected – or wanted – was to become intrigued by a gorgeous stranger. But sometimes chance – or fate -- has a way of changing our plans.",
