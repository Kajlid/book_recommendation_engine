  "description": "When past and present collide at a speed date of all places, Julia Kinkaid does what she does best; she heads for the nearest exit. Only Michael Winthrop has other plans for her. He wants to pick-up where they left off, as friends. Only she never saw him as just a friend, he was the guy she dreamed of marrying one day. Seven years ago, when Julia broke his heart, Michael tried to move on and as far as anyone could tell, he did. He built a life for himself that most men would call paradise. But now, seeing Julia again, heâ€™s realising that a future with her is still the only thing he ever wanted out of life.",
