  "description": "\"Die Dragonetti is a luminary in a wasteland of online writing, transcending all of his contemporaries and paving the way for the digital poet as performance artist (a task many have attempted and only Die has accomplished). Like Chris Kraus, Michelle Tea, Eileen Myles and Kathy Acker before him, Die is a writer who not only calls to be remembered, but celebrated: an icon who at once embodies what it means to be a true radical and yet nonetheless is still poised for cultural canonization.\"- Katya Ungerman, playwright of \"La Vita Rosa\"",
