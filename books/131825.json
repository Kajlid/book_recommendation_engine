  "description": "Unmarried Men Of Mule Hollow: Run For Your Lives!When Haley Bell Thornton arrived back in Mule Hollow wearing a wedding gown, no one bothered to ask where the groom was. Especially not Will Sutton, the first of her ditched fiances. The runaway bride had done it again! And now the woman he loved and lost ten years ago was tottering around the dusty ranch town in her high heels and fancy honeymoon clothes. Will vowed not to look. Definitely a problem, since Haley's granddad--and the matchmaking ladies--had a secret holiday plan to make decade-old wedding bells chime by Christmas!",
