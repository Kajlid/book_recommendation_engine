  "description": "In this collection of stories that mingle love with the horrors of mortality and loss, Immortals stalk the earth. Some search for those they’ve lost, others desperately try to escape their fate, while others are haunted, and trapped by humanity.For most humans, there is the release of death to look forward to as freedom, but no such consolation exists for the Immortals and their subjects, who are destined to remain on the wheel of life – forcing them to make their own peace, and happiness at last.",
