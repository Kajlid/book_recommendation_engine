  "description": "More than any other introductory physical geology textbook, Understanding Earth is designed to bring the worldview of the working geologist to an audience not only new to this specific field, but in many cases to science in general. Students aren't merely presented with concepts and processes--they come to learn how we know what we know, and how that knowledge impacts their lives as citizens and consumers.",
