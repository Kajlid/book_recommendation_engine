  "description": "A royal family split in two and caught in a lethal conflict: the righteous Pandava brothers, aided by the divine Krishna on the one side; the cheating Kauravas, usurpers to the throne, on the other.Karna, sired by the Sun-god Surya, is born to the unmarried princess Kunti. She abandons him to the river; he is found and raised by a low-caste couple. Spurned by all, Karna finds a friend and ally in the avaricious and wicked prince Duryodhana. But Duryodhana's worst enemies just happen to be the five brothers, the Pandavas, the noblest warriors in the world. And their mother is Kunti, that very princess who still grieves for the child she abandoned as a girl.Karna and Arjuna -- the middle and mightiest Pandava -- each vow to kill each other without knowing they are brothers. As tensions mount, so does their hatred for each other; until, in the cataclysmic war that will destroy the known world, they meet in the inevitable face-off on the battle-field of Kurukshetra. This is a war in which no-one can be the winner.The Mahabharata is a grand and timeless story, the oldest and longest epic in the world. It is a story as enthralling as it is moving, as wise as it is entertaining, a living fount of wisdom for Hindus everywhere; an epic legend that has endured the millennia.Sons of Gods is a new version for contemporary readers of both East and West, the essence of the story brought to life.",
