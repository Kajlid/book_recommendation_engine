Her father living the exact life I almost had.Adam Jacobson is known as the bad boy of rock. While he and his band tour the world, they leave a trail of mayhem.

He needs my help to keep her out of the media, and with each exchange we grow closer. Only problem is I need to stay away from the memories he ignites, and the temptations he brings my way.Secrets I’ve kept and thoughts of that fatal night come crashing back into my life. I have to wonder if it was more than fate that brought his little girl into my classroom.",
