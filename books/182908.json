  "description": "Johannah has always been the parent, at least ever since her father left them and her mother was lost to a haze of drugs and sex, leaving her alone to raise her little sister. Jack doesn’t know what’s wrong with him, but he would gladly kill everyone in Bleakon Island High if he could. Amy is the preacher’s daughter so she’s perfect. Good grades, extra scholar activities, cheerleading squad, she’s got it all. But could all this only be a very nice golden cage? Nick’s mother died when he was a kid, at least that’s what his father said. Now he discovers that maybe, just maybe she isn’t. Stuck with a stepmother he hates and a brother who fantasizes with Little-Miss-Perfect-Amy, all he really has is football. Charlie knows everything there is to know about sex. The way it makes her feel complete, loved, even just for a few moments. But then a very hot teacher makes her advances and suddenly sex isn’t what it used to be. Alex is the golden boy. Everybody looks up to him because he’s nice with everyone, plays football and brings home good grades. But if everything was so perfect in Alex’s life, why isn’t his sister coming back home? Six kids thrown into high school together, determined to make it through and get out of this hell hole.",
