  "description": "Carthage, a small town in upstate New York and normally a very quiet community, is about to have a date with destiny. Dave \"Bucky\" Morgan and Roger Fasick, two friends and lifelong residents, know something is very wrong in their town. Especially since a peculiar and mysterious man has opened a ferry service; a man with no past and questionable credentials. He travels with an attendant, a man of few words and chilling personality, who is just as mysterious as his mentor. Unable to understand the change in many of the townspeople's attitude, Bucky and Roger decide to investigate the bizarre happenings and disappearances that have been occurring since the ferry service entered their lives. For as peaceful as the ferry service may seem, be careful what you are agreeing to when you consent to pay the Ferryman.",
