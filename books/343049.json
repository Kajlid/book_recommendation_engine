Still cocky, Carver arrives at Zone Six, willing to play the game until the dust settles. The lieutenant overseeing the department, however, has other ideas. Lieutenant David Logan has followed the rules and worked hard to earn his high rank by the young age of twenty-eight. Carver's arrival threatens to disrupt the efficiency of the quiet department. At the urging of his commanding officer, David takes on Carver to curb his brash, hot-headed tendencies. What he didn't count on, however, is the chaos that his attraction to Carver brings to his well-ordered life. David's unorthodox training methods capture Carver's attention, and the two men of opposing temperaments find themselves growing closer as the weeks pass. When Carver becomes a suspect in a carjacking ring, they find their relationship tested before it's even begun...",
