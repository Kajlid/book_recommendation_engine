  "description": "Kris Bjornsen has come a long way since alien slave ships scooped her up in Denver with thousands of others. Dropped off on an apparently uninhabited world with the rest, she has fallen in love with Zainal, a renegade Catteni, and made a comfortable life for herself and her new family. But she feels a soldier's duty to escape Botany and rejoin the struggle for freedom. As the Eosi overlords continue to drop captives on Botany, the colonists learn that there are freedom fighters on every captured world, and Earth is full of pockets of resistance. There are even rebels among the warlike Catteni. Now the colonists have the technology they need to go back to war with the deadly Eosiâ€”with a surprise strike at the enslaved planet Earth itself!",
