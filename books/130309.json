Raised by his three aunts in Ontario, Canada, he seeks refuge in fantasy, solitude, and strange rituals.

A charismatic new friend soon leads him into a world of crime and dangerous taboos. The Christian God, as well as his father, haunts Ezra as he wrestles with the temptations of this dark new path. Is the dreamy image of his mother somehow leading him toward liberation, or is her spectre a symptom of an impending psychiatric breakdown?Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall. Only an act of shameful impiety offers Ezra Mignon escape and eventual salvation. But can he betray, and even murder, the God that his community worships? And can he live with the divine blood on his hands?",
