  "description": "The Outbreak continues... Cold does not bother that which is dead.  Most Americans have been killed by a virus, one that revives their dead bodies to search for other victims to infect. Hannah now leads the ragged group of survivors up into the mountains of Colorado. Hoping to find somewhere safe to be left alone in the hard, desolate region, they instead get swept up into a battle between two factions over a valuable resource, while the zombie menace still threatens to consume them all.",
