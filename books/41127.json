  "description": "A sadhu predicts the end of the world. As the East and the West come together, a young boy longs to taste cheese. A monsoon thunderstorm awakens memories of a flood. A young man returns from India and encounters the new Buddha. And a hungry policeman steals some vegetables. Amidst desire, longing and the awareness of suffering, these stories ask the common question: what is the nature of existence? Why do we suffer? Can we ever fulfill the hunger of the human heart?",
