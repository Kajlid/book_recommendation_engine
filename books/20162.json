  "description": "When photographer Leon Davis takes a job tracking down the nearly-extinct Zanzibar leopard, he isn't expecting to fall in love with the mysterious and sexy Tuareg tribal leader, Ibrahim Ag Akhamok. Ibrahim has his own secrets, and he knows more than he lets on about the leopard. And what about Piers, the murdered photographer that Leon replaced? Until Leon discovers what Piers was doing in Zanzibar, and who killed him, he can't face his own demons -- and he can't earn the love of the powerful and dangerous Tuareg.",
