  "description": "For over 2000 years, the symbol of the trinity has been represented by a male deity. Through this trinity people have looked for salvation and revelation. But the time has come to reveal the ancient truth, one that precedes the male interpretation of the spiritual journey by thousands of years. This truth is the Triple Goddess: \"Maiden, Mother, Crone.\" Through knowledge of the three aspects of the Goddess, people throughout the world have come home to the Divine Center of themselves. Now you can apply the formula of the Triple Three to daily life and use the empowering knowledge for self-discovery and growth, just as others have done for centuries. The Triple Goddess is an invaluable guide to your individual evolutionary journey.",
