Terrorists have taken away the country they once knew and they survive, secluded and alone, by living off the land. They live wild new lives in a wild new world, living among the wild animals of the vast Colorado wilderness. There are no phones. There is no power. There are few people. They are completely 'Off Grid'.Excerpt:“The screeching and squawking had me searching around the birds at four in the morning. I was equipped with a flashlight, a shotgun, my boxers and boots. Had I known I would encounter the wolves, I would have gotten dressed and come better armed.”-Off Grid-Contains violence, drug use and profanity. Not suitable for children. Thank you, ~Backwoods~",
