  "title": "To Beseech the Godslayer",
  "description": "Aurianna and Clara arrive in Monsford, just ahead of a massive demon army. Their only hope is the dragon who claims the land as his own, Verrier, The Godslayer. Clara sets out to ask the dragon for his aid, and, if necessary, offer herself in tribute.  Aurianna stays behind to bolster the town's defenses. She's possessed the goddess' own luck, but a single paladin is no match for the Host of Torment. And, without Matthias at her side, does any of it matter?  This is book 2 in the His Redemption series. It contains explicit content and graphic depictions of sex and violence. Reader discretion advised.",
