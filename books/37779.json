  "title": "On the Day I Died: Stories from the Grave",
  "description": "\"Positively tailor-made for reading—or reading aloud—by flashlight,\" declares Kirkus Reviews in a starred review. The phenomenally versatile, award-winning author, Candace Fleming, gives teen and older tween readers ten ghost stories sure to send chills up their spines. Set in White Cemetery, an actual graveyard outside Chicago, each story takes place during a different time period from the 1860's to the present, and ends with the narrator's death. Some teens die heroically, others ironically, but all due to supernatural causes. Readers will meet walking corpses and witness demonic posession, all against the backdrop of Chicago's rich history—the Great Depression, the World's Fair, Al Capone and his fellow gangsters.From the Hardcover edition.",
