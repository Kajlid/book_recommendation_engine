  "description": "In terms of your place in the world, it's your actions that define you. Every moment of your life you are always, necessarily doing something. And so the question is - why do you do what you do?A young man travels on a one-way ticket to Southeast Asia to find out, in search of freedom and everything that comes with it. Free from responsibility, free from others, free from himself.He discovers paradise islands and electric cities, and gets hooked on crazy liquor, cheap pills, loose women and easy living. Navigating through a jungle of butterflies and ladyboys, socio-narcotic minefields, hustlers, mafia, mad men and mystics, he surfs the line between reality and imagination, sanity and madness, and life and death itself.I of the Sun also voyages through many areas of philosophy, science and history, to discover whether or not we truly have free will - and if we do, then how do we control ourselves?At turns hilarious and horrifying, beautiful and ugly, Richard Arthur's debut novel takes you on an epic journey following the Sun around Southeast Asia and into the very heart of human consciousness, in this literary and philosophical tour de force.",
