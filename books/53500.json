  "description": "Katya Waters has finally made peace with her past, but the present and future are becoming a never-ending nightmare.At the end of Restraint, Katya fled back to her hometown, seeking solace from Ezra’s constant micromanaging while hiding from her true feelings over what had happened to her at the hands of the men she had grown to trust. Before Katya can come to terms with the catastrophic events she had endured in Dominion, she is whisked away from the comfort of her safe haven. Never getting a moment to reflect before being thrust back to Dominion, Katya’s defenses are down. Ezra’s controlling and manipulative ways know no bounds when it comes to Katya and their daughter. Vulnerable and susceptible to his influence, Ezra forces Katya and Ava into The Edge Building’s fortress of a gilded cage, where Katya fears she will never get out. Hanging onto her sense of self and moral code is difficult for Katya, as Ezra influences every aspect of her life, leaving her feeling powerless and lost as she falls deeper under his spell. Unsure where she fits into the lives of the men who impact her so deeply, Katya seeks direction from an unlikely source to regain her power. Katya’s intuition screams that she is in danger, which is why she allows Ezra to keep her caged safely within the world of his creation. …And then the threatening notes are delivered– written with the words only the monster ever whispered.Genre: BDSM | Dark | Erotica | Romantic Suspense | LGBT | Menage | Taboo | Series |Length: 200,000 word + Epic Length novel.",
