  "title": "The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree: The History and Lore of the World's Most Famous Evergreen",
  "description": "Rockefeller Center had its first Christmas tree even before any buildings rose to fill the in 1931, just after they cleared the site, construction workers decorated a small balsam fir with the most humble of ornaments, from garlands of paper to tin cans. Since then, the tree has become one of the wonders of the holiday season, as thousands of people come together to gaze at the bright and sparkling sight. For many, it one of the surest signs that Christmas is near.  The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree tells the story of this now-landmark calendar event. Not only does it provide background on how the tree is chosen, cut, transported, and decorated, as well as fun facts (it now has LED lights and, after the holiday, its lumber is used for a Habitat for Humanity house), but it also follows at least one family in each decade whose pine ended up becoming one of New York’s most popular tourist attractions. Handsomely bound, with full-color illustrations, this lovely gift book makes a great stocking stuffer and a special treat for anyone who has visited, or dreams of visiting, the Rockefeller Center at Christmastime.",
