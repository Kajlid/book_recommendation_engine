  "title": "Call me Ishtar",
  "description": "She is Ishtar, Mother Goddess, Queen of Heaven, Angel of Death, Whore of Babylon, and, in this most recent incarnation, suburban housewife supreme. She is outrageous, passionate, and gloriously original, and she has returned to earth to right the wrongs wreaked by thirty centuries of patriarchal mayhem. Call Me Ishtar is a rollickingly funny crazy quilt of fantasy, fable, and hard-edged reality a mad and mythic melange that is, ultimately, a work of vision.",
