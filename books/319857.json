Carola, Author of Napoyca Awakened\"Recommend this series to readers who enjoy high fantasy with well-thought out worldbuilding and imperfect, relatable, and heroic characters (and one really nasty villain!)\"   -Helen Whistlberry, Author of The Malhaven Mystery Series\"The author's world building and character building is spectacular; everything came together so fully.\"    -Goodreads Review",
