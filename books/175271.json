  "description": "Librarian's Note: An alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here and hereShortlisted for Outdoor Book of the Year by The Great Outdoors Magazine.Every year several thousand people attempt to hike all 2180 miles of the Appalachian Trail in the eastern United States. Being the first of the big three hikes in America, it is where long-distance hikers go to cut their teeth. Keith Foskett has another reason. Dromomania, or the uncontrollable urge to wander, has been part of his life since childhood. Hiking is his chosen method to placate the wanderlust. Accompanied by an array of eclectic characters including a world champion juggler, a drug dealer, an Everton fan whose visa is expiring and a sex-starved builder from Minnesota, his experience is far from normal. Battling a fear of snakes, bears, being in the woods after dark and his own demons, it’s physically exhausting — as well as a psychologically challenging. His adventure weaves a route through some of America’s wildest landscapes and history, and is told with insight, humour and reflection.",
