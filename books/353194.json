  "description": "New York Times bestselling author Patti Callahan Henry delivers a novel that explores the power of lasting love through the connected stories of two women from opposite sides of the sea.Twenty-seven-year-old Kara Larson is bogged down in the stress of planning her elaborate wedding to a professional golfer. Still, to fulfill the requirements of the Palmetto Pointe Junior Society, she makes time in her busy schedule to visit an elderly woman at a nursing home facility. Soon she finds herself mesmerized by the singsong Irish lilt of ninety-six-year-old Maeve Mahoney as Maeve recounts the rambling story of her first love back in Ireland. Or, Kara begins to wonder, is she really retelling an ancient tale of myth and legend? Waiting for the story to unfold in bits and pieces, and trying to discern the underlying truth, Kara is drawn in—and driven to remember her own first childhood neighbor Jack Sullivan. Gradually she realizes that before she embarks on her new life, she must find out how her own story—with Jack—will end.“About all the things that make us worthy as human beings—integrity, honesty, and living the life you are meant to live.…A triumph!”—Dorothea Benton Frank“A passionate, unforgettable novel of self-discovery, regret, and the illuminating power of love.”—Mary Alice Monroe",
