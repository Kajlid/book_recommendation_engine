  "description": "After the relative intimacy of the first two volumes of In Search of Lost Time, The Guermantes Way opens up a vast, dazzling landscape of fashionable Parisian life in the late nineteenth century, as the narrator enters the brilliant, shallow world of the literary and aristocratic salons. Both a salute to, and a devastating satire of a time, place, and culture, The Guermantes Way defines the great tradition of novels that follow the initiation of a young man into the ways of the world. This elegantly packaged new translation will introduce a new generation of American readers to the literary richness of Marcel Proust.First time in Penguin ClassicsA Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition with french flaps and luxurious designPenguin Classics' superb new edition of In Search of Lost Time is the first completely new translation of Proust's masterwork since the 1920s",
