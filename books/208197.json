  "description": "The Cutter's Code series continues with a hero who fights to remember…and love  Instead of a peaceful homecoming, wounded warrior Tate McLaughlin faces an explosion, near-electrocution and Cutter, an incredibly smart dog. Worse, the sexy veteran needs Lacy—the pretty girl next door—to leave him alone! He's been hurt too many times to risk his heart again.  To Lacy Steele, it's apparent that the attacks on her neighbor were no accident. Someone is after him, but his damaged memory offers no clue who! But as they investigate, Lacy finds an intimacy with Tate neither of them have ever known. And it's that bond—and secrets from his deployment—that threaten his life and heart.",
