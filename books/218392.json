  "description": "If you’re a serious investor, you’ve seen ‘Ms. Money’ on TV. She’s a regular on Smarter Than The Street, the financial markets broadcast whose Neilsen ratings are off the chart. When she’s not on camera, Margaret M Worth is Chief Investment Strategist for nationwide money manager Traub Securities. After making a fortune, losing it and winning it back, she is ultimately victorious in the men-only survival-of-the-fittest world of Wall Street, owing to her mantra--“Sex is the ultimate medium of exchange!” But she becomes disillusioned with the Midas touch, and when a Presidential appointment sends her into the inner sanctum of the monetary blowup at the New York Federal Reserve on Maiden Lane, she gets in touch with the real Maggie, discovering genuine self-worth. Will her new found self-reliance be rewarded?",
