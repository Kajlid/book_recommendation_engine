  "title": "Fridge Magnets Are Bastards",
  "description": "Modern life: advertorials, obscenely cheerful breakfast TV hosts, celebrity chefs, call centres, smiling charity collectors. Brands, highly effective people, misuses of the word 'creative'. Performance reviews, people who say 'I'm not racist, but ... ', sushi bars and the Taliban. Alexander Downer. Water-cooler moments. Yellow stickers. Fridge magnets. Mark Dapin can complain - and does - about almost everything. In Fridge Magnets are Bastards, he's tried to contain his rants about the things that annoy him to a list of 141 - in alphabetical order. Why? Just to be irritating. A book for anyone who's ever gnashed their teeth over contemporary stupidity.",
