  "title": "Nightingale",
  "description": "FROM PUBLISHERS WEEKLY: \"In a world where most humans have a superstitious fear of the elf-like, tree-dwelling anthelai, a half-anthela girl, a rarity considered a demon by the human population, survives the brutal destruction of her home only to be enslaved by the rapacious human Guildmaster Lorcen Caspon. As the mysterious assassin known as the Nightingale, she spreads death and terror until faced by a determined opponent of equal skill: Astin Talros, a general in service to the king. Her struggle to escape Caspon and avenge her familyâ€™s death becomes a race against her relentless pursuit by Talros, who, unaware that she acts under compulsion, is sworn to destroy her. Effectively melding briskly-paced action with the internal struggles of both a traumatized young outcast forced into horrific deeds and the wily but honorable Talros. Debut author Mickelsen brings fresh twists and emotional depth to her tightly-written, compelling tale of mercantile politics, interracial conflict, and difficult choices.\"",
