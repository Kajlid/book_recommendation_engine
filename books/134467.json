  "description": "The dragons are lost.The elements are at war. Enlisting isn’t optional.And I’m falling for a man who wants me dead.\nI’m a wielder of hearts and summoner of corruption. Heir to nothing and born to a fool in the wrong damn month.But I’m also one of only two Fae in this divided land of hellions who might be starting to see through the lies we’ve swallowed for so long.In the year we turn twenty-one, conscripts from across the warring nations of air, fire, earth and water are sent to Never Keep – the only place in our besieged continent where our magic can be Awakened.But something is wrong inside Never Keep. Something which might extend far beyond the reaches of this desolate fortress. Within the gothic walls of this frigid castle in the snow, we’re left to hold our own against the brutal Fae from the opposing lands.The Reapers are merciless. The Royals are lying. The Werewolves run rampant and Vampires roam the wastelands in bloodthirsty covens. But even though death lurks in every shadow of the Keep, it’s the least of my worries.I’m delving into secrets the stars don’t want me uncovering, making alliances with Fae born to be my enemy, falling for a sinner while promising my heart to a different heathen and somewhere amid it all, I’m supposed to win a war.I thought the only thing I had to do was survive my magical instruction.Turns out, fate doesn’t favour the wicked.",
