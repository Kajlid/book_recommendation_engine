  "description": "The not yet so future -- where the complexity of technology has divided society into two classes: Technostians, who understand, use, and program technologies, and Agricoles, who work for Technostians. Cassandra is a fourteen-year-old Agricole who works for a Technostian corporation (the Consortium) that runs a massive theme park in northern New England/Canada, complete with resorts, casinos, and living history museums that recreate the life of the past. This technologically superior corporation controls her entire existence, yet she has one special gift that sets her apart: an inner compass and a growing power to predict and even to alter the wind and weather. She becomes entangled in a struggle between the Consortium (greedily interested in her power) and a shadowy rebel group that is trying to overthrow and destroy it. Cassandraâ€™s formerly ordered and peaceful world becomes increasingly dark, confused, and more dangerous as her sense of true North is tested in ways she never thought possible.",
