  "description": "As a category six wizard in her eighties, Josephine O’Connor has always enjoyed a youthful body due to extremely slow aging but when she discovers she’s become immortal, she must return to the workforce. Soon after starting her investigative work for the police, Josephine discovers a secret organization called the Valituras that has amassed ancient magic and power with single-minded determination. Her new assignment of defeating this agency may prove to be an impossible feat as their members have infiltrated all levels of the government including law enforcement and their advanced wizardry rivals her own. Josephine realizes she may be in over her head when the Valituras end up casting an immortality curse on her best friend, Helen, by mistake. To further complicate matters, her grandson’s eighteen-year-old friend starts hitting on her. Fortunately, Helen isn’t too broken up by the curse. Who wouldn’t want to live forever in a young, perfect body? Of course, everyone knows that dark magic always comes at a cost.",
