  "description": "They were taken.Off the street. From parking lots. Malls. Playgrounds.Snatched from life and thrust into hell.They took Orion Darby on a perfect summer day, while she could still taste her first kiss on her lips.She joined the others with chains on their ankles and scars on their souls.They turned into nothing more than statistics. Cold cases. Lost girls.Years passed and the world forgot.Until the day they escaped.This is not about their captivity.This is about their struggle to return to a life that's passed them by.This was the real world.But for Orion, this was hell.You see... freedom isn't enough.She needs blood.",
