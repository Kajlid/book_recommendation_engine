  "title": "The Little Water Sprite",
  "description": "One spring day a little water-sprite was born in a mill pond. Like all true water-sprites he had webbed hands and green eyes and hair. As soon as he could swim he explored the cool green world of the pond, and was even allowed to visit the world outside, as long as he did not let his feet get dry! The curious and cheeky little water-sprite had lots of advetures both in and out of the pond. Sometimes his fun and games got him into trouble, but life was always exciting.",
