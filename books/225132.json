  "description": "Tooru is a beautiful, young college art student who lacks the common morals most people have in terms of their body. Agreeing to be the nude model for Satoshi Matsuoka, a senior photography student of the same school, he easily agrees to sleep with him in exchange for money (though he is straight). However, what started as a small taste of the forbidden soon spirals out of control when Tooru begins to sell his body to other guys as he works at a male brothel. Can Matsuoka save Tooru from himself?",
