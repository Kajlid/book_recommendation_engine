  "description": "Sometimes patience isn't a virtue.  Facing off with Malina didn't go quite how Raegan hoped, but she isn't one to give up easily. Now, she's back at school and more than eager to do whatever is necessary in order to protect those she loves most.  When a team is assembled and training begins in class, Raegan and Enzo grow closer than ever, but their happily-ever-after isn't within their grasp just yet. As one obstacle after another appears in their path, it will take ever bit of patience Raegan doesn't have in order to make it through.  With the final showdown drawing near, their team travels to New Orleans in hopes of keeping the battle away from school, but even then, the collateral damage might be more than any of them could have ever predicted. With more than one life at risk, Raegan will be forced to make choices she might never be able to recover from.",
