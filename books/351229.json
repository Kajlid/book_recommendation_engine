  "description": "The beast - you'll hear him chasing the frightened night creatures; you'll smell the strong musk of his wild animal scent. He resembles a golden bear, or a great cat. But he is neither of these. He is a more-than-human being who can bend your will to his.He becomes a man who knows not what he is, but still he fights for an identity - while the Beast within uses him, drives him in a search that may kill them both.But the Man-Beast has broken the rule of solitude...and now he will become a prisoner of a force even greater than his own - a force all too human for bestial understanding.",
