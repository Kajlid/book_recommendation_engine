  "title": "Dibdin in Paris",
  "description": "From April through September of 1818, Thomas Frognall Dibdin toured France and Germany visiting libraries, booksellers, collectors, bibliographers, printers, and publishers. What resulted from this trip was his report of 1821 entitled A Bibliographical, Antiquarian and Picturesque Tour in France and Germany. This beautiful book gives an entertaining account of Dibdin's stay in Paris during his six-month bibliographical tour. Frans Janssen describes the bibliophile's visits to prominent representatives of the book world such as Renouard, Brunet, and Crapelet, their reactions to what Dibdin had to say, and Dibdin's responses. As well as the responses that Dibdin had to his critics. This title also includes a brief biography of Dibdin and five color illustrations in the text. Written by an expert on book collecting, skillfully translated into English Harry Lake , designed and typeset by a famous Dutch designer Piet Gerards , and printed and bound by the finest Dutch craftsmen in their field, this little book is a true jewel. Professor Emeritus Doctor Frans A. Janssen, born in 1939 in the Netherlands, has worked in the fields of textual criticism and librarianship, and was professor of Book and Library History at the University of Amsterdam from 1989 until his retirement in 2004. He published a series of books and articles on the history of printing techniques, typographical design, and book collecting. A selection of his articles appeared in 2004 in Technique and Design in the History of Printing, covering subjects as the printing press, the layout of books around 1500 and around 1800, English and French printers manuals, and neo-platonic and hermetic philosophy in book collecting.",
