Her aging dad, her boyfriend and the people at work are wondering what happened, but before they can say Aloha, trouble is brewing faster than Kona coffee. Meanwhile, Penny is mistaken for a goddess--not just any goddess, but Pele--the fearless goddess of fire. Will she see the resemblance in time to get out of a dangerous situation so she can return safely to everyone’s heart?",
