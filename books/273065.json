  "description": "Once upon a time, the devil knocked up a delivery guy.Not your typical intro to a romance, but I promise, it is one. The devil in this scenario would be a sexy horned demon named Apollyon and the delivery guy would be me, Levi Curtis. Just an average guy who got in way over his head trying to keep his twin sister from selling her soul.See, in order to do unleash Hell’s demonic wrath upon the earth, Apollyon needs a mortal vessel to contain the seed of his demonic army. It wasn’t supposed to be a literal pregnancy, but my overactive imagination has always caused problems.Big problems, in this case. A whole Legion of ‘em. I may low-key hate Apollyon, but we’re gonna have to learn to tolerate each other in order to keep our little bundle of infernal joy safe and hopefully not destroy both our worlds in the process.But hey, on the plus side, you know what they say about guys with big horns. Lightbearer is an 82k fantasy mpreg romance with dark humor, explicit sex and hot-as-hell demons. 18+ only.",
