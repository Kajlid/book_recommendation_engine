  "description": "First published in 1968, this contemporary case for vigorous Christian faith -- profusely illustrated by Charles Schulz's delightful peanuts cartoon strips -- sheds more light on the Christian faith and how it is to be lived than many more \"serious\" theological works, with hundreds of cartoons featuring your favorite peanuts characters Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, And of course, Snoopy (including the earliest Red Baron strips). This book's wise observations are as timeless as they are timely.",
