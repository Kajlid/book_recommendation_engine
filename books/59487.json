  "title": "The Selected Poems of Emily Dickinson",
  "description": "Emily Dickinson lived as a recluse in Amherst, Massachusetts, dedicating herself to writing a \"letter to the world\"--the 1,775 poems left unpublished at her death in 1886. Today, Dickinson stands in the front rank of American poets. This enthralling collection includes more than four hundred poems that were published between Dickinson's death and 1900. They express her concepts of life and death, of love and nature, and of what Henry James called \"the landscape of the soul.\" And as Billy Collins suggests in his Introduction, \"In the age of the workshop, the reading, the poetry conference and festival, Dickinson reminds us of the deeply private nature of literary art.\"",
