  "title": "Sons of the Rumour",
  "description": "David Foster's 13th novel is a dazzling remix of Richard Burton's Arabian Nights. A tale of sexual passion and intrigue told in the form of a mystical journey along the old Silk Roads of Central Asia, the book showcases Foster's uniquely profound command of the Australian vernacular to satirise the conflict between modern secular Western woman and fundamentalist Islamic man.Explicit, ambitious and frequently hilarious, Sons of the Rumour is a modern masterpiece by one of Australia's greatest living writers, a man who has been dubbed 'Patrick White's worthy successor'.",
