  "description": "In a futuristic Philadelphia, someone is killing blue-eyed girls and they are good. The mysterious Gaespora have contracted tough-as-nails PI Saru Solan to find a very special girl who may be host to a wrathful alien entity known as the Blue God. Saru must outwit the hunters and find their prey before she becomes just another murder victim. Armed with implants, a brain-linked pistol, and a cattle-prod, Saru must battle the servants of the Hungry God, the zombie-like elzi, and the skin-stealing feasters, in a desperate bid to save the special blue-eyed girl. If Saru fails, all of humankind may face extinction.",
