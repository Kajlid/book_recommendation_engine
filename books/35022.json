  "title": "Forts: Endings and Beginnings",
  "description": "With their backs to the wall the children of the Fillagrou prophecy are forced to fight against seemingly impossible odds. Questions will be answered and mysteries revealed. Lives will be lost, friendships will be tested and the bonds of family stretched to the limit. If the universe is to survive, the ultimate sacrifice must be made. Endings and Beginnings is the final installment in an epic trilogy that follows an unlikely group of children turned heroes and their adventures in a world that seems, on the surface, to have very little in common with their own. Pitted against a tyrant king hungry for vengeance, the fate of the universe rests in their hands.",
