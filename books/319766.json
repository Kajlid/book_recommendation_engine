  "title": "Frances Johnson: A Novel",
  "description": "Frances Johnson doesn't want to attend the town dance. But there is pressure. The people of Munson, her small Florida town, make their needs known: Ray, her boyfriend who is \"overfocused on world history\"; Mal, the horsey, earnest fry cook at Mal's Pico diner, who offers her his cabin; Palmer, the town doctor who can find no cure for the mysterious scar Frances bears; her mother, speaking to her through \"the mechanical screeching\" of Munson's patched telephone lines. Nearby, a volcano the townspeople call \"Sharla\" spews lava and stones, lighting the night sky with its portentous burning. At once measured and suspenseful, Frances Johnson is a comedy of manners in the tradition of Jane Bowles.",
