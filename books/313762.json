  "description": "For centuries, wizard kings have ruled the world from their elite sky cities, battling each other to add to their wealth and power, while using normal human beings as pawns. Those without magic struggle to feed their families and live in constant fear of bringing down the wrath of their tyrannical masters.Something must change.As a cartography student, Jak has always dreamed of finding the lost dragon gate and exploring and mapping distant worlds.Developing magical powers and becoming a powerful wizard? Not a chance.Wizards are cruel and inhumane, warring with each other from their great sky cities and keeping most of humanity enslaved. Jak wants nothing to do with them.But when he and his archaeologist mother unearth the gate, they attract the attention of the very wizards they sought to avoid. Even more troubling, Jak starts developing magical powers of his own, powers that could rival those of the great rulers.Fate may have given him the opportunity to change the world.But the wizard rulers don’t like change, and when they detect threats, they send their elite assassins to eliminate them.If Jak can’t unlock the power of the gate, and the powers within himself, the world will remain enslaved forever.",
