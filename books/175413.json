  "description": "A year has passed since a tragic event stole everything from Laura – her husband, her dreams for the future, and her sense of self-worth. Determined to run her farm alone, she resolves to never give in to the man who wants her land, or allow vicious rumors to break her spirit. When a compelling drifter offers his help, Laura must face the insecurities that have prevented her from leading a normal life.  Four long years in prison have given Cade plenty of time to plan his revenge against the man who framed him for murder. When a young widow saves his life, his unexpected attraction to her is a complication he hasn’t foreseen. In order to protect her from a common enemy, Cade is forced to hide things from the one person who deserves his honesty the most.  Cade and Laura’s mutual attraction opens old wounds and demands they confront their deepest fears. Even as their love grows, Cade’s reluctance to be completely truthful might destroy their one chance at finding happiness with each other. Will Laura’s trust in Cade be strong enough to overcome the secret he’s been keeping, or will the man who is out to destroy them both be victorious in the end?  ***Content Warning: This book contains mild language, mild violence, and physical intimacy, and is intended for mature readers.
