  "description": "When a Â£1 million construction deal starts to go pear shaped, and a London heavy mob working for the opposition ransack his house, Stephen Moyle is out for revenge. In a tale of violence and adventure via the North of England and Canada, Stephen recounts the events that led to a three and a half year jail term and his eventual sectioning. Having taken revenge of the mob that was terrorizing his family and business deals, Stephen was imprisoned in HMP Lewis; but with the voices of God Almighty and the Devil guiding his thoughts Stephen's actions on the inside were to get him moved to HMP Camp Hill, Isle of Wight, from which he was to make his daring escape. Having scaled the prison walls and made his way through the razor wire, a scratched and bloody Stephen set off to swim across the Solent back to his family. His escape mobilized a specialist police unit and the hunt began. While on the run, Stephen returned to his scamming and thieving ways, but despite it all he found time to marry his long-term girlfriend Judith. But after the wedding, things went from bad to worse as the voice of God was still present in Stephen's thoughts; after a publican is almost killed the D11 squad close in and Stephen is returned to prison. Stephen is eventually released but his spell on the outside is short lived when he is re-arrested for GBH on his wife. At the court hearing, Stephen was sectioned for life and sent to Broadmoor Secure Hospital.",
