  "description": "When they get an offer to join a national tour, the musicians of Luminescent Juliet finally find their ticket to fame. But for Sam, the band’s dazzling but troubled bassist, making sure his past stays locked away feels more important than winning the spotlight.Then Peyton, a budding music journalist, joins the tour, tasked with chronicling the band’s every move. She and Sam have a history, one that has made them enemies. Neither wants to deal with old pain and misunderstanding, and they agree to keep the past in the past. This is more than fine with Peyton—after all, it’ll only help reassure her picture-perfect boyfriend back on campus that following the band is all totally professional.Yet being forced to look at Sam in a new way brings Peyton a different perspective on the past—and his magnetic baby-blues and rippling muscles are hard to ignore. When the tour kicks into high gear, the real truth about their shared past comes to light, and Peyton is rocked by forces as passionate and chaotic as the music she loves.This book is intended for mature teen audiences due to strong language and some sexual content.",
