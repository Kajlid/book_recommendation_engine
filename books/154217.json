That one night altered his life and changed the man he always thought he’d be. Turning to drugs, sex and violence was never part of his plan, but neither was losing his mother or failing Samantha. Brody found solace within his club, the South Street Crew and their criminal activities. He knew one day he’d walk away either in jail, fleeing, or dead. When Samantha stumbled back into his life on his best friend’s arm, Brody felt the instant connection he’d always experienced when she was near. Forced to claim her in order to protect her from the mafia’s son and his best friend was the only way he knew how to protect her. He refused to lose her a second time. But she wasn’t safe—not in his world. He’d do anything to save her. Anything.",
