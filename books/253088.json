  "title": "Breaking the Marriage Idol: Reconstructing Our Cultural and Spiritual Norms",
  "description": "Should all Christians be married? Although we might quickly respond \"no,\" our cultural stories and norms—including those in the church—often communicate \"yes.\" Theologian and husband Kutter Callaway considers why marriage, which is a blessing from God, shouldn't be expected or required of all Christians. Through an examination of Scripture, cultural analysis, and personal accounts, he reflects on how our narratives have limited our understanding of marriage and obscured our view of the life-giving and kingdom-serving roles of single people in the church. In doing so, Callaway helps the church craft a new story that transforms the way we look at marriage and affirms the contributions of all to the body of Christ.",
