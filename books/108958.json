  "description": "It came in a plain brown wrapper, no return address - an audiocassette recording of a horrifying, soul-lacerating scream, followed by the sound of a childlike voice chanting, \"Bad love. Bad love. Don't give me the bad love.\" For Alex Delaware, the tape is the first indication that he is about to enter a living nightmare. Others soon follow: disquieting laughter echoing over a phone line that suddenly goes dead, and a chilling act of trespass and vandalism.Dr. Delaware has become the target of a carefully orchestrated campaign of vague threats and intimidation which rapidly build to a crescendo as harassment turns to terror, and mischief to madness.With the help of his friend, LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, Alex uncovers a series of violent deaths that may follow a diabolical pattern. But if he fails to decipher the twisted logic of the stalker and his or her mind games, Alex will be the next to die.",
