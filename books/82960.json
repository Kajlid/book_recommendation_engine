  "description": "A suspected blackmailer is found murdered in this gripping crime story from the Crime Writers' Association Gold Dagger winner, Arnaldur Indridason. Detective Sigurdur Oli is in trouble.  After a school reunion exposes the chasm between his life and those of his much more successful contemporaries, leaving him bitter and resentful, one of his old friends asks him to pay an unofficial visit to a couple of blackmailers. He readily agrees, only to arrive to find one of the pair lying in a pool of blood. When the victim dies in hospital, Sigurdur Oli is faced with investigating a murder without revealing his own reasons for being present at the murder scene.  Moving from the villas of Reykjavik's banking elite to a sordid basement flat, \"Black Skies\" is a superb story of greed, pride and murder from one of Europe's most successful crime writers.",
