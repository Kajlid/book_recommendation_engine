After the funeral of his estranged father, faded hometown hero Hector \"Heck\" Hammarskjold finds himself the new owner of the old man's house... and inside it, a portal to the underworld! With few other prospects on the horizon, Heck goes into business settling inheritance disputes by contacting the recently deceased, accompanied by his faithful sidekick Elliot. But when an old flame knocks on their door with an important message for her late husband, Heck and Elliot embark on a terrifying journey down into the nine circles, braving the horrors of Hell for an assignment that will reveal more than they ever imagined! Award-winning cartoonist Zander Cannon (The Replacement God,  Top 10, Smax,  The Stuff of Life) collects his serial from the hit digital magazine Double Barrel into his long-awaited first graphic novel: a story of memory, friendship, and regret, where the past is dead and buried... but not out of reach.",
