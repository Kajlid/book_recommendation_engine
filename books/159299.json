  "description": "The Bodyguard for Women's Hearts returns with brand-new tough-love advice for satisfying relationships and spiritual fulfillment. Some women have become so accustomed to the games and manipulations of men that they are virtually sitting ducks for all the suckahs out there. Every woman has to be able to recognize Mr. Wrong before she lets him into her heart. True love is definitely out there -- you just have to know where to look. In How to Duck a Suckah , Big Boom -- a former pimp, player, and hustler -- draws on his own sordid past to help women avoid traps, demand respect, and live a drama-free life. His overall message of self-empowerment proves that you can't be happy with anyone else unless you are happy with yourself.",
