  "description": "It all started with Jack & Diane…And no, not the couple from the popular 80’s song—the couple that signed a five-dollar bill with their names and the location of The Livingston Cabin in Copper Ridge, Colorado.And I just so happened to acquire that five-dollar bill on the same day of the funeral of a close friend AND the day I was supposed to be getting married.Coincidence? Perhaps.A sign? I think so.After a short internet search, I found the cabin in question and wasted no time booking a trip for myself to the magical house tucked high in the mountains.But apparently, someone else wanted to experience The Livingston Cabin during the same ten days as I did—and he was hotter than sin.Carson took five years off of my life when I discovered him in my place of solitude. But he also became Santa’s helper as he opened me up to more fun and adventure than I ever thought possible.The magic of Copper Ridge cast a spell over us for those ten days, and then one question remained when our time was up…Did we find love just like Jack and Diane did all those years ago? Or were we both still lost after our stay in Copper Ridge?",
