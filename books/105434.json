  "description": "A Cure To Die For is a medical thriller about a wonder drug, a miracle cure and a conspiracy to destroy it. A genetically engineered cure for the common cold--a simple, inexpensively-grown plant--turns out to be a cure for cancer and threatens to make most other drugs obsolete. The discovery triggers a crisis of medical, corporate and political greed that sweeps the country as the government and the media conspire with Big Pharma to keep the miracle drug off the market.   Alex Farmer, a drug-addicted doctor with a shattered life, and Cyd Seeley, a research assistant with a deadly secret, are inadvertently thrown together to protect a medical breakthrough that could change the face of healthcare forever. Amid the suspense of harrowing kidnappings, manhunts, political and corporate intrigue, Wall Street corruption, suicides, arrests and terrifying escapes--in the Montana wilderness, in the high-tech world of Houston, Texas, in the political cesspool of Washington D.C., and on a massive Indian reservation--Alex and Cyd fight to survive a perilous journey where the fate of a healthy planet hinges on the  survival of a tiny seed.",
