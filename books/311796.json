  "description": "Moonlight Hope interweaves an intimate account of two Muslims living between the worlds of Islam, Arab, and American culture. Set in New York City, this story displays the fabric of hyphenated American identity composed of delicate threads interweaving conflicting emotions, cultural duties, and hidden cues.Intisar, 23, is a freshly graduated nurse who is pulled between her traditional role of being the daughter of Sudanese immigrants and American life. Wide-eyed with a sheltered view of the world, her greatest hope is to get married so she can fill the void in her heart. She isn’t particularly spiritual – until she hits rock bottom.Majed, 21, is the talent manager of his world-famous Egyptian family that handed him everything on a silver platter. With blond hair and hazel eyes, he blends into American society. Partying, alcohol, and entertainment are the pillars of his life. Majed wants to escape it; nonetheless, he struggles under the influence. He knows there's a deeper meaning to life but can't put his finger on it.Intisar and Majed are strengthened through trials to find themselves, Allah, and each other at a time when America could not be more divided.",
