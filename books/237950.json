  "description": "Integrative Medicine: The Return of the Soul to Health Care is an introduction to the field of integrative medicine. Based on both her extensive research and personal experience as a practitioner and recipient of allopathic medicine, oriental medicine, functional medicine, energy medicine, and counseling, Dr. Bonnie McLean offers a user-friendly overview of integrative medicine with resources for further exploration by the reader. From childhood to her current practice in oriental medicine, Dr. McLean has spent her life immersed in medicine. Raised by a physician father and nurse mother, she spent the first twenty years of her adulthood as an RN. After witnessing what she calls a loss of soul in contemporary medicine, she spent the next thirty years in a search of the soul in medicine. She explored natural medicine, Chinese medicine, psychology, energy medicine, and shamanic healing.  With the advent of integrative medicine, she strongly believes that the soul of medicine is returning. The best of both worlds (science of medical technology and the art of healing, contemporary knowledge and ancient wisdom, East and West) are beginning to work hand in hand under the umbrella of integrative medicine. Integrative medicine is the wave of the future!",
