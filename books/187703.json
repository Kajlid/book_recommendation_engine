  "title": "Stench of the Word",
  "description": "In the tradition of Philip K. Dick’s The Man in the High Castle, demons of the Third Reich live on in this alternative history of Nazi dementia and rivalry. Hitler, Braun, Göring , Goebbels, Himmler, Bormann, Speer, Gestapo Müller, and others jostle for power after World War II in New Swabia, a colony deep within Antarctica. While the setting employs the absurdities of conspiracy theory, the implications of Nazi madness are not laughable. The Stench of the Word is a novel populated with villains and incompetents. Neither heroes nor central characters appear in its pages. Not for the light of heart, The Stench of the Word is to be found on the same bookshelf as Roberto Bolaño’s acidic Nazi Literature in the Americas, Frederick Forsyth’s scary The Odessa File, Steven Spielberg’s action-adventure, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Timo Vuorensola’s spoof, Iron Sky, and Quentin Tarantino’s alternative history, Inglourious Basterds.",
