  "description": "Henry Gauthier: Bassist. Gorgeous. My brother’s best friend. And my first love.He’s also the man I grew to hate after a one-night stand went horribly wrong. I’ve spent the last three years successfully dodging him like a bullet. Now, fresh out of a bad relationship and living in a new city, I finally feel like I’m starting to get myself together. And when an opportunity to produce Wild Minds’ newest album presents itself, I can’t help but jump at the chance of a lifetime. Even if it comes with a caveat. Three weeks in Hawaii, an impossible to meet deadline, and Henry Gauthier.Eden Dawson: Spitfire. Stunning. My best friend’s sister. And the bane of my existence.I’ll be the first to admit three years ago I messed up. I shouldn’t have touched her. Sort of like now. Because my best friend, my bandmate, made me promise that when it comes to his baby sister, I keep my hands to myself. Only a woman like her is impossible to resist. And before I know it, despite my best efforts, we’re doing all manner of dirty things to each other. Our rules demand this is only temporary. That no matter what, love is off the table. Now, I have to make sure two things don’t happen. One, I don’t break my promise to her. Two, her brother doesn’t find out I already broke the one I made to him.",
