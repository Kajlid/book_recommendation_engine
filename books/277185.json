  "description": "All Hail Her Royal Majesty… In the wake of an unthinkable tragedy, Emilia Lancaster has become something she never imagined possible: the reigning Queen of Germania. Still reeling from the violent anti-monarchist attacks against her kingdom, engulfed in grief over the fresh loss of her father, and heartbroken by the betrayal of her closest allies, the newly-minted royal finds herself more isolated than ever… despite the whole country watching her every move. She’d like nothing more than to run away — from the prying eyes of the public, from the political schemes unfolding all around her, and, perhaps most of all, from the painful memories of Carter Thorne, the man who stole her heart without asking for permission. But running isn’t an option; not when there’s an empire to rule. So, Emilia does the only thing she can: puts on her crown, slaps on a smile, and acts like the steady sovereign her shaken subjects need her to be. Non sibi sed patriae. Not for self, but country. After everything that’s happened to her in the past few months, Emilia assumes she’s made it through the worst. She’s wrong. The danger is closer than ever. Unforeseen enemies are lurking just out of sight, determined to put an end to the Lancaster line, once and for all... Their final target?Germania’s fiery new queen.  SORDID EMPIRE is the final installment of the breathtaking royal romance romance saga THE FORBIDDEN ROYALS TRILOGY. Pulse-pounding suspense, deadly political schemes, and scorching sexual tension make this final installment utterly un-put-downable!",
