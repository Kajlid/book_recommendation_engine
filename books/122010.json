  "description": "1795: the shadow of Bonaparte has fallen across Europe and touches each member of the far-flung Morland family. As the century draws to a close, Jemima Morland wearily ackowledges that her life is also nearing its end, but she has scant peace as her unpredictable children behave ever more incomprehensibly: James's marriage to Mary Ann is closer to falling apart; Lucy's marriage de convenance is in the balance - her affair with Lieutenant Watson an open scandal; Mary bears a daughter on board her husband's ship during the battle of the Nile; and William supports a mistress whose marriage cannot be dissolved. Jemima's death appears to unite the family but, as ever with the Morlands, the future holds more peril than hope.",
