A Stag enjoys the loyalty, love and respect of his Vixen who is averse to humiliating him.’The book is part fact and part fiction and has explicit sex stories and poems, including MMF and MMMMF pleasures that will appeal to the those that like themes such as cuckold relationships (without the humiliation aspects), polyamory, open relationships, swinging, sex positive and female focused erotica.

A real couple finding an equilibrium that suits their love and sexual appetite rather than following the expected norms. If Sex at Dawn: How We Mate, Why We Stray, and What It Means for Modern Relationships, by Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jetha, is the question, then this is one couple’s fun, loving and sexy answer.The Lovely Vixen herself will pick her favourite of the first 50 reviews on Amazon or Goodreads to receive a $100 Amazon gift card as a prize.
