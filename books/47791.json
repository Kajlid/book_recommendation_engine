  "title": "The Intentional Christian Community Handbook: For Idealists, Hypocrites, and Wannabe Disciples of Jesus",
  "description": "“This is a book that we've needed for a long, long time . . . . This is a book for people who long for community and for people who've found it; for young seekers and for old radicals. Like a farmer's almanac or a good cookbook, it's a guide that doesn't tell you what to do, but rather gives you the resources you need to find your way together with friends in the place where you are. We couldn't be more grateful to have a book like this. And we couldn't be happier to share it with you.” —Shane Claiborne and Jonathan Wilson-HartgroveIn the 21st century, a new generation of Spirit-energized people are searching for a new—yet ancient—way of life together. David Janzen, a friend of the New Monasticism movement with four decades of personal communal experience, has visited scores of communities, both old and new.  The Intentional Christian Community Handbook  shares his wisdom, as well as the experience of intentional Christian communities across North America over the last half century.",
