  "title": "The System: Who Rigged It, How We Fix It",
  "description": "From the bestselling author of Saving Capitalism and The Common Good, comes an urgent analysis of how the \"rigged\" systems of American politics and power operate, how this status quo came to be, and how average citizens can enact change.\nThere is a mounting sense that our political-economic system is no longer working, but what is the core problem and how do we remedy it? With the characteristic clarity and passion that have made him a central civil voice, bestselling author of Saving Capitalism and The Common Good Robert B. Reich shows how wealth and power have combined to install an oligarchy and undermine democracy. Reich exposes the myths of meritocracy, national competitiveness, corporate social responsibility, the “free market,” and the political “center,” all of which are used by those at the top to divert attention from their takeover of the system and to justify their accumulation of even more wealth and power. In demystifying the current system, Reich reveals where power actually lies and how it is wielded, and invites us to reclaim power and remake the system for all.",
