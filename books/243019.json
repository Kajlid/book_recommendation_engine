  "description": "He saved me... And then he blood-bonded me. Now I'm his.My first meeting with a Chicago vampire went better than expected. Up until that night, all I knew about vampires was limited to a few common facts: they drink blood, they get a mean sunburn and if you find yourself alone with one, you’re dead. Except he didn't kill me. Sexy, broody Warin clearly had his own reasons for sparing my life and tying me with his blood, but if he’d known how much trouble I’d attract, I bet he wouldn’t have bothered. When he blood-bonded me, secrets even I didn’t know about myself came to light. Secrets that will pull us both deep into the eternal war between vampires and the witches determined to rid the world of their evil. We have only one choice now: fight the forces hell-bent on breaking our bond… Or die.",
