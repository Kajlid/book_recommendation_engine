  "description": "Socially inclined but time-deprived? Want to see friends for dinner, but can't do more than order takeout or meet in a restaurant? Well, help is here. From Beverly Mills and Alicia Ross-whose nationally syndicated column reaches millions of readers through 115 papers comes the perfect cookbook for the harried would-be host and hostess.Desperation Entertaining! is filled with 200 marvelous recipes for impressive dinner party food. Desperation Entertaining! is a complete game plan for having guests over (children included) without having to spend more than 20 minutes on a dish, or 20 minutes per cook-ahead phase. There are tips on saving time (buy pre-peeled garlic, doctor supermarket potato salad with fresh chopped onions and paprika); sanity (tie the bottle opener to the cooler); and money (sangria costs less than wine). But of course the genius of the book is in the Cajun Catfish Gumbo, Cabernet Pasta Sauce with Italian Sausage, Greek Stifado with Artichokes, Citrus Shrimp Kebabs, Grilled Pork Chops with Southern Peach Salsa. Plus plenty of homemade desserts that won't break the host, including Rocky Road Brownie Sundaes, Berkshires Blueberry Crisp, and Sunset Key Lime Pies. Who's coming over next week?",
