  "description": "Detective Jeremy Lawson doesn't expect anything from his one-night stand except sex. What he gets is a shooting, a mystery, plus some of the best sex he's had in a long time. Somewhere along the way, he also finds some tenderness for a lost soul in need of rescuing. David March has let his troubled past blind him to any kind of happy future. But when a one-night stand turns out to be a cop in shining armor, David begins to think differently about his life. As in, he wants one. But to have one, he has to stay alive. Note: For maximum reader enjoyment, we suggest reading Hidden Force (David) and A Helping Hand (Jeremy), where our two heroes were secondary characters.",
