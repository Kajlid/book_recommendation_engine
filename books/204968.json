  "description": "THE BLADESMITH is a novella in the Lily Harper series and is narrated by leading character, Tallis Black!  Please note, this is a novella and is, therefore, shorter in length than the other Lily novels.Tallis Black is not accustomed to playing the role of prisoner. Yet that is exactly the predicament in which he finds himself in this latest installment of the Lily Harper Series.  Tortured, malnourished and at the mercy of Persephone, a vengeful spirit who resides within the body of the woman he loves, Tallis’s future looks bleak. But the two thousand year old Druid is not concerned with himself. Instead, he wants nothing more than to free Lily from Persephone’s grasp.  In doing so, Tallis will face his own struggles as Persephone forces him to expose information about himself that he’s previously kept hidden from Lily. Tallis’s only hope is that if he is able to save Lily, she won’t turn on him once she learns the truth about his sordid past.",
