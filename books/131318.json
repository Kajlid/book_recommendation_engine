  "title": "Wrapped Around Your Heart",
  "description": "Open your heart to three small-town love stories... Begin your journey in Boot Creek where traditions are sweet as candy, and memories come wrapped with soft ribbons. Wander to Willow Bay where first love is fresh as warm-baked cookies, and romance lasts a lifetime. And follow the trail to Thistle Bend where cinnamon rolls come out perfect, but proposals are much less predictable.  Find love at every fork in the road—different kinds at different times. Then… Now… Forever… Wrapped around your heart.",
