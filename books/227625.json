  "description": "From the New York Times bestselling author of A Dog Named Christmas comes this heartwarming Christmas story about the power of family and the strength and love that comes from our pets. In this installment of the poignant stories of the McCray family and their lovable canines in rural Kansas, matriarch Mary Ann McCray is determined to shake up Christmas by accepting the role as Crossing Trail's first woman Santa Claus. Mary Ann, always a bit of a rebel, is looking to offer a more progressive voice in the staunchly conservative town at Christmastime and has a few ideas up her red velvet sleeves.But all isn't whimsy in town as the McCrays' close friends the Robinsons decide to divorce during the holiday season, turning their young children Keenan and Emily's lives upside down.And then there is Mary Ann and George McCray's son, Todd, who has moved back to town to be with his girlfriend and to start a new job at the city's animal shelter. Tagging along with Todd is the incorrigible Elle, an oddly shaped dervish of a dog that Todd stubbornly tries to train as a service dog. However lovable, Elle has a hard time staying out of trouble, and the refrain, \"No, Elle! No, Elle!\" is often heard throughout town.Lately, though, Todd feels like his life is headed down a troubled path. Although he is concerned that he has disappointed his parents with some of his recent decisions, Todd feels the need to make his own choices an live life his way.The McCrays and the Robinsons are in need of a Christmas angel this year, but when you live in Crossing Trails, anything is possible.",
