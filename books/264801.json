  "description": "College sophomore Amber Meadows is terrible at relationships. So when she goes on a blind date with Kevin (who is impossibly cute, charming, and actually, literally blind) she's terrified she'll screw up her new romance before it even begins.Desperate for backup, Amber secretly texts her two besties for advice on how to win Kevin over. Nora is level-headed, quick-witted, and highly (almost scarily) intelligent. Celery is quirky, impulsive, and does not have one single F to give. They never agree. On anything. Ever.When a mysterious woman kidnaps Kevin at gunpoint, Amber's date turns into a madcap adventure filled with incompetent drug dealers, psychotic trivia masters, and one super pissed-off waiter. With Nora and Celery's help, can Amber win Kevin's heart? Or at least get them both to the end of the date alive?Told entirely through text messages, the Texting Girls series is perfect for fans of Lauren Myracle's \"Internet Girls,\" Lisa Greenwald's \"TBH,\" and Brett Wright's \"OMG Shakespeare.\"",
