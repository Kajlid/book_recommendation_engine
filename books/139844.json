  "description": "If you enjoy tales of epic battles, fearsome dragons and dark, brooding evil, then you'll almost certainly enjoy the works of John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, who, in addition to being very good at that sort of thing, had possibly the most splendid name in the history of the fantasy genre.On the other hand, if you have a penchant for lovelorn vampires, feisty warriors and unnecessarily cryptic ancient prophesies, then you should have absolutely no difficulty in finding something suitable - albeit not in this particular novel.But on the other hand (and this being a work of fantasy, having three hands is not entirely out of the question) if your keenest wish is for a strange and digressive saga about cartography, magic and perhaps just the small matter of changing history itself, then you've hit upon a niche in which this book is largely without peer.'Unreliable Histories' is the first in a two-part duology known as 'The Written World.' Its sequel, also now available, is 'The Endless Land.' Both are published as ebooks for Kindle.",
