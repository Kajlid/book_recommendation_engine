No one is brave enough to ignore the sergeant at arms, unless your Mia.  Mia is an outspoken, opinionated, firecracker that can explode without warning. The motorcycle club may have saved her and her, newly established, sisters from human traffickers, but that doesnâ€™t mean she owes them anything. Going from one prison to another is not something she is willing to be thankful for.  Can Mia find a way to escape and keep her three sisters alive in the process? Or will Torch end up setting her body aflame with his possessiveness and demanding ways?   WARNING: THIS BOOK CONTAINS SCENES THAT ARE NOT SUITED FOR ANYONE UNDER THE AGE OF 18.
