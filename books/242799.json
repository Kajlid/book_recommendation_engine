  "description": "Shea Finnegan always played it safe. Khali Reza made her break all of her own rules. She was a Catholic lawyer and the daughter of a prominent U.S Senator, who grew up cautious and hyper-aware of public appearances. He was a Pakistani Muslim businessman on a one year visa in New York. It was only supposed to be a fling, but when you fall, gravity has a way of taking over. When Khali must return to Pakistan they agree to make a clean break, and an opportunistic politician swoops in to make his move on Shea. Marco Gutierrez appears to be a perfect fit, but appearances can be deceiving and dangerous. Travelling through New York, Karachi, and London, Fall into You is a compelling story of overcoming differences, finding your strength, and the healing power of love.",
