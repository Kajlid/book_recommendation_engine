  "description": "OUT OF PRINTMy name is Delores Diamond Drew, and I’ve got a bone to pick. From an early age, I knew I didn’t want to be part of the cutthroat society my predator family sits at the top of, nor did I ascribe to their legacy of division and elitism. It’s all such utter BS. However, I was brainwashed to believe that if I wanted to live a successful life, I would sit still, shut up, and look pretty. And if I didn’t mold myself to their expectations, the threat of death was never too far off. So I’ve played their games in hopes I can live long enough to find my own way.But there’s a light at the end of the tunnel—Apex Academy. If I can make a good impression during my campus tour, then I’ll no longer be living under the same roof as my scheming parents, free to make my own decisions, free to find out who I am.And the fact the academy seems to be crawling with hot-bod professors sure doesn’t hurt. Here I come, early admission!Unfortunately, life has a way of sneaking up on you, and I’m starting to suspect that what I think is real is just more smoke and mirrors. When the truth finally comes to light, I may have to finally decide whether I continue to obey...or burn these expectations to the ground.---Come Out & Prey is the “preyquel” to Let Us Prey--book 1 in the steamy and mysterious Apex Society Capers standalone paranormal romance series. Please preorder Let Us Prey for more of our bunny, Delores, her hottie professors, and the secrets surrounding Apex.Please see inside the book for a full list of triggers and warnings.",
