  "description": "A plague of mutant grasshoppers is invading American suburbia. An underground suicide cult is gaining national prominence. Gangs of teenage boys with blow torches run amok. But what really has fourteen-year-old Edie Stein distracted from her townâ€™s annual Feminine Woman of Conscience Pageant is Lana Grimaldi, the sexy girl next door. How does a feminine woman of conscience deal with her? Just Like Beauty is a brilliantly inventive blend of adolescent angst and cultural satire set in a disconcertingly not-so-distant future.",
