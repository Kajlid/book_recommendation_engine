  "description": "Luck can change with the flutter of a heartbeat.Dashiel Rosen’s luck shackled him to a life of homelessness and drug use. Every chase of chemical highs slips him further into debt—in both crime and in his soul. To stay alive from men who want him dead, he’s become a master in Parkour. Running, even if it is leaping off buildings with gravity-defying ability, is cowardly, and being unable to function without a fix has made Dash hate himself, but he can’t see a way out of hell.Hazel Whitlock has the perfect upbringing. Passing her veterinary degree with honours, she’s earned a night on the town. Friends come. Drinks are enjoyed. And in the morning, her life is never the same again. She won the lottery. And not just any lottery. The highest jackpot ever. Zel does the logical thing and rents a super yacht, the Octopus, and her and her sister embark on a one year around the world adventure in the height of luxury. What Zel didn’t plan on was a stowaway in the form of a dusty ragamuffin with eyes betraying secrets and pain. Unable to return Dash to port, they form an uneasy alliance, agreeing to stay out of each other’s way. But stuck at sea emotions run high, and tension consumes them. In a lucky, or not so lucky, twist of fate, Dash and Zel’s lives interweave, and the consequences of luck demand more than either of them can pay.Luck can change in the flutter of a heartbeat.Bad luck can destroy just as quickly",
