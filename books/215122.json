  "description": "For fans of young adult contemporary fantasy comes an exciting new world of magic and mystery.Being magical isn’t everything Jake hoped it would be.Jake knew he was meant for something more than the normal teen life he pretended to live. There has to be more to life than ticking down the moments until the mindless drudgery of school ended each day. And then his father disappeared.Vanishing before Jake’s eyes, his father abandons him to a hidden world of wizards and magic, thrusting Jake into the middle of a war he’s not prepared to fight. A war in which more than his life is at stake. Hounded by the Dark Knights, Jake holds the key to the Drogue. A myth. A legend. So old, even the storybooks have all but forgotten its story. Jake doesn’t know why the Dark Knights think he has it, but he must find it before they find him.For where the Dark Knights go, death follows.***Series has been republished as The Shadow Army Trilogy***",
