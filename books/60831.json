  "description": "The stunning second book in Bigfoot Galaxy series. Edstrom knows how to spin a fascinating—and fast-paced yarn! If you thought it couldn’t get more exciting (or weirder), you’ve got a great read in store. They think their adventures are behind them, but the war between tangoga and bigfeet still rages! The six teens who were rescued from a mountainside in the Canadian Rockies are now famous. But only they know the true story...of what they discovered, what they survived...of Undermountain. Those secrets bind them together and pull them toward an ill-fated reunion. The tangoga boss GorVit searches for a lost technology, the terrible weapon of a vanished race. And he'll happily use Breyona as leverage to get Danny's help. Thrust into the midst of war, and into the arms of a beautiful queen, Danny races on a collision course with destiny. And Breyona, still testing the limits of her amazing powers, must choose between what she desires and what is right. One will give in. One will give up. One will give all. Bigfoot Afterlife was previously published as Afterlife (The Undermountain Saga #2)",
