  "title": "The Problem of Poverty",
  "description": "The text, translated and introduced by James Skillen, was originally a speech by Abraham Kuyper (1837-1920) that opened the first Christian Social Congress in The Netherlands on 9 November 1891. His words not only illuminate with stark simplicity many of the enduring problems of poverty, they also bring a strong and pointed biblical message that has outlived Kuyper's time and place. Roger Henderson's essay \"How Abraham Kuyper Became a Kuyperian\" is included in the appendix.",
