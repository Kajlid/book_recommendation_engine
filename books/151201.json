  "description": "This item is no longer available.Oliver Donovan isn't exactly what you might call a normal teenager. Not anymore. The sudden emergence of an uncommon gift changes his entire life, and not for the better. After he is suspected to have had a hand in a family tragedy, he is shipped off to The Delafontaine School to learn discipline and good manners. He soon discovers that there is nothing typical about The Delafontaine School either. When a group of senior boys invites him into their circle, he discovers that his admittance to the school is no accident. When he and his friends set out to expose the true nature of Delafontaine, they find themselves caught in a war with an administration determined to extinguish anything and everything extraordinary. And unfortunately, that means them as well. Warning: Brief mentions of drug use, abuse, some harsh language. 15+ recommended.",
