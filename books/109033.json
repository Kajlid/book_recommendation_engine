  "description": "PI-in-training Rylie Keyes just can't catch a break. While decked out in a Baconaise costume and handing out foot-long chocolate bars at a Halloween party, she's attacked by a costumed gorilla--and that's not even the worst part. The gorilla is the mother of Rylie's sidekick and best friend, Solo, and she's being accused of assaulting the hunky bodyguard of a local billionaire. Between the gun-toting senior citizens at the Fountain of Youth Retirement Home, billionaires, and pie makers, nobody is above suspicion when Rylie is on the case.  Add in her budding relationship with a certain gorgeous Scot and she's got more trouble that she can shake a Snickers at!",
