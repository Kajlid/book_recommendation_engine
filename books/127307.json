  "description": "Reuel CO469 is tall, dark, and infinitely dangerous. His is the face that launched a million flyers. He is the first of his kind, the first cyborg to go rogue, the leader of all who-d come after him, and the only rogue nobody has ever come close to catching. From the moment Dalia first sets eyes on him, she knows she is lost. She can no more resist his dark allure than she can cease to breathe. Graphic violence, graphic sex, explicit language, profanity, menage a trois, bondage, self sex, and exhibitionism. This is the story of a woman-s love for two very different men.",
