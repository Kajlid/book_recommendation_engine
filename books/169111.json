On vacation with her family in Italy, Sky expects nothing more than fun, sun and shopping, but a chance encounter with a gorgeous young Italian man changes her life forever. Handsome, strong and romantic, JC is everything a girl could want. But behind the charming accent and bad-boy image lies a dark and troubled soul. Sky could be the answer to his prayers, but JC's demons may be stronger than his love for her. Their paths cross again, Skylar is an aspiring model on the brink of international success. She has almost everything she could want: beauty, fame, fortune, and her two best friends. Jean Carlo DePandi, billionaire and playboy, has turned his family's humble Italian vineyards into Europe's most recognized brand of wine, but he too hides a troubled past.

His need for control dominates his life, and he's not afraid to cross boundaries to get what he wants. He wants Skylar.
