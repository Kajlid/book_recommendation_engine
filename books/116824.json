  "description": "This second entry to the Kellie's Diary series is about twice as long as Book 1.--------It has been almost a full year since the outbreak occurred. Kellie has just turned 10 and she is still alive and well, telling her diary \"Barbie\" everything she encounters. She's grown more resourceful in her time alone, and has learned to live with the dangers around her. Kellie has run low on resources so she formulates a plan to go to Oregon, where her grandfather's farm is located, in the hope that the rest of her family will be there waiting. She leaves home and starts her long journey. Along the way she runs into many dangers; some are expected, while others are unexpected and beyond anything she's ever experienced... even in her worst nightmares.(Intended for mature readers; references to disturbing events.)",
