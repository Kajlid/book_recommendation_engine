  "description": "While longing to break free from a lifetime of responsibility, Annabel Morgan has never ventured away from the corners of Straight and Narrow. With her stepdaughter heading off for college, now might be the time to pursue her dreams of going to film school, traveling to Paris… dating guys with tattoos. Living on the edge is the only way larger-than-life Investigative Reporter Mad Max Williams knows how to roll. He’s known for partying with strippers, riding a Harley, and standing up for the little guys. With New York calling, he’s ready to move up and on in his career. As wary acquaintances and rivals for a local media award, they deeply disapprove of one another—except for that zing of attraction they can’t quite ignore. When they’re matched up for a date on a television talk show, can Mad Max convince conventional Annabel to take a ride on the wild side?",
