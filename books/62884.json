  "description": "In \"Divine Love in Time of Storms\" we are taken back to early 1300's when the Mongol invasion was in full force around Korea and Japan. We follow Haneul's personal story of love and loss during those years and how he ended up in Japan living under Mikoto's roof. There he finds himself embroiled in a one sided relationship with Mikoto's daughter,Annika. We also find out how he met up with some of the other immortals. Rion/Amirani Devin/Devan, Kahl all show up in this story and together they help save Japan from the invading forces of Kublai Khan.THE PULSE HISTORIA is a series of short stories chronicling various episodes in the lives of A Jacob Sweenyâ€™s beloved Immortals from the smash hit trilogy THE PULSE MYTHS which includes the books Pulse Of Heroes,Of Blood & Pulse and soon to come Pulse Genesis.*WARNING!!! The author would like to add this light warning about THE PULSE HISTORIA series as a whole: \"In this series we may follow real historical events, meaning that facts are not sugarcoated. History is brutal and not always \"politically correct\". As a historian, I am presenting a narrative without concern as to what some people might think is right or wrong to portray. In addition, as we are following more personal stories of our much loved heroes, remember that they are GROWN MEN and will be doing grown men things. Maybe a little steamier than the average YA narrative.\" -A. Jacob Sweeny",
