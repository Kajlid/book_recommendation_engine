  "description": "FINDING MY GIRL / LOVING TALIA is a companion booklet to the contemporary romance novel, LOVE LIKE OURS (Sugar Lake series). If this is your first Melissa Foster book, please note that Finding My Girl / Loving Talia is not a novel, a novella, or even a typical short story. It is a companion booklet to the full-length contemporary romance novel, Love Like Ours, featuring Talia Dalton and Derek Grant. In Love Like Ours, one of the many ways Derek shows his love for Talia is through cute and loving sketches depicting their lives as they came together. Finding My Girl / Loving Talia is a collection of those images, along with a couple of images that Jonah, Derek's father, had drawn for his wife, Eva. Within these pages you will also find heartfelt messages from Derek to Talia that are not found in the original novel. As a bonus, I have included the first chapter of Love Like Ours in the back of the booklet.I hope you enjoy this quick, visual adaptation of Derek and Talia's journey into coupledom. To read their full-length love story, please buy Love Like Ours, a Sugar Lake novel (available in digital, paperback, and audio formats).~ MelissaSUGAR LAKE SERIES The Real Thing (Free on Kindle Unlimited)Only For You (Free on Kindle Unlimited)Love Like Ours (Free on Kindle Unlimited)--bonus companion booklet, Finding My Girl/Loving Talia",
