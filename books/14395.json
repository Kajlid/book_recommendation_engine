  "description": "Book #2 The Good Finding out she was a witch was more difficult for Willyn Brousseau than any of the nine women in her newfound coven. She’s a mother, a healer, and wears a cross around her neck to proudly declare her religion. Though she and her friends are just learning to master their power, Willyn’s time is up. It’s her turn to stand against evil and pass her individual trial. What else could go possibly wrong? The Bad Dare Forster is well acquainted with the prophecy, the demon, and the coven’s magic. It’s precisely why he’s come to the island near Savannah. He’s a witch bearing a grudge, but he also has a plan. He just needs one of the nine to make it happen. The Undeniable Willyn and Dare come together like flint and brimstone, rejecting the desire that sparks between them. He’s no good for her, and she’s his sworn enemy. Both will be tested in ways they can’t imagine and hope that love will save them, body and soul.",
