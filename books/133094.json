Once, Mariah dreamed their old friendship would kindle into something more--but that was before she heard that Cyril was courting the cruelhearted Lady Pearl. Now Mariah is willing to welcome him as a friend and pray he will finally be the heir her stepfather needs, but she'll keep her heart locked safely away from anyone with such poor taste. Due to misunderstandings, Cyril Lightbourne has long avoided returning to Plumford Manor, yet he reluctantly arrives in time for Christmas. When his friendship with Lady Mariah reignites, he finds himself torn between his affection for her and her family's distance toward him because of Lady Pearl, a woman he'd rather forget. Then, more trouble arrives in the form of a Danish lord on a mission to win Mariah's hand by Christmas . . . and to disgrace Cyril in the process.Inspired by The Nutcracker, this Edwardian-era historical romance is a tale of holiday spirit, love, and the power of family and friendship from bestselling and award-winning author Roseanna M. White.",
