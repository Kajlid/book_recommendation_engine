Our marriage was over, it had been for a long time, but now she’s abandoning our son, and neither of us are happy about it.  My assistant, Amber, and I have been flirting for months. There’s a strong connection between us, and we both know it. Tapping into our mutual love for basketball, I bring Amber on to help coach my son’s team. Now my ex is back and making demands. I know I should always trust my gut. When I don’t, things go wrong, and it leaves us with a lesson…It’s not how you start, it’s how you finish ... rise up!",
