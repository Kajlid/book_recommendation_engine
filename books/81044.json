  "title": "Vermont Voodoo",
  "description": "A dark ritual and an angry voodoo spirit are never a good combo. Now, to appease the spirit, AJ must travel to the sleepy industrial city of Frostbite, Vermont to find the Bokor that put her under this curse. But Frostbite has a secret of its own: Zombies. It doesnâ€™t help that her mentor has mysteriously vanished, or that she has to compete with a scientist who wants to experiment on the undead. AJ must pull all her resources and team up with an unlikely hero - a coffin builder with mysterious powers - to unlock the secrets of Frostbite... or stay cursed forever. Filled with suspense and cheeky humor, Vermont Voodoo is a great read for anyone who already loves artists such as Charlaine Harris or Joss Whedon. This story avoids the George Romero interpretation of zombies, and instead returns to the folklore of African-American voodoo - but with a modern interpretation.",
