  "description": "Will his love be enough to keep her safe? Julie doesn't know what to think when the man she's had a crush on her entire life--a man she thinks is meant to be her sister's mate--starts flirting with her after she returns home from college. The harder she tries to distance herself, the harder he works to win her over. He can't want to mate with her...a freak born a full human among shifters. So why won't he accept her rejection? Brendan waited years for Julie's return. Now that she's finally home, there's nothing to keep him from her...not even her three alpha wolf brothers. But he's not the only one after Julie. Something is stalking her and Brendan's protective instincts toward her kick in, but at what cost? When the unthinkable happens, will Julie and Brendan's love give them the strength they need to persevere? WARNING: This title contains explicit sex",
