  "title": "Ultra-Gash Inferno",
  "description": "With influences ranging from 19th century atrocity prints to the Sex Pistols, and obsessions with horror, scatology and human freaks, Maruo has taken the \"erotic-grotesque\" (ero-guro) style of manga, a unique fusion of sex and violence to its ultimate extreme. ?? Ultra-Gash Inferno is the ultimate compendium of Suehiro Maruo's most shocking and graphically precise work, containing nine psycho-nightmares never before translated and published in English. With a translation by James Havoc (author of Butchershop In The Sky ) and Takako Shinkado, and an introduction by Romain Slocombe, Ultra-Gash Inferno is a revelatory cross-cultural event in comic-book publishing. ?? Suehiro Maruo is also the author of Camelia Girl (published in English as Mr Arashi's Amazing Freak Show ). ?? Parental discretion advised. ??",
