  "description": "Sasha is an immortal demon who has harnessed the ability to change into the form of a human to conceal herself from society, but as humanity further extends its reach across the planet it becomes almost impossible for her to hunt her favourite prey – humans themselves. Finding herself at the mercy of the police after her true nature is revealed to the public, she is forced to use her own humanity to escape – a humanity that comes at a fatal price. 'She stood slowly, and his jaw dropped as she started to change before him. The hollows of her eyes began to darken, turning into a black that spread out across her skin like an ink stain on white paper. Her fingers lengthened into claws, ears into sharp points, eyes into bottomless pits of darkness. Her mouth widened across the changing features of her face to reveal red teeth as he looked on in horror. Her body began to morph, bones lengthening and thickening, and by the time she was standing she was no longer a girl stuck in a prison cell; she was a monster trapped in a cage.'",
