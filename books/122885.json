  "description": "For 21 years, I’ve lived a relatively quiet life in Cascade Falls. But there’s more than meets the eye to our small tourist town, and I seem to get caught up in a not-so-hidden criminal empire that I never wanted any part of. The tangle I'd much rather get caught up in?The heartfelt boy next door who I’ve been crushing on for years.The sexier than sin liar who has made it his mission to keep me.The man who already has my heart but could never have my body.The sweet southern gentlemen whose darkness can’t be tamed.The bastard, pretty-boy millionaire who would rather destroy me.The cascade of lies within our pretty little town bind us together, and it’ll take all of us to untangle ourselves from the chaos and make it out alive.If we don’t kill each other first.* * *Days of Winter is a reverse harem romance intended for audiences 18+ due to mature content. The harem develops over time and features five very different men who will consume your daydreams. Our lovely lead will not have to choose between her men and the story will eventually end on a HEA, which, as in life, has a few bumps in the road to get there.This book is not considered a dark romance, but readers may encounter some material they may find sensitive. A full description of content can be found on my website.",
