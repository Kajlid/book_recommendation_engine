  "description": "Fresh from prison, Tomato \"Mad Dog\" Rodriguez returns to find her once-bohemian Mission neighborhood overrun by Latte People trading stocks on cell phones while careening down sidewalks in their Ford Explorers. Rents have multiplied to the square root of horror, forcing the families, elderly artists, and hippies - those who didn't already get run over on the sidewalks - to flee in droves, leaving behind only those willing to serve noisy coffees and change the deadly Firestone tires.",
