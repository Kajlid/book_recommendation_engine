  "description": "Called one of the most original talents in American fiction by The New York Times Book Review, Paul West is a continuously surprising and satisfying writer, whose oeuvre stands as one of the most important in American literature in recent decades. In \"Those Pearls His Eyes\" a scientific genius finds his eyesight transformed by a solar eclipse into a vision of stupendous magnification and, driven by a horrible but compulsive curiosity, he finds himself staring into the abyss of matter itself.\"Tan Salaam\" documents the reaches of mystic zeal when a former Tanzanian civil servant (dismissed for poaching) is interviewed by a visiting journalist as he sits atop a thirty foot column of elephant dung in 120 degree heat.In \"The Sun in Heat\" the sun delivers a searing love serenade to a small dullish star lightyears away and known only to him as M20.The constellation of stories in this collection revolve around the burning, bright, and extraordinary imagination of Paul West. His distinctive vision embraces galaxies and molecular events, an omniscient presence overseeing the tragic, the mundane, and the absurd of human and cosmic worlds.",
