  "description": "Ryker -- After 20 years in the military, I find myself doing my dad's dirty work. But as the \"prince\" of the Hades Abyss MC, it's expected of me. Doing a little recon in a small Alabama town should have been boring as shit, until the hot little minx I met at a bar turned my life upside down. Women always fall at my feet, but this one was different. If I'd known she was a virgin, I might have backed away, but now that I've had a taste I just want to keep coming back for more. Little did I realize that I'd just fucked the sister of a Dixie Reaper, and my life was about to become all kinds of complicated. I had to wonder... had she fucked me because she wanted me? Or was it all some kind of setup?Laken -- My big brother Flicker is always ruining my fun, keeping the guys away from me, so when I finally get a chance for a hot guy to get rid of my V-card, I'm all for it. Ryker's hot and has that alpha vibe, and the fact he's ex-military just made me wetter. It never occurred to me that he was a biker, or that I might have just screwed up a big deal for the Dixie Reapers. It seems my sexy Ryker isn't just some hot military guy. No, he's the son of the President of the Hades Abyss MC. So I hide like big brother asks me to. Just one problem... Ryker doesn't leave, and now I'm late. How am I supposed to tell Ryker that I'm carrying his child? When life fucks me over, it does it royally.",
