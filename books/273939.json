  "description": "Nothing sucks more than to be dragged to school against your will. Unless you are me, one of the last descendants of Abraham Van Helsing, and the school is the Van Helsing Academy. There's never been a member who refused to carry on the Van Helsing legacy until me. It's not because I'm a rebel and irresponsible, which I am. Seeing my parents slaughtered by the monsters they were supposed to hunt is what made me turn my back on the fame and glory I didn't earn.I don't plan to stick around. But when some Big Bad wannabe threatens my brother's life, I have no choice but to accept the call of duty. To do so, I must pass a set of dangerous trials and the person assigned to train me is Alex Saintcrow, a Dark Blades druid who makes me wish the act of clubbing someone to death wasn't a crime. He's cocky, lethal, and worse of all, he's sex on a stick. He makes me feel things I shouldn't nor have the time for. If I don't kill the jackass monster gunning for my family, it might be the ending of the Van Helsing legacy. For real.",
