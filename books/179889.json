  "description": "Dan Tarnowski’s poems reach through the page on a lonely Saturday night, and remind you that you’re not alone in your ennui and doubt. A trembling despair courses through these words on the edge, words written from extreme states like the existential moment after watching a film on netflix, or the itch that drives one to go for a walk in the night, hoping a new direction lights up.Tarnowski’s life situation, the poet stuck between a rock and a dive bar wall, is precarious, but you’ll see yourself in his vulnerability. The poems will find you lying on your bedroom floor, unable to afford a cup of coffee after a night of drinking, looking up at a dark sky after someone has walked out of your life, and searching the underworld of a strange city for someone.Tarnowski’s world is dark and stark, but frequently lit by a backdrop of lights from mysterious buildings.",
