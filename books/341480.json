  "description": "In this terrific debut, a Brooklyn middle-schooler finds the superhero within himself thanks to old friends, new dreams, and a pair of magical \"Dora the Explorer\" sneakers.Ever since a deeply unfortunate incident earlier this year, Reggie's been known as \"Pukey\" McKnight at his high-intensity Brooklyn middle school. He wants to turn his image around, but he has other things on his mind as his father, who's out of a job; his best friends, Ruthie and Joe C.; his former best friend Donovan, who's now become a jerk; and of course, the beautiful Mialonie. The elections for school president are coming up, but with his notorious nickname and \"nothing\" social status, Reggie wouldn't stand a chance, if he even had the courage to run. (CONT.)",
