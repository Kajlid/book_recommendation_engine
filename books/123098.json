  "title": "Glenarvon",
  "description": "Published anonymously in 1816, the same year in which Lamb's husband's family attempted to have her declared insane, Glenarvon tells the story of the love affair that shook London society. Few early readers could fail to recognize the author as irresponsible Calantha, William Lamb as her long-suffering husband Lord Avondale, or the legendary Lord Byron himself, \"mad, bad and dangerous to know,\" as the strangely and tragically irresistible Glenarvon.",
