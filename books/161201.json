  "description": "In the summer of 1942, America has entered WWII, and it’s a terrifying time for nineteen-year-old Eve Oelrichs. When a merchant marine ship is torpedoed by a U-boat off the coast of Massachusetts right before her eyes, Eve tries to join the Coastal Picket Patrol, a civilian yacht patrol, but no girls are allowed. She decides to patrol the bays where she has grown up anyway, but when she and her first mate, Mr. Vern, find a life raft with German saboteurs attempting to row to the mainland, she has to find more courage within herself than she thought she could muster.  This sweet coming-of-age sea story is not a romance, but it is a lovely story about a girl becoming a woman during the harrowing days of WWII.  How this fits into the Billionaires in Disguise series: Eve Oelrichs is Georgiana (Oelrichs) Johnson’s great-great-aunt.",
