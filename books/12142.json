  "title": "A Refutation of Moral Relativism: Interviews with an Absolutist",
  "description": "No issue is more fateful for civilization than moral relativism. History knows not one example of a successful society which repudiated moral absolutes. Yet most attacks on relativism have been either pragmatic (looking at its social consequences) or exhorting (preaching rather than proving), and philosophers' arguments against it have been specialized, technical, and scholarly. In his typical unique writing style, Peter Kreeft lets an attractive, honest, and funny relativist interview a \"Muslim fundamentalist\" absolutist so as not to stack the dice personally for absolutism. In an engaging series of personal interviews, every conceivable argument the \"sassy Black feminist\" reporter Libby gives against absolutism is simply and clearly refuted, and none of the many arguments for moral absolutism is refuted.",
