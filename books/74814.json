Joey may be glad to be alive, but not everyone welcomes her presence. Especially not Joey’s glamorous fiancée, who has her own plans for his future.Every second Callie spends in the past she’s altering much more than Joey’s fate. She’s changing the lives of everyone around her. And she’s growing closer to Joey by the minute.If Callie can’t find a way back to her own time soon, she may lose more than a college education and the career she’s always wanted.
