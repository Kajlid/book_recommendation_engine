  "description": "What lies beyond death? This seems to be one of the greatest questions in the world. What happens when we die? Near death experiences, is there a heaven, is God real? Joey used to hear people tell these stories about how they met God, how they were faced with their own life review. How they entered into a tunnel of light when they died and what they found. He was not a believer, whether it was in God, hell or the afterlife. He would never be a believer. Nothing was going to change the way he thought, nothing.Until the day he died….Joey was killed by a massive heart attack, and was dead for 57 minutes. He was on life support for 15 days, his chances were not good of surviving and it was medically over for him. He miraculously came back to life with no physical or neurological damage.  Joey has been to heaven and back and has an incredible story of survival and the afterlife. God gave Joey a message to share. Honestly, who is going to make a bigger impact, a believer, or a 6’5”, tattooed, rough around the edges, ex outlaw biker? A true story about life, death and what happens when we die.",
