  "description": "As a young boy, rounding a bend in a remote Maine cove, Dave Roper stumbled upon two mermaids. No one believed him then. No one believes him now. But he kept watching and what is imagined and what is real? And while he watched and wondered during 50 years of waterborne life – as a boy, a teen, an adult, a father – what he pulled from the sea was not another mermaid, but the mystery, possibility, romance, joy, fear, and uncertainty that mermaids represent. Based on real experiences, these 30 stories take you on that journey. Once aboard you Share the fantasy world of a teenage solo cruising sailor as he meets his biggest a 22 year old woman. Enter the frenzied mind of a young man who falls overboard 300 miles from shore at night and looks death in the eye. Push down a few beers with Big Red, a legendary Mississippi River pilot, and experience the hard-scrabble world of river life. Climb aboard a 135 foot Mississippi River sternwheeler headed straight into a tornado, with 300 oblivious wedding guests on board. Join a young delivery skipper as he takes two very uncertain aspiring voyagers on world’s shortest circumnavigation attempt… aboard a floating Winnebago. Probe deep up a saltwater creek to meet the reclusive King of Yurtdom and his technology-free world of Mongolian tribal huts. Experience a 50th wedding anniversary at sea and a coincidence right out of the Twilight Zone. Cheer for an octogenarian as his grandson kidnaps him from the clutches of a nursing home for one long last sail on his old wooden sloop. So fill your favorite mug, settle into that stuffed reading chair, poke the stove a few times, and dive into Dave Roper’s new book, Watching for Mermaids.",
