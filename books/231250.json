Trapped in a frightening web of espionage, royal intrigue and murder, Mark must fight for the glory of the country he knows and loves...and for the dazzling Egyptian woman he can't live without.From the decadence of King Farouk's court, to the fury of Rommel's desert legions, to the violent uprisings of Nasser and Sadat, Sakkara sweeps across decades filled with unforgettable daring and adventure-a story of a people's struggle for freedom and one man's triumph against all odds.",
