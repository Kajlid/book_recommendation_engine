  "description": "Will his purchased second-chance destroy the one person he’s trying to save?   Lorelei Grey, the countess of Kimpton, carries her love for her husband hidden deep within her heart. When she learns he’s exiled her brother from England she is beyond devastated. But what is she to do with the knowledge that he’s fathered his ex-mistress’s unborn child? Her only stipulation when they’d married was that he treat her with respect.   Thorne Grey, the Earl of Kimpton, is in the unique position of desiring his adorable wife, far more than usual in those of his station. But someone is spreading horrific untruths, and through his own lack of foresight, Thorne finds he can hardly defend himself. Instead, he must find a way to show her a man is a work in progress. Her threat to leave throws him in a panic. What does he do? Offers her an exorbitant amount of money to stay. Now he has two weeks and prays he’s bought enough time to locate her missing brother, and prove he’s not the scoundrel she believes him to be.   Their explosive passion can’t be denied. And neither can the desperate situation in which they become embroiled—one that threatens their very lives.",
