He was Jewish.In August 1977, she read the following item in \"The Australian\" newspaper.Nazi Mass Killer Dies a PauperA man believed to be the infamous Nazi war criminal Eduard Roschmann - known as the Butcher of Riga - has died in a hospital for down-and-outs in Paraguay.An SS captain in the Jewish ghetto of Riga, Latvia, during World War II, Roschmann is said to have ordered the slaughter of 40,000 Jews.Reading those words brought back a flood of painful memories for Ingeborg. Her resentment, hatred, and bitterness towards Roschmann had lain buried for more than thirty years. Not forgiven or forgotten were the twelve months in 1943-44 when Ingeborg and her baby daughter were at the complete mercy of the Butcher of Riga. Forced into a dreadful game of bluff she was powerless to control. Ingeborg Hesse managed to live a double life... outwardly Roschmann's mistress but in reality Sascha Gruschko's wife - a hunted escapee of Riga's infamous Jewish ghetto. This is her story.",
