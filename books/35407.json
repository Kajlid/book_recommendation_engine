  "title": "The Ballad of Young Tam Lin",
  "description": "The Saga debuts with an inspired retelling of the centuries-old Scottish folk ballad Tam Lin. This insightful coming-of-age story, set in the Scottish Borders country, takes the youthful and very human protagonists on a fairytale journey of imaginative twists and turns through both humourous and risky plot complications. On May Eve of 1790, Janet, a very sheltered but wilful twenty-year-old Earl's daughter, wanders into Carterhaugh Wood. Handsome, seductive Tam Lin, who has been nineteen for the past seven years, appears and accosts her in a glade that burgeons with black roses. While navigating an ever-shifting maze of love, doubt, trust, fear, honour, passion and laughable human foibles, both lad and lass mature and learn much about themselves. But will the young man end by choosing the na√Øve girl who loves him, or another, who is the ideal embodiment of passionate womanhood?",
