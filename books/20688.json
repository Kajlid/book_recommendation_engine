  "title": "Daddy, Come & Get Me: a Dad's Adventure Through a Guatemalan Adoption",
  "description": "Daddy, Come & Get a dad’s adventure through a Guatemalan adoption tells two stories about one girl. Author Gil Michelini tells how he led his family through the process of adopting a daughter of Guatemala. Using the official Guatemalan adoption documents and assistance of those familiar with the Guatemalan culture, Michelini includes a plausible story of his daughter’s life in Guatemala and how her birthmother came to the decision to relinquish her for adoption. This story is included to illustrate and honor the sacrifice one woman endured for the sake of her daughter. This is not a how-to book. It is a story of a man facing fears to accomplish a dream and answer a calling. It is a story to give insight to how much a mother would sacrifice for her child. It is a story to encourage others to consider opening their lives to an orphan.",
