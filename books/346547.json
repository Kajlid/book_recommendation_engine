  "description": "What if the Pope WEREN'T Catholic? What if she never HAD been? It's 1997, in a universe much like ours. But here the Pope is dead, and conclave to elect the new head of the Catholic Church has chosen someone who is not a Cardinal--or even a Catholic--or even a man. Act of God? Fraud on the College of Cardinals? What changes will she bring to Church? And some people will never accept a woman Pope... how do you protect her from the those who have sworn to kill her? Imagine you're the Pope--do you let priests marry? Balance family planning, divorce, orientation, Church power...with the historic teachings of the church? This is Yarbro's breakthrough book! Speculative fiction; a modern-day political adventure; and a religious thriller set backstage at the Vatican. How do you face the responsibilities that have been handed to you--never mind that you didn't ask for them.",
