  "description": "Curses, magic, and witches. Oh, and ghosts. Can’t forget about the ghosts. These are my new normal. Apparently, falling in love with a witch isn’t the craziest thing to happen in my life. Instead of going on dates, Andrew and I hang out at coven gatherings and learn how to protect a secret book from nefarious forces. Telling friend from foe is becoming more challenging as new allegiances are formed and old bonds are exposed. Who can a girl trust when her boyfriend is a witch and her newest ally is a ghost?  Old magic. New love. It ends where it begins.  Charmed first released in monthly installments to all of my email subscribers. Ebooks are now available on Amazon and free to read via a Kindle Unlimited subscription.",
