Working at the world's lamest mini-golf course in New Hampshire can do that to one's life, especially when it's family-owned and named the Pirate's Booty. But then add in being fired by her own parents after a kid is nearly killed, and oh, yeah, a girl's life can off-the-chart suck.Sick of being labeled a dorker-ly loser, Alli seizes a chance to work at Surf Land water park. So what if it's her parents' competition? That's where all the cool kids work, including cool kids like Derek Lansing. When he asks her out, she's sure her life-changing plan can't fail.There's just one teensy little her plan is failing. With that weak stomach of hers, she should never have worked in a water park. Never. Now things are beyond strained with her parents. Her best friend, Jeff, is weirding out. Worse, she's sabotaging her relationships with both boys, probably because she doesn't feel so great about herself.So what's a girl to do?
