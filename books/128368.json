  "description": "In Shadow of a Falling Woman, author Ahmed Alsamanoudi chronicles the story of an Australian family. The romance revolves around the lives of sisters Nancy and Linda. Curvaceous, beautiful, dark-haired Nancy is every man’s fantasy. Her come-hither was such a magnet for boys during her high school years that her strait-laced, God-fearing, devout parents sent her to an all-girls’ Catholic high school to remove any temptations from her education. After high school Nancy attended college to study accounting. While away from home, she honors her parents’ wishes that she have nothing to do with boys even though she was being constantly bombarded by male attention. Nancy, however, once meets a college mate at the coffee shop. Three years after their torrid love affair, she and Tony are married. Two children follow soon. Tony and Nancy struggle to save for a house. Linda, on the other hand, is too practical to get involved with boys. She wants an expensive car and a big house. Linda believes that love can happen after marriage. She marries a rich pharmacy student. Catastrophe befalls the family. Their father suffers a heart attack, and their mom dies in a car accident. Nancy and Tony suffer financial and job losses in the 2007 recession in Australia. Just when they despair about finding employment, a new friend, Alex convinces them to invest in his get-rich-quick-scheme. The results are disastrous. Shadow of a Falling Woman is the story of how one family copes by resisting temptations, disappointment, loss, and death that will leave the readers awestruck. It is recommended to adult 18+, as it contains adult content and some sex sentences.",
