  "description": "The worst date in Vero’s life ends with the arrival of an injured man from another dimension who hands her a magic axe and tries to recruit her and her friends into a war she barely understands.  Which sounds like the exact opposite of how she wants to spend her senior year. Her cash-strapped family just moved to a rich town in California, and acclimating to her new surroundings was already tough enough.  Unfortunately, two soldiers from the other world know what she looks like and want her dead. In the small town of San Luis Obispo, it’s only a matter of time before they find her. She might have to fight, whether she wants to or not.",
