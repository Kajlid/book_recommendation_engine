  "title": "Practical Mysticism - A Little Book for Normal People",
  "description": "This is a book for the modern-day seeker, a 'How-To' book with a bare-bones description of the techniques that lead to spiritual illumination and poetic insight; a no-nonsense guide shorn of any form of dogma, tradition, sectarianism or appeals to authority. Evelyn Underhill writes with conviction and clarity, leading the reader through such seemingly weighty concepts as contemplation, perception, concentration and surrender of the Self, while leavening the whole with welcome notes of humour and irony. This is an easy book to read and understand, and while the application of its principles may prove harder to accomplish, diligent application of Evelyn Underhill's guidance and advice will unfailingly produce a multitude of blessings.",
