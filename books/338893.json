  "description": "A moving recollection of a magical small-town summer…In the backwaters of Illinois, Douglas Spaulding’s grandfather makes an intoxicating brew from harvested dandelions… In a distillation of all that is eternal about boyhood and summer, Spaulding wistfully ponders over magical tennis shoes, and machines for every purpose from time travel to happiness.Based on Bradbury’s own experiences growing up in Waukegan in the 1920s, Dandelion Wine is the author’s most deeply personal work, a heady mixture of fond memory, forgiveness, the imagination and above all, of summers that seemed to go on forever.",
