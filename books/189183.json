  "title": "In the Sphere of Silence",
  "description": "IN THE SPHERE OF SILENCE was initially conceptualized as a journal to promote and institutionalize the practice of the Sphere of Silence™; the single, most powerful tool a human being can use to succeed both in business and in life. Vijay Eswaran came up with the book to accompany the journal because without the book that expounds on the philosophy behind the Sphere of Silence™, many might practice it the way many churchgoers go to Sunday Mass, with nothing in their hearts but the force of obligation which later degenerates to boredom because they do not appreciate the deeper meaning and philosophy and more important the beauty behind the practice.",
