  "title": "Her Marriage Pact with the Billionaire",
  "description": "Ten years ago, on graduation night, best friends Quinton and Virginia made a marriage pact. Virginia left the country and Quinton threw himself into designing roller coasters for his family’s amusement park business; but he never forgot that night or the kiss that seared Virginia in his heart. No matter what corner of the world Virginia found, the memory of Quinton’s arms—safe, strong, homey—followed. When it’s time to return to the states, Quinn’s the beacon and the blanket that wraps her in warmth and courage. Once they meet again, at their ten-year reunion, it’s clear they’ve been changed by time, experience, and distance. However, nothing could erase the underlying attraction and deep friendship between them. As their feelings mature and build, they must decide if a marriage pact is enough or if they’re brave enough to reach for love.",
