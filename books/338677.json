  "description": "The first in a six-volume series, Volume 1: Threshold contains all of Zelazny's short works from his early years through the mid 1960s--a period of experimentation and growth that flowered into gems such as \"A Rose for Ecclesiastes,\" \"The Graveyard Heart,\" \"The Doors of His Face, the Lamps of His Mouth,\" and \"He Who Shapes.\" The stories in this series are enriched by editors' notes and Zelazny's own words, taken from his many essays, describing why he wrote the stories and what he thought about them in retrospect.",
