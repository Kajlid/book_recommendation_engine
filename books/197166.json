  "description": "Delta Stevens is a cop who sees her partner, Miles Brookman, brutally murdered while on patrol. In the ensuing days of his death, Delta discovers that Miles had been investigating a drug ring run from within their department. Not knowing who she can and cannot trust, she dives into her own investigation to uncover the assassins.Interwoven with the investigative action and Delta's turbulent emotions is a revealing, delicate relationship with Megan Osbourne, a prostitute, who holds a tiny piece of the puzzle Delta is trying to fit together. As the two women struggle to break preconceived notions and overcome the stigmas attached to their opposing professions, they soon forge a love that bridges their dichotomous worlds.Delta Stevens is at once strong and passionate, stormy and calm, impetuous and calculating, courageous and scared. She is a woman striving to find the precarious balance between what she does for a living and who she is; between doing what is right and doing what is best. It is not only Delta's ability to bring the perpetrators to justice that has us cheering, but also her courage to love someone forbidden to her by a society and justice system which understands neither profession.Editor: Brenda K.
