'He did? What a cheek! God he annoys me. I really hate him.' Lucy, TJ and Izzie exchanged knowing looks. 'Yeah sure,' said TJ. 'You hate him.' Lucy and Izzie started laughing like TJ had said something hysterically funny. My poor mates are clearly dementedâ€¦ Nesta's life is thrown into upheaval when she gets involved in charity work thinking that it might be a cool way to meet people (mainly boys.) But as her eyes are opened to the plight of the world, she begins to genuinely want to get involved and help others. On top of this, Nesta meets William, a boy who questions her motives. At times, she's convinced he hates her and the feeling is mutual. But Izzie, Lucy and TJ think it is something more like love . . .",
