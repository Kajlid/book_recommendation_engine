  "title": "7 Tipping Points That Saved the World",
  "description": "To what do we owe the great privilege of freedom? • To a handful of Greek soldiers and their naval commanders in a life-or-death confrontation with the Persians in 480 bc? • To a small band of Frankish soldiers who stood against the conquering armies of Islam more than 1,300 years ago?• To the people of Great Britain who refused to surrender to the overwhelming power of Hitler's Third Reich? Today, fewer than 12 of the 193 countries in the world have a democratic government that has survived for more than fifty years. So, what extraordinary events in history have made it possible for us to enjoy self-rule and personal liberty? And what role has the hand of God played in securing that freedom? In this remarkable new book, bestselling authors Chris Stewart and Ted Stewart highlight seven miracles that changed the course of the world. Skillfully weaving story vignettes with historical explanations, they affirm that history would have been dramatically altered if any one of these events had turned out differently.",
