  "description": "AtlasAugustineHarlowPainKultMy brother calls us his Dark Legionnaire. \"A got-damn gift sent by the hand of God to keep my streets free of reprobate riff-raff.\"But being one soldier with five minds qualified us as textbook insane. Whatever. Augustine says sanity is overrated. He's our resident saint. Keeps the walls of our souls shiny and clean. Me and Harlow keep our a$$es off death row by covering Kult and Pain's ruthless tracks.Life was simple as it could get until that night we caught a Butterfly while on a job. Augustine was the one who captured her. She'd seen too much so we took her to The Office to figure out what to do with her. Harlow said we should set her free out in no-man's land. Pain agreed, but voted we clip her wings first. I wanted to keep her just to listen to her cuss Augustine out with bible scriptures.And then Kult voted. “Keep her.\"I'll tell you three truths. One—I ain't never heard Kult speak. Two—pretty damn sure he meant keep her like a pet. And three—that was some death row shat right there.The heated question became, which of us should keep the Butterfly? Damn sure couldn't be Kult or Pain. Harlow didn’t want a thing to do with her even as he licked her up and down with his eyeballs. But when Augustine began mumbling prayers for the Lord's protection over the innocent, I knew we were all screwed.She was innocent alright. As much as she was off in the head. Probably how she managed her way under our deranged skin.I'd wait a week for them to have their fill of whatever she was dishing up. Then she had to get out of our web. Before she became the wrong kind of snack for our sick minds.",
