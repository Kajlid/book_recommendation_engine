  "description": "Soren’s treachery having triggered Bran’s campaign of revenge, it’s the end of a glory none can prevent. Whilst securing the Throne, rival factions threaten to tear the empire apart, before the mourning realm even has the chance to. A new hero emerges from the ashes of destruction though, a mysterious, courageous young boy named Raven, who claims to be an imperial heir. Raised and trained in exile, his knowledge, skills, confidence and power could salvage what still remains of the realm. However, although a formidable foil for Bran, there are those who doubt Raven’s identity. Old issues resurface, suspicions threaten the newly established peace and whilst attempting to strengthen the empire, by removing traitors, the Throne is deprived of one of its strongest guardians. And with the rest divided over Raven’s legitimacy, the Raven God makes his move, to damn the imperial family once and for all.",
