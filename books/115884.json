Draug give up easy.” “And if they don't?” “Every man has the right to make choices about his life,” she said, suddenly philosophical. “What choice? To be eaten alive, or eaten dead?” “That's one,” she allowed easily. Curled her lip into a crooked smile which twisted the scar on her cheek. “But I reckon you're about old enough to know how to say no to Draugs.” --- And then they heard the chains… Still reeling from her confrontation with the mysterious Gaket, Nysta must summon all her strength to continue her pursuit of the Bloody Nine. Accompanied by the enigmatic warlock, Chukshene, she quickly finds herself battling even more of the insane creatures which haunt the Deadlands. There are many chains in the Deadlands. But only one is strong enough to pull her toward that final bloody confrontation where she will face Raste in a final and violent duel at Grimwood Creek.",
