  "description": "Scuffletown is a book of poems by Chris Mattingly.\"How anyone could derive love and intelligence from a place like Scuffletown is a miracle. That one could take these gifts and turn them into such arresting poetry is an achievement. Chris Mattingly's poems spread like wildflowers in a dead backyard, and pretty soon the flowers reclaim and restore the whole damned place. We should all be glad this haunted, beautiful book is in the world.\" --Maurice Manning Scuffletown is a city of bricks, a grown-over ghost town on the Kentucky side of the Ohio River, named for men fighting outside its bars. The characters of Chris Mattingly's imagination have repopulated and re-settled it. For them, Scuffletown is where \"ain't is a hillbilly ohm,\" where the jump rope rhymes still sing about race relations, where Budweiser, Kessler's, and pills operate as currency and accelerant. Outlaws \"hush-talk phone-cops,\" families tailgate while watching Fish and Game shock the lake. Scuffletown's son asks \"What you would say to that man who pretends / Your father isn't the giant he is?\" and tells his mama with \"her eyes like broken jelly jars\" not to weep. With money crumpled in his fists, he's homeward-bound to buy one brick, \"not bread, not spinach, / not chicken-a brick.\" And, with the muscle only an inspired voice of the new South can flex, look at what he uses that brick to build.",
