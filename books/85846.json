  "description": "Previously published as Wedding Survivor\nWhen a wedding planner's first gig teams her up with a sexy stuntman, will she crash and burn - or be airlifted to love? Behind Eli McCain's Texas drawl lies an extreme sports lover, a former Hollywood stuntman - and a broken heart. Left at the altar a year ago, he's not happy when Thrillseekers Anonymous, the extreme sports club he co-founded, gets into the celebrity wedding business. Especially since Marnie Banks, the wedding coordinator with the stunning smile and sexy curves, never stops talking. Marnie, meanwhile, hopes planning an A-list celebrity wedding will be her ticket to success. If only her glamorous clients weren't constantly throwing outrageous demands at her. And if only Eli wasn't so guarded - and so jaw-droppingly handsome. But when the wedding turns from extreme to extremely disastrous, Eli and Marnie must work together against the elements, their bickering clients, and their own smoldering attraction to save the day. Will the sparks flying between them ignite into something real and passionate - or will they both end up burned?",
