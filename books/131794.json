  "description": "One Bear + One Diary = 17 Happy Children... Millicent Withers is the owner of a teddy bear shop filled with a variety of unusual bears. When her granddaughter, Emily, is in need of a special furry friend to help her through a rough time, Granny Withers orders a soft, cuddly bear named Suzie Snuffles to do just that. But when Emily opens her package, she finds a rather stiff and serious-looking bear named Stuffles B. Snippet instead. Slightly disappointed, Emily decides to keep Stuffles after she finds out that this bear- carrying a red diary and gold pen-has a very unique talent. She realizes her new friend can help her classmates and first-grade teacher, Miss Frey. The first graders soon discover they have a special friend in Stuffles B. Snippet, who is able to comfort the children with difficult problems.",
