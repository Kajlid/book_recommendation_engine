There Thomasina will spend a happy young girlhood with her cousins: the Heron heir Simon; kind solid Edward; young James; friendly Lucy; and Francis-- who is imaginative, daring, apt to be cynical, who talks about unicorns and usually gets into trouble. The cousins are faced with many challenges as they grow up, and conflict between King Charles I and Parliament leads to civil war.",
