  "description": "As the top detective in her small Alaskan town, Claire Darrow has seen her fair share of cases. But when a distraught widow comes to Claire with the suspicious details of her husband’s death, Claire is forced into new territory—virtual reality gaming territory.Following the trail set for her by billionaire playboy, Seth Channing (the owner of NuLife, an exclusive VR gaming company), Claire goes on the adventure of a lifetime into the Viking world of Valhalla.Caught in a web of secrets, lies, and skeletons from her own closet, Claire heads into a world she never knew existed. Braving treacherous quests and dangerous computer-generated characters is only half the battle as she sets out to collect the details of the case to decipher whether NuLife is behind not one, but three murders.The line between what's real and what's simulated starts to blur once Claire meets the Viking King, Thorsten, a man so real she has to remind herself he's nothing more than programmed code. And yet Thorsten's emotional compass is so vast, she can't deny her attraction to him. Pretty soon, Claire starts to wonder if she’s playing the game… or if she’s the one being played.",
