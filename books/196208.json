  "description": "The Alchemist of the East is an enchanting saga of gaining wisdom, following one’s heart and, above all, chasing one’s dreams.  This is a story of Sushyo, a toy maker from Mesopotamia who wishes to travel all over the world and spread the message of peace and joyousness. From his home in the city of Nineveh, on the banks of river Tigris, he voyages to the land of seven rivers, Melhua. What unfolds is an adventure of epic proportion with his destiny throwing at him, one challenge after another, probing him in the most frightful manner. An apocalyptic encounter with the Alchemist of the East prepares him for the road ahead. As events occur rapidly, the boy finds himself a part of a legacy for which he will have to face up to the ruler of Arianna, Queen Kassandrra, in an epic battle on the banks of river Helmand.   The author pledges his share of the earnings from this book to the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund, as a part of his effort towards the rehabilitation work in the Kedarnath region of the Indian state of Uttarakhand. The author was a witness to the catastrophe that occurred in the Kedar Valley on 15/16/17 of June, 2013 and did his best to assuage the sufferings of the victims of this horrendous tragedy.",
