  "description": "They welcome her with open arms and hearts, without knowing who she really is - but, does she know who they are?People have an innate desire to belong or fit in, morphing themselves into groups. More than appearance. Demeanors, mannerisms, attitudes, and language patterns are all subconsciously manipulated by the company they keep.Katherine made all those choices consciously. Contact lenses, makeup, hair coloring, and style were only the beginning. When she created the persona for this project, she expected a challenge. Tight groups usually are. It didn’t take her long to become a vital part of the group, maybe that should have been the first clue that everything was not as it seemed.Reviews\"Identity is a tightly written mystery, thriller that keeps you guessing until the end.\"\"Can’t put it down, page turner! From the very beginning you’re hooked.\"\"This was the perfect summer hammock read.\"\"This book kept me guessing till the end.\"\"Identity will drag you in in the first few pages and not let you go.\"\"The book builds slow just as a mystery should. \"",
