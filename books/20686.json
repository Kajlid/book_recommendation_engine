  "description": "I’m not quite the person I was at 5.11pm yesterday afternoon. In fact, I may not be a person at all…When Cassina is blown up in a bomb attack, life as she knows it is over. Except that she doesn’t die. Cassina becomes a para-spirit – a presence that can live in other people’s minds. Nobody knows she’s there, but she can see their thoughts and fell their emotions. She just can’t do a thing to change them.Being in the minds of her grieving parents is not good. Being in mad Aunt Lou’s brain is an eye-opener. But Akim’s head – that’s a dangerous place. Because Cassina knows he’s going to do something terrible, worse even than before. And it’s up to her to stop him – but how?",
