  "description": "In this tale of Summer adventure, four friends embark on an annual backpacking escape into a remote section of the Canadian Rockies. Stumbling upon a canyon not marked on any known map, these women are faced with the decision between safety and adventure. A chance meeting with an academic research team studying a local offshoot of Indigenous People adds mystery when they learn what the tribe’s mythology holds toward the canyon. When a medicine man and his unsettling apprentice enter, the camp takes on a threatening tone. While an authentic wilderness experience is high on their list, finding it might perhaps be more than they’ve bargained for. The decision is no longer when, but how to leave. For all of them the promise of passage might be foregone in what could end up being a decision that was never theirs to make.",
