  "description": "When Phoebe Barati sees the apparition of her dead cousin dangling from a rope in her aunt’s Victorian home, she’s certain it’s just her imagination. No way she suddenly developed some freaky ability to connect with the dead. But then it happens again, and this time it isn’t just a vision. It’s like she’s reliving the excruciating murder through Evie herself. The cops are calling it a suicide, but Phoebe’s aunt is convinced the culprit is Jamie Pennington, Evie’s devil-may-care (and boyishly handsome) ex-boyfriend.There’s something about Jamie that makes Phoebe want to trust him–even when the whole town is against him. But she’d have to be crazy to fall for her cousin’s possibly-murderous ex.Going by the threatening, seriously creepy notes she’s been getting, someone is watching her. Someone who’ll do anything to stop her from digging up the truth. Someone who knows her secrets–secrets that could rip her meticulously buried trauma right up to the surface. To track down the killer and find peace for Evie, Phoebe has no choice but to step out of the shadows and kick the (only semi-figurative) skeletons out of her closet–before the next body to turn up is hers.",
