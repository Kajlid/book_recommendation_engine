All to find a Tracker who happens to be on the run from a demon, yet she is my only hope in bringing my father home.  Nothing is as it seems and I'm uncertain who is friend or foe. My impending punishment threatens to suffocate me as I defy our laws and fight to bring peace to my home. . . and fight to keep those I love the dearest alive. How will I get both my father and I out of this one unscathed? Welcome to being The Chosen One.",
