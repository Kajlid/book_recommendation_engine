  "description": "Rare book dealer Alina Corey decided to live like the heroine of her favorite Renaissance book, presiding over a court of glittering literati, a witty distance from love. It worked - until Jared Troy, a combative history scholar she knew only through his letters, suddenly appeared in the flesh, challenging her to a passion as grand as her dreams. Jared's powers of persuasion were formidable - and his talents were incredible. With words of passion and touches of fire, he slowly seduced her - mind, body, and soul.",
