  "description": "In his Second Term the President is fulfilling his campaign promise to fundamentally change America. As a result of the Supreme Court upholding the McAlister Hate Speech and Hate Weapons Elimination Act, over half of America's guns are turned over to the government. Though it is a felony to own a gun, over seventy million firearms are retained by Americans. A confidential memo goes viral on the internet revealing that the White House, mainstream media, the entertainment industry and many in Congress are in fact Marxists, actively changing their country from capitalism to Communism. Americans nervously watch the President to see what will happen next. Car bombs explode near federal buildings across the U.S. The President accuses religious and Tea Party zealots of trying to overthrow the government. A U.S. Senator learns from his brother, a CIA official, that the bombings were a 'false flag', concocted by the DHS as an excuse to arrest, imprison and re-educate conservatives, veterans and Christians. Pastors are arrested. Blood is shed. Patriots and veterans from across the country secretly organize are an armed attack on the White House to remove the President from office. At the same time, Russia and Iran move military equipment and troops to the northern border of Israel and covertly install nuclear devices in U.S. cities. Will the President honor America's treaty obligation to defend Israel from attack? Are these events tomorrow's headlines? Will ancient prophecies of the fall of a rich, powerful and influential end times nation come to pass? WE'VE BEEN WARNED!",
