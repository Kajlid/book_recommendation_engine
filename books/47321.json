  "description": "For Tobin and Delia, everything was always equal. A bargain, a trade, a deal to be struck. A kiss for a kiss. Your shirt for mine. Break my heart, I’ll break yours. Their disastrous split was no different. Tobin’s spent the last year pretending Delia never existed, and Delia’s been in D.C., pretending to be anything but the country girl that she is. When tragedy brings her back to town, Tobin and Delia realize that time apart hasn't healed either one of them. But staying away from each other is harder than they imagined, especially in small town Louisiana, and old feelings are quickly brought back to the surface. In the mess they’ve created, is there anything to be salvaged of a love that they both thought would be forever?",
