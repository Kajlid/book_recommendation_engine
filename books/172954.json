One night on an annual cruise with her family, Lissie is standing on the deck of her father’s fishing boat when she begins to hear a strange murmur across the surface of the ocean. The voice rises and falls with her own, dancing in and out of her hearing, but before she can get a glimpse of the creature it disappears into the depths of the ocean with a shimmery flash.  The next evening throws her family in the midst of a horrific storm. Lissie is swept overboard and all hope is lost until she comes face to face with a dark-haired merman. She is saved, but the cost is her future. The merman transforms her into a mermaid, with the ability to both sprout fins and walk on land; she now finds herself a captive of the dark merman and flees into the night.  When Lissie ends up on a stranded island and meets its sole inhabitant, the handsome and mysterious Patrick, she begins to realize that meeting the dark merman was not a mere twist of fate.  But if it was destined, why is Patrick’s past entangled with her future?  And just what does Patrick have to do with the dark merman who haunts her nightmares…",
