  "description": "Film producer Robyn Hawthorne can hardly believe her luck: a handsome Englishman, here in Sydney on a lectureship - and he is a talented wordsmith too! Just what she needs to help her script the life of the Australian 'Lost Impressionist' painter, John Peter Russell. Robyn and Malcolm Reid go on a hunt for Russell's past, and thirty-eight of his pictures, which have mysteriously gone missing. They become deeply involved with each other, with their quest - and with danger. Why did Jamie, an artist/curator friend, have to die so young? And he is not the only one to suffer... Look for bright lights, shady deals and creative passions in this fascinating detective story, set in a vibrant modern Sydney, but shot through with echoes of the past. Murder, greed and the plight of the screenwriter in shark-infested waters are expertly portrayed in a thriller with a fiery twist in the tale.",
