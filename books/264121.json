There are over 100 recipes for casseroles, soups, stews, pies and hot puddings, along with ideas for rustic salads, quick suppers and indulgent dinner party desserts.Along with the favourite dishes cooked in the National Trust cafes, there are recipes that have been found in National Trust archives, or link to the history of the places. In the Lake District, Lamb and Hawkshead Red stew celebrates two great local ingredients in one taste of home - Herdwick lamb and award-winning Hawkshead Red beer. During his time as Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon of Kedleston Hall might have encountered a chickpea and coconut curry typical of the southern region, a comforting meat-free alternative for veggies and vegans. Or indulge with the chestnut, rum and chocolate pavlova cake, inspired by the ancient chestnuts planted at Sizergh.Whatever the season, National Trust Comfort Food presents a wealth of regional and international dishes, each one devoted to our love for homely, comforting cooking. From colourful summer favourites such as goat's cheese gnocchi or panzanella made with ripe, summer tomatoes, or a picnic pie served with a tangy chutney, to winter warmers like venison stew or chicken and mustard casserole, these dishes are simple and irresistible.",
