  "title": "Little Owl's Book of Thinking: An Introduction to Thinking Skills",
  "description": "“How do you do it, Dad?” asked Benny, the owlet. (For those of you who don’t know, an owlet is a little owl, like a piglet is a little pig, and outlet is a little out but not all the way.) “Do what?” asked Big Owl, Benny the Owlet’s Dad, who being grown up didn’t need letters after his name. “Be so wise and all knowing?” “Well,” replied the wise, middle-aged owl, “I think it’s an owl thing. To be honest I am not really sure how I got to be omniscient.” “Will I be wise like you when I’m all grown up?” asked Benny, who was too small to appreciate semantic irony. “Well,” said Big Owl, “that depends, on how you think.” “Think about what?” asked Benny. “No. Just think,” came the reply. This brilliant little book is full of word play and continues in entertaining style to describe the seven lessons Benny receives from his wise old father who is eager to teach his son how to think and think well. Ideal for teachers, parents, and older children, this book is an excellent way to introduce the concept of thinking skills. Grades 5–12.",
