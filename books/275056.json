  "description": "An Angel named Conlan has one simple earthly assignment: grant one person one wish. It proves to be more complicated than he could ever have guessed.  The town of Whompaton has a serious graffiti problem, the implications of which might just make it a nicer place to live.  A struggling old woman and her ailing cat get a helping hand from beyond the grave, and it’s clear the dead don’t follow rules.  After a financial setback a man devises a plan to rob banks and never get caught. But did he think of everything?  Retirement should be a time for relaxation. Someone should tell that to Ernest Feldman. Just don’t tell him it’s Tuesday.  With the internet, info is at our finger tips. For one man, making up his own facts could prove dangerous to his health.  A man thinks he’s discovered a way to reunite with his dead wife and the beautiful life they shared. His plan is so absurd it just might work.  You will find these stories and more inside…   This is Book One of my Short Story Collection series. I hope you enjoy every story presented here.",
