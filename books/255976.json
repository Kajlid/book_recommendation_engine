  "description": "Tangles of death, danger, and monsters. Rapunzel and her sexy shifters must escape a witch’s vengeance.  At the age of eight, Elliana lost her father, her future, and her freedom in exchange for eternal captivity. Not to mention unimaginably long hair.  Trapped in a tower by a magical gargoyle, Elliana chances a few daring and ill-fated escapes in search of a powerful, hidden weapon, which could free her and kill the stone creature once and for all. But to do that, she must summon a sly dragon shifter, a ferocious lion shifter with way too much baggage, and a devious tiger shifter. But the witch who hexed her is returning to finish Elliana. Can she save herself and the heroic three shifters she’s slowly losing her heart to before they all die?  Dragons, lions, magical hair and love merge in this heart-wrenching tale that finds its own, unique, 'Happily Ever After.'  Note: Each book in the Haven Realm series is a standalone book.",
