  "title": "Infernal Providence: Heir of Destruction",
  "description": "The inevitable has arrived. Civilizations across the globe have begun to collapse under the insurmountable pressure exerted by the invasions from Hell, and there is no going back. All attempts to staunch the hemorrhaging of mortal lives have produced anemic results at best. As populations and resources are depleted in a steady downward spiral, the skeletal remains of governments worldwide close their borders and abandon international aid treaties in favor of riding out the storm alone in their own dark corners. While humanity trembles and death tolls soar, the gods and their supernatural allies continue fighting to stymie the ever-advancing Infernal hordes. Each divinity has staked their claim in certain locations to foster relations with the survivors there, be it a modest abbey or multinational empire. Dorian, the Ascended One, and his Alabaster Order have fought without pause for months to tip the delicate balance of peace and chaos ever so slightly in their favor, but it is Dorian’s champion, Nathaniel, who has made the greatest impact on both sides. Known throughout the world as a bringer of hope to the innocent and a foe to demons rivaling the gods themselves, Nathaniel has thrived under his master’s tutelage. But as the already frenetic pace of demonic invasions accelerates further, no amount of hope or divine might will prepare Earth’s forces for what is about to blow the doors off on its way to total domination.",
