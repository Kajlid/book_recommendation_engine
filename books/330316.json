  "description": "Lance Fitzgerald has been in love with his best friend Christopher Pritchard for ten years, since their college days. Hiding the fact that he's bisexual wasn't easy during college, yet Lance did it because he didn't want to lose Chris' friendship. But when the two spend three days alone together on a fishing trip, Lance can't hide his feelings any longer. Chris is sure his live-in girlfriend Joni is his happily-ever-after and he never planned to cheat on her. Yet he can't deny the attraction he feels for Lance. He can either accept his feelings for Lance or push him away and lose the best friend he's ever had. But he doesn't want to lose Joni either. If only there were a way he didn't have to choose.",
