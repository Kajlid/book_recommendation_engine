  "title": "The Boy in the Song: The True Stories Behind 50 Rock Classics",
  "description": "How well do you really know your rock history? The Boy in the Song focuses on the boyfriends, husbands, bandmates, exes, heroes, celebrities, fathers, sons, and even complete strangers who inspired 50 of rock’s greatest songs. Readers will learn that a surprising number of performers have revealed their band’s inner struggles through their music. Stevie Nicks’s “Silver Spring,” about her breakup with bandmate Lindsey Buckingham, was left off Rumours , which contributed to her decision to leave Fleetwood Mac. Bruce Springsteen’s “Bobby Jean” was written as a farewell to Steve Van Zandt, who was leaving the E Street Band, and Boy George asked drummer Jon Moss “Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?” in a classic case of requited love.             Authors Michael Heatley and Frank Hopkinson explain how each boy or man inspired the song written about him, when the song was released, and the impact it had on the charts, the performer, and the subject himself. Music buffs will also appreciate information on the performers as well as trivia from recording history. It’s the perfect book for anyone who’s ever wondered, “Who was that song about?”",
