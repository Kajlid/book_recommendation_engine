  "description": "Strandline is a serial and possibly a novel about the new teleporting subspecies Homo sapiens nictans. Why am I not sure if it’s a novel? Because I’m writing this sucker by the seat of my pants and looking to readers for direction. It may end up as a novella or three, or a series of short stories. New episodes are added every week on Smashwords and the Strandline website (www.strandlineseries.com).",
