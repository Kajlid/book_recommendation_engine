  "description": "Facets of Fantasy: Three fantasy stories that take you to amazing worlds. Three mysterious royal families in need of investigation.  Halogen Crossing Karl Kallai is much more interested in searching for his people’s legendary artifact, the Golden Belt of the Kings, than in attending a dull political convention with his brother. But when Brynea, a young woman whose boyfriend seems caught in a palace plot, asks Karl for help, he finds there’s a secret hidden in the castle and adventure could be much closer than he believed.The Amulet of Renari Violet Vail, an introspective loner, has grown up in her family’s vast, ancient country home, Vailsgabel. But when they’re forced to run away, Violet and her sarcastic cousin are thrown on the help of the last people they’d like to see—their ancestral enemies, elf-like spirits who can take the form of wolves. The Yurukozoi haven’t forgotten their old feud with the Vails or the amulet that started it.Millhaven Castle Most girls would think an invite to a royal ball was a dream come true. But Alyce Lomlossa belongs to a minority group that’s never noticed by the monarchy and an invitation from the king makes her suspicious. Arrayed in some else’s ridiculous dress and required to go to a dance where she can’t possibly fit in, it isn’t long before Alyce learns this will indeed be an extraordinary evening.",
