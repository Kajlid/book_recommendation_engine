  "description": "In Margaret Atwood's stunning new collection of stories, her first since her #1 nationally bestselling 2006 collection, Moral Disorder, she returns to the here and now in this brilliant, new collection of stories.      In these nine dazzlingly inventive and rewarding stories, Margaret Atwood's signature dark humour, playfulness, and deadly seriousness are in abundance. In \"Freeze-Dried Bridegroom,\" a man who bids on a storage locker has a surprise. In \"Lusus Naturae,\" a woman with a genetic abnormality is mistaken for a vampire. In \"I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth,\" we remeet Tony, Charis, and Roz from The Robber Bride, but, years later, as their nemesis is seen in an unexpected form. In \"Torching the Dusties,\" an elderly lady with Charles Bonnet's syndrome comes to terms with the little people she keeps seeing, while a newly formed populist group gathers to burn down her retirement residence. In \"Stone Mattress,\" a long-ago crime is revenged in the Arctic. This is classic Margaret Atwood, and she is at the very top of her form.",
