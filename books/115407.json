  "description": "2 Brothers + 2 Sisters + 0 Electricity = 1 Unforgettable HolidayCasey's got a ton of work to do over the holidays. But her sister’s stuck with a broken heart and a nonrefundable vacation for two, so Casey agrees to celebrate Christmas at a rustic Adirondack lodge—as long as she can bring her laptop and work through the festivities.Matt’s happy to take a break from his high-pressure city job to celebrate Christmas at his off-the-grid childhood home. He and his brother are helping with their aunt's Romance of Christmas weekend, even though the couples-only guest list means all work and no play. When one of the “couples” unexpectedly turns out to be two sisters, Matt’s brother calls dibs on the hot one—leaving Matt to deal with a quirky, work-obsessed woman who he's sure would rather get cozy with an electrical outlet than with him. Good thing there’s no electricity at Dutch Gorge Lodge. Because sometimes you have to turn out the lights to see what’s right in front of you.",
