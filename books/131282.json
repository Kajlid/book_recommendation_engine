  "description": "Helen is juggling more than most twenty-somethings: single parenthood of the son her ex-husband has all but abandoned, her job as assistant to an office manager who views her rear end as a firm asset in more ways than one, and a health crisis she's struggling to overcome. When high school love Aidan travels cross-country for a visit, is it a second chance at happily-ever after? Or will Helen find herself picking up the pieces of her broken heart once again, while an unlikely hero waits in the wings?",
