  "description": "Am I the best, most knowledgeable Rick Springfield fan out there? I’ll be No. Not really. I do not know all the gritty details of his life the way that some fans do. But what I lack in messy specifics, I like to think that I make up for with enthusiasm. Look, should I win the lottery, I’d probably follow him around on tour and plaster my house with expensive memorabilia. And obviously my ass would be on that Rick Springfield Cruise every November. But until then, the advantage of being a writer is that I have a decent imagination, and my fantasy Rick life placates my need for, you know, actual encounters with the cherished one. I’m pretty content to worship him from afar. So here is a collection of blogs that I’ve done (now expanded), most of which have a focus on the most charming rock god of all, Rick Springfield. The few that are not entirely Rick-centered are still funny, but less insane.",
