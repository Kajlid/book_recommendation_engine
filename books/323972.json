He's playing games with me, but I don't mind a challenge.Only problem is, I'm supposed to pledge myself to a rival vampire family and now all I can think about is Bran Duval, black sheep of the Duval vampire family, and the wicked things he's promising to do to me in the dark.Note: Hot Vampire Next Door is first and foremost a Kindle Vella serial.
