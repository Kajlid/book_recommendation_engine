  "description": "Ryan's former girlfriend, Cheyenne, is used to getting what she wants. Right now, she wants Jansen Branwyth. The only problem is so does Ryan. For the first time in his life, he's strongly attracted to a man. Okay, maybe it's not the first time but that first time didn't count because it was two months ago and it was the same man. Except with the very beautiful Cheyenne going after Jansen and thinking she'll have no problem getting him, Ryan is sure he has absolutely no chance. Jansen, however, doesn't care one bit what either one of them think. He knows exactly who he wants and knows precisely how he will go about getting his man.",
