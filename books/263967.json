  "description": "Doors were never locked, in Tolerance, Arkansas in the 1950’s. Everyone went to church on Sunday and the corner grocer extended credit, never asking for a credit card. Things were good —the age of innocence in America that laid the foundation for the sexual and Cultural Revolution that was to explode onto the scene in the sixties. But for Sarah Jones, a glimpse into the shadows snatched away her childhood innocence. Her way of dealing with the despicable acts committed against her threatened to destroy who she truly was. Can she find the inner strength to overcome her past? Can she see that letting go of the desire to punish oneself is often the hardest act of forgiveness?Content Advisory: This book is intended for mature audiences and contains child sexual abuse and disturbing imagery.",
