  "description": "This is not a love story. I was just looking to keep my head down and complete my education, so that I could move as far away from my hometown, and all its tainted memories, as possible. I never bargained on running into my past. But then again, I never asked to be kidnapped, drugged and branded as The Doe either. I certainly never asked to be part of The Hunting Grounds, a sick and twisted ‘survival of fittest’ game which would make me the grand prize. There can only be one explanation for this: The Holy Trinity. The Father.The Son. The Spirit. Once upon a time they were my entire world, but now they each claim a different hold on me: tormentor, persecutor, possessor.They may think that they have it all planned out, but they forget one little thing… Odile Kemp isn’t anybody’s prey. The Hunting Grounds are my goddamn playground. And I like to torment my toys before I play with them. ***The Hunting Grounds is a dark reverse harem story with triggering events, bullying and backstories. Please take this warning seriously.",
