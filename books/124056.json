  "description": "The Eisner Award-winning series, finally collected in one volume, presents one of the grandest stories of Western civilization, now one of the most explosive epics in the history of comics. Giants plot against gods, who in turn tear human lovers apart, while the lives of great warriors are ruined, and murder after murder is committed in the name of love and gold. It's the epic as it was meant to be read.This new high point in Russell's distinguished twenty-five year career as a true artist's artist includes behind-the-scenes production art, notes on the adaptation by the artist, and high res scans of the original art.Â \"P. Craig Russell's beautiful telling of The Ring Cycle manages both to be the most faithful and inspiring reworking of the opera into comics form, and the ultimate high-fantasy saga.\"-Neil Gaiman",
