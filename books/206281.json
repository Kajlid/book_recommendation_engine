  "description": "The Hellfire Riders' enforcer, Stone Wall, has just three weaknesses.  Dogs. Little kids. Damsels in distress.  But this time, the damsel isn't in distress. She's bait, luring him in with haunted eyes and a sad smile. And Stone should have known better, but he couldn't resist those soft, sweet lips. One kiss put him in a cage, fighting for his life. Fighting not to let winning rip his soul apart...and losing that fight.  So he played the hero. That's over with. The moment he's free, that damsel in distress is going to give him his pound of flesh. Kiss by kiss. Lick by lick.  It's payback time.",
