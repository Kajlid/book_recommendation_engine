  "description": "Author D. Scott Roberts crafts stories that blur the lines between reality and possibility. In RepositioneD, the first book in the Altered Science Paradox readers are pushed to reimagine their safe and familiar world with one that is twisted, unpredictable, and often menacing. This series filled with suspense, action, intrigue, and even a hint of romance, explores the questions that unsettle us the What if the world we know isn't what it seems? What if the boundaries of reality are more fluid than we dare imagine?With storylines that will keep you engaged; characters that you authentically care about, and unexpected plot twists and turns that will keep you guessing to the last page and leave you thinking even days later, RepositioneD is the perfect combination for anyone who loves incredible storytelling, intrigue, and more than enough Science Fiction to fill their appetite.Having traded a career in the boardroom for the writer's desk, Scott now dedicates himself to his lifelong weaving tales that ask, what if the ‘things that go bump in the night’ are so much closer and more real than we ever thought possible. When he's not writing mind-bending stories, you'll find him exploring the world with his wife, Becky — his partner in crime and greatest inspiration — or indulging in his other great traveling, and creating and sharing (and eating) delicious food. Scott and Becky call South Carolina home.",
