  "description": "Beast saw Beauty. And the hunt was on.  A beast has just kicked down my front door. He’s massive, scarred, just out of prison, and refuses to budge. Unless I go with him.  He’s made it clear what he wants—my untouched body beneath his giant, damaged one. If I run, he’ll hunt me down and take it.  But when he slips and shows me his desperation… I’m no longer sure whether I want to run to him or away from him.",
