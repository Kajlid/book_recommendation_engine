  "title": "The Gospel of Lazarus",
  "description": "The story of Jesus and the Beloved Disciple is a beautiful and intriguing love story, well worth being treated as serious literature and appearing between covers of its own. For this version of the story, editor Tobias Skinner has chosen to believe, for reasons set forth in the preface, that it was Lazarus who first wrote this version of the gospel. Who would be more inclined to write of Jesus as God in the flesh, as the incarnation of Logos, as infallible, as a worker of miracles-something the author of this gospel does far more often than the authors of the other three-than a man who believes Jesus saved him from death and who is so comfortable in his love relationship with Jesus that he can confidently and repeatedly refer to himself as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved,\" and at the end as \"the disciple whom Jesus sincerely loved\"? Skinner here presents a readable alternative text for this ancient story of love.",
