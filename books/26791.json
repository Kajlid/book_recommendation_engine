  "title": "The Lords and the New Creatures",
  "description": "Originally self-published as two separate volumes in 1969 (The Lords/Notes on Vision, which Morrison described as \"a thesis on film aesthetics,\" and The New Creatures, a surreal portrait of modern existence), the late singer's first published volume of poetry gives a revealing glimpse of an era and the man whose songs and savage performances have left an indelible impression on our culture. This collection, born out of the tumultuous social and political landscape of the late sixties, is as intense, sensual, and compelling as Jim Morrison's persona was during the Doors' peak. His fast life and mysterious death remain controversial more than forty years later.",
