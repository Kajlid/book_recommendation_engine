  "description": "VIGILANTES OF LOVE, John Everson's second book-length collection of short horror and dark fantasy fiction, was originally issued in 2003 by Chicago-based Twilight Tales, the year before a limited edition of his first Bram Stoker Award-winning novel, COVENANT, was released by Delirium Books.VIGILANTES OF LOVE focuses more on dark fantasy than the more extreme erotic horror of his first short fiction collection, CAGE OF BONES & OTHER DEADLY OBSESSIONS. It includes 15 dark fantasy and horror tales, including the voodoo-zombie oriented title story, written especially for the collection, \"Calling of the Moon,\" which received an Honorable Mention in the Year's Best Fantasy & Horror anthology, and \"Lovesong\" a 5th Place winner in the 2000 World Horror Convention Fiction Contest. It also includes two light fantasy Christmas tales (\"Frost\" and \"Christmas The Hard Way\") and tales reprinted from the anthologies TRANSVERSIONS and FREAKS, GEEKS & SIDESHOW FLOOZIES, and the magazines SIRIUS VISIONS, CROSSROADS, EULOGY and PLOT.",
