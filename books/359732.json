  "title": "Tomcat Jones",
  "description": "Sex, love, and romance are magical experiences--maybe a little too much so for a wizard unaware and his shape-shifting tomcat familiar. T.J. Jones never believed in love. He's a tomcat--literally--and he's had problems in the past with one-night stands involving men who are horrified to find out what he is. He's been burned one too many times, so he decides he'll settle for becoming a grouchy, lifelong bastard of a bachelor. Of course, that's before he runs into MacGowan, a smoking hot beach boy with the sweetest smile. MacGowan, a ingenuous, open-hearted sex bomb, wants T.J.'s body, his love, his friendship, and his trust. T.J. doesn't dare tell MacGowan that he's a tomcat on the inside, but soon finds he has no choice when MacGowan's developing wizard's powers force the issue. Not only is he unwittingly MacGowan's familiar, but MacGowan's powers make him unable to control his shape-shifting.
