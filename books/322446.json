  "description": "My name is Colton Westbrook, and life just threw me into a dumpster fire. I like to have fun. I like to go out, but when one wrong decision puts me in the spotlight with a less than favorable glare, my family puts me on lockdown.Vermont has become a second home to me, but every time I’m here, I find myself searching for that girl around every corner. One little kiss that happened three years ago in a deserted airport terminal. One little kiss that branded me, scared me, could even ruin me if I were that guy looking for a happily ever after.But that’s not me. I’m not hiding out in my brother’s home secretly searching for the one that got away. I’m not wearing stupid disguises to fool the paparazzi, hoping she’ll turn up. And I’m definitely not that guy relying on a crazy old lady and her tarot cards to find a girl. Nope. Not me.I’ll stay a lost boy in Neverland…until the day I realize some people are worth growing up for.",
