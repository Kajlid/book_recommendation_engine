  "description": "Overprotective dryad Ashton Ward is pissed off. His mate Selena has been tortured by humans who hunt supernaturals, and she's flat-out refusing to let him near her as she heals. Her magic is so compromised that just being near her puts him in danger, but he's sure he can help ease her pain if she'll just let him.To keep Ash safe, witch doctor Selena Giannone wants to handle the fallout from her nightmare alone. But she might be dealing with more than the agonizing loss of her powers—something's haunting her house so badly the land itself is afraid. A demon so powerful nothing in Maggie's grove can tame it alone.Terrified, exhausted and out of options, Selena turns to Ash for help. The enemy needs two things to Selena's powers, yes, but also it needs her fear. And if there's a magic that can save her, it lies with Ash—with his touch, and with their bond.84,000 words",
