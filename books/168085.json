  "description": "A steamy, suspenseful romance from NY Times bestselling author Jessie Evans. How far will they go for a second chance... Years ago, Layla Parker’s romantic dreams came true. She married her high school sweetheart and settled into a house on his family’s ranch to live happily ever after. But sometimes dreams turn into nightmares and when Layla’s husband became abusive, she felt there was no way out. Her big brother was serving overseas, her friends were away at college, and her single father insisted she’d made her bed and now she had to lie in it. It isn’t until her father’s death over a decade later that Layla gains the courage to leave her marriage. She hopes to find peace living alone, but her dreams of happily ever after died a long time ago. Cole Lawson has spent years secretly pining for his former best friend. Layla Parker captured his heart sophomore year of high school, but she was already taken. When she married her boyfriend two years later, she and Cole grew apart and have rarely seen each other since. Cole’s been a lady killer since the day he realized that his dimpled smile made all the cowgirls swoon, but when he discovers Layla is newly single he’s ready to put an end to his womanizing ways and make a serious play for the one who got away. When tragedy strikes the Lawson family, Cole and Layla’s rekindled friendship grows into something more, but soon a dark secret from Layla’s past threatens to destroy their shot at forever. Now Cole will have to decide—listen to his heart or to the people warning him that Layla might not be as innocent as she seems.",
