  "title": "Not In Your Lifetime: The Assassination of JFK",
  "description": "It might not be in your lifetime', said the Chief Justice of the United States when asked whether the files on the assassination of President Kennedy would be made public. If the President was killed by a lone gunman, as the first official enquiry claimed, why can we still not see all relevant records? Fifty years on and the murder of the century remains unsolved. Drawing on thirty years of investigation, Anthony Summers examines the case in compelling, forensic detail. He analyses the evidence for Oswald's guilt, the Mafia connection, and the links to Cuba and reveals, for the first time, a plausible admission of involvement. This updated edition of Not in Your Lifetime is the most definitive account of one of the most intractable mystery mysteries of our time.",
