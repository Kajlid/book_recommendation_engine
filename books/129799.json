  "description": "On the bottom in life. That’s how Craig Elson feels. Even though he’s one of the best strategic planners around, a more confident guy claims credit for his work. He’s good looking, but the slimiest user at the bar calls Craig a loser. Taking care of his mom who has Alzheimer’s drains his finances and leaves him in a dull, gray car -- and a dull, gray life. Then Craig meets Jessie Randall with his T-shirt that proclaims “I Would Bottom You So Hard”. The message seeps into Craig’s soul. Craig asks the gorgeous young graduate student and tutor to teach him how to top. Jessie’s been admiring the shy, handsome guy who comes to the coffee shop, so he says yes and sets out to help Craig get a new job, a new apartment, and a new lease on life. But Craig loves the lessons--and the teacher -- so much, he doesn’t want to graduate. Can Craig learn to be on top without losing his sassy bottom?",
