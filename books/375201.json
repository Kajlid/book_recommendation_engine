  "description": "A gay wedding gone bad. A missing groom. An unsullied reputation at risk. Enter Russell Quant - cute, gay, and a rookie private detective. With a nose for good wine and bad lies, Quant is off to France on his first big case. From the smudgy streets of Paris, he sips and sleuths his way to the pastel-colored promenade of Sanary-sur-Mer. Back in Saskatoon, Quant comes face to face with a client who may be the bad guy, a quarry who turns up in the most unexpected place, and a cast of colorful the vile sister, the best friend, the colleague, the ex-lover, the lawyer, the priest, the snoopy neighbor-are they involved? Or is someone else lurking in the shadows? As he works through his case, Quant juggles his detective gig with the responsibilities of a personal life full of captivating personalities. Taking a cue from the style and humor of Robert B. Parker, and evoking Armistead Maupin with his wit and warmth, Anthony Bidulka's Amuse Bouche is a rich, saucy, and engaging read.",
