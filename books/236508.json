  "description": "Nick Beasley used to be a private detective who didn’t believe in magic and monsters. He’s revised his views since then—after all, the horns and fur he sees every time he looks in the mirror don’t leave him with much choice. Joined by eccentric enchantress Lady Cordelia Beaumont, as well as his younger brother Crispin, Nick has traveled far from his home city of Talesend in a quest to become human again.The Warrengate Academy of Advanced Magic may hold the key to unraveling Nick’s curse—a powerful spell connected to the tale of The Little Mermaid. Unfortunately, the school’s headmaster is a dangerously grumpy dragon with ties to the sinister Council of Scions, so Nick and his friends will have to tread carefully. They soon find that dragons are the least of their problems on Warrengate Island. An ancient evil is rising from the deep, bringing an army of the undead along with it. Shocking revelations send Nick, Cordelia, and Crispin on a harrowing journey under the sea.The Sea Witch is not quite as dead as everyone believes...and her secrets will change everything.",
