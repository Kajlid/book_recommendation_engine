  "description": "Attorney Charles D. Jamieson, Esquire explores the emotionally charged yet poorly understood topic of Parental Alienation, providing a thorough discussion that touches on the history of Parental Alienation and scholarly debates over the relevant science as well a compelling guide for how to deal with your life and family relationships when your ex badmouths you to your child.  The book begins with an overview of key concepts and ideas, drawing from the scholarship of Dr. Richard Gardner, Dr. Michael Bone, Dr. Robert Evans, Dr. Douglas Darnell, and Dr. Richard Warshak.  The next section raises and answers challenging but common questions that targeted parents often have about their rights, responsibilities and options.  The third section explores how to find and leverage help to restablish your relationship with your child and how to put the pieces of your life back together after your tough experience.  Although the book does not offer legal advice, it does something arguably just as important: it lays the groundwork for understanding and grapplying with a complex, unfortunate and confusing topic and provides much needed reassurance and clear explanations about Parental Alienation.",
