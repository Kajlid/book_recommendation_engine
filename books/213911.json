  "title": "Indestructible: Growing Up Queer, Cuban, and Punk in Miami",
  "description": "In her Miami high school, Cristy Road valiantly tried to figure out and defend her queer gender identity, Cuban cultural roots, punk-rock nature, and mortality. Through her writing and illustrations, Cristy reminds us of the strength and ability of punk youth to address realities like rape, homophobia, and misogyny. This book is no exception. Road's headlong story of growing up gives a voice to every frustrated 15-year-old girl under fire from her peers for being queer, butch, punk, or different.",
