  "title": "Wright with Benefits",
  "description": "A feisty stand alone friends with benefits romance from USA Today bestselling author K.A. Linde. With new characters set in the bestselling world of the Wrights, this is a perfect jumping on point for new readers! I shouldn’t have hooked up with my one night stand... again. To be fair, I was having the worst day of my life. I was sure that nothing else could go wrong. Then in walks Jordan Wright. We have a heated history, and I’ve been avoiding him. Not least of all because he’s a hundred percent my type with those big brown eyes, a ripped body, and his blisteringly broody charm. I said I’d never go near him again. But he’s there for me when I need him. And well, old habits die hard. Only problem? I’m leaving in a matter of months, and nothing is going to change my mind. Maybe in the meantime, I can still have my Wright...with benefits.",
