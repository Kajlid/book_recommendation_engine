  "description": "A Katrina Moment relates the tale of two lovers who decide to stay in New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Throughout the days of the storm and its aftermath, the two band together with the other survivors and create a new order. Stripped of any social pretensions, the diverse remnants of the town unite to create a very different society. Collectively the holdouts labor side by side, assisting in the massive relief efforts. Katrina wielded catastrophic destruction, but this contrasts sharply with the depth of humanity that is created. Prejudice inside the sanctuary of the French Quarter is suddenly non-existent.",
