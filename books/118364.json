However, she decides to practice the sensual arts she had learned on the handsome Gattan visiting her family. The virile lion man with golden hair, tufted ears, and an Alalakan dragon tattoo his shoulder fascinated her. But it was the huge bulge between his legs that came alive every time she was near him that captured her attention. Oh, yes, Marljas would be her first true lover.After Sheala is kidnapped and tortured by a family enemy, the indulged, protected young woman she’d been disappeared. Hoping Marljas will heal her physically and mentally, Sheala initiates the blood ritual that would bind her to him forever. The fire he ignites in her soul does much, much more.",
