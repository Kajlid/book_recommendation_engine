  "description": "A devastating first-hand testimony exposing the cruel and widespread practice of forced marriage 'I was twenty years old and dreamed of marrying for love.' Leila was born and brought up in France by Moroccan-born parents. But her romantic dreams were shattered when she was forced by her father to marry a man she'd never met, fifteen years older than her, and whose language she couldn't understand. The husband she didn't love beat her regularly in an attempt to force her into submission. With extraordinary courage, Leila fought back against the weight of family tradition to regain her liberty and dignity. And despite the very real risks, she has left her husband and speaks out openly against the evils of forced marriage.",
