  "description": "\"Passion, heat and deep emotion—Naima Simone is a gem!\" —Maisey Yates, New York Times bestselling authorAs the ex-mayor’s daughter, Jenna Landon has spent her life aiming for perfection—and missing. The pressure and disappointment turned her into a bit of a mean girl, but now she’s tired of protecting her soft heart, of hiding her losses—she’s ready to leave Rose Bend and start over. But before she can leave, she has to endure the town’s carnival fundraiser, her father’s reelection campaign…and the pain-in-the-tail giant who just moved in next door.Wrestling coach Isaac Hunter didn’t mean to disturb his neighbor with his music while fixing his car. But if anyone could use “messing with,” it’s prissy, perfect, sexy Jenna Landon. Soon their clashes turn into something hotter. Recently divorced, his focus should be rebuilding his life, not an… entanglement with a woman who spells nothing but trouble. Because Jenna is leaving Rose Bend. And they both know he can’t go with her, and he can’t ask her to stay...Bonus novella! Tattoo artist Erik Mann never should’ve agreed to hire his best friend’s sister. Against the odds, he’s built a successful business in Rose Bend and has everything exactly as he likes it. The last thing he needs is her sweeping in, changing things. He doesn’t know whether to throw her out…or kiss her. Not that either is an option. Her brother made it clear that she’s strictly off-limits.Rose BendBook 1: The Road to Rose BendBook 2: Christmas in Rose BendBook 3: With Love from Rose BendBook 4: Mr. Right Next Door",
