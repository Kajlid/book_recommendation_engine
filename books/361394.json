  "description": "The biggest danger in the world today is not the asking of questions, but the assumption that we have all the answers.\n\n\n    WHAT GOD WANTS\n  \n\nThis book, from the author of the phenomenal New York Times bestseller Conversations with God, is dangerous. Why? Because it explores with startling freshness the most important question you could ever ask -- and offers with breathtaking courage the most extraordinary answer you could ever imagine.That answer is so theologically revolutionary and spiritually empowering that it could change the course of human history. If embraced, it most certainly will change your life.There are people and institutions in the world, long in place and long in power, that want neither of these outcomes to occur. They would rather that you put this book down right now.\n\n\nWhen was the last time you read a dangerous book?",
