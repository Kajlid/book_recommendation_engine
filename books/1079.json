  "description": "Jayne faces the fury of a family he's long neglected. But even if he can find a way to patch things up... a distress call from Requiem could spell disaster. Pure devastation may be in store, along with internal conflict, distrust as half the crew hunts for a dangerous target, and a secret on Jayne's end that no one truly expected! Despite Jayne trying to recklessly play hero, will the crew find more than they bargained for? Will the help of newly-trained allies be enough for Inara, Simon and Leonard to survive their newest enemy and find the cargo they pursue? Acclaimed comics writer David M. Booher (Specs), artist Vincenzo Federici (Teenage Mutant Ninja The Armageddon Game), colorist Francesco Segala (Maskerade), and Eisner-nominated letterer Jim Campbell (Damn Them All) reveal brand new mysteries, and the threat of an even deadlier weapon than the crew of the Serenity could have prepared for! Collects All-New Firefly # 5-8.",
