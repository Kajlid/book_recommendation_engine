Tilly Watson, to be exact. And when Tilly's gorgeous boyfriend, Jon, mistakes Abi for the real star, Abi's completely smitten. In fact, she's so in love with her new life, it isn't long before she doesn't have time for her old one. But when the cameras are turned off, will she discover running with the Hollywood A-list isn't quite the glamorous existence she thought it was?",
