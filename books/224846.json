  "description": "Who rescues the rescuer when there is no 911 for the soul?Blood is... \"Never let rescuer number one become victim number two\" is one of the very first lessons Victoria Scotts, \"Tori\" to her friends and family, learns as an EMT.Blood is... Caught between family legend and her cousin, Nina, ten years her senior, a musician and a legend in her own right. Tori may be the oldest of her siblings, but never first ... not with her family, not with the woman she lives with.Blood is... Despite the censure of the mother she supports emotionally and financially, Tori forges her own path as an EMT in the New York City 911 system. In the process she discovers a true calling for what she does, a deep and abiding love for the city and people she serves, and perhaps for the first time in her life, after a series of dangerously charged erotic encounters, a real connection to someone who cares for her because of who she is, and not only for what she can do.Blood. When a good faith attempt to render aid, comfort, and compassion goes horribly wrong, leaving Tori sick and scarred, she must question the validity of her relationships, the ties of flesh and those that transcend it, her faith in the innate goodness of people. Hardest of all, she must face for herself the natural, inevitable...why.",
