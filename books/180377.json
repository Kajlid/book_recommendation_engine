  "title": "Trees on Mars: Our Obsession with the Future",
  "description": "The future is big right now—for perhaps the first time, our society is more focused on what is  going to happen in the future  than  what is happening right now . In  Trees on  Our Obsession with the Future , cultural critic and indie entrepreneur Hal Niedzviecki asks how and when we started believing we could and should “create the future.” What is it like to live in a society utterly focused on what is going to happen next? Through visits to colleges, corporations, tech conferences, factories and more, Niedzviecki traces the story of how owning the future has become irresistible to us. In deep conversation with both the beneficiaries and victims of our relentless obsession with the future, Niedzviecki asks crucial Where are we actually heading?  How will we get there? And whom may we be leaving behind?",
