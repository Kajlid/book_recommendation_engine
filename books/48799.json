  "description": "It’s time to deal with all those guy questions in your life. Guys can make life complex. Sometimes they’re nice, sometimes they’re not, and when they’re cute they sometimes leave our brains in a jumble. On top of seeing them every day, we have to figure out how to interact with the male gender, and exactly what to do with any romantic feelings. It’s no wonder girls have so many questions about guys! Well, here are answers to many of the issues and wonderings real girls like you have. The Whole Guy Thing explores how you can deal with boys now and in the future, as well as create self-respect that is rooted in God’s love. Featuring relationship topics, real feedback from guys, and even advice on how to talk to your parents about dating rules and guy-girl interactions, this may be the book you’ve been waiting for.",
