  "description": "The beautiful beaches of Brittany and Normandy were a focus of frantic activity throughout the Second World War. Thousands of men landed on them, died on them, and were rescued from them. For some men their escape was delayed, a terrifying time where every villager’s moves came under watchful German eyes. A few of the men had to wait a little longer for a boat to take them home…A few of them are still waiting. Being asked to accompany her best friend on her first holiday in years is exactly what Joanna needs. Having her best friend’s incredibly handsome brother unexpectedly join them in the idyllic holiday cottage is not. Tall, athletic and fabulously successful, sports writer and celebrity interviewer Dominic Winter is every woman’s dream man. Unfortunately to Joanna her best friend’s brother is also arrogant, antagonistic and spectacularly argumentative but much to her annoyance, he has been the highlight of her dreams ever since they were all together at school six years previously. The tiny fishing village of Prajou holds many secrets of the past but while suspicion and whispers echo their way through the passages of time can Joanna and Dominic call a truce in their never ending battle of wills? It’s time to stop just smelling the aroma of freshly baked French bread and discover the delicious scent of romance in the air. Echo Beach is an easy read romance suitable for young adult and above. (Contains mild bad language and some sensual passion)",
