  "description": "Rachel and Landon’s story continues in this sequel to Drawn to You.It was supposed to be just one week, just sex, no commitment, but somewhere along that overwhelmingly sexy ride, Rachel fell in love with Landon. There’s just one problem, he doesn’t do commitment. As far as Landon knows, they have a good thing going, and he’s not willing to let that go. So Rachel can either tell him how she feels and watch him walk away, or keep it to herself and continue to drown in her feelings for him.It hurts to be with him, but being without him hurts more. How do you make a choice about love, when there’s really no choice at all?",
