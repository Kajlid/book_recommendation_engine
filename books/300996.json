  "description": "Wedded bliss feels like it’s a long, long way away for Finn right now. When he popped the question to Chase he wasn’t thinking ahead to the inevitable – fractious relatives determined to use the wedding to bring up old grudges, nieces jockeying for bridesmaid positions, and a non-human ringbearer with extremely antisocial eating habits. Every day brings fresh battles with florists and family, not to mention that planning a Hollywood wedding is really bringing out the monster in Chase.Just when Finn is afraid that Groomzilla is going to snap and destroy LA, an opportunity arises to do something slightly less insane: hunting the Loch Ness monster. What they don’t know at the time – but soon find out – is that the Loch Ness monster has a long and well documented history of driving people crazy. Have they just added to their stress by dragging monster madness into the mix?Tartan bullsh*t, single malt frenzy, violent golfers, wayward dogs, Aleister Crowley, and deep fried Mars bars – there’s a lot more to Scotland than shortbread, as they’re about to find out. Join Finn and Chase once again as they make a splash (sometimes literally) in the mysterious waters of Scotland’s most famous loch.",
