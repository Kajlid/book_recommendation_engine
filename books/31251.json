  "description": "Bernie has about had it with his wife, and about forty years of her berating insults and over-seasoned cooking are about to come to a head during their regular Sunday canasta game, when he discovers that the only reason she's winning is because she's cheating.Loaded with absurdly dark humor and capped off with an ending that chills to the bone, A CONCEALED HAND shows how quickly a long marriage can turn south over a bad game of cards.",
