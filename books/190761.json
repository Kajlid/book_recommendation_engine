  "description": "\"An impressively ingenious reframing of the chaotic domino effect caused by King Tut's death & the tantalizing possibility of his line's survival.\"------------------\n Hell hath no fury like a spider caught in its own web.\nThe gods, even in their rage, had never been more clear. Either King Mursili II succeed in placing the Amarna bloodline back upon the Egyptian throne or everything he has sacrificed, everything he has lost will be for naught. Everything he has put those closest to him through – Nacamakun, Idamun, his family – would be for naught. All of his prayers and faith would be for naught.Yes. Even in their vengeance, the gods had never been more clear. It’s all or nothing. Either the prophecy is fulfilled and both Egypt & Hatti find salvation or Mursili and his allies fail - plunging both kingdoms into indescribable darkness.Behold. Even in the terrible deafening silence of their abandonment, the gods had never been more clear. The time has come for judgment.----------------------------------------------Amarna is a ridiculously, historically accurate drama set in Ancient Egypt, Hattusa & Syria that is centered around the strange but true events surrounding the battle for the throne of Egypt following Pharaoh Tutankhamun's death and the interconnected events that took place in the Hittite empire.It includes an end matter feature that details what did and didn't really happen (at least as far as historians believe).",
