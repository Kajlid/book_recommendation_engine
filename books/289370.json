  "description": "Lily Connor has focused all her energy into becoming a successful wedding planner, and after five years, she’s on the precipice of taking on more responsibility at Southerland Wedding Company. When the chance finally presents itself, it comes with a complication she couldn’t have dreamt up in her worst nightmares. With the bride and groom away for a month, Lily needs to work with the bride’s best friend, Bennett Burke, a woman she never thought she’d see again. It was only for a few months, a study abroad experience that felt plucked from those same dreams turned nightmares, but Bennett is back, and Lily wants nothing to do with her. Bennett broke her heart the first time, and Lily swore she’d never let something like that happen again. Working together can’t be avoided, but falling in love? Lily needs to stop that at all costs, even if it comes at the sake of her own happiness.",
