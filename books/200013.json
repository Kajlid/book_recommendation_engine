  "description": "Jack Warren is a low-life--a suicidal cop haunted by past tragedy. Suddenly a promiscuous teenage girl goes missing at the local rest stop just outside of small town Wisconsin. Despite Jack's alcoholism, he is on the case. Evidence suggests murder, but what Jack ultimately discovers is something far more sinister...Tarryl's splatterpunk horror fiction is not for those with weak stomachs. It is horror without limits aimed at evoking a deeply felt visceral response from the reader.",
