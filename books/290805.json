  "description": "My rules: No players. No flirts. No cocky jerks. My exception: Dawson Marsh.   Dawson might be every girl’s crush in this small town, but not mine. I can appreciate him from a distance, and that suits me fine.  Except that one time he kissed me. Up close and personal.  Once is a mistake. But the second time? Sublime.  The man should come with some kind of a warning sign: Not safe for work! Hot to the touch! But what kind of girl can’t handle a little friends with benefits action, right?  The one who missed the most important warning: Danger, risk of falling.  *This is a full-length, standalone romance with a guaranteed HEA.",
