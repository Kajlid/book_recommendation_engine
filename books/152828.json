  "description": "Dear Author,Fuck! I got all dressed up for an evening alone and forgot that tonight was my night to host “pizza and basketball night” with the guys. My detective partner arrived at my house first and came looking for me upstairs and found me like THIS!!! How am I going to explain this to him?! He doesn’t even know I’m GAY! Much less that I have a lingerie and heel fetish!Photo Description: A half-dressed man stands in front of an ornate mirror. The room is luxurious, as are the red, lacy panties and fishnet stockings he wears. Long black patent-leather boots reach mid-thigh. He is muscular and very handsome.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love’s Landscapes\" event.
