  "title": "The Shambhala Guide to Taoism",
  "description": "For the first time, the great depth and diversity of Taoist spirituality is introduced in a single, accessible manual.  Taoism, known widely today through the teachings of the classic Tao Te Ching and the practices of t'ai chi and feng-shui, is less known for its unique traditions of meditation, physical training, magical practice, and internal alchemy. Covering all of the most important texts, figures, and events, this essential guide illuminates Taoism's extraordinarily rich history and remarkable variety of practice. A comprehensive bibliography for further study completes this valuable reference work.",
