  "description": "If Rachael Adair could only use one word to describe her life, it would be, \"pandemonium.\"When her mother was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, she knew life couldn't get any more complicated. As the disease sows discord amongst family members, Rachael is forced to deal with a classmate making her existence a living nightmare and cryptic threats from a little girl calling herself Delilah. All she can lean on are her new-found friends, Vera and Holden.Then Holden's guardian reveals their family secret: they are werewolves. And when her mother dies, their alpha intends to offer her a new life as a lycan.While our heroine labors to keep her head above water in day-to-day high school drama, the alpha's interest in her inadvertently signs Rachael's death sentence. Howl of the Sequoia is one girl's journey into the paranormal, a world she is utterly unprepared to confront, and where vengeance can be taken for the smallest perceived slight. Only when she has to fight to save her brother's life does Rachael realize what sort of monstrosity she's up against-and the consequences of becoming one of the pack.",
