  "description": "A portrait of a millennial young man in the pre-Occupy Wall Street America of bank bailouts and apathy. Marinated in cocaine and sexual failure, awkward, painful, with occasional moments of high comedic relief, TRAIN TO POKIPSE has proven itself to be frighteningly accurate in its socio-political predictions. During this election year mad-house, it's easy to find yourself wondering how we fell this far. TRAIN TO POKIPSE, written beautifully and structured in an intricate metaphor, captures the moment in time when the wheels started falling off the American dream.",
