  "description": "Max and Hannah have each made themselves a promise.\tHe’s finally going to ask a woman out for the first time in nearly ten years. And since he can’t stop thinking about the beautiful woman who teaches water aerobics at his gym, she seems like a great place to start. \tLittle does Max know Hannah has made a promise to swear off men for the foreseeable future.\tWhen circumstances beyond their control force them to quarantine together, Hannah decides being friends with the sexy guy next door is totally fine--because friendship doesn’t end in heartbreak.  Plus, did she mention how dreamy he is? Just because she’s not in the market doesn’t mean she can’t window shop, right? And spending a little of her time with Max every day isn’t as costly as giving him her heart. \tBesides, she’s bored. And lonely.\tBut as Hannah gets to know her neighbor and his kind, caring heart, she begins to feel a yearning in hers. Is the promise she made keeping her from getting hurt again…or is she hurting herself anyway because she won’t allow herself to be happy? \tWill sweet surprises, meddling friends, and a man who is as kind as he is attractive finally convince Hannah that maybe it’s better to be alone together? \tA sweet, feel-good romantic comedy, Alone Together has slow-burn chemistry, mild language, and plenty of steam.",
