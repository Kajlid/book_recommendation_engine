  "description": "Maddox McKenna wasn't used to begging. Or coaxing. Or cajoling. Or tempting. As a matter of fact, he wasn't used to anything that had to do with struggling to get someone to say \"Yes!\" because he was a grizzly. Grizzlies did not ask, nor compromise, beg or cajole. They simply breathed and everything stepped into line. That was the grand design of nature; it worked in his favor. As the mightiest of mighty beasts, he never once thought he'd be in a position that would leave him at a loss of what to do. At least not until the day he met Cree Chayton. Sporadically violent with sharp claws and an even sharper tongue, the mysterious beauty not only fascinated his natural curiosity about things smaller than him but she stimulated...other parts. There was just one issue--HER. She wouldn't give in to his desire to see her naked and starry eyed! She avoided him, injured him and refused to greet him shirtless with a smile. Not only was it an outrage to his delicate honey adoring sensibilities but it was a bit of a blow to his ego. However, when Cree's normally stand-offish behavior veers into territories that make Maddox frightened FOR her rather than OF her, he has to wonder if her reason for refusing the advances of his straying groin have to do with a genuine disinterest or something deeper. The option to leave her be is there but he simply can't because he believes wholeheartedly that she's just what a bear needs...",
