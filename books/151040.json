  "description": "In the Cold War era, a small-town family decide that a fallout shelter is the right thing to add to their house following a visit from a salesman, who promises to ease their sleep with a custom cellar conversion. Meet the Braves: father, George, is a New York neurologist, while his wife, Maisie, is stuck at home with the screeching kettle that mocks her failed aspirations and their three children who don’t seem to need her at all. When the installation is complete, the family decide that they will sleep in the shelter ‘just in case’. But on the way down, George slips and hits his head, losing consciousness. Maisie awakes to find the door sealed and the emergency radio dead, and is unsure whether her husband is losing his mind or if the world really has ended. A story about finding courage in a society that sells solutions via scared consumption, and embracing dreams.",
