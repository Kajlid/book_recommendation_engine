  "description": "\"Sometimes a man knows his destiny before he meets it. Perhaps he has glimpsed it in a dream or in the face of a passing stranger. Or maybe, he has felt it in the still of night, in the dark whisper of shadows. As for me, Iâ€™m not sure when I knew of it; my destiny. I cannot claim to remember the exact time or date, but I will never forget the moment I felt the knowing of it; its searing upon my conscience, its emblazoned seal upon my heart. Those are the kind of moments a man never forgets; not even in death.\"After surviving a deadly rock slide, 17 year-old astronomy enthusiast, Michael Garner, is captured by a magic, alien race of humans called Enori who take him to the planet Arlectus, where he is thrust into the middle of an intergalactic war, and falls under the unlikely tutelage of Empyrean's old military leader, Obed Northaven, a half-dragon, half-human Nuhlga.",
