He hates how perfect she is, and she can’t stand his treatment of women. Both Liam and Clove are accustomed to letting others see only what they want them to see, each hiding behind false pretenses.What happens when polar opposites realize that their hatred of one another is really attraction? Will they succumb to the allure? What happens when the things that you fight so hard against are the very things you need the most in the world?",
