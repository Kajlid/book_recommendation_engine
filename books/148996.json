  "title": "Has Man a Future?",
  "description": "What spurs a famous philosopher, at the age of 89, to plunge into a political campaign of civil disobedience and go to prison for his beliefs? The answer is an urgent concern for the continuance of the human race.In the million years during which man has lived on this planet, he must have survived many hazards. Can he hope to survive a nuclear war? Here lies the most agonizing question of our era.Refuting the theory that scientists have been the willing tools of governments, Russell exposes the hypocrisy of official attitudes to nuclear weapons. The one hope for man, he proclaims, is to be found in world government. He maps out a reasoned scheme in his this book, and details the practical steps we can take towards it today.This moving pronouncement - in its admiration of man's past achievements, in the despair engendered by his present plight, in its unquenchable concern for those who follow - is no less than Russell's living testament to mankind.",
