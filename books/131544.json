  "description": "“Tasty, innocent soul,” it says in a voice so deep, dark, and malevolent, it drives a shudder up my spine. The words seem to come from the ground itself, rising like fire, licking at me with grotesque rapture.The price is six souls in three nights.Imprisoned for a crime she did not commit, Rill Narin carries a lethal secret—she is a Tangler. Temporarily inhabiting other bodies is illegal magic, but a slice of life on the outside is sweet relief from the brutality of prison. Until Rill tangles with the Earl of Tarr’s daughter and witnesses a demonic murder.Thrown into a whirlwind of danger and intrigue, Rill forms an uneasy alliance with the steely Constable Sabella Rivers and privileged Lady Keeva Dalton. United by circumstances more perilous than their differences, they embark on a frantic race against time to unmask a hellish murderer. With shadowy secrets lurking in every corner, can the ternion discover the hidden forces at play and unveil the truth before the price is paid?",
