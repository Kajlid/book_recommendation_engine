  "description": "The First Edition of Wherever I Go, which has since been revised by the author.When Elison Hart was seven years old, she lost everything with a big bang; her parents, her little sister Aless, and her home Keynan, the land of magicians, a floating island in the sky which would never soar again. Only approximately eight years later, a week before her fifteenth birthday, Elison discovers that her sister still lives, only she's living with Mildred, Sister of Death and sister of the Master of Death himself, Meldrick, a seemingly ancient foe now long defeated. As the only magician left in planet Cascade, Elison is one of the three CCO members, along with Kale Dillans and Tyson Smith, prophesied to save the world form an unearthly darkness. After defeating Meldrick and returning the light to four of many lands of Cascade, the CCO begin their second adventure to reconnect the shattered planet, as each of its lands float scattered in the endless abyss of space. With the help of their new friends, Merlin the Magician, Cindy, and Viviane \"Lady of the Lake\", Elison realizes she isn't the last of her kind as the CCO take charge to battle against the Sister of Death, who wants revenge against them for \"murdering\" her brother, and will do absolutely anything to get what she wants. In order to defeat this new threat, Elison might have to defeat her long-lost sister as well. What if you had to murder your own sister, after already losing her for eight years?",
