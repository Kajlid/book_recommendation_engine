  "description": "Have you ever come across a vain, impetuous little creature called a Mandie, and had to quickly dodge one of her poisonous darts? Or, have you ever imagined having to sing to a fruit to get it to peel open? Perhaps you've bumped into freakishly large, blue men, called Dreads? Yes. I said 'blue'. And maybe the pet you have always wanted is a fluffy purple ball with large bulbous feet? Well with all of that, along with evil Nymphs and blood thirsty Banelorgs - these are things you've only likely experienced if you've had a nice long visit to Lynniah.Corrah's life suddenly and drastically changes with the unexpected and inexplicable death of her loving mother, Lillian. She and her two sisters, Gaela and Stormy, are suddenly thrust into the unknown and sent to live with their mysterious Aunt Rainee, who lives in the seemingly bewitched village, called Lynniah. It was a place that they'd always heard extraordinary tales about, but had never imagined to truly exist. Living in a house that their mother's family had occupied for hundreds of years, they find clues that begin to unlock the startling reality that they are all part of an important magical heritage. A heritage that has been kept secret to save them from a dark and powerful enemy. Corrah has to find a way to battle and balance the onslaughts of loss, young love, and learn to uncover the personal power she has hidden inside her to overcome overwhelming adversity.This is book 1 in the Enchantress of Lynniah series.",
