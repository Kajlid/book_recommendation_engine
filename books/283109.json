  "description": "Nothing in this world would ever stop Breanne Parker from saving her late-father's beautiful land, especially when someone goes after her vulnerable sister to try to purchase it.   The wealthy Hayes family has been after Breanne Parker's land for years. When Breanne discovers her younger sister is secretly dating one of the Hayes brothers, she knows she needs to do all in her power to keep her property safe from the Hayes' avarice and greed. Little does she realize that she's the one being set up to commit to a long-term merger with much broader implications.  Fated merger is a clean romance that explores how unfounded prejudices disappear when two stubborn hearts can meet half way.  A true romance must come from the heart, a trait that author Ruth Davidson has no shortage of. Her style of writing is largely inspired by Jane Austen, considering her to be the first true romance author, and also Hallmark, believing that beauty is in its simplicity. Ruth's catchphrase for her books is \"clean romance that leaves a smile in your heart,\" and she fully commits to that ideal whenever she puts pen to paper.
