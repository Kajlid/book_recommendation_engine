  "description": "Do I save my siblings or keep all of the men I love? Hunter thought he lost his pack for good, but his brothers have reappeared. The pups are overjoyed at seeing their uncles again, and we’re all relieved to know some of his pack members survived. The only problem? His brothers hate humans. Which only adds to my confusion when I hear they have a shaman like me. The divide between Hunter and I only grows when I’m offered an opportunity I can’t refuse. It’s more money than I’ve ever seen in my life-- more than enough to support my siblings who still need me, and to start building a future with my lovers. On this rollercoaster, Connor and Raz are always at my side. Even Arjun is surprising me. The only questions is, can my heart accept that Hunter may have found happiness without me? Step right up, and witness the hardest choice I’ve ever had to make. Tightrope is the fifth volume of the Harem of Freaks series, which should be read in order. Contains violence, M/M, and M/F sexual content.",
