  "description": "Authors Note - On the advice of the zombie overlord, and the very dangerous duck, this book has been re-issued with new material and released as Lord of the Zombies: Apocalypse.Think Dawn of the Dead, The Evil Dead, Return of the Evil Dead, The Evil Dead Go Shopping and The Evil Dead return their overdue library books.  Lord of the Zombies is nothing like any of these zombie classics. It is however a comedy satire of the zombie genre, complete with werewolves, vampires, ridiculous plot devices and cheesy pop-culture references. After all, who brings a duck to a zombie fight? If Monty Python had written a zombie book, it would be nothing like this one – except for the zombie killing goats, the psychotic duck and the porn star with a tank. In this post-apocalyptic novella complete with an apocalypse to end all apocalypses, a handful of survivors embark on a perilous journey to find sanctuary. All the while they are pursued by the relentless Lord of the Zombies and his army of the undead. Will our heroes survive, or will they become lunch… A madcap satire on the zombie, vampire and werewolf genre where appalling fashion sense and the absolute lack of a plan may actually save the day… PLEASE NOTE - This",
