  "description": "Ellis Morse is no longer human. The day her girlfriend breaks up with her, she discovers that her hair and skin have turned stark white. At first, she's scared. And then she's livid. She shaves her head and begins to hunt for answersâ€”what is happening to her, and why? But she might not like the answers she finds, especially when they point her to the mysterious killer of one of her classmates, and then to the stars.",
