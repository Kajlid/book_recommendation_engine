After caring for two husbands and her mother for 22 years, Reese spent the next five years documenting the relationship and passing of her second husband, the love of her life, and her always loving and ever charming mother—both of were dying at the same time.Each day challenged Reese’s strength, and at times her patience, yet each day was an opportunity to laugh with her quick-witted husband and her wickedly funny mother while finding ways to honor the love they shared.Once the pain of loss began to lift, Reese realized she was no longer a caregiver, so she set out to redefine her purpose in life. Using her business planning skills, she created a process to transform the pain in her life to a future full of meaning.Hers is a love story. Her process to redefine purpose provides a path out of grief. Both are within the cover of her book, It wasn’t supposed to end this way .",
