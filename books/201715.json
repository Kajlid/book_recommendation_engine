  "title": "Crazy Horny Lady",
  "description": "Angelica has a cat named Bixby and a shotgun named Skeeter, but she can't seem to find Mr. Right. That is, until her friend sets her up with the perfect guy... who just happens to have a smoking hot brother. She navigates the conflict between her need for everlasting love and the desire for ultimate gratification in this hilarious look at modern life and love. In the debut novel from author Lindsay Valentine, romance, sex, and everyday living are lovingly skewered to reveal the immense beauty and endless silliness of being human. At once tender, sweet, erotic, and ridiculously romantic, Angelica's adventures reveal humanity in all of its glorious blundering as she tries to make sense of this crazy thing called life.",
