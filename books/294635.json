  "title": "Loudmouth",
  "description": "Raised in a violent, unreconstructed Southern family, Thomas Ransom was not the first of his generation to imagine rock & roll as a way out. But he took it to the extreme, becoming an outrageous singer and, at 21, editor of the magazine that invented punk â€” before crashing in 1970s New York. Still, it isn't music that saves him. It's a soft-spoken painter, who turns out to be the most outrageous character of all. Tom's memoir-like story recounts adventures with both the famous (Springsteen, Clash, Stones, Lester Bangs) and the luminously obscure. And music is just the start. With echoes of Almost Famous and Just Kids, LOUDMOUTH is a novel about growing up while falling down. The debut novel of Robert Duncan, a former editor of the legendary Creem magazine, LOUDMOUTH tracks an impassioned wannabe out among the hippies, punks, and wild geniuses of rock when music was the center of the world.",
