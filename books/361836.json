  "title": "The Last Crossing",
  "description": "This epic tale sweeps across continents and time, hovers over a key area in American History, and deftly realizes the humanity of a whole cast of characters. Charles and Addington are two brothers sent from the comforts of Victorian England by their dictatorial father to find Simon, a brother missing somewhere in the depths of the American West. As Charles, a sensitive painter, and Addington, an arrogant former Soldier, search the American frontier, they gather a troupe of other characters--Lucy, bent on avenging her sister's death, Custis, a Civil War veteran, and Jerry Potts, a half-breed. The love story that emerges eventually forces Charles to confront the meaning of love--and what it means to cross over.",
