  "description": "Milla McKool has been dumped by her French boyfriend after five years, losing her chance at love, her rising star status as an executive chef, and Paris. Back in NYC, she’s stuck with a dead-end job, an amaretto addiction to make herself sleep at night, and a decidedly jaundiced view of all mankind. The only cure, according to her best friend, is to get back out there.  Hunter Rossdale has been stuck in neutral for even longer. The handsome, successful investment banker meets his match in Milla, a woman who no longer believes in happy-ever-after. She’s just looking for happy-for-now. Hunter doesn’t know what’s hit him, but he’s interested. What man hasn’t dreamed of a sexy woman who’s after him just for sex, no strings attached? But along with some dubious help from Hunter’s brother—a workaholic physician with his own romance woes—Milla’s sous-chef, who has no moral compass to speak of, and a nymphomaniac Russian psychic, the couple finds love isn’t always predictable. Sometimes your destiny is waiting.",
