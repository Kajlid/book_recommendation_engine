  "title": "Can You Stand The Truth?: The Chronicle of Man's Imprisonment: Last Call!",
  "description": "Parts of THE TRUTH are found fragmented in every viewpoint, religion, aspect, and human ideology. But not a single one of the above can give us the complete picture of IT. As an example, we can take Newton’s spinning-disk experiment and the deflection of (white) light into the seven colors of the rainbow. WHITE LIGHT –which contains all colors– is like the ONE TRUTH, which, like a magic picture, lies in front of everyone's eyes. Man, remaining firmly ATTACHED to his personal view (color) cannot compose all colors - aspects - viewpoints and gaze at the ‘White’ color of the TRUTH. If he can position himself however at a specific “place/point” he will be able TO SEE. Then, everything gets decoded in front of his eyes like a hidden picture that suddenly appears. Who are right then? The evolutionists who believe in Darwin’s theory, or the Church when it claims that god created us? ...Both! Who is Those who believe in reincarnation or those who persistently reject it? ...Both! Who is Those who believe in man’s soul and spirit or those who don’t? ...Both! Who is The eye-witnesses of UFO’s or the scientific community that insists there is no intelligent life on other planets? ...Both! The contents of this book gradually move the reader through an ascending-spiral process, from a simple position to a complex one, so as to smoothly reposition him to a different dimension, wherefrom he can gaze at a very different world from what he has believed in up to now.",
