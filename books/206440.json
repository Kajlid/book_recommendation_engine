  "description": "Alex isn’t like the other girls. Alex has secrets that only Alex knows, and she intends to keep them that way. That is, until those secrets stop her in her tracks, leading her to the dark and macabre world of BDSM to cash in on the money she needs to keep up with her addictions, as well as living the proper life of a snobby sorority girl.Alex’s main infatuation goes from Elle, the love of her life, to money and power. Taking newly learned techniques and her broken moral compass, Alex goes through a whirlwind of ventures and struggles, hitting rock bottom and clawing her way out, all while battling her inner demons—and the real life ones in the dungeon as well.Can a young woman living so dangerously, so hazardously, with so many risks and so much to lose, choose the path that leads her away from the coaxing temptation of the exquisitely beautiful women she works with, away from the wads of greenbacks and the name she’d made for herself, the infamous Dolce DeMaul?Or will she live happily ever after with the only person who’s ever shown her what affection is? Only time will tell, as it usually does—catching up and breaking open secrets, unveiling the true wrath of a woman addicted to the sweeter things in life. A woman with a beautiful mind and broken heart, enslaved in her own ways.",
