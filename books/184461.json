  "title": "Dark Satellites",
  "description": "In a not-too-distant future, the world is overcome by war. Man-made Satellites, built for protection, orbit the Earth, using artificial intelligence to seek out signals of fear and mutate animals and humans into monsters twisted by paranoia, madness, and violence. Poe is a seasoned and dedicated soldier who has spent years fighting the war. He finds solace in battle, but he has seen too many of the horrors the Satellites have created, both in the field and in his own family. Yet the Satellites can find no fear to use against him, which makes him the last best hope for the human race's salvation. So why have his most recent orders taken him away from the fight? Released from active duty, Poe returns to his parents' home in the City in the Sea, an artificial island built beyond the reach of the Satellites and the war. The residents of the city are safe from the terrors of the outside world, so why does it feel more dangerous than any battlefield Poe has ever encountered?",
