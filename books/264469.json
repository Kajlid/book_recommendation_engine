  "description": "In 2012 Mr Ashish Bobade lost his memory for one day due to a significant health issue! Once he recovered, his curious mind started discovery of science behind memory. He learned the secret, how exactly world memory champions use their brain at maximum potential. He discovered that \"There is no GOOD or BAD memory; it is only TRAINED or UN-TRAINED memory.\" More than 24,000 children between the 14-18 age group died by suicide from 2017-2019, according to data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). The highest incidences are attributed to a failure in examinations. What if these techniques are applied in education & learning? Can the schools teach these techniques to the students? Mr Ashish Bobade and his team have taken up a non-profit mission to spread study techniques worldwide. The two-hour seminar is sponsored by the BrainGyan Foundation and is free for participants.
