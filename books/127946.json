  "description": "What would you do if the one fate chose for you vanished into thin air? What would you give up? Who would you become to stay with that person? Krista Bell Johnston finally knows what it's like to be free. The torture she endured at the hands of her psychotic father has unleashed the monster her mother tried so hard to help her suppress. The only thing she wants to do is be the shadow in the night that everyone is afraid of. Taser “Taz” Jameson is barely holding it together. He lost Kris once to her father and now he's losing her to the monster she is becoming. He's also barely containing his own monster since Krista decided she didn't need her mates anymore. Nathan is still near but he may not be enough.  Nathan Brimming, Jr. is on the verge of losing not one but both of his mates. One vanished without a trace. The other is avoiding him. He has run out of patience with them both. But when the monster that Krista has become comes to them with a proposal; will they take her up on it and possibly lose themselves or will they try to talk her down and get the beast to put back on her chain?",
