  "title": "Owning Regina: Diary of My Unexpected Passion for Another Woman",
  "description": "Everything you ever believed about your sexuality may be turned on its head upon meeting the right person.When television commercial production coordinator Meg Curtis gets stood up by her longtime boyfriend, she vents her frustration by feverishly writing in a diary. At a time when she is unsure about all things romantic, she encounters 5th grade teacher Regina Baker at yoga class, a free-spirited single mom who is beautiful, playful, and impossibly intriguing. What starts as friendship turns sharply toward something more as they learn they each share a love for very dark and unconventional sensual expression. Despite significant differences in lifestyle, each woman is desperate to get close to the other to explore the depths of devotion.Shocked, yet thrilled by the intense level of Regina’s erotic desire, Meg turns apprehensive. She had never been with a woman— never had to be in society with a woman, never had to wonder what labels may be placed upon her relationship, never considered herself anything but obsessed with men. Regina, also enchanted by a woman for the first time, finds freedom from the pressures of daily life by committing herself to Meg. Compelled by the need for a balance between worlds, the two embark on a daring, passionately physical role-playing game. Welcoming Regina’s darkest needs, Meg explores her own deep-seated desires that have been locked away in the shadows her whole life.Erotic, amusing, and profoundly romantic, Owning Regina is a tale that will awaken you, possess you, and transport you to an alternate universe that steams with passion and danger.This book is intended for mature audiences.",
