  "title": "Cherry Blossom Girls",
  "description": "I was a just normal guy until the night the cherry blossoms bloomed, the night that Grace appeared on my doorstep. A failed sci-fi writer, a gamer, but a normal guy nonetheless.  Grace was everything I was not, a psychic shifter, beautiful beyond my wildest imagination, a government conspiracy waiting to be unraveled.  And that was before the second superpowered woman showed up to kill us both.  Warning: Cherry Blossom Girls contains a harem; gamelit LitRPG humor/stats; violence; telepathic, shifter, and vampiric superpowers used for auto theft, mind games, and the exploitation of the general public. This series was inspired by The Tick, Stranger Things, Vonnegut's Breakfast of Champions, and the anime Elfen Lied.",
