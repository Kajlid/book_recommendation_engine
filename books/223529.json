  "description": "T-Bone Riley is a man of few words. Raised pretty much off the grid his whole life, he tends to see things a little different. Now that he's all alone after the death of his dad, he's thinking it may be time to find him some company. Seeing as he's a throwback to the old days, when he sees the little filly's ass on the campus grounds, he doesn't think there's a damn thing wrong with nabbing her and taking her back to the farm to warm his bed and bear his children.",
