  "title": "The Idea of Prostitution",
  "description": "This work explores the idea of men's entitlement to abuse and profit from the abuse of women in prostitution. It aims to show how this idea is central to male supremacist ideology, and has been bolstered by masculine systems of thought such as sexology, sociology, historiography and queer theory. It asserts that the feminist challenge to this idea has become more difficult in recent times because sexual liberalism, economic individualism and free \"choice\" ideas have persuaded even some feminists that prostitution should be seen as \"just a job like any other\". The book argues that it is important to recognise men's abuse of women in prostitution as a variety of male sexual violence and a violation of women's human rights.",
