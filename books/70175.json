  "description": "Alongside our world is another, a world where women may be kept as slaves, whipped for the slightest misbehaviour or just for the amusement of their owners.Somewhere over the Atlantic Ocean is a portal where it may be possible to cross from one world to the other, swapping lives with someone on the other side.Pam made the crossing, although not intentionally. She found herself on an airship, caught as a stowaway and condemned to work semi-naked as a slave for the amusement of the passengers, and whatever they wanted to do to her.",
