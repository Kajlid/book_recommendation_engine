  "description": "Eleven souls, suicide victims resulting from various issues including: bullying, unwanted teen pregnancy, drug addiction, and sexual abuse awaken from a cocoon-like state, to find themselves on a mysterious realm named Destaris. An Oshlu (spirit guide), named Maree, has been appointed to assist the fallen souls, who are universally intertwined through life experience. The teens must complete their self-interrupted spiritual journey in order to free themselves from the limbo-like realm and move on to the next. Oblivious to their soulâ€™s true desire, they are put through a series of tests that will ultimately deliver them, one by one, through a porthole to their final destination, Heaven or Hell. The group, quite content being free of their earth burdens, soon realize that they cannot escape their biggest nightmare: the inability to escape themselves. They race against time to complete their testing for spiritual growth, for the longer they remain on Destaris, the more they must cope with the return of their former earth burdens. On Destaris, these past hardships re-emerge with a cruel psychedelic twist, as the realm holds unknown bizarre powers beyond those of a simple Earth. Many resist cooperating, for fear of being claimed by the Devil, and become deeper entrenched within their limbo state. This frustrates Maree, as she needs to free every trapped soul in Destaris before she is freed herself. She loses patience when several become uncooperative, tempting her to force the teens out through any porthole she can.",
