  "description": "He’s a fire mage who’s lived his entire life on the wrong side of the King’s law. She’s a guard desperate to prove herself. Together, they will enter the legendary Demon Forest.     Vethe Scarvian is a direct descendant of the man who almost destroyed humanity. And that plus a couple of coppers will buy him another beer.   When his aunt reveals the existence of a long-lost betrothal agreement hidden somewhere in the ruins of the Demon Forest, Vethe is only interested in how much money the noblewoman betrothed to him would be willing to pay to escape that contract.  He just has to find the contract first.   Lyria Guardia let her family down and got her heart broken. Gods help her, that will never happen again.   After a crushing betrayal by the man she’d built her life around, Lyria abandons her promising career with the Adventurer’s Guild and returns, humiliated and heartbroken, to the Guard’s Guild that her family has run for hundreds of years. Determined to regain her position and prove herself to her five brothers, Lyria is willing to accept any assignment.  Even if that means she has to drag some spoiled noble brat through the Demon Forest in search of a mysterious missing contract.   The Flame and The Blade is the first book in a new romantic fantasy adventure series. Fans of Miranda Honfleur and Sarah J. Maas will love this story of forbidden magic, dangerous adventure, and sizzling enemies-to-lovers romance.",
