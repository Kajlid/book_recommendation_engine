Zaydee Lansing was young and in love when her life got turned upside down. She thought that removing herself from the situation when the moment presented itself would help her fix everything. She hoped that all of the painful memories from the past would be swept away, and she would be a normal person again.  But the bitterness inside of her is cold and unrelenting. When an unforeseen event prompts her to go back home, she finds herself faced with every monster from her past.  How deep do scars really run? Is it possible to put mistakes behind you and start over again?  Zaydee Lansing made one mistake and it's left her broken to her core.",
