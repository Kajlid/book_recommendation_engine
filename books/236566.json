  "description": "She left him at the altar, but the devil is making him keep his promise.  Destiny is calling Chris, yet someone forgot to give him an instruction manual on conquering the world. Being the Antichrist is all well and good, but how is he supposed to know how to bring about Armageddon? He’s still waiting for his army of minions, the glory, the riches. And where is the respect?  You’d think any woman would be ecstatic at the thought of marrying the future ruler of the world.  Not Isobel.  She keeps spouting things like “forced to get married,” “love me for myself, not because Daddy made you.”  It doesn’t help that his psychotic mother with a penchant for playing with dead things has taken an interest. However, having her henchman of the apocalypse attempt to kidnap him isn’t the way to get in his good graces.  Things are starting to get complicated on Earth. Dark forces are rising, Chris’s powers are still developing—and he’s pretty sure his dad, Lucifer, wants him dead. What’s the destroyer of the world to do?  Point him to the nearest bar. This calls for more beer.",
