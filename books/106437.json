  "title": "Blind",
  "description": "Blind follows one traditional, non-racist skinhead's journey for revenge after the murder of his best friend. A darkly comic novel about a scene as strict as it is chaotic, with a strong background of punk, oi, and working class roots in the San Francisco bay area. Rated Teen for searchability, but contains some graphic language and content.",
