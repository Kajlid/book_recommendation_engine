But Lord Jack Byron is facing a predicament that is scandalous...even for him!Marry a young woman because he lost a bet? Unreformed rake Lord Jack Byron would do anything to get out of it. But the rich merchant who holds his debt insists Jack lead his on-the-shelf daughter to the altar...and make her believe it's a love match. With no options, Jack agrees, thinking he'll be shackled to a closed-in spinster. But Grace Danvers is no milk-and-water miss. When he first encounters her in a London bookstore, Jack is struck by her tempting sensuality and soon becomes determined to bed—and wed—her (in that order!). Yet though he plans to seduce her with his touch, he never dreams he'll also want to win her with his love.",
