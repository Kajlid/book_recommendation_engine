In fact, she really doesn’t want to, but of course, life wants to mess with her again.

He has a great family, a business he loves, and women if he wants them. Then, by chance, he meets a cute, bumbling baker, who doesn’t seem to want anything to do with him.Of course, he has to change that, and make Channa see he’s worth getting to know on all levels.",
