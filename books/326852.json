  "description": "They say the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I’m learning that lesson the hard way. My name’s Aubry Brooks, and here’s the thing—I’ve got myself a little possession problem.Yes, I led a séance I had no business leading in the first place. No, I’m not a channeler, but let me explain. I was only trying to help a mother find her missing daughter, and then a cocky half-incubus had the nerve to possess me! You’d think a clairvoyant kitchen witch would have seen this coming.No need to panic. I can figure out a way to exorcise Damion Blackmon, assuming I can withstand his seduction in the meantime. Oh, and he’s agreed to help me find out who killed my best friend. Deals with devils. I'm not sure if it's my soul or my heart that's at risk.But don’t worry, my grandma was a voyeur in a past life and she'll catch you up to speed. In extremely graphic detail. A word of warning—do not let my aunt talk you into a juice cleanse. Nothing magic about that, I promise.Welcome to the metaphysical shop Memphis Magic.",
