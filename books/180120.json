  "description": "Ten years after they landed. All over the world. And they did nothing, standing on the surface of the Earth like trees, exerting their silent pressure on the world, as if there were no one here and nothing under foot. Ten years since we learned that there is intelligent life in the universe, but that they did not recognize us as intelligent or alive.Trees, a new science fiction novel by Warren Ellis (Transmetropolitan, Red) and Jason Howard (Super Dinosaur, The Astounding Wolf-Man), looks at a near-future world where life goes on in the shadows of the Trees. Biologist Jo Creasy, the survivor of the catastrophic Arctic events of Trees: Volume One, is sent to the Orkneys to look for the phenomenon that she knows is the sign of the end of the world. A smaller apocalypse is being enacted in New York, where a mayoral candidate is taking revenge for the night the Tree landed on Manhattan...Collects issues 9-14.",
