  "description": "I had one job—kill the king, and I failed.I’d once thought ending King Zephyr’s reign would be enough for me to move beyond my past, but the longer I’m within the fae realm, the more I realize nothing is as simple as I’d hoped.My first attempt to take down the castle might have been unsuccessful, but I refuse to accept defeat. The only problem... sea creatures and unknown fae insist on getting in the way and my path back to the castle proves harder than I like.Between magical swords, my sexy fae, and new allies I’m not sure I can trust, I’ll have to figure out my priorities and quickly. Death is in the air, and if I don’t make the right decision, it could be more than just my life on the line. It could be my heart, too.",
