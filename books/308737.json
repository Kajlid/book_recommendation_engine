  "description": "What would you do if an irresistibly desirable but utterly untouchable woman whispered to you, If you want me, you’ll have to come and get me?That’s exactly the situation that Elliott Foster, CEO of Foster MacKenzie, finds herself in when she meets the alluring Lauren Collier, Chief Legal Counsel of a Fortune 500 company. Elliott never has a shortage of attractive women willing to share her bed, and she doesn’t care if they are attracted to her or just her money. By her rules, if two women are attracted to each other there’s no reason why they shouldn’t spend the night together―or in some cases, the afternoon. Lauren, intriguing but decidedly off limits, doesn’t fit the mold and Elliot knows she should walk away. Instead she finds herself in the unusual position of pursuing another woman, and even more disconcertingly…on Lauren’s terms. Come and Get Me is a passionate, roller coaster romance that’s anything but predictable.",
