  "title": "Ten Men",
  "description": "A best seller in the UK, this witty and endearing novel about a woman's mission to discover what will make her truly happy introduces ten extraordinarily different men but none, it seems, that entirely fits our heroine's needs. Among them are The Virgin, who has charm but can't spell experience, The Lord, whose stiff upper lip makes for a stiff upper life, and The Billionaire, a walking bankroll with a bankrupt heart. So when The Actor has been dumped, The Lawyer's BMW consolation prize sold, and The Schoolmaster left behind, there's only so much she can give to The Lover, who's out of her head when he's out of her bed, Mr. Cerebral, a late-night brilliant idea always gone by morning, or The Director, who can't say Cut to his own wife. After journeying across several continents in search of the perfect man, our smart and stylish protagonist finally realizes that not one of these men has made her feel complete â€” on the road to fulfillment the first person she must learn to satisfy is herself.",
