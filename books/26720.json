  "description": "Everyone has bad hair days, and Marina is no exception. What she doesn't understand is why her bad hair days are always the worst ever. An accidental journey to world far in the future because of her grandpa's psycho cat pretty much makes her day not only the worst ever, but wins the title of most bizarre day ever.In the chaos that ensues as she tries to find her way home, Marina embarks on a quest to find and rescue the mother that she never knew. In order to do so, she needs to learn a valuable life lesson. Not only must she accept who she is, she must come to terms with who she isn't.This story targets young adult readers, and deals with the personal responsibility we all have for the \"Green\" movement and taking care of our planet, while tackling the often-sticky issue of the need for young people today to take school seriously and pursue education as a way to make a difference in the fate of this world.",
