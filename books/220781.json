She doesn't work in an office by day and have a secret identity by night. She doesn't have friends and family who know nothing about her but when they find out they love her anyway. She's not cool. She's not clever. She's not kind to animals. She won't help children, the elderly, and those less fortunate than herself. In fact, she doesn't care. But if you hurt her, she will kill you. Actually, she'll do worse than that.Meet Laura. She'll eat you alive.",
