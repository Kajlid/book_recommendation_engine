  "description": "Is Healing for Everyone?  God is not just “able” to heal, He is willing! The Lord is gracious and compassionate, and He longs to give you all the blessings of redemption, including physical healing. He is Jehovah-Rapha, the God who heals you (Exodus 15:26). Why is this blessing of divine healing the source of so much confusion in the church? What does the Bible really say about healing? Explore this controversial topic with author F. F. Bosworth as he carefully searches the Scriptures for answers to perplexing questions such as . . . * Is healing really possible today? * Is healing for everyone? * What was Paul’s “thorn in the flesh”? * How is a person supposed to receive healing? * Can I receive healing? “Faith begins where the will of God is known,” says the author. By understanding God’s will for your healing, you can live in the fullness of your salvation in Christ—spirit and body.",
