  "description": "A pair of grief-stricken parents and a strange set of psychic sisters whose vision of future tragedy goes unrecognized; a young girl who attempts to fulfill her dead father’s wishes and thereby discovers the horrifying truth about her own past; an engineer who becomes involved in an experiment that seeks to answer the question of Death and the ultimate force of Life—These are some of the characters whose strange adventures unfold with gripping suspense in this collection of five new tales by Daphne du Maurier. Chilling and compelling, all of the stories contain elements of mystery, and some of them touch on the supernatural in very real and frightening ways. And together they represent Daphne du Maurier at her very best—full of intricately woven drama and shattering surprise endings.",
