  "description": "From author Rayvn Salvador comes an all new paranormal romance set in the mystical city of New Orleans.Remember, you must die.Spurred on by her mother’s need for the family’s fifteen minutes of fame, jaded skeptic Hanlen Arbor returns to her hometown, the root of her past terror, only to be thrust into a new nightmare. Someone is murdering the good people of the city in a macabre scene of blood and ritual.When Hanlen gets pulled into the mystery, she’s not prepared for what she finds or the dangers that await her in the bayou. And she’s certainly not ready for the handsome-as-sin man whom she’s forced to put her faith in.Ghost hunter and Vodou Houngan Deveraux Glapion has seen a lot and dealt with more as the descendant of one of the most well-known people of New Orleans. When the intriguing and somewhat-broken caretaker of his TV show’s latest location comes to town, he’s thrown for a loop, the likes of which he’s never experienced before.And that’s just the beginning. Because evil is afoot in New Orleans, and he may be the only one who can stop it—but only if he can get Hanlen to trust him and believe in things that most people think are merely ghost stories.",
