  "description": "Silent No More is the story of Elisabeth Bauer, a modern young woman side-tracked by a freak twist in time to 1942-era Munich, Germany, where she unites with a rag-tag group of medical students bent on bringing Germany back from the brink of Hitler’s insanity.On the desperate journey to find a way back into her own world, she begins to see that life is not all black and white, and that sometimes even the most courageous can falter.Back-Jacket Info excerpt –“So you’re a doctor, too?” Elsie asked Hans after Dr. Adler had left the room.“Heavens no, not yet at least. I’m a medical student at the university. I’m one of the residents here.” He came over and sat next to her on the bed. “Don’t worry. You’ll be home soon.”“I hope so.”He stood up, “I’ll be back later. In the meantime, get some rest.” As the door clicked shut, Elsie only had one thought running through her head. Home? Where’s home?This is just one of the frightening questions facing 22-year-old Elisabeth Bauer, as she struggles to make sense of the nightmarish world she has stumbled into. With no knowledge of her past to guide her forward, Elsie forges new friendships with people she hopes will help her in her quest for truth.Among these friends are Hans and Sophie Scholl, members of the World War 2 resistance group, The White Rose. Another is a mysterious medical student who seems to know more about her past than he’s telling. Elsie needs to find answers to her questions, and fast. As the bloodhounds of the Third Reich circle ever nearer, she quickly learns that all truth comes at a cost.",
