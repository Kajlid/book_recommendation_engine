  "title": "The Forbidden Ground",
  "description": "In \"The Forbidden Ground,\" Val and Dimitri (and Sindari and Zav) take a trip to Southern Oregon for an assignment that is not as simple as it seems. In the bonus scenes, we take a look at several events from the first three novels in the Death Before Dragons series from Lord Zavryd's point of view. For the first time ever, we see what he was thinking while interacting with Val and the world at large.From the author's site: I wrote story to stand alone (so if youâ€™re a new reader, you can jump in and enjoy it), but it does have some spoilers for the earlier books. It takes places between Books 4 and 5 in the Death Before Dragons series.",
