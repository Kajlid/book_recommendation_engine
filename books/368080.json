  "description": "My Booky Wook was one of the most revered and successful celebrity autobiographies of all time (not including the Bible or anything by Jordan). The honesty, mayhem and scandal made it as riveting and fanciful as anything found in fiction. In Booky Wook 2, this award-winning achievement is surpassed as Russell charts his rise from crack-house junky to Hollywood star, indulging in sexual excesses that make Caligula seem like a prudish spinster.On his quest to find true love, Russell encountered thousands of women, often three or four at a time (for efficiency), and his dizzying ambition led to chaos and controversy that could have landed him in prison and left the BBC in ruins.This is the story of what happens when insatiable desire meets limitless opportunity and when a chancer from the wrong side of the tracks is given the keys to the palace. This riot of self-indulgence would be rampaging still but for a tossed bottle to the head from one of the world's biggest pop stars. Can true love conquer all? Is it a more powerful force than the raging libido of a professional madman? The answer lies inside.",
