With her best friend by her side every step of the way, Alex takes on this new experience to see her dreams could really come true.

Especially a band that has entered a showcase competition, where the grand prize is the chance to open for a multi-platinum selling group of rockers that is currently on a worldwide tour. That famous band is also fronted by none other than the sinfully sexy, Noah Dreagan, who seems to be drawn to Alex, and emits an energy that could easily pull her in. Battling nerves and insecurities, Alex digs deep inside to find a confidence she had long forgotten, and embarks on a journey that leaves her questioning whether she still believes that everything happens for a reason. “What happens when ‘Destiny’ comes along and changes everything?”",
