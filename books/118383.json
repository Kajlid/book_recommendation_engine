  "description": "What does an airplane - aka “death trap in the sky” - have to do with true love? If you like flying and you’ve never been dumped, well, nothing. Lucky you! But, if you were Elliott James Hallowell, the answer to that question would be easy…that tube of death hurtling through the sky at 600 miles per hour means…Everything. This is the story of what love looks like when it’s been sucker punched by the boy of your dreams. The same boy you’ve given the last six years of your life to, only to be played the fool in the end. What happens when you feel like there is absolutely no other choice but to face your greatest fear in order to put the image of that boy - THE boy - out of your mind for good? Maybe in the end you’ll see yourself in a way that surprises you. Maybe you’ll see that all along you’ve been the arm candy to his Thor and not much more, but no longer. Maybe, just maybe, you learn to follow your dreams, and even make a few come true along the way.",
