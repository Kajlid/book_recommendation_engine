  "description": "Can a disabled mage save a prince from a terrible fate?  When she was fourteen, Gabi promised she’d do anything to protect Prince Alrik of Arksar. Including falling in love with him, in case true love’s kiss is needed to break the curse. But six years later, Alrik hasn’t expressed interest in any woman. He is content to flirt, but never showed a strong attachment for anyone. And now the witch who cursed him has returned after years in exile...  Time is also running out in Savony, where trolls have broken out from underground, terrorizing the castle. More help is needed to defeat the trolls, but with half the mages tasked to protect Alrik, how will Alix, Sybil, and the princes band together and save their kingdom from an unprecedented crisis?  This is the third and final installment in the Reversed Retelling trilogy. It is highly recommended that Book 1, Till Midnight, and Book 2, The Beast and the Beauty, are read prior to starting on this book.",
