Inspired by her own family's experiences during the Coronavirus pandemic, Brianna wrote this new short story in hopes to provided young children a sense of inclusion during a time in their life's that has been confusing, scary and isolating. Although we have all been in lockdown and separated from our friends and family, we can connect through the similar experiences we are all facing. Everyone around the world has been forced to alter their life. Going through this change together has proven just how important human connection is. With this book being inspired by true life events, children can reconnect knowing they were not going through the pandemic alone.",
