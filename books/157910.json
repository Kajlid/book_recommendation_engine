When the city council’s new convention center project threatens to demolish her new flower shop, Kiss from a Rose, she vows to win the fight without help from her wealthy and well-connected family.

Problem is she hasn’t been able to get along with the guy since that fateful day they met … back in kindergarten.There’s more than building blocks and coloring books on the line now though. Luke’s recently inherited his family pub, and isn’t about to let the city put a wrecking ball through years of memories and tradition. This is his chance to show his family he can be more than just the fun-loving, favored son. … except Luke’s not exactly singing “Jingle Bells” at having to strategize with spoiled Candace.The only hope they have is in finding some common ground. Will this Christmas bring miracles or the destruction of everything these old rivals love?",
