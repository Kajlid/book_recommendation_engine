Now that he’s running his own security consulting firm, not much has changed.Except the curvy blond he hired as his office manager.Noelle Davis has been through the damn ringer. Swearing off men after escaping a toxic relationship, she’s grateful for a fresh start―new job included. Of course, her job isn’t tranquil and calm. In fact, it’s quite the opposite. Because her boss is the most infuriating man on the planet.And, not to mention, sexy as hell.Foster has limits. Rules. No attachments allowed because he doesn’t do love―and Noelle Davis foiled that plan and took a red pen to his list of rules. With her smart mouth and quick witted banter, he found the woman beginning to creep past his defenses.When circumstances put Noelle in a perilous position, the first person to come to her rescue is none other than Foster Kavanaugh. She gets to see the man in action―not as her aggravating boss, but the man who will stop at nothing to ensure her safety.The same man who makes her want to reconsider her self-imposed embargo of men.The man she wants to get to know now that she’s seen another side of him.The man who makes her want…more.But is more possible when you're OUT OF LOVE?",
