  "description": "There is a fine line between the world of the living and the world of the dead, and Robin Hillard and her handsome husband Dr. Matthew Gregory are about to cross it. After the two meet in the ER of the local hospital, Robin and Matt begin a whirlwind romance. Matt surprises Robin when he proposes to her in the midst of the beautiful Pikeview Manor, the home that Matt has just purchased for them to begin their lives together. What the newlyweds are unaware of is that by walking through the front door they have walked between the worlds. The couple begins to hear strange noises, find objects moved, and they see the shadows once hidden within the majestic house.  Robin has dreams of the past, while Matt struggles with the line between science and the world of the unseen. Matt’s young daughter Olivia begins speaking of the little girl that she plays with in her room, and of the darkness lurking within every board, nail, brick, and tile of the house. The family’s love and strength is tested as they realize that terror is not imagined…its real!",
