  "description": "God exists!? This may seem unprovable. The truth about Jesus differs radically from his traditional image!? This may seem absurd. However, both of the above assumptions are in fact provable through the logic that orders the Universe and also by virtue of the moral principles inherent in Life.This book initiates an independent investigation into the Jesus phenomenon. In parallel with this, it opens up an exploration of the nature of the Creator.",
