However, in an act of exceeding folly, the king presents his new bride with the enchanted Lythereon Mirror as a wedding gift. Its dark power soon corrupts the queen. Prince Corlan, Raven’s brother, is determined to find a way to destroy the mirror before he loses his mother completely—or it kills them all. Already the queen’s envy of Snow has become obvious. Corlan has been in love with Snow White since they were children and would do anything to protect the beautiful princess, even defy his mother. But when Queen Melantha uses the mirror to force Corlan into killing Snow, he knows it will take a battle of great strength to outwit the evil spell surrounding him and save the girl he loves.JENNI JAMES FAERIE TALE COLLECTION~ Box Sets - great value! ~Faerie Tale Collection Box Set #1: Cinderella, Hansel and Gretel, Jack & the BeanstalkFaerie Tale Collection Box Set #2: Beauty & the Beast, Snow White, RumplestiltskinFaerie Tale Collection Box Set #3: Sleeping Beauty, The Frog Prince,The Twelve Dancing Princesses~ The Collection - read in any order! ~Beauty and the BeastSleeping BeautyCinderellaRumplestiltskinHansel and GretelJack and the BeanstalkSnow WhiteThe Frog PrinceThe Twelve Dancing PrincessesRapunzelThe Little MermaidPeter PanReturn to NeverlandHook",
