  "description": "Christina's Tapestry N. J. Walters Christina Beaumont impulsively buys an expensive tapestry that she sees in a shop window, having no idea how that one action will change her life. The magical tapestry not only transports her to Javara, a world that resembles medieval Earth, but also into the arms of two massive warriors who both want to claim her. Jarek and Marc, Brothers of the House of Garen, are elated to discover the tapestry has delivered Christina to them. Women are scarce in their world, so the men of a family must compete for the right to be her husband. But before she can choose, Christina first has to experience the lovemaking of both brothers, separately and together. Jarek and Marc use all their considerable sexual skills to pleasure her in ways she's never imagined. But the tapestry also offers another choice. Christina could return to her own world. Jarek and Marc join forces to convince Christina to stay with them even as they fight a rival family for the right to keep her as their very own.",
