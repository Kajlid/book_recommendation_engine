  "description": "I always believed in fairy tales, but he preferred horrors. Damian Blackstone didn’t care about my existence. He came into my world for one reason only. He came to find answers about his past. He moved like the villain in my favorite fairy tales. He wasn’t the one who received the happily ever afters; he was the one who destroyed them.Which was why I couldn’t understand why the man who raised me set it up in his will for Damian and me to be married. I wasn’t certain I’d be able to live with a man like Damian. We were as opposite as any two people could be. I loved to bathe in the sunlight while he prospered in the shadows.I didn’t think I’d develop feelings for the one who looked at me as if I were nothing more than a means to an end. Yet in his darkness, sometimes I’d see sparks of light. I’d see gentleness. I’d see his soul.We became entangled with one another as we fell into mistakes and called them fate. I was his Cinderella, and he was my Beast. I wasn’t certain that twisted fairy tales ended with happily ever afters. Still, I was determined to find out.",
