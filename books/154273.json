  "description": "Diane and Stacey like to wander the city in pursuit of excitement. They flirt with danger, meet new guys and accept rides from strangers. Harmless fun. Or so they think.  Marti Rose, international bestselling author and amateur crime solver, returns to Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada to visit her family and present at a fundraiser. Upon arrival, the Chief of Police enlists Marti’s help to solve the murder of a fifteen-year old girl.  Marti questions potential suspects and friends of the victim, Diane. Through her involvement with groups focused on Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, Marti becomes involved in a second murder case.  As a mother and writer, Marti questions why teenage girls flirt with danger. Is there a deeper reason for the killings? Are girls being murdered because they’re Indigenous or are the murders unrelated? Why have the shadows of evil invaded the safe haven of suburbia?  Stolen Spirits, a contemporary Canadian young adult murder mystery with Indigenous characters and voices provides a unique twist on murder as it addresses the untroubled, reckless attitude of youth. Spirits, tricksters, ghosts and forces from beyond provide false hope, scattered clues and jumbled nightmares as Marti and the police rush to solve the murders before the killer, or killers, strike again.",
