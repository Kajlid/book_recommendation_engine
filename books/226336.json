  "description": "When Letters From Home make all the difference.  Ben Fowler, an Army mechanic on tour in Afghanistan, loved listening to his squad member read letters from his sister.  Alicia Newton’s letters to her twin brother kept them as close as ever. When tragedy strikes, she relies on his friend, Ben, to fill the void.  As Ben and Alicia help each other with shared grief, they grow closer. But as Ben’s job is still dangerous, Alicia wonders if she can risk her heart again.  Can two broken hearts find healing in each other?  A standalone, no cliffhanger, and an HEA. For language that some may consider crude and for scenes of a sexual nature, mature (18+) readers only.",
