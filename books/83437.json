  "description": "The journey of a man who loses everything in one terrible momentLeo Millar is a young painter in Paris who seems to have it all—a beautiful French wife, a talented young son, a thriving career. And then in one terrible moment he loses everything. Overcome by guilt and despair, he flees to an island off the coast of Normandy, thinking that his life is over. Soon the island begins to work its magic when Leo encounters a brilliant but troubled musician who is fighting her own demons. But it is only when a strange, damaged child enters Leo’s life that he has a chance to move beyond his own losses and find, perhaps, a new definition of love and the restoration of hope.This luminous novel from the acclaimed author of A Blade of Grass explores the intersection of creativity and love and the ways in which the past is woven into the present. DeSoto’s marvellous painterly eye, his affinity for the natural world and his deep insight into human nature—in particular, the act of artistic creation—have produced an unforgettable work of fiction set in a landscape that is the stuff of dreams.",
