  "description": "Wulfblaec is NOT a fantasy novel imbued with dragons, elves, magic, or demons. With only a touch of the occult, it is a deeply researched adventure story taking place during the Dark Ages of Europe and gradually encompasses a wide variety of themes, many of which are relevant to our modern world.The year is 555 A.D. The Romans have long been gone from Britain, and German settlers have been pressing the Brits off their lands. Wulfblaec, whose name means Black Wolf, is a young barbarian horsewarrior and hunter descended from the fearsome Langobards. He arrives in Britain intending only to support his family back on the continent, but he discovers his personal ambitions mean little. His destiny is not for him to determine for he is believed to be the long-awaited BLACK WOLF of an ancient prophesy. (approximately 840 e-book pages)",
