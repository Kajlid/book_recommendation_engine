  "title": "Animal Equality: Language and Liberation",
  "description": "The first book on language and nonhuman oppression, Animal Equality shows that deceptive, biased words sustain injustice toward nonhuman animals. Speciesism, the failure to accord other animals equal consideration and respect, survives through misunderstanding and ignorance.Contrasting evolutionary reality with popular notions of human uniqueness and superiority, Animal Equality discredits the term \"lower animals.\" Compelling evidence of nonhuman thought and emotion debunks language that characterizes other animals as unreasoning or insensitive.Vivid exposes of hunting, sport-fishing, zoos, aquariums, vivisection, and \"animal agriculture\" reveal the cruelty that misleading words legitimize and conceal. Animal Equality leaves no doubt: speciesist abuse relies on euphemism, doublespeak, and other linguistic ploys.",
