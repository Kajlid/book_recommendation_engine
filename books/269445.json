  "description": "I knew exactly what I wanted out of my senior year.A full ride to Northwestern University, the title of American High School Journalist of the year,and a kiss, not just any kiss, but one from the boy I've been in love with since the sixth grade.By October, my plan was fully in motion with liplock by Christmas Imminent. Imminent, that was, until Andie Mercantile moved to Marlowe Junction, swooping both my beat and my man.Now, I'm stuck writing the sports column--a subject I know nothing about. My goals aren't unobtainable, but they will take a lot more work. Just because a sports writer has never won journalist of the year before, doesn't mean it can't be done. And as for the kissing part, I'm not counting myself out just yet.After all, maybe learning a bit about competition is just what I need.Off Center is the second book in the Varsity Girlfriends series.",
