  "title": "The Perception of Time... and its Measurement",
  "description": "This e-book corresponds to Chapter 2 of the printed book entitled \"Galloping with Light - Einstein, Relativity, and Folklore\", and is the second of the e-Series entitled \"Relativity free of Folklore\".Because you deserve more than just folklore, in this e-book you will find the astonishing answers to the following intriguing 1) Do we know what Time is? How is it perceived and how is it measured?2) If all the processes in the Universe became overnight faster or slower in the same proportion, would we be able to know they did?3) What does the statement \"the cause precedes the effect\" actually mean?Â 4) Did you know that the apparently trivial notion of speed is logically vitiated because it needs of the notion of simultaneity which, in turn, needs of the notion of speed?The fact that the reader may not have a scientific education does not mean that s/he does not have the intelligence to understand profound concepts -- as long as they are presented with semantic and epistemological clarity. After all, Einstein said that Science is simply the refinement of our intuition and everyday experiences.",
