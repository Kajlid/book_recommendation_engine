  "description": "Sansa thinks her life can't get any weirder when she meets the man of her dreams during a holiday in Norway.  But it's only the beginning.  When Sansa falls through the ice of a small lake close to her hotel and resurfaces in another world, she has to take shelter in an old, beautiful mansion. And that's no punishment. Especially since the man of her dreams had accompanied her there. But slowly things start taking a turn for the worse and Sansa's life spirals into a dark adventure that looks like it has come straight from one of her fantasy books.  Part 1 of the series. Part 2: the Shadows, will be available soon!",
