  "description": "Will I still be loved if I show people who I really am?  \nFour high school seniors. Four secrets about to be told.   If Indie had it her way, she would never choose to river raft with three other high school seniors, mostly strangers to each other, from her journalism class.   A loner, a jock, an outsider, an Instagram influencer. At first they can’t see anything that they have in common. As the trip unfolds, the unpredictable river forces them to rely on each other. Social masks start to fall as, one-by-one, each teen reveals a deep secret the other three don’t know.   One is harboring immense grief and unwilling to forgive after the death of a loved one. One is dealing with a new disability and an uncertain future. One is fearful of the repercussions of coming out. One is hiding behind a carefully curated “perfect” image on Instagram.   Before they get to the end of Hells Canyon, they’ll know the truth about each other and, more importantly, learn something new about themselves.  What the Other Three Don’t Know is a poignant and gripping YA novel about the unlikely friends who accept you for who you really are and the power of self-acceptance.",
