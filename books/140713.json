But there's more to me than the official story in the textbooks. All of that is just the grand details. That's not the story. \"I've made mistakes. I've held secrets. I've done impossible things. Good things. Terrible things. \"I'll not die before I've said my piece. With aching bones and a heavy heart, I fear that now the time is right for my confession.\"",
