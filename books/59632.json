  "description": "A seer’s magic has kept Gallelon safe . Now the old seer is dying, threatening the hard won peace, though his visions offer hope of an wakening seer far to the north, in the Kingdom of Asgard. Even in hope there is despair. To ensure the vision’s truth, Egan, crown prince of Gallelon must travel north, risking his life beyond the safety of Gallelon’s borders. How much will they risk for peace? Egan journeys north with his personal bodyguard, the beautiful foundling, Misir, his father’s trusted advisor, Vincent, and a pair of rogue wizards, one of whom is an apprentice who barely has his spells under control. They will face barbarians and lycanthropes, and even risk starting a war before they can claim the prize that they so desperately seek. A new seer for Gallelon’s peace, and for the peace of all the lands. Search for the Seer is a new work by fantasy author Andrew Monk",
