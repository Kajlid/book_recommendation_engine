  "title": "Frontlines: Finding My Voice on an American College Campus",
  "description": "A shocking and honest account of the culture war at American universities, giving you a front-row seat to campus indoctrination. As a biomedical sciences student, Isabel Brown never anticipated finding herself immersed in a world of leftism, silenced by the thought police, and afraid to speak up for conservative values, but this is the reality that defined her college experience.Isabel's story is a compelling memoir about the current state of affairs on America's college campuses—unveiling the truth that university administrators don't want you to hear—and a reminder of the need for true ideological diversity. Finding My Voice on an American College Campus is a call to action for us all to boldly fight for the future of American culture on and off campus.",
