Freddy's Bean Farm is a frolicking place and Freddy-whether he's a pilot, cowboy, explorer, politician, or detective-will always save the day and be sure to have fun doing it.In Freddy Rides Again, Freddy-the porcine idol of people everywhere who love to laugh-gets it all started when he mixes it up with Mr. Elihu P. Margarine, a wealthy foxhunter who does not care a fig for the damaged vegetables he and his hunters leave in their wake. In the background, Henrietta the rooster chastises her husband Charles, \"A fine mess you've got yourself into! You know where you'll end up, don't you? On a platter with a lot of dumplings, that's where!\" With the help of Cy, the steed who taught Freddy to ride, Freddy rids the countryside of several menaces, including a rattlesnake and Elihu Margarine-making even Henrietta happy. It all makes for a stirring saga of a remarkably colorful pig and his steadfast barnyard compatriots.",
