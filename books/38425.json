Bonded to a misfit, who comes with her own disparate tribulations, Julissa follows in Cherrieâ€™s tread and is introduced to Aaron Delmon, an outsider in her high school. Julissa, searching for a perch in her raging sea-of-life, forges a relationship with Aaron. As she is drawn into his world, she learns life holds more promise than she could have ever imagined.",
