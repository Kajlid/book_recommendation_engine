  "description": "A bad boy, enemies-to-lovers, office, roommate romance.  Aiden is an alphahole and absolutely infuriating. You're going to effing love him!  I'm Carly.  A nice girl. A nice girl who has recently figured out that nice girls get the shaft. So, I've decided to become Carly 2.0 and say buh-bye Carly 1.0, the doormat.  There's a problem, though. An alphahole is my new roommate and my CEO’s son. He’s also my boss and the alphahole is gunning to ruin me. Alphahole: A grade-A alpha male asshole. The epitome? Aiden Carmichael.  Aiden wants to give me the shaft. In multiple ways, if you get my drift. Good thing the new me has decided to fight back and if push comes to shove, fight dirty.  I'm Aiden. Alphahole.  Or so the chick my father put in my corporate apartment and my department at the office calls me. Whatever. She's got spunk. And a great rack. She tries to come off as a badass, but I see right through the act. If she's gonna tangle with me, she'll be the one to get tied up in knots. It won't be me. I have no problem fighting and as far as I'm concerned, the dirtier the better.",
