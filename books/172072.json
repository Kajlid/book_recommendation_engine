  "title": "Thoughts for Young Men",
  "description": "There are four great temptations that plague most young men: sloth, lust, love of pleasure, and peer pressure. J.C. Ryle—the last of the great Puritans—tackles each of these subjects with a tenderness and tact which is unsurpassed. If it was difficult to be a young man in the days of the nineteenth century when Ryle first penned Thoughts for Young Men, it is all the more difficult to be a young man in the twenty-first century world of image-overload, radical individualism, and rampant sensuality. Thoughts for Young Men remains to this day the most relevant and helpful book on the subject in print.",
