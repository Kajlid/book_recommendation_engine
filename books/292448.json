  "description": "Don’t date clients.  One rule.  Easy enough, or so I thought.  Until this hot surgeon that I’ve been dating off and on becomes a client.  It was a casual fling, a fun summer love affair.  Until it wasn’t.  My heart wasn’t ready to fall so hard for this bad boy in scrubs.  The secrets he has hidden in his past stop me dead in my tracks.  But he isn’t giving up on us. Not for anything.  And I have to decide where I stand.  Break the rules or walk away from the best thing I’ve ever had.",
