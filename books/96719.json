  "description": "Twelve-year old Robin Hood is the head of the Underthieves-- a small thieving guild-- and he's good at what he does. As he likes to put it, \"The Best.\" But nothing pricks down The Best quite like a lacy red cloak that smells like... lavender? All because 'Grandma' wants an extra-special basket of Robin's stolen goods hand-delivered to her, and a Red Riding Hood is the best disguise available. It's not long until everything goes horribly--and laughably--wrong.",
