  "description": "Book 2 of the White Wolves MC series   Chelsea must be honest with the White Wolves  Although Tomas has backed off for now, Chelsea knows it's only a matter of time before he comes back. With everyone's future now jeopardized, Chelsea must delve into her painful past and find the strength within to tell Elias everything.   Elias is caught in an impasse  He wants to keep Chelsea safe, but he also has a responsibility to his club--his family. He needs to find a middle ground that will keep the White Wolves from coming to blows with the Houston PD as well as keep Tomas away from Chelsea.   Time is running out.  With Tomas' return all but inevitable, Chelsea comes to terms with the very real possibility that sometimes, the best choice isn't the easiest one to make and she'll need to convince Elias of that.  EXCERPT  Chelsea came back over to Elias and looked up at him. \"Elias?\"  \"Yes, lover?\"  She paused, forgetting what she was about to ask. Having him call her lover made her heart quake. \"Am I still your lover?\"  \"Definitely,\" he nodded.  \"Then, can we go back in the bedroom and kiss some more?\" she asked shyly, feeling greedy and needful.  He bent and swooped her up into his arms, and a giggle burst from her before she realized it was there. Wrapping her arms around his neck she kissed his ear, and then his cheek.  \"I'm very happy you still want me,\" she told him.  \"Do you still want me?\" he asked.  \"Very much,\" she told him.  \"Then I'm happy as well.\"  \"Make me your woman again Elias, please? Because I need you, too.\"",
