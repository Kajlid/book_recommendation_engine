  "description": "ANNA: a queer love story in poem and image.ANNA is an exploration in poem and in image of the raveling and unraveling of a passionate, tumultuous love story. Poet Gili Estlin Hirsch's words and artist Alex Ogden's illustrations follow two women as they weave together a powerful romance and are rocked by its force through to its inevitable end. With grace and subtlety, ANNA pushes the limits of modern poetry. Combining illustration as an essential part of narrative, it presents poetry that is both linked to host a love story, and independent so that each and every poem and image can stand for itself, dealing with themes of sexuality, love, and queer life.ANNA is innovative in all its aspects; as it presents a realistic and non-stereotypical queer romance, it strives to discover all sides of it, and explore all depths of the two characters that make up of it. Powerful language and imagery lead a bold but gentle story about a long-known tale, in a brand new way.giliestlinhirsch.com",
