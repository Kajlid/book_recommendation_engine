  "title": "GOOD FRIEND Volume 4: The Boy In The Window",
  "description": "Janice knows the boy across the street has been spying through her bedroom window for years, but when he comes home from college, she discovers that the grown up version of the boy is something worth watching for herself. They develop an unspoken nighttime routine: I watch you, you watch me. All goes well until the night the boy brings home a little red-haired girlfriend to put on a different kind of show through the window. Janice, realizing that he has no real experience beyond window peeping, takes it upon herself to cross the street and confront the boy face to face for the first time. Alone in his bedroom, with nothing now separating them other than fifteen years of age, the encounter turns into a sexual training session as Janice takes it upon herself to teach the boy in the window all the things she expects a man to know in bed. Just another Saturday night in a sleepy, suburban neighborhood. THIS STORY IS INTENDED STRICTLY FOR ADULTS. Meaning be 18 if you want to read it. It contains potentially controversial adult themes and all the crude language one would expect to describe them in glorious detail. 6900+ words.",
