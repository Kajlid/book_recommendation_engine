  "description": "Available as an ebook and paperback from all amazon sites.From Amazon.com: Make a Joyful Noise is the sparkling tale of a choir preparing for a very special Christmas performance of \"Belshazzar's Feast\". We meet a host of characters who are mercilessly sent up by the author: Lucy the staggeringly trusting young music teacher, Tristan the lecherous and vain anti-hero, Miss Greymitt the ageing and slightly confused choir pianist, Claire the shameless and scheming temptress, and singers with nothing but resonance between their ears. Just as all does not run smoothly for King Belshazzar in Walton's music, so the characters in the novel suffer from hopeless yearnings, romantic misunderstandings and the unfortunate consequences of their own misguided actions. All is sharply and wittily observed in a delightful mix of romance, music and humour.About the AuthorJenny Worstall spent her childhood years in Devon, Bath, Dorset and Naples. She is a musician and teacher and has sung in many choirs and choral societies, including the BBC Symphony Chorus, where she met her husband. Jenny now lives in London with her husband and two children",
