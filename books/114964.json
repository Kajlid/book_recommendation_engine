  "description": "The perfect gift for fans of The Big Lebowski, Jeff Bridges's \"The Dude\", and anyone who could use more Zen in their lives.Zen Master Bernie Glassman compares Jeff Bridges’s iconic role in The Big Lebowski to a one of the men in Jewish mysticism who are “simple and unassuming,” and “so good that on account of them God lets the world go on.” Jeff puts it another way. “The wonderful thing about the Dude is that he’d always rather hug it out than slug it out.”For more than a decade, Academy Award-winning actor Jeff Bridges and his Buddhist teacher, renowned Roshi Bernie Glassman, have been close friends. Inspiring and often hilarious, The Dude and the Zen Master captures their freewheeling dialogue and remarkable humanism in a book that reminds us of the importance of doing good in a difficult world.",
