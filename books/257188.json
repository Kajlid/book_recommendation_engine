  "description": "The Devil's Workshop is a metaphysical extravaganza for adults. It explains the origins of love and death, demonstrates the true nature of God and shows how He created and maintains the universe. It is also a tragic love triangle set against the background of a ripping pirate yarn. In a sea tale filled with witches, werewolves, pirates and Indians, there are many scenes of wit and whimsy, and many more of romance and dark intrigue. The main characters, Katie and Tom, have drunk a love potion and are fated for one another, but they have parted, just as a slave rebellion and an Indian war roil the waters and transform the landscape. They will search for one another through many hazards and perils. And this is just the moment that Crazy Dog and his pirates have chosen to enter the mouth of Cutthroat Bay in search of the giant emerald that is the eye of Maddibimbo the monkey god. Follow Katie and Tom as they traverse the treacherous roads and reefs of the Coast in their quest to be reunited.",
