  "title": "In Pursuit of Glory",
  "description": "Oliver Baldwin, recently back from the Barbary Wars, sets sail in the U.S. frigate Chesapeake on a routine patrol. The patrol becomes anything but routine when the ship is confronted by the 50-gun HMS Leopard outside the Virginia Capes. Commodore James Barron refuses the British captain's orders to produce Royal Navy deserters, and the Leopard fires into the American frigate with disastrous results. Following the ensuing court-martial, a new captain takes command of Chesapeake to enforce the Jeffersonian Embargoes on the Atlantic seaboard, with Oliver Baldwin still in his crew. Baldwinâ€™s adventures continue, encountering more ships of the Royal Navy, going to battle with the HMS Macedonian , and, ultimately, witnessing the actual beginnings of the War of 1812. Steeped in accurate U.S. naval lore and told through well-constructed characters, this chronicle provides a fascinating glimpse into a lesser-known period of crucial importance to both the development of the fledgling United States and her Navy.",
