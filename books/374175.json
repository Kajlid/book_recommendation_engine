  "description": "Once there was a little house called Green Gables in a little town called Avonlea, on a little island off the coast of Canada. It was the prettiest, most perfect place in the whole world -at least Anne thought so, the first time she saw it. And just think, it was to be her new home! Or was it? \"There's been a terrible mistake,\" said the last on the porch when she saw the skinny little red-headed girl carrying a suitcase. \"A mistake?\" Anne gulped. \" You're a girl! \" the lady said. \"We asked the orphanage to send us a boy.\" Anne dropped her suitcase and burst into tears. \" I might have known, \" she cried. \"Nobody ever did want me! I might have known it was all too beautiful to last!\" *taken from the back cover",
