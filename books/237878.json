  "description": "Bad Beat:  A hand in which a player with strong cards is unexpectedly beaten by a lucky draw.  Nico Conti has never regretted joining the family business. Through hard work, loyalty, ruthlessness, and dedication, he earned his rank as Capo and his army of soldiers.    With the life he leads, a good woman is not in the cards—until one comes along and turns his world upside down.  Olivia Miller’s childhood was anything but conventional.  Raised in a brothel, her mother protected Olivia from that life until she became sick.  Now Olivia must be the protector.  Taken as collateral by Nico Conti in a business dispute between families, Olivia is desperate to get home—until Nico makes her an offer she can’t refuse.  Or can she?  Because to save the one she loves most, Olivia will need to ignore the sacrifices made for her and barter herself to the man who holds her future in his hands.  Author's note: This is a full-length, steamy, contemporary romance novel without a cliffhanger. It is part of a series, but each book is a stand-alone centering on new main characters. Due to sex, language, and violence it is recommended for persons over 18.*** HEA ***",
