Republished on the tenth anniversary of the 1999 “Battle in Seattle” against the World Trade Organization, Harvey O’Connor’s book offers lessons and inspiration to a new generation of rebels. Harvey O’Connor was a seminal labor journalist and historian, whose work exposed the greed of the depression-era “robber barons” and labor struggles nationwide.",
