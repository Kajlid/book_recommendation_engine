  "description": "I was totally over Joshua Parkerson. Sure, I had a teenage crush on him way back when—and everyone knew it—but he never saw me as anything but his little brother's friend, the girl who got tongue-tied any time he walked into a room. I had long ago accepted the fact that his strong arms would never hold me, his lush lips would never claim mine, and his blue eyes would never see me as anything more than who I used to be. But now he's back in Willow Creek Valley, and there's a brand-new spark between us—even he can't fight it. Our chemistry is explosive, and every time we're together, I swear I can feel the earth shake.It doesn't mean anything... how could it? I'm over him. Until I see that little pink plus sign, and the earth stops turning completely. Now I want it all again, a life with him. But Joshua built walls around his heart for a reason, and his secrets haunt him. How can I show him that the ghosts of his past don't have to define our new family's future?",
