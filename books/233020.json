  "description": "Sometimes lines get blurred.Sometimes the truth is a lie, and the lies are the truth.Sometimes what you believed was rain is really fire.Sometimes your saving grace is the destruction you’ve been fearing.Azalei’s enemy isn’t the kind that subjects his people through fear and threats. He’s a more dangerous kind of enemy – the kind that weaves hope and safety into chains. The kind that inspires, enthralls, and enraptures. He has always known that fear loses to hope in the end, and so he became the hope.That leaves Azalei with the weaker weapon. She has to convince a country of happy, contented people that Carson isn’t a hero at all – that he is, in fact, turning their children into weapons, filling their heads with lies of a greater tomorrow, and then robbing that tomorrow from the countries surrounding them.And she has to do it at her own trial.Armed with a few young adults that are hardly more than children, a file of information, and a couple dozen dragons, she has as long as it takes a jury to find her guilty of treason to prove that Carson is the opposite of everything he’s claimed to stand for. And that’s if she can keep herself and the children from being murdered beforehand.Welcome to the game of Strategy. Sequel to the 4.5-star rated novel “Azalei’s Riders” by Miranda Marie.",
