  "description": "This title is being re-released from a previous version. If you own the previous version, then you will be prompted to update your Kindle so you get this newer version. You will not be required to re-purchase this title, even though the content has been revised.Many people want to be published authors, but not everyone has a full-length novel in them. Maybe they do have a full-length novel in them, but they'd like to \"test the waters,\" per se, before dedicating the hours, days, months to churning out a 60,000-word book and finding out they're not necessarily prepared to become a writer. Maybe they're already published authors who are looking for more exposure.Either wayâ€¦Independent Author Index Compilations are designed to help authors with one or all the above and more. Building on the premise that there is strength in numbers, the Index seeks to create a collective forum for writers to promote themselves and other authors.Authors (in alpha order) included in this compilation are as Mary Ann Bernal - \"Murder in the First\" / Maxine Brothers - \"The Reappearance of Sarai\" / Faydra D. Fields - \"What's In A Name?\" / Dave Folsom - \"The Pyramid Locators\" / Clara Freeman - \"Technicolor Love\" / CJ McKinney - \"Cold Wind\" and \"Two Magicians\" / Joey Pinkney - \"Swiggers\" / Anthony Robert Schultz - \"Rory Winters\" / Briana Scott and Carl Thompson - \"The Jimmy Lewis Project\" / Justina Wheelock - \"In Backstory\" and \"Nightmare Released\"",
