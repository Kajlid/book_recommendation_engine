A son of the most important rancher in Jasper Ridge, he’s tethered to the town, so he’s made his escape inward, turning his back on any new chances for a happy life.But he sees something in the eyes of the young woman who walks into the town saloon: a guarded pain he recognizes as like his own. He tries to resist the pull he feels, but with a nudge from Fate, friends, and family, Heath opens his heart again.Together, they find love and hope for happiness. First, though, they must face a past that neither has escaped.NOTE: This book was originally published in 2016, under the pseudonym Jenny Gavin.",
