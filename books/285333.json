  "description": "MANNISHLAWS was born out of the author’s need and a personal desire to create something that could be shared among men that could serve as a light resource for guidance and support. Mr. Christian committed to the challenge of writing a blog and a book, hoping to help establish a better baseline for understanding what it is to be a man, as well as how to use the term “man” intelligently. He calls this MANNISHLAWS because what is shared is a combination of rules, observations and principles that, when put together, form laws. The aim is for the reader to take these rules for what they are, an opportunity to understand how to embrace manhood, live as a real man, and live a life at a higher level without regret. This book is written to provide a lifelong guide for progressive, reflective, self-respecting males seeking to achieve a life of happiness, success and general fulfillment for himself, his family and his community. Numerous challenges of life circumstances and corresponding insight for success in navigating those choppy waters are included. Core concepts are presented that build a solid foundation of manhood that will never crack.",
