An ill-advised scavenger hunt through London, with social-status-ruinous consequences.Now, instead of pinching police helmets, this Bright Young Thing is pursuing her uncle’s latest hobby along the rocky cliffs of the Cote d’Azur.But all is not misery in Lady Caroline’s life. Murder brightens up what could otherwise be a terribly dull existence. First, a well-connected seductress is poisoned at the roulette table, then the Riviera’s preeminent villa architect slips off the bluffs into the turquoise Mediterranean Sea idling below.As the bodies mount, the local police suspect someone is boosting their way up the social ladder through nefarious means.Lady Caroline has a different idea. Always up for a good scavenger hunt, she can’t resist following the trail of clues to the killer.",
