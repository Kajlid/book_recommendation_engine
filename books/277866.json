  "description": "A man pulls back from the brink of suicide when his application to buy a gun with which to shoot himself is delayed. Instead of throwing his life away, he decides to spend all his time and effort disposing of those who he feels deserve to die. With a renewed zest for living, he embarks on a joyful killing spree, having found the true purpose of his existence.\"Like all great writers, Selby does not answer questions. He only raises them to a pitch so intense that only a scream or a prayer can stop the pain.\"â€”San Francisco Chronicle",
