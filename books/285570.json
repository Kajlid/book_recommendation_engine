  "description": "Nikki Lowe's \"summer of nothing\" gets shaken up when she meets the handsome and intelligent Cory Thomas.Nikki, a biology teacher and staunch evolutionist, plans on a quiet and relaxing summer at home in Vicksburg, Mississippi, when she meets Cory. He's well-spoken, intelligent, works as a computer programmer, drinks wine, and quotes poetry. And when she discovers he's a fundamentalist, Nikki won't let \"religious stuff\" get in the way of their relationship, and keeps her beliefs to herself.So when Cory asks Nikki to come serve as a counselor at a girls' Christian summer camp, Nikki readily agrees. Her vision of getting paid to hike and hang out with Cory is too good to turn down. She says \"yes\" to posing as a good Christian woman for a few weeks with a bunch of giggly teen girls.But Nikki's act of deception grows in the shadows of secrecy, and soon she's swept up in a drama and violence she never dreamed of. Will she find her way back to her truth? And will she be able to mend the relationships she's broken in the process?",
