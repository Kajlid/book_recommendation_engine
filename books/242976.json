  "description": "She’s the only one who’s ever driven him to his knees…Blasphemy founder and hedge fund manager Hale O’Keeffe is spiraling. Nothing in his life makes sense anymore—and nothing gives him pleasure, either. Not his work, not his club, and not domination. Feeling like a fraud, he turns to an old friend for help—and receives an offer he’s surprisingly tempted to take.Real estate investor Alina Lane likes to switch things up—houses, investments, and partners, too. She enjoys commanding and being commanded. But not everyone likes to switch, so she’s stunned when sexy, brooding, crush-from-afar Hale attends one of her private parties and reveals he needs something more, something different. Something she’s always fantasized about but never thought he’d accept.Soon, one scorching night turns into many, and Hale realizes he’s found everything he’s been searching for. But Alina won’t be anyone’s dirty little secret, forcing Hale to decide if he’s brave enough to admit to the other Masters of Blasphemy that he craves serving her as much as dominating her.",
