  "description": "This is just my story. The story of my life so far, with all the horrible details. I survived, and you did too. If you've read this far, I urge you to read more. Maybe my story will help you get on the path to healing. Maybe my story will help you give yourself PERMISSION to heal. The only one that can take that first step is you. This story is my path. My fist step and then some. I wrote this initially as a method of self healing, and then it morphed into something that I felt led to share. My life has not been peaches and roses, so if you're squeamish, here's your heads up. This is just me, talking with you, being honest, and for once, not holding anything back.",
