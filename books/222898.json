Tawny was everything any man wanted, and he wanted her. So much so that it almost scared him. He couldn’t imagine himself with anyone but her. Could he possibly lure her to leave the life she’d known to try a traditional relationship rather than an arranged business agreement?Tawny hadn’t thought much about Auggie Gibson until he disturbed her brunch and propositioned her to consider a traditional dating relationship with him instead of one of convenience and sex. She quickly learned Auggie was everything she ever wanted in a man. Could she have a relationship other than what she’d always known?",
