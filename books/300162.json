  "title": "China Virus: How Justin Trudeau's Pro-Communist Ideology Is Putting Canadians in Danger",
  "description": "Why did Justin Trudeau wait so long to restrict flights from China? Why did his top health bureaucrat tell us not to wear face masks? Why is there a loophole in Canada's quarantine laws for illegal border-crossers at Roxham Road? Why did the Liberals gather up Canada’s medical equipment and ship it to China as a gift? And why on Earth did Trudeau give $838,000 to the Wuhan Virology Institute? None of these strange facts makes sense — until you understand that the true virus threatening our country is Trudeau’s life-long infatuation with the Communist Party of China, the country whose “basic dictatorship” Trudeau admires. China Virus documents the comedy of errors that allowed the coronavirus to spread through our communities. But it also reports, in meticulous detail, the Trudeau family's obsession with China that goes back to Pierre Trudeau’s support for that Communist dictatorship. And China Virus warns that Trudeau — like his Chinese role models — is already trying to take advantage of the pandemic to seize further control in Canada, limiting Parliament, restricting the media, and continuing the globalist agenda that got us into this trouble in the first place.",
