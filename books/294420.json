  "title": "Plant Trees, Carry Sheep: A Woman's Spiritual Journey Among the Sufis of Scotland",
  "description": "Sarah flees an unfulfilling life in Montana to volunteer at a spiritual retreat in Scotland. But Braemar House seems more religious cult than safe haven. Not only is she expected to plant thousands of trees, look after flocks of poultry, and chase truant sheep, there are toilets to clean, dishes to wash, and firewood to chop. Can Sarah navigate contrasting spiritual beliefs under sometimes maddening circumstances to find her heart's longing? God, help her!",
