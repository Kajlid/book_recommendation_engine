  "description": "As evocative and moving as Charles de Lints Newford books, with the youthful protagonists and exciting action of Mercedes Lackeys fantasies, Thirteen Orphans makes our world today as excitingly strange and unfamiliar as any fantasy realm . . .and grants readers a glimpse of a fantasy world founded by ancient Chinese lore and magic.As far as college freshman Brenda Morris knows, there is only one Earth and magic exists only in fairy tales.Brenda is wrong.A father-daughter weekend turns into a nightmare when Brendas father is magically attacked before her eyes. Brenda soon learns that her ancestors once lived in world of smoke and shadows, of magic and secrets.When that worlds Emperor was overthrown, the Thirteen Orphans fled to our earth and hid their magic system in the game of mah-jong. Each Orphan represents an animal from the Chinese Zodiac. Brendas father is the Rat. And her polished, former child-star aunt, Pearlâ€”that eminent lady is the Tiger.Only a handful of Orphans remain to stand against their enemies. The Tiger, the Rooster, the Dog, the Rabbit . . . and Brenda Morris. Not quite the Rat, but not quite human either.",
