Colin Winters was only supposed to be a one-night impulsive indulgence.  Instead, the easy connection between us became an addiction. Colin believed in me when no one else ever had. He encouraged me to take risks and chase my most ambitious dreams. Finally, I was taking charge of my life. Then, two blue lines change everything... ColinThe adventure tour was supposed to be a team bonding experience. All it took was one look at Piper Rigby, the beautiful, blonde tour guide, and I was completely distracted. Her passion for life and photography was inspiring. Yet, sadly, no one had ever encouraged her to follow her dreams. I wanted to be the guy who did. Being around her was intoxicating. She didn't care about my major league aspirations or the money that went along with it. In fact, Piper didn't want anything from me. Which is one of the many reasons I wanted to give her everything. We agreed to one night together, but it just wasn't enough. One way or another, I'm determined to make her see we belong together. Even if that means taking a timeout in the friend zone for a while...Sizzling romance comes to one small town in Impulsive Love, the latest swoon-worthy read by author Lea Coll!",
