Another small act of defiance against this narrowing world' - Observer'His language sings...I should not be surprised if Hemon wins the Nobel Prize at some point' - Giles Foden. In Aleksandar Hemon's electrifying first book, The Question of Bruno\" Jozef Pronek left Sarajevo to visit Chicago in 1992, just in time to watch war break out at home on TV. Unable to return, he began to make his way in a foreign land and his adventures were unforgettable. Now Pronek, the accidental nomad, gets his own book, and startles us into yet more exhilarating ways of seeing the world anew. 'If the plot is mercury, quick and elusive, sentence by sentence and word for word, Aleksandar Hemon's writing is gold' - Times Literary Supplement'Downbeat but also hilarious, while the writing itself is astonishing' - Time Out 'Hemon can't write a boring sentence, and the English language is the richer for it'- New York Times 'Sheer exuberance, generosity and engagement with life' - Sunday Times",
