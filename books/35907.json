  "description": "Mahmoud Darwish is one of the greatest poets of our time. In his poetry Palestine becomes the map of the human soul.— Elias KhouryThe book tugs at the reader’s heart page after page, poem after poem, line after line, you cannot remain apathetic for a moment…— Haaretz At once an intimate autobiography and a collective memory of the Palestinian people, Darwish’s intertwined poems are collective cries, songs, and glimpses of the human condition. Why Did You Leave the Horse Alone? is a poetry of myth and history, of exile and suspended time, of an identity bound to his displaced people and to the rich Arabic language. Darwish’s poems – specific and symbolic, simple and profound – are historical glimpses, existential queries, chants of pain and injustice of a people separated from their land.",
