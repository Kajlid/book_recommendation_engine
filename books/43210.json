  "title": "The Matrix of Evil",
  "description": "Set against a world in turmoil, The Matrix of Evil portrays the plight of five individuals whose bond of friendship is challenged by revolution, war, and the corruption of power. It is a journey filled with political intrigue, gritty battlefields, raw sensuality, and even grotesque human mutations as the search for truth attempts to solve the mystery behind sinister forces that appear beyond control. Though told in a parallel world of the 1930s, The Matrix of Evil is a timeless epic dealing with love and hate, heroism and treachery, power and morality. It is also a book about books-and the influence of their ideas. The Matrix of Evil provides insight to those who seek to understand the web of conspiracies spun by the power masters of the world.",
