In Just Beyond Tomorrow, Jasmine's strong-willed son, Patrick Leslie, continues Skye's Legacy when he takes a wife who wants no husband. . .Just Beyond TomorrowWith his father dead and his mother in France, Patrick Leslie, Duke of Glenkirk, discovers the obligations of the estate and its people are now his alone. But during a day of hunting, a chance meeting ensures that he will not be alone much longer, for to obtain the deserted castle and lands adjoining his, Patrick must agree to take something else, as well--a bride.Flanna Brodie, heiress to Brae, is as vibrant and beautiful as the Scottish countryside, and just as wild. She wants no man--only her freedom. But the passions Patrick awakens in her run deeper than those of the flesh. The independent Flanna is determined to champion the royal Stuarts' cause, and restore Charles II to his throne despite her husband's objections. Patrick knows the dangers of such political intrigues; that the Stuarts have always brought misfortune to the Leslies of Glenkirk, and that a roguish king will ask far more of the na√Øve duchess than a simple vow of fealty--forcing Patrick and Flanna to choose between the threat of wounded pride, and the promise of a lasting love both secretly yearn for. . .",
