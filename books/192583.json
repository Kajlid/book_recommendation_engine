Now, it's up to Anson to keep Cass safe from a murderous gang dead-set against a divorce going forward.

About the Author  Olivia Dane isn't sure if what she writes is properly called romantic suspense, or erotic thrillers, or military romance, or adventure romances, or what. To be honest, she isn't really concerned about labels. She writes stories about people with guns, and strong wills, who do what they have to and discover love in the process.",
