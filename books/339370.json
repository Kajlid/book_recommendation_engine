  "title": "Kelroy: A Novel",
  "description": "The Early American Women Writers series offers rare works of fiction by eighteenth- and nineteenth century women, each reprinted in its entirety, each introduced by Cathy N. Davidson, who places it in an historical and literary perspective. Ranging from serious cautionary tales about moral corruption to amusing and trenchant social satire, these novels provide today's reader with a unique window into the earliest American popular fiction and way of life.Set in Philadelphia, elroy focuses on the limited options for women in early nineteenth century America. The plot revolves around the dilemma of Mrs. Hamilton, who is suddenly left penniless by the unexpected death of her wealthy husband. Not willing to live in poverty, Mrs. Hamilton sees as her only available recourse her two unmarried daughters. As the daughters make the rounds of the marriage market and suffer the machinations of their mother, Kelroy exposes the contradictions of class interest and the profound limitations women suffered in the political and social economies of the early Republican years.This is the first time Rebecca Rush's novel has been available since the printing of the original, single edition in 1812. With an illuminating introduction by Dana D. Nelson, this exceptional novel is certain to shed new light on the role of women, as well as the state of fiction, in early America.",
