Like any sane person, she always put the dreams down to an overactive imagination coupled with a higher than average libido.One night, however, instead of their usual erotic encounters, she finds him in her dream, chained to a wall and screaming in pain. Not only that, but she thinks she recognises the building he's being held captive in as one that's just a few streets away.Awaking with an irrepressible need to save her fantasy lover, Lydia decides to humour her dream self and head on over to where she thinks he's imprisoned.What unfolds is beyond even her wildest imaginings as she's sucked into a dangerous and deadly world she never knew existed ... and it turns out that the man who inhabits her darkest fantasies isn't the only one that needs releasing.18+ (adult scenes and very strong language)Paranormal fantasyNovella length at over 34,000 wordsFirst book in a seriesWritten in British English",
