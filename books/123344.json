  "description": "\"Whether they spot themselves in Charlie or Lola, young ones will enjoy this exuberant, hilarious spin on a bedtime story.\" —  BooklistNight owl Lola likes to stay up coloring and scribbling and wriggling and bouncing and chattering. Lola never gets tired. How can big brother Charlie convince her it's time for bed? Heralded by the  Washington Post  as \"a delightful new voice in children's books,\" author-illustrator Lauren Child splashes her offbeat sense of humor and unique artwork all over this bedtime story. Laugh out loud at Lola's imaginative antics, but save a cheer for kind, patient Charlie, the big brother we'd all love to have.",
