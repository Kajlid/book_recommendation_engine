  "description": "From the Back CoverA country-boy-turned-country-doctor goes on house calls among the Amish of eastern Ohio in this warm collection of true-life tales.Alert to his patients' preferences to have their babies born close to home, and their illnesses and injuries treated in a home-like atmosphere, Dr. Elton Lehman also created a treatment and birthing center in the hills of Wayne County, Ohio. From these years of medical technology meeting rural values come these unforgettable stories: - Joe brings his dismembered fingers to the office in a coffee can filled with kerosene; - Dozens of babies are born with Dr. Lehman's help; Katie's little boy is his first at-home birth; - Three-year-old Davy rallies to overcome a life-threatening illness at birth, only to be crushed under a tractor wheel;- Barb, the Amish leader's wife, joins Doc Lehman in an unusual partnership, setting aside a bedroom in her own home as an alternative \"delivery\" room.Writer Hoover captures in sometimes local vernacular the joys and dilemmas of a family practitioner among a rural and predominantly-Amish community.",
