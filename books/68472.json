  "description": "Cate Evans holds her father’s life in her hands—literally. Death came for John Evans but dropped the token—a star—required in order to take him. Now Cate has the star, and along with that a choice no fourteen-year-old should have to make.Cate’s father remains alive, and unaware of how close he came to dying. Having the star however, has given Cate a gift—or a curse, it’s hard to tell. She can see and talk to the recently deceased who live inside a type of borderland. And the borderland is an interesting place to a girl who keeps an open mind. One downside is Death, who haunts Cate’s every move. All she has to do is give the star to her father and Death will take him and leave her alone.She’s not going to do that.Cate can keep her ailing father alive indefinitely, or pass the star to him and say good-bye. Or is there another way—is it murder if she passes it to someone who has nothing to live for?GIRL THE REAPER is the extraordinary dilemma of an ordinary girl who learns that death can sometimes be a beginning instead of just an end.",
