Billy Harper is trying to pick up the pieces of his shattered life when he rents a cottage on the property of Chuck and Beth Whitcomb in New Canaan, Connecticut. He's had everything that matters stolen from him, leaving his heart numb. But when he meets the Whitcomb's four-year-old daughter, Carolyn, she teaches him what it is to live again, and his heart begins to thaw.  But a series of ominous incidents make it apparent that there is something very wrong with Carolyn Whitcomb. It escalates to an incident so surreal that Billy wonders if she might be an alien, or maybe she truly is his angel. But when a rogue military organization called Operation Anesthesia learns of Carolyn's \"gifts,\" Billy must risk everything to save the life of the little girl who helped him to live again.  Derek Ciccone is an avid fiction writer who has written eight novels. Painlessis the first one to be published. Derek grew up in Connecticut and attended Arizona State University, where he graduated with a degree in Political Science.
