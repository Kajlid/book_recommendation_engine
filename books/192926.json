  "description": "It was a time when nobody called. Early evening, the hottest August in living memory.A frightened girl bangs on a door. A man answers. From the moment he invites her in, his world will never be the same again.She tells him about her family, and their strange life in the show home of an abandoned housing estate. The long, blistering days spent sunbathing; the airless nights filled with inexplicable noises; the words that appear on the windows, written in dust.Where is her family now? Is she telling the truth? Can the man be trusted? Beautiful and disturbing, her story – retold in his words – reaches towards those frayed edges of reality where each of us, if only once, glimpses something nobody will ever explain.",
