  "title": "Contagious",
  "description": "In a genre all its own, Fluorescence fills a niche between audacious teen romance, urban fantasy and sci-fi.  The fire has been started and things have changed for the Fluorescent Ones. A massive turn of events has thrust Brian's life into chaos. The Saviors had a terrible secret in store, and now he and the rest of the group must make decisions that could impact their future forever. Contagious is narrated by Brian, but each volume in the Fluorescence series is narrated by a different character. This drives the story forward in a new and exciting way. Fluorescence evolves from a quiet beginning into a gritty and unabashed look at real-life limitations and struggles these teenagers face while coping with a life-changing secret.",
