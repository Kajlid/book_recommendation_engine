  "description": "Ten years after the 1715 Jacobite uprising, General Wade came to the Highlands with the mission to pacify the clans and uphold the law. On the command of King George I, he raised six independent Highland Companies, which were known as the \"Black Watch\" or \"Reicudan Dhu\". Within half a century of its inception, the regiment had become well-known and respected for its bravery and skill at arms, and there were many stories of their valiant efforts in battle. Legends of the Black Watch, first published in 1859, recounts such stories vividly. The tales within this book show the bravery, leadership, and martial skill with which the soldiers and officers of the Black Watch faced their foes with musket and broadsword, as they fought throughout Europe and North America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The stories serve not only as a record of the legends of the regiment, but also show the mindset and beliefs of the Scottish people during this time period. The descriptions of battles and individual armed encounters will be of interest to students of European martial arts and historical fencing methods, and will be delightful to readers who seek riveting action scenes!
