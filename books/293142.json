  "description": "Hey, you!Yeah, you.Are you listening?I have a story to tell you but it’s not your average fairy tale.My story?It’s wrought with violence.Strewn with blood.Dominated by desire.My stepmother, the evil queen, hates me. She wants me dead but hasn’t killed me yet. At her insistence, a never ending line of repugnant suitors tries for my hand, but when I decline each and every one of them, the evil queen punishes me...severely.She will stop at nothing until I’m sold or dead.As she grows insane with power and my death seems imminent, something unexpected happens.I see a ‘lurker.’ They come to me in my dreams, touch me, taste me. Even though I’ve never met them outside of my mind, I begin to crave them.Stories have been passed down in the town of Riverwood about creatures of legend, kings given the power to wield the seven deadly sins.They tell me they want me, they claim that I belong to them.As I fall deeper into sin, they become mine as much as I am theirs.What will happen if I submit to their desires? Will I transform into the very weapon I seek, harnessing their power for my own or will I find myself lost in their seduction?The evil queen might kill me first. But I’ve made a vow to my people; to take back my stolen throne while bathing in her blood.Read my story and find out what happens...if you dare.SEVEN SINS OF SNOW is a full-length stand-alone, dark, PNR, RH retelling of “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.” Nothing inside these pages is appropriate for a children's story.
