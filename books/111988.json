When the school Rebel Queen Renee Hammond needs a knight, Ella dumps the idea of glass slippers and takes up the challenge.

A story where the girl might get the girl, but most of all, the girl gets herself.Newcomer Shari McNally creates an engaging world where a young woman finds she must steal her own story or others will write it for her.",
