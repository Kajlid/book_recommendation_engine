  "description": "After being arrested for stealing a Christmas tree, seventeen-year-old Joseph has no choice but to volunteer for his church as a missionary. Struggling with heartbreak over his ex-boyfriend and with grief for his dead mother, Joseph tries to find comfort and friendship in his homophobic mission partner, Brian. Journeying through the south, the two missionaries don't exactly act as good Christian boys are supposed to - and in the end, they learn more about themselves than they ever intended.http://www.amazon.com/Missionaries-eb...",
