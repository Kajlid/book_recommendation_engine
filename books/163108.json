  "description": "From the lights of the field, to the curve in the road, one shattered breath leaves friendships and relationships forever altered.  Landon Hayes, an all-star wide receiver, is spiraling out of control after one fateful night that forever changed him. He has one light left in his life but he doesn't believe he deserves it.  Macy Thomas, a college sweetheart, is trying to hold on to the boy who stole her heart. She's stuck on the sidelines watching as he throws his life away. The guilt is forever pulling him into the darkness threatening to take her with it.  When the heartbreaking reality sets in, can they find their light or is the past to dark to help them find their way?    Author's note: Be sure to check out Forever Dark by Chelsea Landon for Cash and Madison's story.  You will see that both stories follow the exact same time frame and include the same group of friends but while you read something in Forever Light you will see some extra interaction in Forever Dark. We don't want our readers to think they are getting the same story twice because they aren't.",
