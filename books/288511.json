  "description": "George C. Wolfe's iconic play on the black experience of the 1980s. The Colored Museum has electrified, discomforted, and delighted audiences of all colors, redefining our ideas of what it means to be black in contemporary America. Its eleven \"exhibits\" undermine black stereotypes old and new, and return to the facts of what being black means. \" Mr. Wolfe is the kind of satirist who takes no prisoners. The shackles of the past have been defied by Mr. Wolfe's fearless humor, and it's a most liberating revolt!\" - Frank Rich, The New York Times; \"Brings forth a bold new voice that is bound to shake up blacks and whites with separate-but-equal impartiality. True satire.\" - Jack Kroll, Newsweek.",
