  "description": "Let me tell you a little-known secret. Being turned into a vampire doesn’t necessarily guarantee freedom from fear or danger. All of that silly happy-ever-after gibberish about immortality isn’t all it’s cracked up to be either. And furthermore, living forever in a state of bliss and contentedness is actually a blatant lie. I wish someone had told me. Elizabeth Amarande Rose Bertrand’s first day as a vampire was definitely not what she’d expected, what with nearly losing her beloved twin sister. And after a short reprieve and a warm welcome to Ravenswynd, her new home in England, it gets even worse. Her immortal life takes on a whole new twist and she finds herself living in a perpetual state of fear. Faced with unsettling rumors and revelations, her dreams become real-life nightmares. Suddenly finding herself up to her neck in a mind-bending abduction, Elizabeth believes that death itself would be better than being bound to someone she despises - bound by ancient law - for all eternity. The old saying is only too true: There actually are fates worse than death - even when you’re a vampire. And once again…there will be blood. (This is Book Two in the Ravenswynd Series)",
