  "description": "Lacey Underhill has what her Dutch grandmother refers to as luxe problemen: luxury problems. But Lacey's problems are very real and they are exactly two: her breasts. Twelve years old and in eighth grade, Lacey has developed faster than everyone else around her. The other girls -- even her own best friend -- are jealous, and boys won't stop teasing her.  Then Chad, a high school boy, starts talking to her at the mall, assuming she's older, and for the first time Lacey sees a positive side to her appearance. She keeps the flirtation -- and the lie -- going. Meanwhile, a childhood guy pal resurfaces and Lacey does all she can to hide her \"developments\" from him. Suddenly in every part of her life Lacey's torn between trying to look older and trying to look younger, trying to grow up and trying hard not to. How long will Lacey stay stuck in between?",
