  "description": "BOOK ONE in the CROSS ACADEMY SERIESAN EPIC CHRISTIAN FANTASY The Fire Tribe has stood the test of time. When the spiritual realm cracked open and demons crawled forth in hordes, the Children of the Sun were not afraid. They had a blessing from God, power in its finest form. And if their blessing failed, they had great structures surrounding the village--keeping the demons out but locking the people in.The Fire Tribe took pride in their power and in their protection. Nothing could harm them. For what could burn a flame? Nothing could threaten them. For what could penetrate their mighty Walls?And then the Walls crumbled. Demons entered the village. And for the first time in 700 years, the Fire Tribe was in danger. Thankfully, Hunters of the Cross arrived just in time.Cross Academy trains those with exceptional blessings. Hunters of the Cross are the legends of old, fighting demons and darklings to keep the Four Regions safe. When Fox Fire's village is destroyed, the Cross goes to investigate.What they learn threatens to tip the balance of the Great Demon War ... in favor of the demons.BOOK I in the Cross Academy Epic Christian Fantasy SeriesSERIES ORDERCross AcademyThe Howler's CryThe Nine Births of Carnage (coming 2022)The Testament Relics (coming 2023)Cross Book V (coming 2023)Other Books by Valicity PatchesThe 'I' WordI AM MAN (Christian science fiction series)I AM MANI AM LOSTI AM BROKENI AM FREEI AM COMPLETEWithered Rose (Christian mafia romance trilogy)Withered RoseClipping ThornsStarting OverFractured Diamond (Standalone Christian Billionaire Romance)",
