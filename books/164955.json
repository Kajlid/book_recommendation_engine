  "title": "Boys & Murderers: Collected Short Fiction",
  "description": "In [the] minor arena of sexual horror, Ungar is unsurpassable.â€“ The Chicago ReviewBoys & Murderers is the first complete collection of novellas and stories in English from Hermann Ungar, author of the highly-acclaimed novel The Maimed. A writer of unique talent whose life was prematurely ended by illness, he was much admired by Thomas Mann, who prefaces this volume, and known as the \"Moravian Dostoevsky\" for his analysis of the human psyche. In fiction that is often grotesque and comical, Ungar explores the depravities of the heart and delusions of the mind. Taking Prague as well as his hometown of Boskovice for his settings, he can be located in that illustrious tradition of Prague German Jewish writers who came to prominence in the waning days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Forgotten for decades, Ungar's work has experienced a renaissance over the past years with translations appearing in a number of languages and new editions appearing in German, which has allowed him to take his place among the greats of 20th-century European literature.",
