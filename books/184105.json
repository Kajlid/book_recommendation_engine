  "description": "His partner is the desperado, Tuco, who turns vengeance into a sadistic contest of endurance.His adversary is the ruthless Sentenza, a killer who long ago lost count of the lives he has cut down.His goal is a $200,000 treasure in stolen Army gold for which many have died and more will be killed.His secret is a dead man's final breath. More than once it has saved his life, and it will lead him to the treasure--if he can keep alive long enough to reach it.His trail is a path of blood cutting across the hell that the Civil War had brought to the southwest.His reward--death, probably, from any one of a hundred enemies; betrayal, possibly, from the unpredictable Tuco; defeat, perhaps, blazing from Sentenza's custom-made pistol... or the gold that two armies and a legion of dead men have failed to reclaim!To the Man With No Name, the odds seemed almost favorable!",
