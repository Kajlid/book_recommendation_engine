  "description": "The things I've lost could shatter any man.Send him on a downward spiral.I would've punched my own ticket if it weren't for the Satan's Knights. Instead, I became the VP of the Knightdale Charter.A man can't drown in his misery when he's got responsibilities. So I look for things to dull the pain.Sex. Drugs. Whatever. When you've been to hell and back, the only time worth having is a good one. My little Birdie knows this self-destructive path, too. That's why I can't stay away from her.The highs are higher when you don't fly alone.But I'm not the only ghost in her life, and her past isn't letting her go. I thought my club was the only thing left for me to love.It turns out I was wrong.",
