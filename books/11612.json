  "title": "The Magna Carta",
  "description": "Magna Carta Libertatum (Medieval Latin for \"Great Charter of Freedoms\"), commonly called Magna Carta (also Magna Charta; \"Great Charter\"), is a royal charter of rights agreed to by King John of England at Runnymede, near Windsor, on 15 June 1215. First drafted by Archbishop of Canterbury Stephen Langton to make peace between the unpopular king and a group of rebel barons, it promised the protection of church rights, protection for the barons from illegal imprisonment, access to swift justice, and limitations on feudal payments to the Crown, to be implemented through a council of 25 barons. Neither side stood behind their commitments, and the charter was annulled by Pope Innocent III, leading to the First Barons' War.",
