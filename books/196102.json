  "description": "For Peter, it was just another day of waking up to his mother yelling from the small kitchen in the small house they shared. The image he saw in the bathroom mirror that morning would change everything. Follow Peter in this first book of his journeys. Written for Latin students who read at the intermediate-low to mid level, this fantasy of magic and intrigue is just over 4600 words in length and is based on a vocabulary of 330 unique Latin words (not including different inflections of the same word). The verbs are limited entirely to the 50 Most Important Verbs list developed by Latin teachers on the Latin Best Practices Listserv.",
