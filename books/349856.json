  "description": "Ren Edwards has made a successful career out of playing the well-to-do customer, spending company cash and demanding flawless service from high-end retailers. But underneath all those fabulous perks, she's just a single Scottsdale girl who can't live without classic books, a fast car, and her best friend, Mo. Ren's life seems just about perfect until she meets Adan, an impossibly sexy Golf Pro Shop manager during one of her staged customer disputes. They fall helplessly for one another, with just one tiny Adan thinks she's happily married. Finding herself in a hilarious ruse far outside her comfort zone, Ren tries to untangle herself from her little white lie or risks losing the biggest perk of her life.",
