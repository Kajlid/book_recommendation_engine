  "title": "Poirot: The Complete Battles of Hastings, Vol. 2",
  "description": "A brand new Agatha Christie omnibus, featuring four of the eight novels in which Captain Arthur Hastings appears alongside the world-renowned detective, Hercule Poirot: Lord Edgware Dies, The ABC Murders, Dumb Witness and Curtain. Captain Arthur Hastings is well-known as Poirot's trusty sidekick, the perfect foil for the great detective and his 'little grey cells'. Yet although Agatha Christie wrote 33 novels about her famous detective, only eight of them actually feature Captain Hastings. Considered by many to be some of the very best Christie stories, the distinctive Hastings novels are distinguished by being recounted in the first person, just as Dr Watson wrote for Holmes. This omnibus volume brings together the last four Poirot and Hastings novels, including Lord Edgware Dies, The ABC Murders, Dumb Witness and, returning Poirot to the scene of his first novel for his very last case, Curtain.",
