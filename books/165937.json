When the man she grew up thinking was her father realizes she isn't his daughter, he devises a plan to use her existence to his advantage in a way that will get her out from under his roof.  When her situation goes from bad to worse, Annora escapes but is badly injured in the process. Luckily, Elias Reve comes to her rescue while on his way to Wolf's Point and the daughter he lost years ago. With nowhere else to go and nobody to turn to, Annora joins him on his journey and ends up running smack-dab into the arms of her mate.  Parker Tate knows Annora is his the moment he lays eyes on her. When he manages to mate and mark her within hours of when they meet, he considers himself lucky. Then the trouble nipping at Annora's heels finds her and Parker realizes the path to claiming his mate won't be as easy as he thought - especially not with the bears involved.
