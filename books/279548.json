  "description": "He was King of Arcadia Prep until she came for his throne…ARIANNAWe moved around a lot, too much.The shine of my highly respected and decorated military dad’s badge wore off after I became heavy baggage.I was the new girl thirteen times in two years and every time I had to tape up another box I grew more resentful. Forced to forget everyone I fell in love with, laughed with and bonded with.For a certain price you could unburden yourself from your hormonal teen at Arcadia Prep too.I’m reckless.I’m impatient.Purple hair, a don’t care attitude and my Doc Martins all screamed leave me alone, fending off any new relationships.I vowed to keep my heart safe this time, locking it away right under my anger but he knew exactly where I hid the spare key – in his mysterious eyes the minute ours locked.BOLTONI was stuck – the essence of a God in some kind of limbo of high school.I was meant for more than this.Being king here meant nothing.Arcadia Prep wasn’t for the weak. The expectations, the pressure, the standards, the success and privilege smug on everyone’s face wasn’t everyone’s cup of tea.I thrived in chaos.I’m fearless.I’m ruthless.The new girl was not my cup of tea.She stomped her doc martins all over my tradition, rules and my reign.We all have secrets. Mine were paper weighted down by my heavy crown.Her violet eyes and her abrupt attitude spewed sass all over my black on black. She didn’t faze me until I realized she was after my crown…",
