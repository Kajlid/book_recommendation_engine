  "title": "Takeover: The Return of the Imperial Presidency and the Subversion of American Democracy",
  "description": "Hailed by liberals and conservatives alike for its revelation of an emerging threat to the checks and balances devised by our Founding Fathers, Takeover is a searing investigation into how a group of true believers, led by Dick Cheney, has seized vast powers for the presidency – and permanently altered the constitutional balance of American democracy.Takeover unveils the machinations behind the headlines, explaining the links between warrantless wiretapping and recent Supreme Court nominees, between the unprecedented politicization of the Justice Department and the torture debate, between the White House’s use of “signing statements” and its efforts to impose greater control over JAG lawyers. For anyone who cares about America’s past, present, and future, Takeover is essential reading.",
