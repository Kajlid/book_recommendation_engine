  "description": "For my birthday, I get the worst gift a bride.My kind lives in the deepest woods of Alia Terra. The humans call us forest giants, but we call ourselves grendels, after our ancestor. We live in small communities, and we'd be happy to have nothing to do with humans, except we need... their females. My brothers are all married, and now it is my turn. I refuse to do it. Human females are tiny, and fragile, and need too much care... I'd rather end up selfish and alone. My brothers say a bride would change me, but I beg to differ. They leave me alone. Until...She comes out of my birthday cake. A gorgeous little thing, with hair like the sun and eyes like the sea, with a body so delicate that I'm afraid to even breathe in her direction. And I know it's their doing! How did they get my blood to send to the Temple? It doesn't matter. I have a bigger problem now.What do I do with her?!The Temple, a matchmaking service for monsters, shifters, and aliens, is open for service. Arranged Monster Mates is a series of novellas written by your favorite paranormal and sci-fi romance Eden Ember, Layla Fae, and Cara Wylde. Each of these steamy stories has it a possessive male, a heroine ready to sacrifice herself to the beast, plenty of spice, and a happily ever after to curl your toes!",
