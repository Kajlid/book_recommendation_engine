  "title": "In Calamity's Wake",
  "description": "Set in the badlands of the North American west in the late 1800s, In Calamity’ s Wake tells the story of orphaned Miette’ s quest to find her mother, the notorious Calamity Jane.Miette is reluctant to meet the woman who abandoned her- whom she knows only as an infamous soldier, drinker and exhibition shooter- but she sets out nonetheless across a landscape peopled with madwomen, thieves, minstrels and ghosts, many of whom add a thread to the story of her famous mother.Interspersed with Miette’ s story are the stories of Jane as told in legend, history books, dime store novels and by the woman herself. As Miette makes her way to Deadwood, South Dakota, history and myth collide to create a picture of a remarkable woman who shattered the expectations of her time, and a daughter who must confront the truth of her past. As in Billy the Kid or HBO’ s Deadwood, In Calamity’ s Wake blends fiction with real conversations and events to transport us, through vividly crafted atmosphere and seductive storytelling, to a side of the Wild West we’ ve never seen before.",
