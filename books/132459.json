  "description": "We all have secrets. But at a certain point, they become too big to keep. If you asked Ruby, she'd tell you she's happy with her life. She's tough and independent and doesn't depend on anyone else. The road that has led her here has not been easy, and she's blocked a lot of it from her memory. But things aren't as rosy as she would have everyone believe, and the road ahead of her is filled not only with gangs, drugs, and depression, but other challenges that Ruby hasn't even imagined.Winner of \"In The Margins\" Top Ten Best Books for Teens Award 2015. Awarded to relevant books for our communities that validate, illuminate and humanize those living in the margins.",
