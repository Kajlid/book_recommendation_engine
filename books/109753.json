  "title": "Our Cosmonauts Are Dying",
  "description": "When astrophysicist Jens Ottosson discovers the asteroid Hygiea on a collision course with Earth, he should be hailed as a hero, as one of few people who can help divert disaster. Yet as governments and space agencies implore the world to stay calm and work together, the media increasingly clamours for blind faith and personal favours. Jens finds himself trapped between his work, a family which begs him to return to the faith, and a media which ostracises him for his rationality. Hygiea looms close and the best laid plans fray at the seams - if humanity can't get its act together, fast, it won't only be the cosmonauts who are dying: it will mean the extinction of life on Earth.",
