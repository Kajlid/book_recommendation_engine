  "title": "A Barista That Doesn't Drink Coffee: A Spicy Friends to Lovers Summer Romance",
  "description": "The thing about romance is, that it's all in the timing. But timing is a bitch.Jillian has no time or patience for a great love story. She's spent too many years winning back control over her own life. With everything she's ever wanted finally within her reach, she refuses to be distracted and swept away into another man's plans. No, she's quite content with the book boyfriends waiting for her each night between the pages of her favorite novels. That is until her first day as the world's worst barista. The hot older man that works upstairs is enough to have her quickly adjusting her plans. She may not have the time for an epic romance, but a hot summer in this man's bed? Yes please. Cordell knows that he wants a wife and a family one day, but losing himself in his work has always been easier than taking the risks that come with falling in love. That is until his usual barista is replaced with a tiny little brunette with a foul mouth, a quick wit, and an adorable mean streak that has him dreaming up new ways to piss her off. She'd be perfect for him, if only she were ten years older. Women in their twenties want wild adventures, not old men closing in on forty that can no longer take caffeine after dinner.They may not be able to offer one another what the other wants, but staying away from each other just isn't an option. So Cord and Jilly decide on the only rational course of action, they decide to be 'just friends'. And everyone knows that 'let's just be friends' is an absolutely fool-proof plan.",
