  "description": "Review by Mamta Madhaven for Readers Favorite The book deals with difficult situations that families face in their lives and the story is also about hope and reconciliation. The messages conveyed are useful to all readers, young and old alike, and strike a chord within them. The characters and situations are relatable and palpable, and the fluidity in writing gives the story a good pace and movement. The author brings the Christmas season to life beautifully and the story also highlights the bond shared between a mother and her daughters, and how they stand by each other and support each other during their difficult times.Awarded Five Stars by Readers Favorite",
