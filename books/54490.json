  "description": "\"Whether you view your one-woman m√©nage as Doom or Adventure, you need a plan, if you are going to make the best of it.\"Marjorie Hillis provides no-nonsense advice in this archly funny, gently prescriptive manifesto for single women. Though it was 1936 when the Vogue editor first shared her wisdom with her fellow singletons, the tome has been passed lovingly through the generations, and is even more apt today than when it was first published. Hillis, a true bon vivant, was sick and tired of hearing single women carping about their living arrangements and lonely lives; this book is her invaluable wake-up call for single women to take control and enjoy their circumstances. Hillis takes readers through the fundamentals of living alone, including the importance of creating a hospitable environment at home, cultivating hobbies that keep her there (\"for no woman can accept an invitation every night without coming to grief\"), the question of whether single ladies may entertain men at home (the answer may surprise you!), and many more. Who can resist a book with chapters such as \"A Lady and Her Liquor,\" \"Pleasures of a Single Bed,\" and \"Solitary Refinement?\" A priceless gem from a more genteel age.",
