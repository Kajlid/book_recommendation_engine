  "title": "In the Warsaw Ghetto",
  "description": "Ala Silberman is training to be a dancer when the Germans invade Warsaw. Together with almost half a million other Jews, Ala and her family are forced into the ghetto, where she struggles with feelings of guilt at her comparative privileged circumstances. Then Ala’s enigmatic teacher forms a dance company with the intention of putting on a performance for the ghetto’s residents. Max Silberman, Ala’s uncle, is a bachelor, who still carries the flame for the girl he knew at university. She married someone else and he hasn’t seen her for over a decade. When he meets her in the ghetto and discovers she and her two children have been abandoned by her Catholic husband all his dormant hopes are incongruously revived amidst the squalor and destitution surrounding him. In the Warsaw Ghetto tells the deeply moving story of Ala and Max’s struggle to preserve their aspirations in the midst of the inhumane conditions of the Warsaw ghetto, until the deportations to the death camps begin and the Jews organise themselves into a fighting force determined to oppose the Nazis.",
