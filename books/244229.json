  "description": "It is 50 years since \"Casablanca\" opened up in America. Little did Humphrey Bogart know when he uttered the final line - \"This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship\" - that he had just closed what would be one of the most enduring and popular movies ever. Aljean Harmetz believes that \"every movie is a creature built from accidents and blind choices - a mechanical monster constructed of camera angles, the chemistry between actors, too little money or too much and a thousand unintended moments\". Her portrait of the making of an unmatched classic reveals some of the how the stars of the movie almost weren't Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman; how \"As Time Goes By\" nearly didn't make it to the final cut.",
