  "description": "It was only supposed to be a quick adventure, one where Lucae and her slave and best friend Astrid could prove, to themselves, they were just as good as any of the boys. Secretly entered into a male only mining competition winning was definitely their intent, getting kidnaped by some of the scariest fang-wielding warriors in the universe was certainly not.  To save their world and the moon that circled it, Rune, Tranan, and Felps were charged with obtaining the service of the best miners in the galaxy. The task seemed easy, but when you factored in that two of the men's races were sworn enemies, a minor hiccup with a mating heat, a large overprotective gargoyle claiming to be your new brother and the fact the male victims turned out to be women, success was no longer a guarantee. As attractions heat up, plans to make the kidnappees disappear at the end of the mission is no longer an option. Luckily, these possessive alpha males will pull out all the stops to protect their women.",
