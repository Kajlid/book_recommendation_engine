  "description": "Bridgette Adler has never been popular in school. Quite the contrary in fact – she’s been bullied and tormented almost her entire life. But what the others don't know is that Bridgette is extremely talented at piano – a trait she inherited from her father. One day, she is discovered by a professional and in the blink of an eye she's one of the rising stars in the classical music industry. Caught up in the whirlwind of fame, Bridgette subconsciously begins to change, swapping her once innocent and naive character for someone who is vain and heartless, hungry only for gold. Will she realise what she’s become before it’s too late?",
