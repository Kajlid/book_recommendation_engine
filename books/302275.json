  "description": "Arabella Smith knows from experience that football players are stubborn when they get injured, but Zeke Humphreys might be the one she can't help fix. Can she get her old school friend to listen to her, or will she find her task too complicated when she develops unexpected feelings for him? Zeke Humphreys knows it all. He knows he needs to rest for a few days and then spend some time in the gym. He doesn't need a sports therapist; it's a complete waste of his time and hers. Well, that is until he realizes his old school friend makes his body hum with desire whenever she looks at him. Can he do what she asks to get his career back on track, or will he allow his strong feelings for her to get in the way? Arabella and Zeke are about to learn that all the fun and games aren't just on the field. If you let yourself believe, it can happen in real life as well.Playing Again by Anna Edwards is part of the Quick Snap Novella Collection and is tied to Kristen Proby's With Me In Seattle series through Will Montgomery and his football team.",
