  "description": "In this breezy and hilarious novel, set in the astonishingly beautiful sun-dappled Greek islands, four incompatible women digging into the past may just find the answers to their futures.Buckle up, it'll be a summer for the ages.On the Megalopolis archeological site in rural Greece, the mythic home of the first Olympics, an unusual artifact is discovered. It's a relic that shouldn't exist; one that upends long-held beliefs about male achievement--everything their megalomaniacal leader has built his career, and ego, upon. Clearly, something has gone horribly wrong.Z, Elise, Kara and Patty are all digging on this very site this summer. All four women are at wildly different crossroads in their lives, yet all have somehow ended up on this same mountain. Kara is a polished art historian on the verge of calling off her wedding. Patty is a hapless undergrad with an unfortunate bowl cut. Z, a millennial, just got dumped and fired for what feels like the thousandth time. Elise, their star excavator, is consumed by work and has no time for a personal life.To figure out what they're really digging for, and what this site really means, these dirt-crusted colleagues will have to become what they've each avoided for years--friends. If they can manage to band together for this one summer, they might just make the discovery of a lifetime.",
