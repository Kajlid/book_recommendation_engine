But she's already lost her job, run over a mailbox, become embroiled in a heated small-town controversy...and run afoul of the local law in the person of the good-looking Chief of Police Blaise Corrigan.But with a little love it can be heaven.Jillie just wants to settle down and open a bookstore.

But Jillie is determined to weather the emotional storm, because her destiny has brought her to this magical place and wonderful new man. And her heart is begging her to stay.",
