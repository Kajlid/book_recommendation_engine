  "description": "Jack isn't your typical vampire. He has a high paying job, drives a nice car, owns a nice home and has a closet full of clothes that would make the top editor at GQ envious. He's a rarity among vampires, one who has successfully blended into the human world and enjoys the trivialities of human life.Holly, a blonde haired, green-eyed beauty is exactly the type of girl that could take Jack out of his comfort zone and have him risk his true identity. Intruiged by her radiant beauty, Jack goes all out to impress Holly, even if it means extending the night into the possibility of facing the early morning sun.In the tradition of Bram Stoker's Dracula, King's Vampire Revealed is a tell-all epistlary from a vampire who enjoys Facebook, reality shows, and the newest consumer technology. It is also the beginning of Jack's harrowing tale of betrayal, horror, exploitation, and the ultimate revelation of the origins of humanity and vampires.**REVIEWS**“P.J. Day breathes fresh air into a genre oversaturated with the same plotlines and characters. This page turner is something special.”—H.T. Night, author of Vampire Love Story and Winning Sarah’s Heart“King’s Blood is a fantastic story that is told from an intelligent perspective.”—Summer Lee, author of Kindred Spirits and Angel Heart“Hip. Relevant. Darkly funny. Day’s vampires offer a unique perspective on what it means to be human. A fantastic new series.”—J.R. Rain, author of Moon Dance and Dark Horse",
