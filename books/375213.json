  "description": "While digging through a chest, Mandie and her friends discover some wonderful old quilts, some of them made by her Cherokee grandmother some time ago. Uncle Ned has shown up with another quilt of her grandmother's, one Mandie has seen before with very unusual looking Cherokee writing on it. She had asked him to find out what the message was, but now he tells her to pack it away, that what it says is dangerous. Mandie, as you might guess, is more curious than ever! What is the secret sewn onto what seems to be a simple bed covering? Mandie is about to find out, and the truth will surprise everyone! Includes quilt block pattern and easy-to-follow quilting instructions.",
