  "description": "Danger lurks in every corner for a poor, harried mouse. He escapes the glittering teeth and cruel claws of a cat by a whisker, only to find himself in an elegant theater. But even in these opulent surroundings, his life is not safe as sword-wielding soldiers and an irate custodian give chase. Yet the music and the dancers, especially the beautiful ballerina Celeste, leave the mouse entranced. They touch the tiny rodent's soul and ignite his passion . . .for he, Tendu, was born to dance.",
