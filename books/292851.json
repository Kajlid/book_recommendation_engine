  "title": "Voices of Cancer: What We Really Want, What We Really Need",
  "description": "\"I don't know what to say\" and \"I don't know what to do\" are common responses to a life-threatening diagnosis. Voices of Cancer is here to help. Every cancer story is different, but there is one commonality: both patients and the people supporting them often struggle to properly articulate their wants and needs through particularly challenging‚ and in many cases, uncharted‚ territory. LyndaWolters knows firsthand: she was diagnosed with stage 4 terminal mantle cell lymphoma in August of 2016.Voices of Cancer offers a candid look into the world of a cancer patient, informed by Lynda's own story and conversations had with dozens of patients weighing in on their needs, wants, and dislikes as they navigate the complex world of diagnosis, treatment, and beyond. With comprehensive and accessible insight from people who've been there, Voices of Cancer helps educate, dispel fears, and start positive conversations about what a cancer diagnosis truly means, while shining a light on how best to support the patient.",
