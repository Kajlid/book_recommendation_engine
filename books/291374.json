  "description": "According to the National Institute of Mental Health, more than 23 million Americans suffer from anxiety disorders- many as a direct result of trauma. As a young stress researcher at the University of California at Berkeley, Peter A. Levine found that all animals, including humans, are born with a natural ability to rebound from these distressing situations. Now on Healing Trauma, you can join this respected therapist and teacher to learn how to address these and other symptoms at their source-your body-and return to the natural trauma-free state that you were meant to live in. Featuring more than six hours of guided instruction to engage your body's built-in healing process.",
