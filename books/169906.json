  "description": "Leo knows just where he stands  He’s never been surer of what he needs to do and never been more determined to see it through to the bitter end.   Jamie has nothing left to lose  She wants to see justice served and an end to all the bloodshed. She has a plan, but she’ll need Leo to help piece everything together.   Together, they'll take one final ride, one final shot to chase down the devils that wronged to them.  There’s one chance for them to go through with their plan, one chance to rally what’s left of a brotherhood bound by ink and steel, and one chance to finally end things for good and bring peace to Vallecito de Grande.  EXCERPT  “I’ve told you before, I’m not that easy to kill.” He scooted away from her and rolled her to her back so he could look into her eyes. “I can’t die now. I have this thing I need to do.”  She gasped out a laugh and sniffed again before wiping her eyes. “What’s that?”  “This,” he smiled as he leaned down and kissed her gently.  “But what about tomorrow. And the next day?” she asked softly as their lips parted. “I worry.”  He kissed her again. “I’ll need to do this again tomorrow. And the next day. And the day after that.”  She stared at him a moment then sniffed again. “I’m serious.”  “So am I.”",
