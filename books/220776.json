  "description": "Chloe: Moses has been my best friend since kindergarten. We met when I shoved him face first in the dirt and took his action figures. Ever since, we’ve been tighter than blood, but we’re not blood, and my body knows that. My heart has known that for years. The fact that being a pole dancer has interfered with my relationship status is an understatement. Moses is literally the longest I’ve been with a man, except I’m not really ‘with’ him. Now I’m approaching a place where I’m curious enough to tell him about my feelings. I’ve gotten close, but a man as hot as my bestie has had really small gaps between girlfriends. I know it could be a big mistake, and he’s never seen me that way, but I won’t know for sure unless I act right? Only problem is, I might be too late again.Moses: I’m not blind to the fact that my best friend is dangerously hot. She’s basically every man’s dream but she’s not mine. I’m the one that protects her, councils her, and encourages her, knowing she will do the same for me. She’s my girl. But now something is different, and I can’t put a name to it.

After all, I’m in the friend zone…",
