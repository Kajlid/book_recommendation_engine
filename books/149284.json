  "description": "JJ Stoner once killed people for a living. In the military his kills were government-sanctioned. As a mercenary they were privately contracted. He doesn't mention the other kills, those of his own initiative. Highly-trained, finely-honed and used hard, Stoner now seeks not to kill as he investigates underworld activities for official intelligence agencies, an entirely deniable operative in sleazy situations. Less the blunt instrument, more the swift stiletto. A series of brutal, blood-soaked murders looks to be right up Stoner's street. When the investigation spirals in queasy circles, JJ finds release in the music of the blues and in weird sex with treacherous women. An old army comrade, equally lethal and with less to lose, steps out of the shadows. Friend or foe? And who are the seductive killing sisters? Stoner must find focus, find the killer, maybe even find himself. The time has come for Stoner to kill again...----------'Guns, girls, guitars and scenes of gruesome violence, all shot through with a wit sharp enough to draw blood. With terse and brilliant prose, Westworth delivers a plot that drags you along relentlessly. Loved it, unconditionally.' R J Ellory, award-winning author of A Quiet Belief In Angels and 12 other crime-thriller best-sellers.",
