  "description": "What if bad guys ruled the world and the good guys were the outlaws?  I’m Chaos, patch member of Outlaw MC of Mars. We fight against the government’s warped rules under the guise of hover bike enthusiasts. Gays are put to death. Women are used for breeding. Dark-skinned men are considered slaves. I told you our world is messed up and the battle is going to be bloody. I’m currently on my way to Earth for a six-month prison sentence. Level six is for sex, a twisted buffet of ass and mouth. Level five is for the fights. That’s where I shine.  Beau is a sexy Hispanic man that’s too goofy to play with the big boys. He was loaned to me for some quick, naked fun. But it turned into something else. I don’t do relationships because of my past. My father was a serial killer. But it seems that now, I have a boyfriend. It’s complicated.  Beau is released from prison before me. Can I survive three months without his calming touch? Will he survive on Mars amid my dangerous and violent club without me?",
