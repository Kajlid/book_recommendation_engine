  "title": "Dogs Of Dreamtime: A Story About Second Chances And The Power Of Love",
  "description": "How intense a bond can man and dog truly forge? What''s a person to do when her world is whole only with a beloved dog--but her family is not as keen on the idea? When does a dog''s behavior become too dangerous for even the most loving person to accept? Karen Shanley tackles all these questions in lyrical prose that brings to life her relationships with three very different Kiera, who came to her in a dream; Molly, Kiera''s beautiful deaf sister; and Magic, the scrawny rescue dog who captures Karen''s heart. The Dogs of Dreamtime is Karen''s story; It''s about a time when she is forced to take a long, hard look at what matters and what does not, what she can control and what she cannot. And about the hard choices--choices of life and death--she has to make to keep moving forward. In the same way that her dogs bring to Karen experiences of joy, struggle, and, ultimately, uplifting change, this book will touch every reader.",
