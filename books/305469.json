  "description": "Sarah had no idea what she was getting herself into when she set out on her journey across Europe. A simple quest for sexual education ended up a lesson in heartbreak, an immersion into submission, and a headlong dash into danger as one seemingly kind, and handsome Dutchman hides deep, dark secrets while a New York City photographer and notorious womanizer threatens to steal her heart. Meanwhile, in the shadows, a predator stalks her best friend's brother coveting that which he cannot have. Can Sarah survive the evil that awaits as she seeks out pleasure or will pleasure be the death of her?",
