  "description": "Seven punky and pitch-black stories offer English-language readers an overdue introduction to Izumi Suzuki, a cult figure in Japanese literature.Women and Women: The fissures in a queer matriarchal utopia are exposed when a boy, a creature usually contained in ghettoised isolation - appears beneath young YÅ«ko's windowYou May Dream: An extreme government initiative curbing overpopulation prompts a woman to re-evaluate her friendshipsNight Picnic: The last family in a desolate city learns to be human through the awkward appropriation of popular cultureThat Old Seaside Club: Passive-aggressive furniture provides unwelcome romantic adviceSmoke Gets in Your Eyes: Tense interplanetary politics distort Emma's love lifeForgotten: Jane's ex-girlfriend reppears, radically altered and insistent on a catch-upTerminal Boredom: Tokyo's teenagers, disaffected and numb from excessive screentime, find distraction in violence.Suzuki's singular slant on science fiction remains fresh and essential. Concerns about society, gender and imperialism dovetail irresistibly with flights of speculative wonder. And with a kitchen sink in the corner of even her wildest stories, Suzuki reminds us that while society may be limitless, relationships remain impossible",
