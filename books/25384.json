  "description": "The Marina Star Hotel has become overrun with zombies, legions of the undead have spilled into the streets, devouring everyone in sight. The picturesque island resort town has descended into chaos. The local government lacks the resources necessary to contain the murderous corpses and requests assistance from the United States. A U.S. Special Forces unit sent in to squash the threat is quickly overwhelmed. In desperation they turn to an unlikely ally, Benjamin Hawk, MD.Dr. Hawk, “Hawk” to his friends, is an unassuming, regular guy who happens to cut up dead bodies for a living. When not in the morgue he spends his time dissecting horror films. His fascination with gore led him to develop an annual Halloween lecture series titled ‘Monsters and Medicine’ for the stressed out medical students and pathology residents. His most popular lecture, ‘The Neuropathology of Zombies’, spreads throughout the Internet, eventually catching the attention of the U.S. Government. Now faced with an actual zombie crisis, the U.S. military decides to bring Hawk to the island with the hope he can end the zombie plague.Being the world’s only authority on the topic, Hawk uses his skills as a forensic pathologist and a neuropathologist to carry out autopsies on the zombies, leading him on an electrifying and dark journey to the true origins of the zombification process. Hawk has many close encounters of the dead kind as he uses his scientific mind to battle the zombie hordes, nearly becoming one of the undead himself.",
