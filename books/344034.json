  "description": "A gruesome series of murders decimates a small town in one night, leaving a watching nation in terror. Only miles away, another small town lives in its shadow, left to wonder if they could be next. While most try to ignore the possible warning signs, one man cannot. Not when it's right under his home. It's now up to him to warn a town of non-believers that they will be next, and that the danger comes from something few have seen, and even fewer have survived. But is it real? That's a question he must answer himself and do so quickly. Time is running out. . .",
