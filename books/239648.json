  "description": "Pay your debt or forfeit your soul.  ​ Mona thought her troubles were over, but little did she know, they were only just beginning. ​ When you owe a demon, they will always come to collect. Mona must enter the demon realm to repay her debt to the demon Adramelech. If she fails to complete her task, the forfeit is her soul. ​ Few have ever returned from the demon realm and those who have, are never the same. The realm is cruel, dark, and merciless, much like its inhabitants. ​ As if that wasn’t already enough, Mona must now deal with her growing feelings for the guys.  (Yup, guys as in plural.)  ​ Things can never just be simple for Mona.   *This is a slow burn Reverse-Harem series.",
