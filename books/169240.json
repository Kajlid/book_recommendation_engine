  "description": "Best when read after No, Not that Jane Austen, the prequel to The Best of Fools.Jane Austen is nothing like that Jane Austen. Or so she thinks. Emotionally guarded and unwilling to open up to just anyone, Jane is surrounded by friends and family who seem obsessed with starry-eyed sensational romances. But as Jane explores the hidden chambers of her heart, she finds herself standing face-to-face with the love she's spent her life avoiding. The kind of love that breaks you into a million pieces when it's gone. The kind of love that softens you, hardens you, and changes everything you thought you knew. The kind of love that is asking her to risk it all and finish what she started. Magnetic, emotional, and profoundly moving, The Best of Fools is a timeless love story for the young at heart. A story that will stir you to place your book down and hold the one you love ... without letting go. A story that will stick with you long after you turn the last page. Because love knows no end. And neither do the stories that convey what only the heart can understand. As Jane discovers, like the \"real Jane Austen,\" the colors of love are vast, no love story is the same, and sometimes all it takes is the right person to open you up to a world you never thought you'd find. A world you'll never want to leave.",
