  "title": "People-First Philosophy: Thrive Together Instead of Diminishing Divided",
  "description": "Old philosophies have failed us.We are here, on Earth, alone, somewhere in an infinitely large universe, but instead of improving each other’s lives, we make them harder.We are so smart that we build atom bombs but so stupid to point them at each other.We could use the full potential of our brains to achieve wonderful things, but we waste it at non-meaningful activities.People-First philosophy is based on a revolutionary scientific theory - the Theory of People.This 26-page booklet, which requires the Theory of People to be fully understood, presents a new philosophy. It can move humanity forward and improve the well-being of individuals while truly fostering their freedom. It proposes the following Ideal \"I must move closer to 100% scientific knowledge.\"\"I must optimize the PE values of my solutions for others.\"\"I must optimize my ideal state choices and values.\"If somebody does not want to apply them, he or she will just miss the benefits. Those who apply it will get the benefits, no matter if others apply them or not. This is their beauty.",
