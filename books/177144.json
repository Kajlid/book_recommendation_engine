  "title": "Under the Ivy: The Life and Music of Kate Bush",
  "description": "The book examines Bush’s unconventional upbringing in South London, the blossoming of her talent, and her evolution into one of the most visually and sonically creative artists of the past four decades. Graeme has managed to masterfully weave into his narrative over 70 new interviews with those who have viewed from close quarters both the public artist and the private woman. He gives unprecedented insight into Kate’s unique working methods and pioneering use of the studio on landmark albums such as “The Dreaming and Hounds Of Love”, her rejection of live performance, her key relationships, and her profound influence on successive generations of musicians. The book manages to build a crescendo of Kate’s life events leading to the unprecedented spurt of activity in the recent years that resulted in the release of two albums in 2011: the controversial “Director’s Cut” and “50 Words For Snow” and, more recently, a series of concerts in 2014. The result is a detailed and utterly absorbing biography of Kate Bush, written with wit, style and substance. “Under The Ivy” is the definitive and updated account of the life and music of one of the world’s most gifted, private and often misunderstood artists.",
