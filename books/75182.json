You'll also be graced by the first scripts of heir apparent to the scripting crown of Atlantis, Roy Thomas, as he builds the foundation for the Sub-Mariner's leap into his very own solo series! Featuring head-to-head battles with the Hulk, guest art by Gene Colan and the first of John Buscema's classic run on the character!",
