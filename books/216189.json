  "description": "At age seventeen, Arun, the narrator of Of Love and Other Monsters, emerges from a fire, his memories and identity vanished with the flames. He finds a refuge and home with Janani and soon discovers his unique ability to sense and manipulate the minds of others around him. Intimately connected yet isolated by this insight, he inhabits a dangerous place outside conventional boundaries: man/woman, mind/body. When someone who shares his ability, Rahul Moghe, arrives on his doorstep, he senses a power beyond any he has known. Janani warns of the grave danger posed by Rahul and sends Arun on his journey, fleeing the one person who may have answers to the mystery of his past...\"Singh writes with a beautiful clarity. Each character is sharply drawn, and the inevitability of the story pulls the reader headlong with it--helped by a compelling sparseness of prose. Nothing unneeded is written, leaving Of Love and Other Monsters with an incredible tightness that is rarely seen even in the best of today's modern short fiction. Of Love and Other Monsters is an engrossing, though somewhat melancholy, story. The reader is quickly carried away by Arun's story and journey, and Arun is a character who subtly challenges our perceptions of what it means to love and be loved. Singh also uses him to show us how we often harm ourselves with our own limits.\"I certainly recommend this to any reader. It is the best short fiction, and possibly the best fiction, I have read this year.\" --The Fix",
