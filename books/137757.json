  "description": "Until hostilities opened in early August, 1914, humanity had never borne witness to a conflagration the likes of the Great War. Political alliances, pitting empire against empire, saw Europe plunged into a horrific and savage conflict that drew in millions of young men from all walks of life, on all sides. In '1914', follow the stories of nine such men, those they fight with, and some they meet along the way, as all struggle to survive the slaughter of the Great War's first months.",
