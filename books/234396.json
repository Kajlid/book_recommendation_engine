  "description": "The New York Times bestselling authors take a journey into the Cape Light of Christmas past.  As the citizens of Cape Light deck the halls for a Christmas to remember, the curmudgeonly Lillian Warwick has been confined to her bed with pneumonia. Cared for by her daughters, Emily and Jessica, she lets her thoughts drift back to the holiday season of 1955, to the magical time when she first met Oliver Warwick-the dashing man who would become her husband.  Back then, Lillian was beautiful, spirited, and idealistic, and Oliver was a wonderful man who took a real joy in living. As she recounts those romantic early days to her daughters and faces the mistakes she's made, she is reminded of a time when she had much to be grateful for-and of all the special gifts Christmas can bring.  And, to cap off this special, life-altering holiday season, there just might be a winter wedding on the horizon...",
