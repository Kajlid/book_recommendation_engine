  "title": "Maybe It Should Have Been a Three Iron: My Year as Caddie for the World's 438th Best Golfer",
  "description": "Maybe It Should Have Been a Three-Iron is the funny and poignant story of one man's search for sporting glory.Lawrence Donegan had the desire but lacked the talent to be a professional golfer, so he settled for the next best thing--caddying for Ross Drummond, a little-known pro on the European PGA tour, ranking 438th in the world. With self-deprecating humor, Donegan recounts the days and endless nights he spent on the road with Drummond as they existed on a string of meager tournament checks and chased the elusive \"big win\" much as Don Quixote and Sancho Panza chased windmills.",
