  "description": "The Covenant in Action  was developed to continue the inspirational spirit of the Covenant With Black America and to empower people to take effective action to achieve THE Covenant goals.  The information, tools, and ideas presented in  The Covenant in Action  will enable and inspire people to become agents of change in their respective communities and to become partners in a larger Covenant movement. The Covenant in Action  is organized into three (1) stories about the projects and actions that everyday people have undertaken over the past year that were inspired by the Covenant With Black America; (2) motivational essays from young Black activists who are on the ground impacting their environments; and (3) a toolkit outlining steps you can take to organize, connect, and act.  The toolkit contains not only traditional action strategies, but includes innovative approaches to organizing and community building that will result in stronger, more bonded communities that are reflective of their history and past experiences.  The Covenant With Black America was only the first step.   The Covenant in Action  toolkit will prime and prepare individuals and communities to actually move the Covenant book into action.",
