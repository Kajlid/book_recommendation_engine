I’m pretty sure He just did.”After a year of loss and bad choices distance Emma Reynolds from her lifelong beliefs, she finds herself pregnant and alone at a twenty-week ultrasound, hearing the words “incompatible with life.” When her son, Theo, survives birth, she fights to give him the best care possible. As each day passes, Emma’s love for Theo grows—along with her fear of losing him. She can’t understand why God allows her son to suffer.Seventeen-year-old blogger, Mason Hughes, feels lonely and worthless after his father left their family years ago.

While he’d love to avoid the uncomfortable events, his heart can’t help but seek the one thing missing in his life—a marriage like his parents have. If only he could find the woman himself.As Theo’s tiny life connects them to each other, their loneliness breaks under the love of community, and they will never be the same.",
