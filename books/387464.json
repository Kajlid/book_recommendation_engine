  "description": "I enjoyed Sins of Omission and while reading had to order this second book and wish Fern Michaels had written a third. From two young servicemen to grown men, Reuben and Daniel's friendship never wavers, even though complicated by family members. From powerful lives in Hollywood to France being invaded with characters rescuing people and children, survival seems to be the theme of this novel....whether in the corporate world or private world. A surprising twist as to who Reuben really loves, and a lot of love and intrigue in this second book.",
