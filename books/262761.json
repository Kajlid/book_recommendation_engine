  "description": "\"Sharp writing, a challenging mystery, and an exceedingly likable protagonist.\" — KIRKUS Reviews.2019 NATIONAL INDIE EXCELLENCE® AWARDS (NIEA) Finalist in the “Thriller” categoryCan you start your life over again the day you learn you’re dying?Until yesterday, twenty-one-year-old Phoenix Collins had it all figured out: she was going to live forever. Not literally of course; nobody lives forever—she knows that, she’s learned it the hard way—but bearing a mythical name had convinced her that someday she’d have a fresh start, her life back on track.Therefore, when she wakes up in a hospital bed to learn that she has twenty-four hours to live, she’s utterly confused, if not in complete denial. A big scar stretches across her stomach, but she has no recollection of the previous days’ events.As she races against the clock, anger and frustration threatening to overtake everything in their way, Phoenix crosses paths with Gabriel, a young widower. Meeting him completely upends her plans to figure out why she’s dying, for the more she gets to know him, the more she remembers what it really means to live for the day…even if this is the only one she has left.\"Through Bertaud’s articulate, edgy prose, Phoenix shines as the charming narrator of her own madcap journey—funny, sarcastic, frightened, tough, and tender.\" — KIRKUS Reviews.",
