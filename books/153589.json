This is the Mafia. Lines are blurred. Choices are never black and white. And the life you thought you knew is one giant lie. He was dead. I didn't want his life to be in vain, so I tried to make something of myself. I tried and failed. Now he's back. Alive. And he wants me. Nobody ever said the Mafia played fair. Welcome to the family.",
