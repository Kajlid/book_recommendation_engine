Flame is prince and heir to the Lion throne but he is not yet strong enough to stand up to the evil uncle who killed his parents and is trying to claim Flame's throne for his own.

So Flame travels from family to family in various kitten guises using his, often chaotic, magic spells to help those who need it along the way.
