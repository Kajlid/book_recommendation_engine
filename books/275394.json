  "description": "My life is a mess. Literally.\n  I’m a single dad, which means If I’m not cleaning up spilled milk or changing a diaper, I’m pulling gum from my daughter’s hair. I barely have enough time to eat—let alone sleep.  And women? Forget about it. That ship sailed two years ago along with my ex-wife. My brother says I need to get laid. I say, screw that. I’m content with my life, until pop star Nora Hayes walks through my best friend’s front door and flips my world upside down.  She’s beautiful, famous, and completely off limits.  \nMy life is a headline waiting to happen. Literally.\n  It all started with fishnet stockings and ended with a baseball bat to my boyfriend’s Porsche, putting me on the front page of every newspaper and gossip magazine in the country.  My life is spiraling out of control and I’m ready to make some serious changes. What I’m not ready for is a hunky man to strut his jean clad tush into my life. Grayson Calhoun is as rugged as he is sweet. He’s also way in over his head with his kids, and I have an offer I’m hoping he can’t refuse.  What starts as an agreement, turns to a friendship, and quickly escalates to stolen kisses and heated nights spent wrapped in each other’s arms. What we have is temporary. I promise him that I won’t fall in love.  But I make that promise already knowing it’s a lie.",
