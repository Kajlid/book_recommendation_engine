  "description": "TC hides from the virus-infected in abandoned houses. He hasn't seen another healthy human in months, and it crosses his mind that there might not be any more. Not long ago, in a moment of crisis, he abandoned his lover and friends. He told himself that sentimental loyalty was the same as suicide, in the All F___ed Era, his own name for the dark time. Now his only companions are the virus-infected animal-people who hunt him, and his own heavy conscience. As he runs events over in his head, he doubts himself, and whether his survival is worth the love and honor he sacrificed. When TC thinks of a plan to save the human race, he isn’t just fighting for humanity. He's fighting for his own soul. He grows with the terror of his time, until he pursues, inexorable as a hungry tiger, vindication, leaving a trail of virus-laced blood in his wake, chasing those who once hunted him.The novel features Philadelphia landmarks and neighborhoods and is an action-packed treatment of the questions that plague the human race, about responsibility, love, and sacrifice. Readers can expect humor and Philadelphia flavor on their journey into the end of time.We hope you’re never caught in a viru-pocalypse. If you are, we hope you read this book first.",
