  "description": "Demons are watching. They move invisible through our world, hunting for rare prey: most humans don’t see the monsters that lurk in the dark, and as long as you can’t see them, they can’t directly hurt you--only influence you.But Ana Flynn, daughter of a witch, sees the demons everywhere. Monsters once found only in her late mother's bedtime stories have crept from the shadows, whispering her name and stirring ancient–and forbidden–magic in her blood.On the day her tarot deck foretells a disturbing change, Ana encounters an uncanny young man who literally stops (and starts) her heart. The new kid has strange powers, and an even stranger quest, and for some reason wants to help her. But the closer he gets to the truth behind Ana’s power, the more important–and dangerous–his own quest becomes...even more important that keeping Ana alive.Because in a world haunted by demons determined to find the key to their empire, there is much more at stake than one girl’s soul.",
