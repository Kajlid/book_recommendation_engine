  "description": "The necromantic armies are on the warpath and nowhere is safe. Even the presumed sanctuary of the floating dungeon controlled by Cal is threatened! The leadership of nearly all the sentient monarchies has been wiped out, and only the races most suited to repelling the advancing darkness have an intact chain of command.Cal learns quickly that the most pressing threat is not the far-off war, but is instead those entrusted with the general population’s protection. As it turns out, the idea of having a flying dungeon for your people is very tempting indeed…Dale has been facing his trials and tribulations better than anyone else could have hoped for, but when the war takes a turn for the worse, his duties are forcibly assumed by another. Since his only chance at survival is painful and rigorous advancement, Dale must learn if his strength of will can develop into strength alone. If not, the world itself may be at risk.",
