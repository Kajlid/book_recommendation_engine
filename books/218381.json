  "description": "Hey, I'm Diana Mallory, Melissa Alexander’s daughter, but don't let that fool you – my life's just as messy. I can't decide whether to marry, chase a career, or join the Sisters of the Universe. But who needs decisions when you get sucked through a black hole and dumped on an ice planet, right?This place is nothing like home. It's freezing, it's strange, and oh, there are these five guys who are making my heart race in a way I never knew possible. Each one of them is kindling a flame in me, heating up this icy world. They weren't prepared for a girl falling from the sky, but now they're all about keeping me safe, loved, and yeah, a lot more.Trying to figure out love and survival here is a whole new game. And just when I start to think maybe I can have it all, I realize the universe doesn’t always play fair. With danger lurking in the shadows, can these five hotties help me navigate this chilly new world? And is there really such a thing as a happy ending on an ice planet?",
