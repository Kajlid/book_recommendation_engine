  "description": "Celebrate the 75th birthday of this classic treatise on bullying by Dr. Seuss with our new foil-covered, color-enhanced edition!The 500 Hats of Bartholomew Cubbins is the story of a young peasant and his unjust treatment at the hands of King Derwin.While The 500 Hats is one of Dr. Seuss's earliest and lesser known works, it is nevertheless totally Seussian and as topical today as when it was first published in 1938, addressing subjects that we know the good doctor was passionate about throughout his life: the abuse of power (as in \nYertle the Turtle\n and Horton Hears a Who); rivalry (as in The Sneetches); and of course, zany good humor (as in \nThe Cat in the Hat\n and the 43 other books he wrote and illustrated)! This is a perfect way to introduce new readers to an old classic or to reward existing fans.Follow more of Bartholomew's adventures in \nBartholomew and the Oobleck,\n a Caldecott Honor Award-winner.With his unique combination of hilarious stories, zany pictures and riotous rhymes, Dr. Seuss has been delighting young children as well as helping them learn to read for over fifty years. Creator of the wonderfully anarchic 'Cat in the Hat', and ranked among the world's top children's authors, Dr. Seuss is a global best-seller, with nearly half a billion books sold worldwide.",
