  "title": "Don't Drink Your Own Kool-Aid",
  "description": "A deeply inspiring and insightful book about what it means to be a spiritual seeker, how to use (not abuse) a spiritual guru, how to win your ascension and what it feels like to be an ascended master. This book is unique in spiritual literature because it is given as direct dictation by a master who has recently ascended and therefore is still aware of the challenges we face on earth.This profound and personal teaching is a gift from the Ascended Master Guru Ma, who in her last embodiment was a public figure. Her name was Elizabeth Clare Prophet and she was the head of a world-wide spiritual movement. She was by some called a cult leader and by others hailed as a visionary spiritual teacher. In this book she demonstrates that she is so much more than her outer form. Drawing on her personal life and her experiences as a spiritual guru, she describes in unprecedented depth the psychological changes we all go through as we qualify for the ascension.It is impossible to quickly convey the depth and breath of this book, but here is a small selection of what you will",
