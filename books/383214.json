  "title": "The Iron Heel",
  "description": "Generally considered to be \"the earliest of the modern Dystopian,\" The Iron Heel chronicles the rise of an oligarchic tyranny in the United States. It is arguably the novel in which Jack London's socialist views are most explicitly on display. London presents a fictional \"Everhard Manuscript\", hidden and found centuries in the future. This book is a platform for him to espouse his socialist views and predict the collapse of capitalism. Very different from his other action novels, it envisions a future oligarchic tyranny in America and the rise of the Socialist party. The book has been credited with influencing George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.",
