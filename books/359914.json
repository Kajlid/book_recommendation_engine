  "description": "We were supposed to protect the world from monsters, not become them.All I’ve ever wanted was to protect the people I love. That’s why I joined the military’s Elite Specimen Containment Unit. When I learned they were experimenting on sentient monsters, however, everything changed. Now, I have a new mission: protect a scaly winged monster named Bud and escort him to somewhere he’ll be safe from my superiors. Yet, Bud’s so sweet and perfect, I can’t help but fall for him, even though I know it’s too dangerous for us to be together. It’ll be safer for us to go our separate ways, especially when we’re being hunted.But I’ve only got so much willpower… Though Scales and Song is the second book in the Monsters in my Bed series, it can be read as a standalone novel. It features a closeted and traumatized special forces soldier, the sweet cinnamon roll monster who loves him, and a HEA. Please see the interior for content warnings.",
