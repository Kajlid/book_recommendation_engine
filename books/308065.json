  "description": "He doesn't mind killing people... he just prefers to do it on his own terms.But the pirates have no say in who they kill on this island.The council orders. The pirates obey.This arrangement has kept Declan from setting foot on these shores for years... until a bit of bad luck forces him to return.But it may prove a lucrative stop, if the rebel's information is true.Find the dagger. Escape this life.But only if this damn stowaway doesn't ruin everything first.=======This high seas tale of deceit, legends, and love delivers a deliciously gray hero, a relatable heroine, and a found family you'll root for. An enemies-to-lovers story with a slow-burn romance and one bed, this is book one of a trilogy and ends on a cliffhanger. But it's worth it.",
