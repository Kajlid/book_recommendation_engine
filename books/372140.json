  "title": "Improving Personal Relationships",
  "description": "This is an invitation to explore the various types of personal relationships we enter into along with what makes them positive and enriching. While it is true that some of our relationships are more meaningful to us than are others, all relationships, if properly handled, may broaden our minds and contribute to our well being. Improving Personal Relationships will help you identify your ways of relating to people as well as remove obstacles that hinder your attachment to valuable others. Together with Living with Stress, the first volume of the bibliotreatment series, and with the upcoming Why Can't I Make Money?, the book provides detailed analysis and guidance leading to a fulfilling lifestyle. An attractive bonus to the ideas proposed in all three books is the possibility of personal contact with the author through info@pintobooks.com ABOUT THE AUTHOR Marta Merajver-Kurlat is an Argentine novelist, translator, essayist, and biographer. Her attraction to the ways in which mankind tells its own history encouraged her to undertake studies in myth, language, literature, psychology and psychoanalysis. Accordingly, her novels Just Toss the Ashes and Los gloriosos sesenta y despu√©s delve into intriguing aspects of human nature. A lecturer in psychoanalytic associations of her country, she first took up the challenge of addressing non-specialists in Living with Stress, released by Jorge Pinto Books in mid-2009.",
