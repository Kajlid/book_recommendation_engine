  "description": "Vernon came out of the Civil War with a honed talent for violence that disallowed any opportunity for a peaceful existence. Pursuant to a confluence of circumstances, five children living a scratch existence on the outskirts of Jackson, Texas will come to rely on that talent for their very lives. Indeed, one runaway Chickasaw with vengeance in her blood and another with destruction in his will force Vernon to extremes that challenge not only his skill with a revolver but his very survival. With an old man carrying an old shotgun riding at his side, Vernon seeks to control his personal demons while going up against the very real threats that seek to destroy both him and the people he cares about.“The author delivers a strong protagonist and an engaging supporting cast. … A likeable, quirky hero and delightful youngsters make this violent yarn appealing.” — Kirkus Reviews.John Earl Sharp is a retired lawyer living with his wife, Sylvia, their three dogs and one cat in a log house in the ever dwindling woods of NorthEast Texas.
