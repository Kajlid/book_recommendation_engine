Gordy says he's heard rumours about stolen ancient mosaics. Emma, an art crimes specialist herself, won't discuss the rumours. Especially since they involve Oliver York, an unrepentant English art thief. Gordy and Emma's grandfather, a renowned private art detective, chased Oliver for a decade. Gordy knows Wendell Sharpe didn't give him everything he had on the thief. Even now, Oliver will never be prosecuted. When a shocking death occurs, Emma is drawn into the investigation.

He also knows there will be questions about Emma's role and where her loyalties lie. From Boston to Maine to Ireland, Emma and Colin track a dangerous killer as the lives of their family and friends are at stake. With the help of their friend, Irish priest Finian Bracken, and Emma's brother, Lucas, the Sharpes and Donovans must band together to stop a killer. \nNo one creates exciting, action-packed romantic suspense and international intrigue like New York Times bestselling author Carla Neggers.",
