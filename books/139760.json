  "description": "Lena Rose Winter was a typical seventeen year old girl, or so everyone thought.  She had a hated secret and she knew what love was, but she dreaded it.  Liam Christopher Black was far from your typical bad boy. He was a good guy, the one who would sit at the back of the class, not making a sound.  His family dying in a car crash cost him his voice.  Lena knew becoming friends with someone was a great risk because you could always end up caring too much. But still, she fought for the boy and his friendship but they ended up falling for each other. Hard.  It seemed as if the world didn't want them together as they faced struggle after struggle to beat the odds. But will the risks be enough for their relationship to survive?  Amidst the trials and bad experiences, will both of them learn to truly love again?",
