  "description": "Professional dog walker Ellie Engleman may have a psychic connection with dogs, but she was hoping she would not get roped into dealing with the wet-nosed guests at the Hamptons wedding she's been invited to. But soon she's chasing her tail over trouble of the two-legged variety. Before the bride can say, \"I do,\" someone is murdered. And Ellie and her yorkiepoo Rudy must put their noses to the ground to sniff out the killer.",
