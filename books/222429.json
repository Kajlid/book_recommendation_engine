Then everyone be cool.\") or the time she drove to the wrong city for a fourth-grade field trip (\"Why are we in San Antonio?\"), Jen parlays her own triumphs and tragedies into a sigh of relief for all normal, fierce women everywhere who, like her, sometimes hide in the car eating crackers but also want to get back up and get back out, to live undaunted \"in the moment\" no matter what the moments hold.",
