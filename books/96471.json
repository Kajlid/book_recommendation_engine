His only solace is his childhood friend, Ryan.Ryan has always been the one bright thing in Phillip’s life, but while Ryan lives out and proud, Phillip is terrified by the feelings Ryan inspires in him. For years he’s kept them locked away, but when Ryan suddenly confesses his love, Phillip discovers that denying his own feelings might be the only thing scarier than finally owning up to them. PHOTO DESCRIPTION:Two young boys around age six or seven exchange a sweet, innocent kiss behind a caption that reads “No matter what age. No matter what gender. Love is love.” The taller boy is gently cupping the smaller boy’s chin while the smaller boy grips the strap of the taller boy’s backpack. STORY LETTER:Dear Author,This was their first and only kiss but Ryan has always loved Phillip. Ryan is out and proud now, and has known he was gay since this first kiss about 20 years ago.
