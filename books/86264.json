  "title": "Andy's Day on the Farm",
  "description": "Andy lives in the city. His Uncle John lives on a farm. Andy is going to visit Uncle John and see all of the animals. He loves meeting each animal and learning how they help Uncle John on the farm. The first half of the book is Andy's story and the second half of this book contains a variety of coloring pages, game and puzzle pages. Some of them are easy and some are more difficult. All of the answers, however, are found in the story. The puzzles are designed so that the slightly older primary age child can complete them alone. They can look up the answers if necessary. The younger child will need help but, working along with the parent, can complete most of the games.Andy's Day on the Farm is now an animated story and interactive game book available in the iBooks Store.
