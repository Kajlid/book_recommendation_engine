  "description": "\"Life plays at being a card dealer but, since the cards are stacked, when you make your choice, it’s always the wrong one. When you realise it, though, when you fold and quit, then out of spite, you’ll get hold of a good card in the next deal. Something like a reward. The only thing you have to do is play it right…\" Will Demosthenes play his own card right?",
