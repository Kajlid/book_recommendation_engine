  "description": "In this contemporary Phantom of the Opera story, a disfigured recluse leaves his world of shadows to mentor a beautiful rookie trial lawyer in a controversial case that changes both their lives. Ambitious attorney Christine Dawson has landed a controversial court case which can launch her career as a litigator—or kill it. A week before trial, the hardworking but reserved rookie is desperate to learn the secrets of courtroom presence. But the only one who can help her is a disfigured recluse with a chip on his shoulder the size of the Astrodome. Yet as she looks past the scars and rudeness, she sees the brilliant mind and dry humor of the charismatic litigator who once charmed a nation with his passion for human rights. Intense and demanding, the phantom of the courtroom draws Christine into his world and challenges her to give her whole heart to the law…and to him. Once handsome and successful, RJ Parker's world was shattered when a gang who objected to his politics sliced his face to shreds. Now he lives life in the shadows, going out only at night and trying cases vicariously as a legal consultant. Until he meets the beautiful Christine. For her he braves the daylight and mentors her through a momentous courtroom trial. Through her eyes he sees the better man his disfigurement has made him. He wants her to stay with him in his world of shadows, but ultimately, to be worthy of her love, he must accept the challenge she offers and learn to live in the light.",
