  "description": "Genevieve has just purchased a beautiful historic home that needs a lot of love. Okay, maybe more than a lot, but she’s determined to make her dreams come true, so she hires a contractor to help her make that a reality. But when Barrett Cooper steps on her property, it’s like Thor himself has fallen out of the sky. How can she possibly think straight while having a heat stroke?  Barrett Cooper is focused on his business and nothing else. He loves restoring old homes but doesn’t get the chance to as much as he wants. When he gets a call about a job that piques his interest, he takes one look at the owner and knows this is going to be a hands-on project.  Warning: There’s a lot to love about this hulking alpha who knows how to build a house. But hands-off, because he’s falling hard and fast for the woman who has stolen his heart. With someone else trying to threaten what’s his, you’ll find out just how possessive a guy with a big hammer can be.",
