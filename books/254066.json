Ursache. My pack. The high-born family of wolves I’ve sworn my life to protect, even if my dying breath is pledged to another. Mason… My everything. Friend, confidant, enemy, lover. Most dangerous of all, he would become the reason I lived if I let him. He is the one thing I won’t allow Dominic to take from me. Love is not a luxury I can afford, but the sweetness of revenge has nothing on the taste of him…    This is the second book in the Flesh and Bone series. It is an MM shifter romance with no MPREG. Readers 18+ only. Note, this is a full-length book and will be roughly 70k words or more.",
