  "title": "Moonlight Beach: Murder and Magic",
  "description": "Moonlight Beach, adjoining the exclusive, opulent hamlet of Rancho California is a sleepy conclave in Southern California where median home prices top $5,000,000 and yearly incomes…well if you can afford a home there, then your income is commensurate. What has been shattering this sunny, sheltered little world? Death. Bodies washed up on Moonlight Beach. Grisly mutilations. Could it be sharks - hungry, hunting, doing what they do best? But, maybe it’s something else: something sinister, dangerous, perhaps even supernatural? Then there’s the cynical, greedy, local Venture Capitalists looking to start a company supplying organs to those with the need and the money; could they be responsible? Could their greed reach so far into such unimaginable violence? And how about the nearby coven of witches who often explore their own bizarre rituals and dark magic, could they be involved? As victims or willing participants? On a recent night, two more people are murdered on a cliff overlooking the beach – their organs are missing. Serial killer? Greed? Black magic?",
