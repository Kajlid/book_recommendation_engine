  "title": "The Whispers of Water",
  "description": "This book is a compilation of spoken word derived from the author's point of view. It unfolds truth told by the Spirit, and confirms the revelation of life through biblical reference, praise, poetry, and theology. It is the author's desire that \"The Whispers of Water\" will quench dehydrated souls, and help to inspire spiritual freedom. The “Whispers” are the author's signification of relativity to the world through her personal experiences. The “Water” is the pure substance given to the author by the Most High God through the Holy Spirit that any and every being can take part in, and be blessed with. Overall, this book serves as evidence to the world that spiritual freedom is created through the lessons learned from carnal captivity, as well as allowing God’s word to reside within our hearts.",
