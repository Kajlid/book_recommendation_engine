  "title": "The Grandmothers: A Family Portrait",
  "description": "Through the eyes of a grandson of today this segment of American Life is recaptured--a span of human experience stretching from the pioneers and the Civil War down to the present time. It is a moving and memorable expression of those things for which one is happy and proud to be an American. Here are dozens of characters--ministers, outlaws, farmers, lovers, sweet-hearts--all within the family circle fo the Towers, and all revolving about the axis of the \"old home\" in Wisconsin. \"About 'The Grandmothers',\" said Burton Rascoe, \"I find it difficult to remain calm. Its appearance at this time is comparable to the occasion when 'The Spoon River Anthology' was first given to the public. It is a novel with its roots in the American soil. It is a novel that gives a new significance to American life.\"",
