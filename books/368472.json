What if a dinosaur's friends come to play?Does he mope, does he pout if he can't get his way?Does he hide all his dump trucks, refusing to share?Does he throw his friends' coloring books up in the air?Time and time again, children are told to \"play nice.\" This brilliantly illustrated board book is packed with rhymes that will teach children how. Mark Teague's laugh-aloud illustrations, along with Jane Yolen's playful text, will show children that \"playing nice\" can be easy and fun. Perfect for parents to read aloud with their children, this book is as humorous as it is instructive.",
