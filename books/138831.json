  "description": "\"Hmmm, an alien, an angel, and a dead prophet. Welcome. We’ve been expecting you. Please come in.\" \nOperating a piece of heavy machinery, for example, a time machine under the influence of tainted human blood, is never a good idea, especially if my oldest friend and onboard computer, Lasitor, vowed to protect not only me but my bloodline for eternity.This is my story. If you haven't figured that out by now, I feel sorry for you and your parents. Anyhow, this is how I found my soulmate by accident in a time and place not written down in your human history books.My story comes with a warning label. It is a time travel, speculative science fiction fantasy—I’m spelling it out for those slow to grasp things like this. It contains elements that might shock or confuse you. Your human history about where you came from, and where you think you are going, might or might not be as you imagined. The explicit, graphic depictions of my love life and my travels are unsuitable for young, sensitive readers or anyone offended by gay sex.Thank you to the wonderful author who has taken the time to write it all down meticulously. \nCopyrighted © 2024 Anzulla, According to ISH - A New Beginnings M/M Series Book Three\n by Kashel Char.
