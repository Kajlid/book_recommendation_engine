  "description": "Meet Ashley Whitaker, a twenty-six-year-old advertising associate, who considers herself a modern-day Mary Tyler Moore. Filled with moxie and a contradicting wealth of insecurities, Ashley uses all her coping mechanisms to deal with the minefield of dating.After being dumped via text message, Ashley decides to focus her energies on her aspiring advertising career, becoming a Taekwondo badass, and funding a trip to Europe with a part-time waitressing job.It’s only when she discovers the magic of the Marinara Theory that her life takes a surprisingly positive turn upwards. Suddenly it seems as if the heavens have opened up and populated the universe with available bachelors seeking her affection. Even her ex (AKA Mr. Text Dumper) is susceptible to the Marinara Theory’s magic and wants Ashley back.The Marinara Theory also lands Ashley the role of manager of a lucrative new advertising account. But can Ashley rise to the challenge? It doesn’t help that tongues are wagging at work about a juicy rumor. There’s also office politics and her own self-doubt that she must overcome in order to lead her creative team and please the client.Will the power of the Marinara Theory dissipate like Cinderella’s glass slipper at midnight or will Ashley recognize the secret to sustainability? The answer can be found in the pages of The Marinara Theory, which humorously chronicles Ashley Whitaker as she searches to find self-empowerment and, with any luck, her Prince Charming.",
