  "description": "The CliffNotes to living well, the Scandinavian way.Diet and lifestyle guides are all the rage, but they tend to be too prescriptive and difficult to follow. And most self-help books are too long. Who has time to read 300+ pages or the discipline for a total lifestyle change overnight? Cue The Nordic Guide to Living 10 Years Longer. With this pragmatic little book that channels the healthy lifestyle of Scandinavia, 10 easy tips will add 10 healthy years to your life.Swedish doctor Bertil Marklund covers broad ground in this short book, providing a comprehensive guide to lifestyle choices, many of which are inspired by Nordic ideals about engaging in vigorous outdoor recreation, foraging for food such as berries, and—important to those in Northern climes—getting enough sunlight. Other tips cover areas such as sleep and the negative impact of stress. We can all make some of the changes outlined in the book without completely rethinking the way we live. By providing pragmatic and realistic advice, Dr. Marklund gives you the power to make a difference in your own life–today, and for the future.",
