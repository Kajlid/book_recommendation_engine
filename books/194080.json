  "description": "The conclusion to Caleb and Isabelle's story...Everything is going as planned, for the most part. With school, the club, and new responsibilities on the horizon, the life Caleb and Isabelle imagined together is so close they can taste it. But their happiness is also a fragile one--all it takes is one wrong turn, one stupid decision and their happily ever after shatters all over the highway.Because as old threats resurface and new ones rise, the most deadly enemy of all lies not in outside forces, but inside the club itself. How do you follow orders when you know those orders might destroy everything you love? How do you move forward when all your best-laid plans slip right through your fingertips?Choice breeds consequence. Hope rises from the ashes. Love weathers any storm. And in the end, every road leads home.**Carry You Home is not a standalone and is the sequel to Carry Your Heart. It is intended for readers 18 and older**",
