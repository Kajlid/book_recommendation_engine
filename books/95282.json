Given the opportunity to run away, she takes it, but her hope of love is crushed by betrayal and she finds herself lost and alone with nowhere else to run.Lucus is a nature loving werewolf and it’s his job to make sure no vampire’s cross into his packs territory. Except when he finds the lone Alexandria passed out from exhaustion he can’t do what he knows needs to be done. Instead in a moment of panic he hides her from the others, and does what he can to protect her from not just from his pack, but from a rogue bunch of vampires that have an unexplainable hatred of Alexandria’s family.",
