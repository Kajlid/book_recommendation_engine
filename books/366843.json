Too bad he hates women. Ever since his first wife betrayed him, Colt has steered clear of entanglements, ignoring his own potent masculine needs.Renny should never have accepted Colt's drunken marriage proposal but she just couldn't help herself. She's hopelessly in love with her brand-new husband. She might not have the sexy curves of a centerfold model, but she yearns to unleash the raw power he keeps reined beneath that icy, indifferent fa√ßade.While Renny struggles to save her fledgling marriage and change her husband's mind about women, the love-wary Colt finds himself fighting the intense attraction he feels for her. When all is said and done, Colt's once-scarred and damaged heart will belong to Miss September.",
