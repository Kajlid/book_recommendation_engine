  "description": "In this life there are givers and takers. It’s safe to say that vampires are very much in the latter camp. They don’t have much time for the givers of this world – except perhaps at mealtimes…Welcome to Lancre, where the newest residents are a thoroughly modern, sophisticated vampire family. They’ve got style and fancy waistcoats. They’re out of the casket and want a bite of the future.Everyone knows you don’t invite vampires into your house – unless you want permanent guests – nonetheless the King of Lancre has invited them to stay and celebrate the birth of his daughter. Now these vampires have no intention of leaving… ever.But they haven’t met the neighbours yet.Between the vampires and their next meal stand the witches of Lancre: Granny Weatherwax, Nanny Ogg, Magrat and young Agnes. But as the residents of Lancre are about to discover, it will take more than garlic and crucifixes to take back their home.The Discworld novels can be read in any order but Carpe Jugulum is the sixth book in the Witches series.",
