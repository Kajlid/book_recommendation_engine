  "description": "The Kings of Carnage clubhouse is no place for a good girl, but I’m not the good girl they envision. After getting tangled up in Carnage business, it isn’t long before I'm tangled up in their sheets. All they see is my blonde hair and sweet smile and they want to dirty me up a little. I'm a splash of pink within the leather-clad army, standing out like a tampon in a condom factory. But it’s not my fault they underestimated me. I might like girly things but I’m much more likely to spray you with bullets then sprinkle you with glitter. I could just tell them they have me labeled all wrong. But then, where’s the fun in that?  Please be advised that this book may cause shallow breathing, exploding ovaries and spontaneous disintegration of panties. As a result, all readers should be over the age of 18 and refrain from reading in public places.  Trigger warning: This book contains swearing, violence and sexy fun times with not one but three bikers.",
