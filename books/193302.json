  "title": "Donald Trump in the Bible Code: New Testament Echoes of Americaâ€™s Future Leader",
  "description": "My beloved builds a wall. The burdens of Caesar (taxes) are lightened. He demands justice from the alien. In a breezy pamphlet of just 3,000 words that is sure irk some and delight others, statistician Jason Alan Hogue, who is also author of America in the Bible Code, reports his research of what he calls the New Testament Code for Bible-based predictions about Donald Trump. Using a dynamic algorithm rather than a chain-seeking algorithm, and analyzing the New Testament rather than the Torah, the author finds fascinating strings of prophetic utterances in which the name Trump emerged, and presents them with a minimum of commentary. The author is not affiliated with any political party or political campaign and is not related to other authors of the same last name.",
