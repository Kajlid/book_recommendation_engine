I am a woman and I am a man.\"\"If you don't find an ideal man by your age... it doesn't mean that you like girls. Don't worry, you can find a man! You will not be an old maid.\"\"That was also when these police officers, who were meant to protect the public, became my pimps.\"What can be more deep and personal than reading what a woman wrote of her experiences?

You won't be able to tear your eyes away as you read their quiet whispers of horror, while trying to understand why this still happens in other cultures today.

And for a woman to survive in such a culture she must have enormous strength to defend her own or her children's lives from violence and oppression.
