  "description": "Award-winning photographer Rachael Hale's 101 SALIVATIONS is a delightful collection of 101 dog portraits that will become a must-have for dog lovers everywhere. Rachael Hale's signature style catches the eye of everyone who comes across it. Featuring 101 color photographs of Chihuahuas, Great Danes, and everything in between, 101 SALIVATIONS presents dogs in all sorts of wonderful poses that bring out their most endearing characteristics. Rachael's secret to capturing a dog's soul is to focus on his eyes-whether they are wide and shining, or heavy-lidded, in the throes of slumber. Within this book we can see the soul of our own best buddies staring back at us. The book is peppered with humorous and touching quotations from well-known authors such as A.A. Milne and Fran Lebowitz.",
