  "description": "FOR FANS OF TONY HILLERMAN AND ANNE HILLERMAN This mystery mingles Choctaw culture, science, and murder and features Lieutenant Sam Chitto of the Oklahoma Choctaw Tribal Police. Chitto considers himself a man of principal, but he's at a breaking point. His father's ten-years old murder, his young wife's premature death, and an ineffective law enforcement community has him ready to quit the force. Indian women are the ones paying the highest price. One in three can expect to be raped in her lifetime, and tribal police cannot arrest the assailant if he is not Indian. And then, Chitto is assigned to work on a mystifying case that forces him to make a decision that could not only challenge his personal code of ethics but also cost a man his life.",
