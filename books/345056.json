  "description": "The Federalist Papers were eighty-five essays in support of the U.S. Constitution written by James Madison, Alexander Hamilton and John Jay in 1787 and 1788, and published under the pseudonym \"Publius\" in New York newspapers. They are invaluable resources for understanding the intentions of the drafters of the Constitution.(particularly important to adherents of the legal doctrine of 'originalism,' such as Antonin Scalia). Two of the most important, covering special interest groups and checks and balances are reproduced here.",
