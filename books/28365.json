  "title": "Janet Frame: The Complete Autobiography",
  "description": "New Zealand's preeminent writer Janet Frame brings the skill of an extraordinary novelist and poet to these vivid and haunting recollections, gathered here for the first time in a single volume. From a childhood and adolescence spent in a poor but intellectually intense railway family, through life as a student, and years of incarceration in mental hospitals, eventually followed by her entry into the saving world of writers and the \"Mirror City\" that sustains them, we are given not only a record of the events of a life, but also \"the transformation of ordinary facts and ideas into a shining palace of mirrors.\"Frame's journey of self-discovery, from New Zealand to London, to Paris and Barcelona, and then home again, is a heartfelt and courageous account of a writer's beginnings as well as one woman's personal struggle to survive.",
