Every night the dreams continued to torture her with images of a man she had no recollection of ever knowing. Westly and his love for her was so intense. Abigail was left feeling guilty and confused. Questions to an old college friend about this mystery man went unanswered, leaving her wanting to ask more.During the day she tried to push the dreams and Westly from her mind, but the lingering feeling of his hands on her skin was hard to ignore.

What she would discover would not only stop the dreams but also answer all of her questions.In one day, her life would change in more ways than one.
