  "title": "Casanova and the Devil's Doorbell",
  "description": "Forget everything you thought you knew about the world’s greatest lover…History records that Casanova completed the twelve volumes of his memoirs and settled in Castle Dux in Bohemia to live out his senior years in a disgraceful and largely undeserved style. It was only with the discovery of Casanova and the Devil’s Doorbell, written by his late valet Jacques del Rosso, that historians realized we need to reappraise his mature years. Casanova, it turns out, was more spirited and more enterprising than history has given him credit for.Jacques’ journal faithfully recounts the intrigues and dalliances therein that occurred in the times just preceding the French revolution – and Casanova’s role. The memoir appears to be a compilation of the highlights of their adventures together during the years 1787 to 1793, a tumultuous time in history. Casanova was nearing the age of seventy, but, as you will see, age posed no barrier to his dauntless pursuits.The memoir was found lying in a hidden vault in the Palazzo Malipiero in Venice, a known haunt of Jacques and Casanova. It is not for those who are faint- hearted or for those who are set on judging works and men by modern day standards of political correctness. For readers who can suspend their moral high ground and enjoy the hijinks of one of history’s great rogues, a rollicking read awaits.",
