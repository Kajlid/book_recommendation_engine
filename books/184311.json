  "description": "If Doreen Gray were to take a selfie upon her arrival at the elite Chandler Academy, it would capture a face marked with acne, a head full of frizz, and eyes looking anywhere but at the lens.What Chandler queen bee Heidi Whelan sees is a desperate hunger for acceptance and the makings of a willing and useful protÃ©. Heidi's roommate, Biz Gibbons-Brown, works her Photoshop magic to create a stunning profile pic of Doreen -- a glossy, digital makeover that Doreen initially rejects . . . only to wake up the next morning transformed as the girl in the picture.But Doreen quickly becomes accustomed to her newfound power and lives without considering consequences of her actions. Only the picture knows the truth, and she will do anything to protect her secret.In this sharp, scandal-filled retelling of Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray , the men of nineteenth-century London become three girls of twenty-first-century New England.",
