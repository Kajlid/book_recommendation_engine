  "description": "When Nigel Bloodragon, Duke of Sarcen, goes to Earth to find a woman willing and able to pose as the queen to ferret out her enemies, he spies MP Cpl. Josephine Benat in action, subduing a criminal, and is immediately convinced she's perfect for the job. It isn't until after Nigel has dragged her to Atar that Josie manages to convince him that she has no interest in glory or riches, but that's when they both discover they have a serious problem. The portal is unstable, they've arrived in the wrong time, and they must seek Goldenwing to find their way back. This is when Nigel discovers they have another serious problem. Unlike the females of the dragon clan, human females are always in season. Rating: Contains violence, adult language, and graphic sexual content.",
