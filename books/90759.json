  "description": "\"If you're so concerned about my humanity, Elena, then reach into my soul and find it, because I'm not sure I have any left.\" According to the FBI, I was considered a serial murderer after three kills. What do they call me after fifty-two? They call me the Silencer. One final bullet would have been all it took to stop me from taking another soul, and I would have been doing Meridian City a service by pulling that trigger. An angel crying for help stopped me, and that night, I took three lives for her. Then three turned into eight. Then eight turned into twenty. Twenty turned into twenty-one. Twenty one turned into twenty-three. Elena Young is the hero in my story, but Iâ€™m the villain in hers. And this is the kind of story where the villain gets the girl, even if it kills her.",
