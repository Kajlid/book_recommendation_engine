  "description": "Twenty-two year old Norah Johnson is at a crossroads and is in desperate need to heal after a highly publicized breakup from her major league baseball player boyfriend. To escape, she moves to her summer home in The Hamptons with her sister and best friend where she journals, attends therapy and works on her pending clothing line all the while wondering how fast can a heart really heal. Well, it sure helps when part of the healing process involves living in a fabulous summer home on the beach with your sister and absolute BFF. The best psychologist since Good Will Hunting always helps. And then there's the hottie, much older version of Taylor Lautner look-alike who finds your lost journal, reads it and falls madly in love with you, \"the you on paper\", and is set on finding you and making you fall in love with him. Okay, so this can all really help! But is Norah ready to love again? The Last Page is a PG, language-free, sex-free, short novel (40k words) suitable for all ages. This book is an inspirational light hearted read about living and loving again. This series can be read as stand alone novels.",
