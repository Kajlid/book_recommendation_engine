  "description": "Following the Eisner-award winning Brazen , Pénélope Bagieu pens her first autobiographical work in this hilarious and bitter sweet graphic memoir.Pénélope Bagieu never thought she'd publish a graphic memoir. But when she dusted off her old diaries (no, really―this book is based on her actual diaries), she found cringe-worthy, hilarious, and heartbreaking stories begging to be drawn.In Layers , Bagieu reflects on her childhood and teen years with her characteristic wit and unflinching honesty. The result is fifteen short stories about friendship, love, grief, and those awkward first steps toward adulthood.",
