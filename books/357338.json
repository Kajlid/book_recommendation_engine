They also find their relationship deepening, unable to deny the attraction that exists between them. Kade's freedom from slavery and Surial's release from his family's tyranny allow them to explore the boundaries of their bond, which goes far beyond Kade's ability to help Surial recover from using his healing gift.While they rejoice in discovering new intimacy, Kade follows where the winds lead, trying to stop the slavers who would destroy his people. Surial isn't sure he can bear it if Kade becomes a killer, and he can't help but voice his worries, making Kade worry that he will lose his One through his own actions. Can these two very different men find a way to keep their fledgling love alive, or will it be over before they really begin?",
