  "description": "To outfit his new gym, trainer Cooper Fitzgerald is looking for fresh boxing talent. Male boxing talent, that is. So what on earth is he thinking by taking on Jamie Sawyer? She's stubborn, difficult, aggressive—and far too hot for the kind of close contact training requires. But her skill in the ring is turning his professional head.Too bad his isn't the only head that's turning. Jamie and her skimpy little shorts have all the guys forgetting the power she packs in a punch. And when Jamie offers Cooper her irresistible body—no strings attached—he's down for the count. But can Cooper keep the line between trainer and sex buddy…or is he setting himself up for another knockout?",
