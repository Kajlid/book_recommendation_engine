  "title": "Chloes",
  "description": "A parakeet appears on a branch outside Chloe Fortinâ€™s window one spring morning in Montreal. Its arrival can't begin to foretell the unlikely events that follow. Chloes explores our tendency towards multiple selves. Experiencing unbounded bliss one moment, only to later find it out of reach. Or burrowing into our grief, wishing we could send another version of ourselves out into the world. When we open our lives to a stranger, sometimes our wildest fantasies are only a universe away.*with illustrations by Nicole Legault",
