  "description": "Jacko’s life has been a series of people taking advantage of him that should have protected him and his sister. The only chance he saw to end it was to win a fight for rank contest hosted by a new pack alpha, but a rock to the head stopped that plan cold. Despite not winning the fight, the alpha not only gave him a place in the pack, but also rescued his little sister from his evil mother.  Lavi and Van are vampire elders and the sight of them makes Jacko’s wolf pant. They are everything he’s ever wanted and so out of his league, but they are just what he needs to protect his sister. It doesn’t take long for him to realize the vampires might be his mates, but he isn’t the only one wanting a piece of the hot powerful vampires. Is he strong enough to protect them?",
