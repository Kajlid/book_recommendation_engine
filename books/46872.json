  "description": "In 1775, Sarah Himmel, reared parentless in the Moravian Christian community of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, marries a stranger to accompany him as a missionary to the Indians of the Ohio wilderness. On the banks of the Elk's Eye, Wind Maiden dreams of a man but marries a boy. Despite the two women's differences, friendship grows. Against the backdrop of the Revolutionary War, through joy and misery, birth and death, they sustain one another until strength triumphs over weakness and life reigns over death. DANCING THROUGH FIRE is a carefully researched account of the events from 1775 to 1782 which culminated in the massacre of more than 90 Christian Indians at Gnadenhutten in eastern Ohio. All historic events are actual, and all secondary characters are real. Although fictional, the novel's main characters are accurate depictions of Indians and Moravian missionaries of the Revolutionary War period. DANCING THROUGH FIRE is a recipient of the OHIO ARTS COUNCIL FELLOWSHIP GRANT FOR CREATIVE WRITING.",
