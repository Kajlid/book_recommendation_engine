  "description": "Jonathan Smith thinks he’s a regular twelve-year-old living a normal life in England with his parents. His first clue to the contrary is the faceless monsters in suits and bowler hats that crash into his family’s cottage. It’s not until he wakes up alone in the unfamiliar village of Hobbes End that his true identity is revealed: his mother’s a demon, his dad’s an angel, and his grandfather Gabriel is the village’s angel-turned-clockmaker. As Jonathan’s one-of-a-kind angel-demon powers start to kick in, he wonders if he can prevent the archdemon Belial from taking over Heaven and Hell . . . let alone round up his parents. A swashbuckling fantasy debut!",
