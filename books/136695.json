  "description": "Do you struggle to make time to write? Does it matter if you’re not sure of your novel’s genre? How much detail do you need for world building? What’s the difference between First and Third Person? Is there guidance on how to structure a story? What’s a character arc? How do I write a synopsis? There are guides and rules that will answer the above, but you might not find them all in the same place. This book gets to the point - in a simple way. There’s no room for complicated jargon or theory. What do you need to know, and how should you apply it? Creative writing is about building on an idea, creating great characters, twisting a plot, gripping the reader, and giving life to a world. Words are the life of stories.",
