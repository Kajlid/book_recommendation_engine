  "description": "A few months ago, Spencer Perry made a deal with the devil. Or, more aptly, Hades. With her boyfriend back from the dead, honoring those promised nightly trips to the Underworld has gotten more complicated. Torn between loyalty towards Micah and duty towards Hadrian, Spencer has enough to deal with without having to worry about Persephone. Unfortunately, the original Gravewalker is hell bent on unleashing malicious spirits on the world, and she thinks Spencer is standing in her way. Attempting to stop Persephone means learning how to use her new abilities, and more time in the Underworld with Hadrian, a fact Micah strongly dislikes. With the clock already ticking down, Spencer needs to accept this new role she's been given, and maybe accept that some feelings, and some loves, don't actually last forever.",
