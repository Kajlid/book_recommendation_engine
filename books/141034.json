  "description": "Mike Ripton \"Ripp\" is witty, covered in muscle, rides a motorcycle, and drives a 1969 Chevelle. he's tattooed, and has 4 piercings on his cock. He has never been in love, nor has he ever been in an actual relationship. He does relationships, 'just not for that long'. He boxes professionally, and fights bare knuckles matches in the 'hood' for cash. Ripp is a take me or leave me type of alpha male that won't change for anyone. When he meets the 'most beautiful woman in the word' one day in the bar, a local prominent attorney, he decides she'll be his next 'victim'. Little does he realize that he just might be hers. She eagerly admits she's attracted to one type of male, and one type only. Bad Boy. Alpha. Tattooed. And. Dominant. As long as she's in a relationship. But Ripp doesn't do relationships..... Unstoppable is steamy. The type that fanning yourself wont fix. It's got alpha males. Fighting. Tattoos. Muscles. And above all, it's got Mike Ripton.",
