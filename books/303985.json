  "description": "Women have no ability to cast spells. That's what wizards have said for generations—and it's a lie.In this second book of the Clandestine Magic trilogy, Beatrix Harper wants to expose that lie to protect her sister's life. Her desperate plan: Train tens of thousands of women in secret, then shock the nation with a display of their magic. She thinks it will work—if only she can keep the details from her town's wizard, Peter Blackwell.But that's nearly impossible thanks to their unwanted magical connection. Peter, meanwhile, fears that his own desperate goal—to counter the terrible weapon he should never have invented—is doomed to fail.Their plans are about to collide. Disastrously.If you're a reader who prefers to know upfront whether a book has a happy ending, what the level of violence or trauma is, whether there are sex scenes and how substantial a part romance plays in the plot, you can find a link to those details in Colleen Cowley's author profile. One scene in the book includes a character discussing a past trauma, and the link has more specifics.What reviewers are saying about Subversive, Clandestine Magic #1:\"Readers who enjoy fantasy stories with strong female protagonists, magical powers, intriguing political plots, and a great love story will love Subversive.\" — One Book More\"A spectacular story of magic, politics, social classes, and the uncompromising need to do what you think is right.\" — Bookshelf Adventures\"An exciting new series! ...
