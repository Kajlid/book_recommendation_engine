  "description": "Vonnie was just beginning to feel at home in Houston. She was doing well in school, had made new friends and was even getting to be known as a leader. Things had settled down after the unfortunate shoplifting episode, and she and Monique seemed to have reached an understanding. But all that happened before Vonnie founded the Graphology Club and their old rivalry flared up again. Now Vonnie was beginning to question not only her own position but also the loyalty of her friends. Could she regain her self-confidence and keep her friends or would Monique destroy the person she was trying so hard to be?",
