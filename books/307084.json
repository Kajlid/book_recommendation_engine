In this strange new world, which James learns is called Torpor, he befriends Stevie. With her help, James competes to become a Whiteflyer to gain access to the other worlds and to find his girlfriend Liza. Will he master the powers of Air, Fire, Water and Earth, or will the growing tension between James and Torpor’s leader, The Controller, stand in his way?",
