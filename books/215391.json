  "description": "An unsuspecting boy, his dead pet fish, and his well-intentioned mother make this a must-read for fans of The Bear Ate Your Sandwich and I Want My Hat Back. Splotch was meant to be in his bowl when his boy got home from school--but he isn't there! There's only one conclusion: he must have run away. But when he mysteriously returns, all is well again. Except...Splotch's distinctive spot has moved and the only explanation is that he has been CHANGED BY ALIENS! When the spot moves yet again, it's clear something fishy is going on. This hilarious story poses the question that, when it comes to this family, who is protecting whom? Spot-on kid-humor and splashy illustrations are a signature of Gianna Marino's work. The perfect follow-up to I Am the Mountain Mouse and Night Animals, Splotch! will not disappoint!",
