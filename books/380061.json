  "description": "Farhana and Faraz are twins, born 6 minutes apart. Both are in turmoil as they approach the holy time of Ramadan. Farhana has to decide whether her faith is strong enough for her to wear the hijab at school and whether she can give up her relationship with handsome Malik. Faraz has fallen in with a street gang headed by unscrupulour Skrooz, when all he really wants is to combine his faith and his talent for art. Both teenagers have life-changing choices to make, against the peaceful backdrop of Ramadan. Do Farhana and Faraz have enough courage to do the right thing? And can they help each other - or will one of them draw the other towards catastrophe? When Faraz finally says no to the drug-dealing demands of Skrooz, it sets off a dangerous chain of events. This powerful novel explores ideas of right and wrong, and honour, and what they mean to different generations of Muslim families living in the west.",
