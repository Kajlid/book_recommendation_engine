  "description": "With green Aliens, interplanetary travel and rampant sex, God is a Mortician is a parable about society, politics, morality and more, as up to date as the latest headlines, and more fun than a barrel of monkeys.Aliens have found a way to suck up mental energy from earth’s minions. In fact, aliens from all over the galaxy can use earth as a pit-stop to refuel their ships by drawing off this crazy energy from the minds of humans.Meet the characters: God (Bubba), Jesus, our hero Miguel and his alien-turned-nympho lover, Sho-shota. The subject matter and unabashed mockery aren't for the faint of heart.Some readers may be reminded of Kurt Vonnegut and others of Hunter Thompson, but one thing is certain:◆◆◆Finn Briscoe is a fearless writer, unafraid to go where his imagination takes him.◆◆◆",
