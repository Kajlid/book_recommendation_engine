They’ve bedded supermodels, famous actresses and pop stars, but this year, Alec proposes they go after someone from their past--someone ‘normal’ yet elusive--and give them the time of their life.Brandon and Connor have to think hard about their prospects, but Alec knows exactly who he wants go after: Dahlia Bridges--a girl who has haunted him since their playground days. He thinks she could be the missing puzzle piece in his otherwise full, decadent life and he will do everything in his power to make her his.But how much will it take?",
