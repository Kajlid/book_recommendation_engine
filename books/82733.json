It’s all or nothing. In moving forward to make her his—completely—he promises that if she submits she’ll discover what she craves too.

When she does let loose, Lucien fears that he is the one getting closer to being burned. As the two of them get deeper into a dangerous sexual dance, Lucien can’t help but wonder if the exquisite firestorm that Elise has ignited could expose his secrets, draw him dangerously close to the edge, and leave his future in ashes.Includes a bonus excerpt of Beth Kery’s Release",
