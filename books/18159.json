  "description": "In The Broken, people shop at Walmart, and magic only lives in fairy tales; in The Weird, aristocrats still rule and the strength of your magic controls your fate; and The Edge is the borderland where anything can happen...Audrey Callahan has a unique talent: no door is closed to her; and – thanks to her Edge family, a motley crew of grifters and layabouts – she's a consummate conwoman. But she's severed all ties with her past, finally gotten a legitimate job in The Broken, and Audrey couldn’t be happier. But now her dad has swindled her into one last job...What do you get when you take the best thief, grifter and gambler make him into a secret agent? You get Kaldar Mar. Judge Dobe probably put it best, “I guess you’re familiar with the law. You hit it over the head, set its house on fire, and got its sister pregnant.” Deeply scarred by his aunt’s death, Kaldar has some scores to settle – and his new assignment might let him do just that. A priceless object has been stolen and Kaldar must retrieve it at any cost. Piece of cake…until Audrey shows up after the same item.So what happens when a former thief finds herself matching wits with a jack of all trades? One thing is certain: Neither one will ever be the same.",
