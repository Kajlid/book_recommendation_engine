  "description": "Now a Major Motion Picture starring Ewan McGregor and Emily Blunt Winner of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction 2007. Shortlisted for the British Book Awards, Newcomer of the Year, 2008. A Richard and Judy Summer Read Selection. Written as a \"report into the circumstances surrounding the decision to introduce salmon into the Yemen\", this is a novel that is made up of e-mails, letters, diary extracts, records of the prime minister's Question Time, interviews, and chapters from the memoirs of a fantastically weaselly Peter Mandelson-type figure. The \"Yes Minister\" comparisons are justified (and there is some brilliant, hilarious political and bureaucratic satire here), but at its heart, this is the story of a hen-pecked, slightly pompous, middle-aged scientist who finds himself caught up in what seems like an impossible project, and of how this project changes his life. In the process, he becomes an unlikely and rather loveable hero, discovers true love for himself, finds himself both a pawn and then a victim of political spin, leaves his brilliantly horrible wife, and learns to believe in the impossible. And he takes the listener with him in the process. Complete and unabridged edition read by a full cast including John Sessions, Samantha Bond, Andrew Sachs, Andrew Marr and many more.",
