  "description": "Psychopomp Volume 1: Cracked Plate is the story of Meena, who suffers a mental fracture on Portland's light rail that alters her life in an instant. Confused and afraid that her unexpected unraveling will result in universal rejection, Meena confronts a man in a coffee shop and asks if he'll be her stalker. Meanwhile, her parents Esther and Frank fly to Portland from Cleveland's Slavic Village to better measure their daughter's distress, while revealing the inexplicable mental gifts informing Meena's crack, and their own. Repair of all plates might be possible with the assistance of Lola, who witnesses Meena's fracture and learns that she is a psychopomp, a conductor of souls. Lola has something that belongs to Meena, but can only return it with the guidance of voices she's been told that no one should hear.Invocation, observation, and hallucination, PSYCHOPOMP examines the American Dream after waking, and new dreams escaping sleep.",
