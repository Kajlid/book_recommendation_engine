  "description": "It's technology must evolve alongside magic. Trained from boyhood to be protectorate of the only known community of survivors in a post-apocalyptic world, Blaze's life takes a devastating turn when he fails to save the Order from an unexpected and devastating attack. When his mentor turns executioner, Blaze gets arrested for treason and falls victim to Toka's secret genetic engineering experiments. He’s further thrown into confusion when his legendary combat skills prove useless against the magical powers of a small, unintimidating alien woman. After Evelia, his unquenchable crush, becomes the alien’s unexpected apprentice, Blaze is called to lead mankind’s last few survivors to a surprising a technologically advanced civilization governed by magic. With death, treason, treachery, and genetically modified monsters at every corner, that may not be so easy. Featured on Wattpad, Moon 514 quickly gathered nearly 80,000 reads. Young adult readers who enjoy action packed page-turners will love Moon 514’s unique and hopeful twist on a post-apocalyptic world. Consider it a thriller-paced mashup of Star Wars meets Divergent.",
