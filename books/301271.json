  "title": "Dark Horses",
  "description": "A searing and darkly gripping debut novel about a teenaged girl’s fierce struggle to reclaim her life from her abusive father.Fifteen-year-old equestrian prodigy Roan Montgomery has only ever known two worlds: inside the riding arena, and outside of it. Both, for as long as she can remember, have been ruled by her father, who demands strict obedience in all aspects of her life. The warped power dynamic of coach and rider extends far beyond the stables, and Roan's relationship with her father has long been inappropriate. She has been able to compartmentalize that dark aspect of her life, ruthlessly focusing on her ambitions as a rider heading for the Olympics, just as her father had done. However, her developing relationship with Will Howard, a boy her own age, broadens the scope of her vision.  A page-turner and urgent survivor story, Dark Horses takes the searing themes of abuse and resilience in Gabriel Tallent’s My Absolute Darling and applies the compelling exploration of female strength in Emma Donoghue’s Room. In much the same way that V.C. Andrews’s Flowers in the Attic transfixed a generation, Dark Horses will keep you turning the pages.",
