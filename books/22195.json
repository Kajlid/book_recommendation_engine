  "description": "\"Everyone hates Glenda. So when retired movie star Glenda Dupree was murdered at Fairbanks, her antebellum mansion near Nashville, Tennessee, there was much speculation, but no one missed her much. Prior to leaving life on earth, Glenda had managed to offend everyone in sight, including her neighbor, a (mostly) law-abiding horse trainer named Cat Enright. Cat finds Glenda s body and is implicated in the murder, and also in the disappearance of a ten-year-old neighbor, Bubba Henley. Cat thinks Bubba s disappearance ties into the murder and realizes her name will not be cleared until he is found. Although a Henley ancestor built Fairbanks, the current Henley clan lives next door in a scruffy trailer. Because the police treat the missing boy as a runaway Cat begins her quest to find Bubba, solve Glenda s murder, and clear her name. An unpopular sheriff and upcoming election mean the pressure to close the case is on. With the help of her riding students, a (possibly) psychic horse, a local cop, a kid named Frog, and an eccentric client of a certain age with electric blue hair, Cat takes time from her horse training business to try to solve the case and keep herself out of prison.\"",
