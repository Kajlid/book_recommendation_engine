  "description": "In a world that is full of fear and doubts. This book takes you on a journey of mystical beauty. Not a shroud or shred from this real world. A little fantasy of words composed in poetry to take you away too far off lands with mysteries, hypnotizing your senses. To two of a kind, the myths and legends of dragons, the mystical unicorns, butterflies, and the hummingbird. Then it is up to you to run away with your imagination with painting the sky whatever you choose.",
