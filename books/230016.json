  "description": "Devon March has grown up knowing two things: the monsters in the closet are real, and he is stronger than they are. But at fifteen years old, he still doesn’t know why. Now an orphan, Devon has been sent to live at Ravenscliff Manor with the foreboding Amanda Muir Crandall, her troubled nephew Alexander, and her feisty daughter Cecily. In the dark seaside mansion, plagued by ghosts, Devon learns the answers to at least some of his questions. Namely, his birthright as a sorcerer of the Order of the Nightwing, a three-thousand-year-old tradition of mysticism and magic, with roots that run deep in Ravenscliff. Living in the most mysterious place in a small town filled with colorful characters, Devon will have to quickly decide who he can trust, as Ravenscliff’s worst nightmare is about to return – and Devon is the last line of defense.",
