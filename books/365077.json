Cut off from the Woodland building's business office and its trove of magical weapons, the exiled free Fables now must turn to their oldest and most powerful members - the witches and warlocks who once occupied the Woodland's 13th floor - to defeat this latest adversary. But even as those still trapped within the business office struggle against a legion of uncaged foes, rivalries within the Fables' sorcerous community threaten to fracture their united front - and open them up to destruction.Collecting: Fables 86-93",
