Though tragic, that accident granted him certain abilities that he now uses to protect those who had forgotten him. Jadon Cain is the Vigilante.  Orion is the leader of the criminal organization that is terrorizing the good citizens of the city of Orias. He is cruel, vicious and has no regard for human life. He also is enhanced with unbreakable skin, superior speed and strength. He is unbeatable, and he knows exactly who the Vigilante is.  Jadon refuses to kill anyone he fights, but Orion threatens to destroy all that he holds most dear, forcing Jadon to make a terrible choice. Save the woman he loves from Orion’s wrath, or save the city and the people he protects.  The Vigilante’s Choice is book two of The Vigilante Series of books and concludes the epic love story that began in Vigilante, which is book one. This series of novels puts a fresh spin on the male hero, the woman that loves him and those he's sworn to protect.",
