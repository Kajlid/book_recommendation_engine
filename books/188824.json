  "description": "There are many legends on the planet of the Dorsai, the breeding ground for heroes. Here are two of them.Lost The New Dorsai Companion contains the Hugo Award winning novella, Lost Dorsai , and Dickson's classic short story \"Warrior.\"Plus, the New Dorsai Companion contains, for the first time ever, an all new Concordance of the Childe Cycle--a roadmap of Dickson's massive and brilliant creation. The Concordance will let you know not only in which books or stories a person or place is mentioned, but will give you a brief history or biography that explains their significance in the Cycle. It's a Who's Who of the future--and no science fiction reader should be without it.",
