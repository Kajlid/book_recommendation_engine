  "title": "Sister Satan",
  "description": "Although she has three younger brothers, 15 year old Lauren Anderson is a lonely teenager who’s spent most of her time yearning for a sister, a companion. But, as the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for. One moonlit night, using ancient knowledge of the supernatural taught by her grandfather Ute Werner, she decides to conjure up a sister on her own. However, something goes horribly wrong and what she conjures is Rachel, an exact duplicate —a Doppelganger— from the bowels of hell who is the exact opposite of Lauren in nature, bent on wrath and destruction. As the evil twin with ungodly powers, Rachel lives for the kill and frequently scans Lauren’s mind in a quest for revenge, brutally slaughtering those who have offended Lauren. When Lauren discovers the truth, she tries to keep her thoughts neutral, but how does a teenager whose hormones are raging quell her childish anger against those she comes across on a daily basis?",
