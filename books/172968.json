  "description": "Is there a statute of limitation on heartbreak? Rhiann Baron-Wilde hopes so. Surely eight years is long enough…right?  After chasing her dream of living in New York and working in the fashion industry, Rhi suddenly isn’t so sure that’s what she really wants to do anymore. After all, the hush-hush stories she’s been writing—stuff about white knights and forever after—are calling to her.  Then, Liam Ashforth turns up eight long years after walking away from their secret love affair. And not just any old reappearance—not him! No, he’s come back as her boss in a move that shakes up Rhiann’s whole world.  Liam makes it clear—he wants her back. But can she believe him? Should she trust him again? After all, they hadn’t exactly parted as friends. Then again, maybe this is her very own happily ever after?  But secrets and lies have a way of coming back to haunt in sometimes surprising ways and an unexpected twist that threatens more than their feelings puts these two to the ultimate test.  Wilde Heart is the second book in the Wilde Women series about three sisters who weren’t exactly looking for love by romantica suthor, Suzanne Halliday.",
