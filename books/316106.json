Reader discretion is advised.**IMPORTANT: Somewhere along the way in the formatting process, I accidentally switched up chapters 25-29. It was a simple fix, BUT if you don’t know it, it’s very confusing to read around 😅If your chapter 25 begins with “This is Naomi,...” then you, my dear, have a limited edition!! I’m encouraged that Amazon will remedy this mixup asap. If you have a jacked up chapter 25-29, then the reading order should be the following: … Chapters 1-24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 25, then 30-endTo thank you for being the owner of a limited edition copy, I’d love to throw a giveaway! If you have a digital copy with a chapter 25 that starts with “This is Naomi,” please send me a pic and you’ll be entered to win a signed paperback!
