  "title": "Healing from Depression: 12 Weeks to a Better Mood : A Body, Mind, and Spirit Recovery Program",
  "description": "Over 100 million people worldwide are diagnosed with clinical depression each year. As stars like Rosie O’Donnell bring their battle with depression into the spotlight, the disease becomes less and less a shameful secret. In HEALING FROM DEPRESSION, Douglas Bloch shares his struggle with a life-threatening depressive illness, and explains how the power of prayer and other holistic approaches ultimately led to his recovery. As one of the estimated 19 million Americans who suffer from depression, Bloch could not be helped by such “miracle” drugs as Prozac. Therefore, he had to seek out conventional and alternative non-drug methods of healing. The result is HEALING FROM DEPRESSION, a 12-week program that combines his inspirational story with a comprehensive manual on how to diagnose and treat depression, offering new hope and practical strategies to everyone who suffers from this debilitating condition.",
