  "title": "I Hope This Finds You Well: Poems",
  "description": "Kate Baer returns with a collection of erasure poems created from notes she received from followers, supporters and detractors—an art form that reclaims the vitriol from online trolls and inspires readers to transform what is ugly or painful in their own lives into something beautiful.“I'm sure you could benefit from jumping on a treadmill”“Women WANT a male leader...It’s honest to god the basic human playbook”These are some of the thousands of online messages Kate Baer has received. Like countless other writers—particularly women—with internet profiles, as Kate’s online presence grew, so did the darker messages crowding her inbox. These missives from strangers have ranged from “advice” and opinions to outright harassment. At first these messages resulted in an immediate delete and block. Until, on a whim, Baer decided to transform the cruelty into art, using it to create fresh and intriguing poems. These pieces, along with ones made from notes of gratitude and love, as well as from the words of public figures, have become some of her most beloved work. Baer offers us a lesson in empowerment, showing how we too can turn bitterness into beauty.",
