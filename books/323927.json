  "title": "Mosquitoes & Whisky",
  "description": "A semi-autobiographical account of growing up in Winnipeg, Mosquitoes & Whisky details the author's struggle to escape boredom in the city of mosquitoes and ice. This prequel to 2004's I Was a Punk Before You Were a Punk is an candid snapshot of teenage angst, both humorous and disturbing in its frank simplicity. Soaked with boozy excess, Mosquitoes & Whisky is enough to give Charles Bukowski the grave spins.",
