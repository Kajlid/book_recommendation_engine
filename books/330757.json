  "description": "This is a must have book for every child's library. Poor Mandie is a young filly in the herd of wild horses located in Corolla. She is not a pretty horse or a popular horse. Infact, most of the time she is completely overlooked by the rest of the herd. One evening, after an algae bloom, a mysterious unicorn shows up on the beach. A wonderful adventure of kindness, inclusion, self-esteem, and of course... wild horses. This wonderfully written book also contains information about the wild horses in Corolla, that was provided by the wild horse fund.",
