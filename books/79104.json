  "description": "A glorious volume devoted to the flowers and gardens of medieval times, enhanced with historical detail, medicinal and herbal lore, gardening wisdom, and 140 exquisite color photographs. It was in medieval gardens that the healing arts, poetry, spirituality, a sense of order in the cosmos, and an appreciation of beauty took root and were cultivated. Flowers had a significance almost incomprehensible to the modern-day gardener. Precious as jewels, painted and praised, they played a part in every courtly ritual and village romance. From peony to poppy, columbine to lily and iris, Medieval Flowers celebrates the species that grew then and still grow today. Photographer Clay Perry reveals their indelible beauty in 140 color images, as Miranda Innes explores the rituals and festivals in which flowers played a vital part. She also details the medicinal, cosmetic, and herbal uses of each plant, surveys the designs of physic, kitchen, and pleasure gardens, and introduces us to medieval gardens that can still be visited today. Complete with an illustrated directory that provides cultivation details for each flower, this is a book that will be coveted by all gardeners. Miranda Innes' many books include The Ornamental Garden and Ethnic Style. 160 pp 9 1/2 x 10 1/2 140 color photos",
