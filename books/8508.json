  "description": "“A captivating novel.”— Richmond Times-Dispatch “Reynolds creates a genuine and engaging young narrator…and maintains heat and suspense on every page.”— Detroit Free Press A mystery, a coming of age novel, a tragic love story, a rich evocation of a memorable time and place in America, The Starlite Drive-In by Marjorie Reynolds is all of these things and more. The author returns readers to the summer of 1956 in this riveting story that reviewers have enthusiastically compared to the Harper Lee classic, To Kill a Mockingbird —as the arrival of a handsome drifter at a rundown drive-in movie theater inflames dangerous passions and jealousies, and changes a young girl’s life forever.",
