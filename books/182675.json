  "description": "Luke Hartwell does it again! “Toller” is a sultry story of sex, infatuation, and annoying song lyrics. As always, the brilliance of the narrative voice shines brightest. Cam, like other Hartwell narrators, is angry but funny, purposeful but confused, and humorous yet unexpectedly profound. Although sexy and sought after, Cam sees life darkly and takes solace in fishing. His relationship with the title character is a wild, unpredictable ride. Hartwell’s use of present tense throughout the story gives the book an immediacy, honesty, and tension reminiscent of his masterpiece, Atom Heart John Beloved.",
