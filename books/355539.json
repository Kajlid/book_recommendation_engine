  "description": "Sarhaan and his band of elite soldiers don't know what to make of Caleb when his little spaceship turns up on their viewscreen. Believing that he might be a Republican spy, they bring the junior diplomat onto their stolen spaceship and question him. Sarhaan is immediately attracted to the young aristocrat, despite his doubts about Caleb's motives, and his feeling that giving into his feelings would be a very bad idea.Caleb is no spy. He's come looking for Sarhaan's soldiers to help them clear their names of a crime they didn't commit. Or at least he thinks they didn't. He's looking for a murderer and figures he'd better stay clear of any kind of entanglement with the smoking hot Sarhaan until he can find out who's at fault. What he doesn't count on is falling for the genetically enhanced Sarhaan, who seems to think Caleb is just a good time.Can Caleb convince Sarhaan that he's more than just a soldier's diversion? And can Sarhaan accept that the young elite might be just what he needs?Set against the backdrop of space and Doradus Station, a place where anything goes, Off-World is part mystery, part romance, and all heat!",
