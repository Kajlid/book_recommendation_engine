If there’s anything left to learn, he’s not going to find it in the classroom.The theater department’s “make-out class” is famously hard to get into, and what goes on between the twelve people who take it every spring is an annual topic of speculation. Winnie needs one more arts class to appear well-rounded for fellowships. Cal is just … bored.The dark space – a class, a place, a state of mind – is ready for them both.",
