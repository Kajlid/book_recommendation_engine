  "title": "Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition of Eastern Orthodoxy",
  "description": "Volume III of Boris Mouravieff’s Gnosis contains ancient keys to a tradition of Christian esotericism that was necessarily hermetized 1800 years ago and has since remained unpublished, surviving to the present only in unwritten form. For students who have read the first two volumes of this work, this final text will provide exact data making it possible to solve many of the practical problems attendant on spiritual practice under the pressures of everyday life in modern times. It also contains comments on certain related ideas seen from a viewpoint so foreign to our present era that it hints at a very different frame of mind from the everyday… so different that some people find it hard to accept, although it unravels many of the knotty points of theology and philosophy as well as certain key problems of our day. \"Great esoteric works do not argue with you… instead they leave an imprint on your being that is no less indelible for its subtlety; once you encounter them, you will never see things the same way again. To this list I’d have to add Gnosis...\"   - Richard Smoley, Editor, reviewing in Gnosis magazine.",
