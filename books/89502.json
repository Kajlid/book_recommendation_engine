  "title": "Time Was - A romantic comedy ..... with a kink",
  "description": "What happened when Henry met Sophie. Sophie, early twenties, free and easy with the tequila shots, the nightclubs, but a little lost in life. Fed up with lousy sex and lousy hangovers. “Oh shit, I’m shagging a perve! I mean, I got the domination thing, kinda, last time out. And I have no problem with that. I mean absolutely no problem! And the other thing really was no problem either. But handcuffs? He must’ve been carrying the bloody things with him all evening! Chatting away with all his mates, while all along they were sitting in his jacket pocket ready for our kinky little get together. The little devil!”Henry, late forties, company director with a penchant for fine wines, Napoleon brandy....and handcuffs. Woke up one day to find that his get up and go had got up and gone.“Back at the hotel, I’ve not even had chance to run a bath when the phone rings. No prizes for guessing who this is going to be. ‘Henry, I seem to have a bit of trouble with my plumbing. Can you come and have a look at it for me?’ ‘Really?’ ‘Yes,’ she says, and then breathes ‘...something keeps dripping and I’m hoping that you can sort it out.’ Incorrigible. But I’m having my bath first, whatever state the young lady finds herself in right now. Wash the grime of the day away ..... just so that I can go and get all dirty again. So to speak.”Follow Henry's and Sophie's bawdy adventures into the kinkier side of life, adventures that don't always turn out as planned. A romantic comedy for the 21st Century. Bridget Jones with a little of 50 shades thrown in for good measure.(Adult humour rather than erotica)Available thru Amazon.",
