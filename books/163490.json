Tracking down a thief of millions of dollars worth of art was the least of her problems, her major pain now, was the handsome owner of that art. Ric Derby owns the Blue Spot art galleries. Murder and a million dollar theft bring them together. A personal vendetta from a dark figure threatens them both. Retreating to the safety of the small town of Pride, Ric must fight to protect the only person he’s ever truly loved.",
