  "description": "Katrina was tricked. The charming blacksmith didn’t want an excuse to spend more time with her; he wanted time alone with her mother’s magical elixirs. When Katrina realizes he has stolen two of the most dangerous potions and is heading for the castle, she must find a way to capture the man who almost had her heart before he wreaks havoc on the entire kingdom. Stopping him won’t be easy, but in her attempt Katrina accidentally poisons the missing prince, who has been traveling in disguise while searching for his kidnapped sister. Katrina realizes sticking with him might be the best way to fix her mistake and protect the crown, but the prince’s bad luck curse sends them into the path of a madman willing to do—or kill—whatever he must to stop the curse that is robbing him of his life. Now Katrina must survive the magically mutated animals the madman sends after her, rescue her new friend after he is kidnapped, and stop her former crush from conspiring to take the throne. All while trying to keep her heart safe from a handsome man she seems to keep running into but isn’t sure she can trust.",
