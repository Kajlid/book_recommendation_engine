  "description": "I used to have such good judgment. A solid head on my shoulders. Then I met Isaac.I'm not like most girls. I don't believe in love and I don't have time for fairy tales. People say that I'm damaged, that I'm missing something inside. They're not exactly wrong. It's dark in here. Cold. Empty. I fall apart if I think about it, so I never do. What's the point?We are just supposed to work together, that's it. I fought hard to get where I am today and I'm not letting it slip away because of those mischievous green eyes, that cocky tilted smile, and a pair of hands that can make the world disappear. Isaac is trouble with a capital T.He can have any girl that he wants, but he keeps chasing me. Turns out he's as twisted and broken as I am and that just makes me want him more. He tells me to let go. He promises to catch me. But no one can protect me now.Isaac doesn't have a secret, he is a secret. We can't be together. In 30 short days, this assignment is over and we'll go our separate ways like it never happened. Why does my heart stop beating when I think about that? This doesn't mean anything. I am not in love with him. I can't be.The detailed description is too intense for Amazon's filters! Look Inside or download the sample to see if it's too intense for you.
