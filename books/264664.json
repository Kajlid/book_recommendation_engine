  "title": "Crier's Knife",
  "description": "In the dark heart of a sweltering summer night, alone and shivering, a young man whispers an incantation. Leagues and miles away, in a creaky cottage atop a mountain, a silver mirror breaks in the night. A woman in white rolls scrimshaw knuckle bones by the light of black candles, frowning at their message before she sends for her grandson. Dirk Crier is no stranger to being summoned up the mountain, and this is far from the first time he’s been sent to bring his cousin Teller home when he’s gone too far astray. This time is different, though. This time a shadow looms over the end of the path; a nameless threat, asleep for now, but coming closer to waking with every passing day. He will need to be swift if he wants to bring them both back to the slopes of Ben Morgh. And if he isn’t quick enough to save his cousin, Dirk will show those responsible why the folk around the mountain say only a dead man crosses a Crier.",
