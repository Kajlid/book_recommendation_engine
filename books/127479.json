  "description": "A pulsing ball of light launches a host of undeadly adventures in this slightly macabre, slightly irreverent, hugely fun look at what two kids will do to make their family whole again, from the author of The Last Invisible Boy.When twin brother and sister Fenton and Fiona find a ball of light in their backyard, things get weird. Especially when Fenton figures out it can bring things back to life. Everything from bugs, to trees, to their old dog Scruffy, to - well - people. Namely, their grandfather. Because they really do miss him, and more than that, their father and their grandfather have unsettled business to take care of. But be warned: bringing back things from the dead gets a little more complicated when they stick around.",
