  "description": "The future is already here... Computers, the space shuttle, biogenetics - what was once the domain of science fiction is now business as usual. Developments in science and technology are propelling us forward so fast that only a few dare to speculate where we might be tomorrow. Take a step toward our future in out space with two of the leading minds in science fiction and science fact as you explore the colonization of Mars. Nebula Award nominee S. C. Sykes weaves a spellbinding tale of a man who changed two worlds. When shoddy waste disposal techniques result in a series of toxic clouds causing the death of millions, the company responsible makes their CEO, Graham Sinclair, a scapegoat. When he is convicted, an outraged world court decrees that his punishment is to be exiled to the colonies on Mars, never to return to Earth, even in death. Scientist Eugene Mallove provides an in-depth look at the nearly insurmountable technical problems involved in starting a colony on Mars, and what it would take to keep such a colony alive. With an introduction by Isaac Asimov.",
