  "description": "Olivia Walters thought she had found the man of her dreams. Young and inexperienced, she couldn’t discern the danger lurking behind the beautiful stranger’s dark seductive eyes. Now a grown woman, she knew every single one of his tricks. For years, she hoped to be free from Alessandro Damiani’s clutches, and when the chance arose, she didn’t hesitate to take it. But when all of her plans fall through and her abusive husband is once again the charming stranger who swept her off her feet at only seventeen, what is Olivia to do? Destroyed once already, she refuses to let Alessandro do it again, but she can’t deny that her husband’s unwanted antics trap her in a dangerous battle between her cautious mind and her reckless heart. This is not your typical \"hearts and flowers\" romance story. It will contain strong language, disturbing situations and in some parts sexual content. Please don't read this if you are under the age of 18, or find such things disturbing!",
