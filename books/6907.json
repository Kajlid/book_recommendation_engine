  "description": "When \nDavid Shannon\n was five years old, he wrote and illustrated his first book. On every page were these words:No, David!...And a picture of David doing things he was not supposed to do. But some things never change...Here's the semi-autobiographical story of writer and artist David Shannon, the once little kid who broke all his mother's rules. He chewed with his mouth open (and full of food), he jumped on the furniture, and he broke his mother's vase! As a result, all David ever heard his mother say was \"No, David!\", and this is his story.\nDavid Shannon\n grew up in Spokane, Washington. He has written and illustrated numerous popular books for children, including How Georgie Saved Baseball, a New York Times Best Illustrated Book; The Amazing Christmas Extravaganza, an American Bookseller Pick of the Lists: and most recently A Bad Case of Stripes, a selection of the Junior Library Guild. In 1996, he also Illustrated Audrey Wood's The Bunyans, a School Library Journal Best Book of the Year and an ABC Children's Bookseller' Choice award Winner.
