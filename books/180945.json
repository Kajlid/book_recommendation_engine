He expects a holiday chock full of thrills when he travels to South Africa and comes face-to-face with the ultimate in high adventure – breaching Great White Sharks. What he doesn’t count on is crossing paths with the lovely American heiress, Harlow Karnes, whose beauty and charm pit Mako against his friends and distract him from the things he loves most. But he soon learns that people are not always what they seem. After a series of unexpected events, Mako is forced to reconsider his impulsive lifestyle, but is it too late?",
