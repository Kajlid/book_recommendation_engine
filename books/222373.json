Problem is he wants Pat’s Pub—and he’s not taking no for an answer. Caitlyn should despise him for threatening her family’s business, but there’s something about Lucas’s dominant nature that awakens the hidden submissive inside her.What should be a run-of-the-mill real estate acquisition goes off the rails quickly when Lucas meets the granddaughter of the owner. Lucas never mixes business with pleasure, but that rule is broken when he meets Cait. Soon the couple is thrust into a steamy affair that will ultimately force them to choose between family loyalty and love.",
