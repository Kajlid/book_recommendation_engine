  "description": "Being pregnant with Ravager babies isn't easy.You have to deal with things like having not one but two overprotective baby daddies breathing down your neck all the time. Cravings for disgusting food combinations.And weird alien side effects, like randomly falling through the floor and into another dimension called the Other Side.The Other Side is a place of darkness and void. It's the flip side of this reality where only the most wicked of the Ravagers reside.According to my husband, Beast, it corrupts. According to my husband, Striker, learning to exist there is necessary for survival.If it were my choice I'd avoid the place entirely...Because I know when I fall into the Other Side there are monsters in that dark. And when I look at the monsters they look back at me. And if I listen closely I can hear them roaring...And when they're roaring I swear it sounds like they're saying mine.",
