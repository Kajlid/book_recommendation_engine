  "description": "Behind me, stiffened with frost, lie the remains of Victor Frankenstein.What becomes of a monster without its maker? At the end of Mary Shelley’s classic novel, the creator dies but his creation still lives, cursed to a life of isolation and hatred.Frankenstein’s Monster continues the creature’s story as he’s compelled to discover his humanity, to escape the ship captain who vowed to the dying Frankenstein to hunt him down—and to resist the woman who would destroy them all.This is a tale of passion, revenge, violence, and madness—and the desperate search for meaning in an often meaningless world.",
