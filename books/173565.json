  "description": "Human Remains, the latest novel from crime-writing sensation Elizabeth Haynes, is a powerful and chilling thriller that preys on our darkest fears, showing how vulnerable we are when we live alone, and how easily ordinary lives can fall apart when no one is watching. How well do you know your neighbour? How well do they know you? Would they notice if you lived or died?Police Analyst Annabel wouldn't describe herself as lonely. Her work keeps her busy and the needs of her ageing mother and her cat are more than enough to fill her time.But when Annabel discovers her neighbours decomposing body in the house next door, she is appalled to think that no one, including herself, noticed her absence.Back at work, she is compelled to investigate, despite her colleagues' lack of interest, and finds data showing that such cases are frighteningly common in her home town. People, of all ages, all dying of natural causes. Seemingly. All forgotten. But for Annabel.As Annabel is drawn deeper into the mystery, she comes face to face with her own demons and her own mortality. Would anyone notice if she just disappeared?",
