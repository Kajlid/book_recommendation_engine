  "title": "Who I Am",
  "description": "*Recommended for ages 18+ due to strong sexual content and mild violence.*  Some stories aren’t easy to tell.  Some situations aren’t easy to relive.  But I was raised to be strong—to hold my own. Because of it, I was hurt, torn down, beaten and even had my heart snatched right out of my chest.  But I’m ready now. It’s time for me to speak up. You want to know what really goes on inside my head, well I’m right here.  Real. Raw. Intense.  This is all me. Roy Sykes. This is my story, and trust me… its far from pretty.  *This is the third book of the FireNine series but it can be read as a standalone.*",
