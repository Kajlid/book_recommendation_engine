  "title": "Debating Everything Sex",
  "description": "After nearly 30 years in the sex and relationship industry, meeting with no fewer than 2000 clients in that time, Ashley gave it all up to become an author. In November 2016, she released her first thriller called “The Cure Hotel” followed by “Concealed Anguish” a few months later.  NOW, Ashley returns to the industry that gave her so much joy for so many years and teams up with one of her best friends to openly debate everything sex. Along with her co-writing colleague and a few female friends, Ashley plans to take on subjects such as seduction, dirty talk, initiation and masturbation, then tries to unravel any mystery or confusion behind each topic.  With a load of comedy, many strange pictures and stacks of debatable chat, one thing is for sure – They had a lot of fun writing a book, where their only goal was to find common ground and equality between men and women.",
