He was the all-American kid who played baseball and had a paper route. He never touched drugs or cigarettes, did not enjoy alcohol. \"Brad\" says one of his best friends \"was an angel.\" But one night the devil crossed Brad's path, in the guise of a trusted family member, and the small town where Brad lived and played was dropped to its knees when the truth came to light.",
