He’s just landed his first post-collegiate job and can no longer stay in the dorms.Coincidentally, real estate agent Aaron Culver is looking for a tenant to rent an apartment in the building that he owns and happens to live in himself.The price is right, well within Mark’s budget. The location is perfect. The apartment is suitable to accommodate Mark’s needs. The only problem though, is that Mark happens to have a serious crush on his would-be landlord.Is there any way he can overcome or even conceal his secret fantasies about the successful, confident and very attractive man-of his dreams? Does he even really want to conceal them, and what would Aaron do if he were to discover Mark’s secret? When the two do in fact actually become landlord and tenant, they quickly discover there is more than one way to collect the rent.",
