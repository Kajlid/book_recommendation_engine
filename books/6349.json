  "description": "As the world begins taking its last breath, Professor Dorian Thomas teaches history to over-privileged students at a New York college. A borderline alcoholic, Thomas plods through his existence until the day he receives a strange note that \"Must meet with you tonight after classes. Will meet you in front of the old library steps.\" The mysterious and dangerous meeting is with Father Michael Donavan who asks Thomas to join their mission-the search for pieces of a missing holy text that has the ability to change life's destiny and save mankind. Thomas is skeptical. In this new world, organized religion is taboo and, in some cases, illegal. But when Thomas discovers that Teresa Elizabeth Donavan is part of the group, he doesn't hesitate. Thomas has been waiting ten long years for Elizabeth, his life's love, to return to him. The diverse group-a team of God's chosen army-seriously attends to its task and embarks on a dangerous international journey to recover the texts and restore life to what it once was.",
