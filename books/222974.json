  "title": "Grimm: Something Wicked This Way Comes",
  "description": "An original story set within the fourth season continuity of the hit television series Grimm! What do Juliette, Adalind, Truble, and Rosalee have in common? They're the women in the life of Portland's own Grimm, Nick Burkhardt, and they're about to cross paths in a way they'd never expect! Juliette's struggles to come to terms with becoming a Hexenbiest draw her into conflict with a new Wessen threat, and she finds she has nowhere to turn except her most hated enemy, Adalind (that's right, the woman who impersonated Juliette and slept with Nick)! Written by Caitlin Kittredge, the author behind the novels Nocturne City and Iron Codex, as well as Vertigo's Coffin Hill comic series, and featuring artwork by rising newcomer Maria Sanapo!  Review:  -I love the fact that this particular story is an all-girl affair given that the women of 'Grimm' have all been very strong in their own right, but never really explored.- - SciFi Pulse",
