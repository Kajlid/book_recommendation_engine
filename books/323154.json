  "description": "Eadha learns early the cruel nature of the world from Lord Huath, a brutal Channeller. The Channellers rule Domhain, sapping magic from others so that the crops might grow, the cities might prosper, and the dragons might be held at bay. But there is another, more ancient power blossoming in the young Eadha, one that does not consume the life force of others. And as the world and its cruelties rush toward Eadha and Ionain, the boy she has always loved, she faces a terrible choice: make a lie of Ionainâ€™s life or watch him lose everything.",
