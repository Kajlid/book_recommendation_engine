  "title": "Richard, Zombie King",
  "description": "Richard Diemar is under a love spell cast by a beautiful witch who tricks him into murdering his father and brothers. After she refuses to marry him, he flees to a settlement of polygamists, steals the patriarchâ€™s youngest wife, and takes her to New Orleans where a voodoo mambo turns them into zombies. Richard escapes living-death when a snake god shows him how to travel through inner-dimensions found in shadows. He reunites with the witch, whose spell still holds him, when he finds her reincarnated as a giant serpent, and together they set out to build a zombie kingdom. Packed with love, betrayal, dark history, and heady revenge, RICHARD, ZOMBIE KING is full of what readers crave: myth, murder, mayhem, magic, the dead, and, of course, the undead. Laissez les terreurs commencer!",
