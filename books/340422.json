  "description": "The New York Times bestselling Freakonomics was a worldwide sensation, selling more than four million copies in thirty-five languages and changing the way we look at the world. Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner return with Superfreakonomics, and fans and newcomers alike will find that the freakquel is even bolder, funnier, and more surprising than the first. SuperFreakonomics challenges the way we think all over again, exploring the hidden side of everything with such questions as: 1. How is a street prostitute like a department-store Santa?2. What do hurricanes, heart attacks, and highway deaths have in common?3. Can eating kangaroo save the planet?4. Why are doctors so bad at washing their hands? 5. How much good do car seats do? 6. What's the best way to catch a terrorist? 7. Did TV cause a rise in crime? 8. Are people hard-wired for altruism or selfishness? 9. Which adds more value: a pimp or a Realtor? Levitt and Dubner mix smart thinking and great storytelling like no one else. By examining how people respond to incentives, they show the world for what it really is—good, bad, ugly, and, in the final analysis, super freaky. Freakonomics has been imitated many times over—but only now, with SuperFreakonomics, has it met its match.",
