Since becoming a practicing introvert, there have been only a few changes in his life, and for each of those changes his wife had walked him through them, including their recent move to a much smaller home in a middle-class neighborhood where he lives next to a racist whose pint-sized son addresses him as Mr. Jew.Mr. Rosen had seen the move coming and he's very much aware of the enormous change to come that will force him to chart his own life's route, though he refuses to think about it, but he's not aware of the change that will come from the child next door. A change that could offer him a second chance at life... if he would allow himself to take it.This cozy story of an unlikely friendship offers a roller coaster of emotion as Mr. Rosen's comfortable world begins to implode while on a collision course with the chaotic world of a boy, his troubled mother and vengeful father.",
