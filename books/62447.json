  "title": "Regarding Ruth",
  "description": "Regarding Ruth is the first book in the Ruth Chernock series. This story is set in the mid-1700’s in the Province of Maine. It begins with the hanging of beautiful, young Ruth. The tale is related by a modern day descendant of hers, who cannot believe that her ancestor could have been guilty of a crime worthy of hanging. On a mission to discover the truth, she discovers shocking family secrets that far surpass the original rumors. Ruth’s trouble began at age 15, when she met and fell in love with Teague Johnes. She is the youngest of eight children and is thought to be a bit over-indulged. But it is far more that as she has a deeply troubled mind. Ruth suffers a series of dreadful ordeals and her thinking gradually progresses from \"twisted\" to completely irrational. In time she will descend into complete madness. As her mental state declines she commits the most unspeakable acts. Eventually her horrendous misdeeds are discovered and she pays the ultimate price them. Unfortunately, through her continual decline, her actions have impacted the lives of those around her and they will also suffer for her actions. Book 2 in the series, 'In Ruth's Memory' is also available on Kindle and in paperback. Book 3, 'On Grace's Shoulders' will be released in August 2012.",
