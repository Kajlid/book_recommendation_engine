  "description": "It had been almost a year since Cari had escaped and promised to come back and save Jess from the Relians who held her captive and brutalized her since she was a child. Now as her usefulness to the Relians was at an end and rescue nowhere in sight, she only hoped to face her impending death with courage. Walking onto the field where she was to die, she never expected the giant warrior who tried to save her.  Amun had been obsessed with the tortured woman since the moment Cari had told him about her and showed him her gift. Heâ€™d spent the last year desperate to find her as their ship tracked the Relian camp in the hopes of rescuing her, never giving up hope that one day he could hold her, heal her. He never expected the impact that her shattered body and soul would have on him.  With a traitor on the loose and the Relian leader threatening to kill all of the hybrid women and children, Jess and Amun are thrust into the middle of danger, only this time he is determined to protect her and keep her safe.",
