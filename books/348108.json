  "description": "Artemis Bridge can get you what you need no matter how immoral or illegal, no questions asked. With practiced detachment, he keeps everyone around him at arm's length. But when the city of Boulder is trapped in a mysterious dome, he must set aside his detachment to help his bodyguard Aristotle's search for his missing grandmother. Every step he takes towards the dome deepens the mystery, as he is compelled to seek out the source of the strange happenings. Flaming dragons, cars transformed into robotic golems, a corporate-military quarantine and disturbing visions drive Bridge to a life-altering conclusion. This enthralling sequel to the critically-acclaimed Under the Amoral Bridge is the second in the Bridge Chronicles series.",
