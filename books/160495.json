It's one of the hardest things in life to accept.In Loving You is a collection of 52 poems that tells the story of Eeva Lancaster's love for a man she couldn't have. It is sad and painful, as the author shares her emotional journey and bares her pain and longing in her poems. In the end, Lancaster shares her hopes too, her triumphs and beautiful self realizations, when she finally learns to overcome this challenge in her life.An excerpt:Inside of Me..I hear the echoes of a sound so far away I just don’t understand a single word they say... I move closer so that I can better hear,But when I do they always disappear…I see the traces of a picture I have dreamed But when I looked it isn’t what it seemed Cause every time I made the colors flow.. I’m left with nothing but an empty showI looked and looked and there at last I found… A wondrous place with lots of wondrous sound, There I have found the truth that set me free… It wasn’t far, it’s just inside of me.
