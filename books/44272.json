  "description": "It's not just a trilogy any more. In the fifth book of this popular series, Arthur Dent makes the terrible mistake of starting to enjoy life, and immediately all hell breaks loose. In short, it's up to him to save the world from total multi-dimensional obliteration, the Guide from a hostile alien takeover, and the daughter he never knew he had from herself. A tall order, to say the least. And one he's really not up to, thank you very much.LENGTH6 hrs and 37 mins",
