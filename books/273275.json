  "description": "I’m not a queen, not anymore.  I still have my palace, my fortune, and my position as Atlanta royalty. Of course, I can’t control any of it anymore. Instead, it’s all in the hands of a powerful criminal, a mysterious enemy who is suddenly determined to marry me.  This will be the event of the century, the perfect wedding little girls dream of. Too bad my groom is my captor, a lethal man I can’t help but feel drawn to, even after all he’s done.  I knew Javier Vega was dangerous, but I never expected him to be the devil himself.",
