  "description": "Hating and dating: I didn’t realize they’re two sides of the same coin until I meet him. Theo Morgan.One of Wall Street’s highest-paid traders, he may be hot as sin in his five-thousand-dollar custom-made suit and six-figure SUV. But Theo is the bane of my existence. He’s arrogant, rude, and as brash as they come.As our bank’s newest star hire, he’s also after the same promotion I am. But I didn’t make it this far in a man’s world just to be passed over for an entitled egomaniac. Two can play at this game.In a surprise to exactly no one, Theo and I butt heads from the beginning–and end up losing my biggest client with a trade gone bad. Our boss’s punishment: fly us to California together to make nice with the client—or else.When a snowstorm back home leaves us stranded on the West Coast, we learn our hotel is fully booked, save for one room.And of course that room would have only one king-sized bed. After a little too much wine, our deal to stick to opposite sides of that bed goes out the window. But on the flight home, my resolve to keep things professional remains intact, until Theo offers me a new deal. The gloves (and clothes) can come off. But the lipstick stays on…THE DEALMAKER is an all-new, outrageously sexy romantic comedy coming June 7 to all retailers!",
