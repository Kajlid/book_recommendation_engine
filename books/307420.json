  "description": "Three hundred years and nine generations later, humans have established themselves in their New Eden. In the asteroid belt, the Federation of Free Colonies holds sway, a loose affiliation of Privateers who have maintained their independence through superior technology and control of key resources.On the central worlds, the United Corporate Sphere are the descendants of the original conglomerates who funded humanity's exodus. The pragmatic Corporatists have established a multi-world utopia through questionable means, subjugating society's destitute, sending them to work for the rest of their lives on welfare colonies.Jarek Ansley lives in hiding amongst the people of one such colony, Anesidora-3, scratching out a brutal living as a resource miner. Now, after eight years of undisturbed peace, a single ship descends in the dead of night, threatening to expose his deepest secret; the long-dormant power trapped within him.",
