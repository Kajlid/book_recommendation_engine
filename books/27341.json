  "description": "A nice day in June. A whole day ahead. Anything might happen, said Mr. Wilson. \"Anything!\" Meg repeated his words as she pedaled down the tree-lined drive of her home. Almost immediately things did happen. That morning Meg heard that Mrs. Partlow's Holly House had been broken into, and that very afternoon, her garden party was ruined by the appearance of Mrs. Glynn and her poodles. Then just when the guests were calm, they found that the Partlow diamonds were missing! Meg and her friend Kerry Carmody had many questions. What was Kerry's little cousin Cissie doing at Mrs. Partlow's party? Why did Mrs. Glynn decide to give Meg the collar? And most important to Meg, where was Thunder? When you are Margaret Ashley Duncan and can sense a mystery almost before it's begun, and you have a whole day ahead of you, almost anything can happen -- and does -- in Meg and the Disappearing Diamonds.",
