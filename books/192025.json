  "description": "\"You and no other.\" Flames and blood – the story of Eleanor's existence. How can she recover? How can she go on? How can she stay away? Eleanor survives, it what she does. But at what cost? She learns her past and sees the terrible and tragic history of her kind, the wreckage of fear and necessity spread across generations of innocent lives. It is enough to show her she is toxic, a cause of pain and destruction. For everyone’s own good, she will disappear forever. But first, one last visit to Jamesford. The sleepy Wyoming town mourns their lost child. The unremarkable girl who in life wanted only to be ignored is a celebrity in death, a tourist attraction, a legend. A mystery. But not everyone thinks she’s dead. While some wait in hope for her return, others wait in ambush.",
