  "description": "The Workplace is a critical, high stakes environment. We are expected to be available at all hours, across modes and platforms, all in service to some vague priorities of customer service. We spend much of our lives in the world of work, spending most of our waking hours contemplating how best to earn a living. While we may practically need to “punch the clock” each day, we rarely give one another permission, encouragement, and support to develop more intentional, well-considered ways of approaching such time with a deeper sense of purpose. Fortunately, there is a quiet, powerful revolution occurring within the 21st century organization, and we can notice these forces, harvest their practices, and build upon their insights to focus on What Matters. That’s where this Guide comes To reflect on What Matters at Work is to consider what has been learned and apply it to the pragmatic realities of work life.
