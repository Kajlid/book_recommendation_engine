  "description": "Anna has no family except her friends and the shelter dogs she walks. Rae-Rae communicates only through old rock-and-roll lyrics. Piper is terrified of her boyfriend. Sunny wants everyone happy but doesn't know how. Dareen wants to battle the world into being a better place. Jade is so withdrawn she has all but disappeared. Charity keeps showing up to school black-and-blue. These teenage women could be your own friends. The difficulties they face are hauntingly familiar. With the shared strength that only true family of choice gift each other, they set out to take on bullies ... only reluctantly recognizing that the worst bully of all is their teacher. This is their story of coming of age, of learning not to be powerless, and of healing each other's hearts.",
