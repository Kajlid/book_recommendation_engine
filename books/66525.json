  "title": "Duchess, Bound",
  "description": "When Jocelyn's guardian, who had previously turned her into his mistress, dies, she becomes the ward of his the new Duke of Rochester. The duke doesn't just take her under his wing, however--he marries her. As the mere daughter of a servant, she'd never expected to become a duchess. It seemed an even more unlikely prospect than becoming the mistress of a duke. Upon arrival at her new home, however, she discovers she's not only the new duke's wife and duchess, but also his pet--and he is her Master. Gabriel has lusted after Jocelyn since she was a mere girl and even offered for her when her father died. His uncle refused Gabriel's suit, and Gabriel's already dark perversions took a decided turn for the wicked. But now Jocelyn is his. He intends to teach her precisely what her new place in his life shall be with the assistance of his servants and a friend, before his annual summer gathering at Blackthorne Manor, during which she'll be put through her paces. this title is only suitable for those 18 and over as it contains graphic and explicit sex and language, bondage, submission, punishment, humiliation, dp, tp, a Regency-era gang bang, maids in next to nothing (if anything at all), an earl one should never defy, and an ingenious saddle for a horse. (No duchesses, maids, horses, or other humans or animals were harmed in the writing of this novel.)",
