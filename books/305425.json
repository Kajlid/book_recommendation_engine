  "description": "By day, I, Everleigh Greene, am a dutiful elementary teacher.By night, I become Madam Isis, the unattainable ice queen at RISE.Co-owning a gentlemen’s club with my best friends was supposed to grant us all freedom. So, why does it feel like my wings are being clipped, one feather at a time?I conceal my identity so my family won't know where I spend my nights. I put on a brave face so my girls can’t see how their fortress of freedom shackles me. The hardest one of all to wear is the mask of indifference whenever he's near.The man I can’t have. The one who’s promised to another.I tell myself that I can keep up this charade, that I can be two people—even that I can stop loving him.But aren’t the saddest lies the ones we tell ourselves?",
