  "description": "Sydney journalist Charli Cooper has no idea what destiny has in store for her as she packs her bags and moves half way around the world for a fresh start. Jack Manning has issues letting anyone too close and is only interested in advancing himself and his company. He is used to getting what he wants and has no patience dealing with an inexperienced reporter who has no idea of the New York social hierarchy.  As she unlocks the truth about Manning and his empire, she realises all is not as it seems and if she digs deep enough, she might just find the story she has been looking for. But at what cost?  Will the secrets they both hold cause their delicately poised relationship to crumble?  Can one mistake unravel their lives?",
