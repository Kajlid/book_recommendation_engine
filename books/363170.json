  "description": "“Four years ago I walked out of the biggest pop group on the planet and embarked on a journey into the unknown. Everyone, it seemed had an opinion on what Ginger Spice should do next -- the only one who wasn’t so sure was me. I didn’t know whether I’d make it on my own or fall flat on my face but I did know that this time it was Geri, not Ginger, who would be leading the way. This book is about what it’s like to strike out on your own.”As Ginger Spice of the Spice Girls pop group, Geri Halliwell stormed the pop charts worldwide. She survived the transition to solo artist, with four No.1 hit singles in the U.K., and has managed to forge a new place in the public eye, promoting the cause of breast cancer and as a United Nations Goodwill Ambassador. Since the break-up of the Spice Girls, Geri has been written about more than almost any other pop artist. But how much of it is true? In a glorious mix of over 100 exclusive and beautiful photographs and an honest and heartfelt text, she reveals for the first time the real story of her life. As Geri herself puts it: “This is the real nitty gritty of what I’ve been up to over the last four years.”",
