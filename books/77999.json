  "description": "\"The fly fell down.\" Quiller sent the message off to London as requested. He had just seen a supersonic jet plunge 60,000 feet to its destruction. It was the 36th crash, and more were to come--unless Quiller finds out who is to blame. That meant entering the deadly shadow world between East and West, where the name of the game was betrayal and the stakes were sky-high. \"If you are a Quiller fan this is for you. If you have never met him, it's time you did.\" (Charleston Evening Post)",
