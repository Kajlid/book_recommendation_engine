Jennifer Walters, the Sensational She-Hulk, is no longer savage - and now she needs to put her life back together. She's got a legal career to rebuild, friends to reacquaint herself with (and maybe represent in a court of law), and enemies to... well, she may not want to connect with them, but they are definitely going to connect with her. And Jen is about to be sent down a road she's never travelled - one that will shake up her life... and possibly the whole Marvel Universe! Collecting: She-Hulk (2022) 1-5",
