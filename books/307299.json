  "description": "Cillian Tertius, now in his aged years, sets himself upon a path of recollection by writing down the events of his youth during the Second War of Ascension. As a legionary builder, Cillian wishes for nothing more than to use the skills of his craft in defense against the Ascani, creatures of the underworld that have plagued the Kingdom of Anolia since its birth. But boyish thoughts of purpose, recognition, and belonging are quickly shattered when a surprise assault transforms his once grand view of war into its realities of horror and nightmare. Be that as it may, in the thick of legionary life Cillian answers the call to war, finding himself taking part in a quest of ancient beginnings, one that will come to test all he knows, forging the bulwarks of his defense, and the sinew of his courage.",
