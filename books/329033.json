Hers is a poetry that is passionate and wise, not afraid to confront our most salient issues.\"Although her work is often spare and simple, it is always beautifully and painstakingly crafted into poems that tell the truth, poems that insist on residing within the reader, poems by a poet who seeks and achieves the ability to be a vehicle for those who may not otherwise speak.\" â€”Web Del Sol Review of Books",
