  "description": "Eighteen-year-old John is the middle of three brothers who look like triplets but aren’t. John is especially close to Jacob, the oldest, while Jared, the youngest, has a bit more distance and is more focused on his serious girlfriend. The family is devoutly Christian, and the house rules are so religious that not even masturbation is allowed. Of course, that doesn’t stop John from doing it, and it also doesn’t stop his mind from wondering if his brothers do it, too, particularly Jacob.It's Christmas, and twin cousins, Peter and Paul, are staying for the holiday weekend. The house is quiet because everyone is asleep. However, John can’t sleep and decides to take care of business in the bathroom. He notices that Jacob isn’t in their shared bedroom, and Jared is deep asleep in the top bunk. Jacob didn’t even say his special goodnight phrase like he does every single night, something that’s reserved for John. Where could Jacob be?As John quietly steps out of the room, a series of unfamiliar sounds come out of the guestroom where Peter and Paul sleep. Could Jacob be in there? But they aren’t just any sounds; they’re the sounds of fornication, strong enough to lure John into listening as a private audience with a curious hand. These taboo sounds confirm that rules are meant to be broken, and John quickly learns that a silent night can unexpectedly turn into an unholy night.",
