  "description": "When Letters From Home make all the difference.  Brody Molina, an Army medic on tour in Afghanistan, saved lives everyday but preferred to spend his down time with a good book.  Molly Thurston, working in a library, sent boxes to books to soldiers overseas. Slipping a note into one, she wondered who would write back.  Finding each other through a love of books, the friends continue to write, but Molly, with a secret to hide, is afraid of her growing attraction.  When the secret is revealed, will the love between two pen pals overcome all obstacles?  A standalone, no cliffhanger, and an HEA. For language that some may consider crude and for scenes of a sexual nature, mature (18+) readers only.",
