  "description": "When the leader of Finn's clan orders him to kidnap Bea Jones, Finn falls crazy in love. He risks his life by betraying his clan to protect her. Finn Wilde is a computer-nerd trapped in a broad-shouldered, super strong body. He's one of the Fir Na Geala√≠, whose strength and speed surpass those of ordinary men. He'd give up those traits to be rid of the other aspect that makes him a Fir, the bloodthirsty madness that possesses him each month. The story is told by an alternately pensive then manic patient in a mental hospital. His identity and the truth of his tale won't be revealed until the end.",
