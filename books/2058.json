  "description": "However much we like Alice Walker's fictional characters, it's still a treat when she speaks in her own voice, whether in essays or poems. The poems in this work show the impressive range that voice has, from the outrage of \"First, They Said,\" to the quiet and lovely \"These Mornings of Rain,\" to poems about family. Walker makes a lyrical world big enough to seamlessly weave these disparate parts together.",
