  "title": "Wisdom from Peace Is Every Step: The Path of Mindfulness in Everyday Life",
  "description": "In the rush or modern life we tend to lose touch with the peace that is available in each moment. World-renowned Zen master, peace activist, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that often antagonize us. For him, a ringing telephone or a red traffic light can be signals that call us back to our true selves. Thich Nhat Hanh's stories, meditations, and exercises encourage us to walk the path of mindfulness as we keep our consciousness alive to the present, and work for peace in the world while cultivating inner peace.",
