  "description": "\"This is the turtle that slid into the pond and ate the snake that dropped from a branch and swallowed the fish that swam after the frogâ€”JUMP, FROG, JUMP!\" This infectious cumulative tale will have the young frogs you know jumping and chanting with joy. Jump, Frog, Jump has been a winning story-time favorite long enough for it to have teacher and parent fans who first enjoyed it in their own preschool classroom. \"Extremely satisfying edge-of-the-seat fun for very small readers.\" ( Kirkus starred review)",
