  "description": "Set in the ancient, pagan days where myths and magic existed side-by-side with the mortal world, comes Bound by Lies, the second book in an erotic, historical romance series. After trudging from battlefield to battlefield in the footsteps of the Fomorian army, Aileen is desperate to have a home far from the horrors of war. She will do anything to achieve her goals. Even lie to the kin and people of her newly deceased husband. But lies are nothing compared to drugging a pixie king and stealing his memory...and his seed. When Ioducus returns to the hill fort, Tranelleon, he discovers both a son he never knew he sired and forgotten memories of one wild night of ecstasy. Burning with a desire to teach Aileen a lesson she'll never forget, he soon realizes it is more than lust that drives him. Could this be the one woman who can lift his curse and gift him with true love? But for one, lies are not so easily forgiven and Aileen may well lose everything she holds dear.",
