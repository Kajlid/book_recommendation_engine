His ambitious plans are shattered when his mother's body is found floating in the river, an apparent suicide. When the media speculate that she is responsible for the murder of an elderly German farmer, Peter is caught in a web of intrigue involving Nazi war criminals and his mother's ruthless past as a Polish partisan. Suddenly, past collides with present, truth with falsehood, reality with illusion, and Peter abandons his musical aspirations. Five decades of deceit and betrayal converge in this thrilling mediation on the ultimate cost of violence and revenge.",
