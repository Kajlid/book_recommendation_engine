  "description": "Siddhant Roy is back in Bangalore after a really depressing, detained semester. He wants to rebuild his life from scratch without looking back. But he is an engineering student, after all. It never gets easy. He makes a bunch of new friends, who take him on a journey where he crashes into strange apartments, gets drunk and pukes halfway across the city, tries to start an online social network and watches all his efforts fail miserably. He faces denial, acceptance, love and hatred, all in the span of less than a year. He must now make a choice, whether to silently withstand the oppression of his sinister and stubborn college principal, or to risk everything and take his own stand. What will Siddhant do? Life, Served Hot is a coming-of-age story of a young rebel's undying attachment towards his dreams and survival.",
