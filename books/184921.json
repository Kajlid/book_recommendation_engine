  "description": "When Lance Juddit looks up into the night sky, he sees two moons, but he's learned not to mention it to other people. He also doesn't mention the things he sees when he drops off to sleep-and he falls asleep all the time, everywhere. He doesn't mention the place with the golden fields, the purple sun, the emerald sea. And he definitely doesn't talk about the slender silver creatures that stalk this landscape and menace his fitful dreams, which aren't dreams at all. In the space between waking and dreaming, between this world and the next, between body and soul, the silver Mysts feed on human souls. For a thousand years, a select few seekers have found a way to fight and defeat the Mysts where they live and set free the souls they've trapped. But the seekers have all but disappeared and it is up to Lance to end the battle once and for all and liberate humankind from the Mysts.",
