  "title": "Glastonbury Swan",
  "description": "Every few weeks, there is a mysterious death in Glastonbury, the Somerset (UK) town famous for its spiritual traditions, both ancient and new. The deaths seem completely unrelated - an apparent suicide, a hit and run, a drug overdose, a magic act which goes horribly wrong - but is that what the killer wants people to think? The police are certainly convinced - but one of the victims is communicating to medium Tabitha Drake that the deaths are linked. Who is killing all these people and why? This is what Tabitha has to figure out - before it is too late to save someone very dear to her.A sequel to Death and Faxes.",
