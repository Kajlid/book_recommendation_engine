  "description": "Easton Hayes has been my knight in shining hockey skates since he saved my life. This devastatingly handsome grump may be everyone’s favorite goalie, but to me, he’s my strength when demons haunt my dreams. And okay—so maybe he’s also the only man I’ve ever loved. But he doesn’t need to know that. We’re friends. It works for us. At least, it did. Until I wake up with his ring on my finger and the hangover from hell. But what happens in Vegas doesn’t stay in Vegas when he refuses to give me an annulment and follows me across the country instead. Now our families are furious. Our friends are playing matchmaker. I’m getting goosebumps each time I hear the words “my wife.” And I think my husband might be in love with me.",
