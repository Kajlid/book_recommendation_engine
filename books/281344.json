  "description": "The sea might be his mistress, but Shereen is the queen of his heart.  Known as the Iron Pirate, Darius has been sailing the treacherous seas for a decade now. It might be time to settle down before the monsters he’s been fending off finally get their tentacles on him.  But any plans for a quiet retirement walk the plank when he discovers the Princess Shereen has stowed away aboard his ship.  A pretty princess with a price on her head.  A woman who has only one dangerous choice if she wants to be free.  If Shereen can prove she inherited her father’s power, she might just survive. Problem is, what’s a pirate to do when she asks him to be her king?",
