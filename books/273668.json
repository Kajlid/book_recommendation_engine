  "description": "The World of Naeisus is at WAR!  Five unique races are locked in a furious struggle for six crystal shards of immense power. After uncovering some frightening texts during a night of historical research, King Areth of Mar imposes a critical duty upon himself to unite the world as it once was. However, the psychopathically brutal Captain of the Forsaken manipulates the work of the good King for her own selfish gains.  While the war rages on, something stirs beneath the ground; something from myth, far bigger and altogether more terifying than any of the denizens of Naeisus would believe.",
