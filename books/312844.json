  "description": "Saoirse takes part each year in the annual games on St. Patrick’s day. There are four things that you either need to find or need to do. For as long as Saoirse can remember, she has gotten three out of four, like everyone else that also partakes in the games. As the 4th thing on the list, the hardest is to find, a Leprechaun. But this year Saoirse vows she will get all four things on the list, no matter the cost. Will she be willing to pay the steep price for the fourth thing, when it’s her heart that is the currency?",
