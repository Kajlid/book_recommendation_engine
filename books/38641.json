  "description": "Perfect for Mother’s Day, or for any day on which we wish to acknowledge this all-important bond,  Mother  is an awe-inspiring affirmation of the enduring love that exists in every corner of the globe. With her signature eloquence and heartfelt appreciation, renowned poet and national treasure Maya Angelou celebrates the first woman we ever knew: Mother. “You were always the heart of happiness to me,” she acknowledges in this loving tribute, “Bringing nougats of glee / Sweets of open laughter.”  From the beginnings of this profound relationship through teenage rebellion and, finally, to adulthood, where we stand to inherit timeless maternal wisdom, Angelou praises the patience, knowledge, and compassion of this remarkable parent.",
