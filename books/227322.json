  "description": "A story about love, but not just a love-story!“Never a Dream” tells a tale of eternal love, the one that never ends, and lasts longer than one lifetime. The kind of love everyone is searching for… Except for, maybe, Matt — he is too busy living the classic rock-star’s dream full of music, drugs and girls. Lots of girls. Life is treating him well, until reality starts to bite. Rain, on the other hand, is a dreamer She recovers from one failed relationship and, with her eyes wide open, jumps straight into another. Her passion for antiques drags her into a new adventure that, like every castle-builder’s wish, begins in dreams. Wishful thinking is not something, Ed is familiar with. His life used to be strictly practical, however, Ed suffers from solitude, that even he fails to recognize. Even in a relationship he is still lonesome. But changing that means changing his whole life. Changes are also the thing Charlie is craving for. She’s been playing warm family life for long enough to get tired, so now she is ready for another step. Only she has no idea, where exactly is that step supposed to be leading her, and how many people she might hurt on her way. \n\nIf there is something they all share - it's a burnt down mansion, a small ominous town, and a century-old legend about two crosses.\nDarren H.
