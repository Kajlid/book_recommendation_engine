  "description": "My father taught me the importance of an eye for an eye—a cardinal rule, ingrained in every club member.A life for a life.Seven lives in payment for an unimaginable list of sins.People might wonder why I’m doing this. If this vengeance is borne from some noble cause. If I’m trying to prevent others from suffering at the hands of Dornan Ross and his sons.But I’m no selfless vigilante.I’m doing this for me. I’m doing it because I want to.I’m doing this because I just want to be able to sleep at night without seeing their faces.This is the fate they have earned. The penance for their crimes.Time to send some of these brothers off with a bang.",
