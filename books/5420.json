And even as she leaves that gift, another one, a letter, will help bring Sarah through the most painful and trying time she has ever had.One of the most honest portraits of death, courage, and, most especially, love can now be shared again with a new generation of children.\"Hermes, author of this . . . uncompromisingly candid story makes the reader aware of life's priceless moments and the need for courage.\"-Publishers Weekly\"A vivid, painful believability.\"-The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books\"A sensitive, touching account.\" -Instructor Magazine\"This book is by far the best liked book in my reading class. We have read this book in my fifth grade class for the last eight years. The book gives us an opportunity to discuss many issues confronted by young kids while growing up. It also provides an opportunity to discuss death and the loss of a loved one. The students and I have had many heart wrenching talks while reading this book. Many tears have been shed by my students while reading and discussing this book. This is my all time favorite book to read in class.\" -Online review",
