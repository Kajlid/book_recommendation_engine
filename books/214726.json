  "description": "If you like stories of struggle and transformation, read this story about Ben. Ben is not fully human, is considered a second class citizen, and is distrusted for the very characteristics that were built into his psyche. He's not even sure he has a psyche and has been told all his life he doesn't have true feelings. Norrie seems to think he does. Her unique upbringing has taught her to respect the special class of being that Ben is and to treat him equally. However, in a society that distrusts him and treats him as an inferior while at the same time fearing him, Ben is often in fight or flight mode. In a time of distress, Ben must choose between two drastically different paths and must weigh what he now stands to lose. This short novelette is a continuation of the Made for Me series, but it can be read as a stand alone. With this e-book, readers can also get a link to a free short story based on Pamela's upcoming time travel novel.",
