  "description": "New York City in 2057 â€” a metropolis divided. Sheltered by seawalls, Manhattan is green, clean, and thriving while Brooklyn and Queens have been given up to the hurricanes and the rising Atlantic. In this broken city, Jake and Shavir are like Romeo and Juliet, only that Jake works for Homeland Security and Shavir would be charged as an eco-terrorist should she ever get caught.Jake works for Homeland because he is brilliant at securing critical medical drugs in a fragile world running out of everything. Haunted by the loss of his family and a job that forces him to choose life or death for others, Jake is a sensitive man with too much amphetamine in his blood. He cannot afford to care for anyone, least of all a woman who is keeping secrets from him.Shavir thinks of herself as a part-time barista, a community farmer, and an underground activist fighting for the forgotten and discarded. Her heart beats for the people on a rooftop farm called Roots and the animals she rescues. The last thing she needs is a Homeland guy, but she can't stay away from Jake. When she takes him across the East River to the community he was ordered to ignore, entirely new questions arise about who must be saved and who can be sacrificed.A gripping medical thriller, a thought-provoking look into our precarious future, and an unflinching examination of our deep need for love and connection in times of social and environmental upheaval, Fragile is perfect for fans of Emily St. John Mandel and Alison Stine.",
