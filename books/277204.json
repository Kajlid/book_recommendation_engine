  "title": "The Sagas of King Half and King Hrolf",
  "description": "This book presents the first English translation of Half's Saga and a new translation of Hrolf's Saga , both classic Old Icelandic tales. Both belong to the mythical-heroic category of sagas, containing fantastical material and relying considerably on folklore motifs. They have at their base legendary, quasi-historical material which has served to anchor them more firmly in the Icelandic imagination throughout the 800 years or so of their existence. Will be of interest to the student of folklore and medieval Scandinavian literature.",
