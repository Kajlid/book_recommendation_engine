  "title": "Safe Sex",
  "description": "Adrift in an era that birthed both AIDS and The Internet, 22-year-old Wiley Jones washes out of school and into Atlanta in the early ‘90s with little more than his typewriter and an eye for the angles. It’s soon sink, swim, or ride the waves of the epidemic when Wiley starts writing for Brackett Data, an AIDS magazine with an agenda that borders on insanity. As the magazine’s newest junior editor, Wiley is quickly navigating through office politics, sex, scandal, sabotage, and all the turbulent in-betweens. At Bracket Data, AIDS is just another profit center, and it’s the corporate backbone on which Matt Bracket has righteously built his empire. A magazine, a radio station, controlled circulation, and expensive ad space all steer the AIDS conversation down morally murky avenues, and Wiley Jones just strapped in as co-pilot. Drawn to the danger of older women, wading through a shallow sea of dreams and disease, it’s hack or be hacked for an aspiring novelist who always has SAFE SEX on his mind.",
