  "title": "Things I Remember",
  "description": "This is a collection of poems and short fiction of 2000 words or less. The poems and stories chronicle the life of the author in dreams and illusions, current events and real people, fantasies and fears, common and uncommon occurrences, and a little bit of wacky surreal fun. Terse writing and simple language combined with symbolism, metaphors, and parody convey deeply layered emotional concerns about life, love, relationships, and the modern world. Though he has been writing nonfiction for many years, this is the author's first collection of fiction.",
