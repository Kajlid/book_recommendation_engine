  "description": "I remember nothing about the night I turned into a wolf. I don't know what I did or who I might have hurt. I think I may have even killed someone, but that's the least of my worries right now. The Sherwood pack is leaving Cedar Falls soon. The idea of being away from Jax scares me. More obstacles keep getting in our way. The odds of surviving this life, let alone this relationship, seem slim. Jax and I shouldn't be together, but the problem is that it's even riskier for us to be apart. Our bodies won't survive being away from each other for too long.  Love isn't supposed to be this dangerous.  Then again, I had known from the beginning that being with Jax Sherwood was a risk and I'd chosen him, anyway.  This YA paranormal romance novel is recommended for readers ages 17+ due to mild language, sexual content, and other mature themes.",
