  "description": "One queen. Four smoking-hot males. A reverse harem can't get any better with all the steam, actions, twists, and devotion!  My mates and I march into the dark Fae's court, where I was born and cursed. The usurper Fae queen, my aunt, rules with whip, blade, and dark magic. I'm determined to end her reign of terror once and for all. As the daughter to the First Princess, I'm the rightful heir to the throne, despite being a hybrid--half-Fae, half-dragon. And with the great magic of light awakening in me, I can unite all Fae and dragon realms, with my mates by my side.But the Fae queen is more powerful and devious than I could expect. She can't defeat me in a duel, so she resorts to seducing my dragon princes and offers them what they want the most.If the princes betray me, the curse will return to me and render me to the Fury beasts once again and forever. While I fight for my men, my kingdoms, and myself, a trial of fire also sweeps over all my mates to test their strength, limits, passion, lust, and our very bond.",
