  "description": "All West Montgomery wanted was a vacation. A week-long stay in Tucson with Abby and her parents, a chance to get away for the week, the opportunity to get to know her family a little better and maybe carve out a little alone time with his girlfriend. What he doesn't count on is finding a way to resume his baseball career. Encouraged by Abby and her father to attend a MLB open tryout, West discovers that he can still play ball—well—and he suddenly becomes the hottest commodity on the field. Overwhelmed with offers and possibilities, West knows that whatever choice he makes will affect more than his baseball career. It will affect his future with Abby. Professional baseball was always his dream, but Abby was a new dream come true. He doesn't want to choose between them, but in order to fulfill one of those dreams, West will have to. Because he knows it's all on him.",
