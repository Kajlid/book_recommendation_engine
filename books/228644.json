  "description": "Geisha is the futuristic tale of Jomi Sohoda, an android with a knack for painting. Adopted early in her development by the Kami family, Jomi has been assimilated into regular human lifeâ€”except society sees her as an outcast, something less than human. This makes it rather difficult for her to sell her paintings, so to make money, she joins the family bodyguard business, launching herself into a world of action and intrigue, complete with supermodels, jealous ex-husbands, maniacal moguls, robotic armor, and the twisted double-cross of art fakery.",
