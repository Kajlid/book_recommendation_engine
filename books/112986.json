  "description": "A high-tech robot boy enjoys a day of low-tech fun on the farm. Doug and his parents are off to visit the grandbots. But when their journey is interrupted by some sheep in the road, Doug goes from downloading information about farm animals to actually interacting with them! Doug gets to learn by doing —he herds sheep, milks a cow, gathers eggs, and then uses good old-fashioned “horse sense” to get their car back on the road. Doug Unplugs on the Farm is a lively celebration of farm life and the value of hands-on learning that will encourage kids to go screen-free and explore the real world! A terrific companion to Dan Yaccarino’s first book of low-tech learning, Doug Unplugged . Praise for Dan Yaccarino’s Doug  “Without preaching, [Yaccarino] comments smartly on children’s screen time and the necessity of outdoor play and exploration.” — Publishers Weekly “Yaccarino is especially good at slipping in the small, nourishing details that are savored upon repeated readings. . . . It’s a sweet tale and true to the anti-technology, analog strain that runs through much of Yaccarino’s work.” — The New York Times Book Review",
