  "description": "Jen has never enjoyed the full moon. Not like her family and certainly not like her boss, Rob, whose monthly trysts leave the office in a shambles. Jen turns into a mouse on the full moon, the most disrespected form in the were-community. Her crush on Rob only makes her deep loneliness and feelings of alienation worse. When her friend steals an amulet with the power to turn were-wolf, Jen decides to try it on... only to find that being a wolf isn't all its cracked up to be. A novelette guaranteed to make you howl. (Formerly released as Wolf N Mouse)",
