  "description": "Cover Art by Jen Lee http://www.jen-lee.comRated R: For graphic violence and some nudityThe time is one of constant discovery. The world expands by the day as colonists and empires search for new lands, or, more often, take old ones. Newer and better ships cross the seas constantly, but fear the unknown waters. Peopleâ€™s perspectives on the world change with every new revelation. Only a few precious elements stand firm. Those of faith turn to their churches, though there is fear of an imperial war looming with each visit to holy places. Loyalty to crowns is earned, but fewer and fewer leaders worthy of their people remain. The only ones who do not fear a holy territorial war are those already branded heretics. Those in search of a voice.The Holy Church of Dioverit has spread its influence across all the lands of the nearby continents, and continues to grow. It purports to worship a god of light, but such a claim seems dubious to the people who fall under its ever-growing shadow. Some places have managed to remain out of its reach, but only through a combination of luck, vigilance, and very \"sharp\" responses to the monks who try to be the first to \"convert\" a new city of heathens. But more and more, the fear that it is only a matter of time before they fall under the shadow of the Holy Church spreads. However, there have always been some. Scoundrels, thieves, murderers, pirates. Those who are so much better at moving through the shadows, and who know well how to start a fire.",
