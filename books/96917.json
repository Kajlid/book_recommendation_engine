  "description": "REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR!At 6 A.M. on Sunday, December 7th 1941, 353 planes manned by pilots of the Imperial Japanese Air Force winged their way toward the Hawaiian Islands. Their mission: destroy the United States Navy at Pearl Harbor, the U.S. Infantry at Schofield Barracks, and Army Air Corps at Hickam Field. At 0748 hours in Hawaii, the Japanese struck mercilessly in their bombing attack on Pearl Harbor!Meet Chief Boatswain's Mate Beau Lynnott and the intrepid men of his gun crew aboard the USS St. Louis (CL-49), one of the very few ships to make it out of the harbor to hunt down the Japanese task force that assaulted the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pearl Harbor attack.Although the tale of Chief Lynnott and some of the characters are fictitious, the details of the events of Japan's \"Operation AI\" are true and accurate Pearl Harbor facts, including a running log of the bombing from the perspective of the USS St. Louis.This semi-graphic historical novel captures, in classic comic book form, one of the most devastating events of the twentieth century in U.S. Naval history.Children of all ages will enjoy the retelling of this most famous tale of the brave civilians, sailors, soldiers, and airmen that endured, and even lost their lives through, the horrors of \"a date which will live in infamy,\" the date which marked the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War 2.",
