  "title": "Outlook: Grim: The Dead Nasties",
  "description": "This gargantuan book collects the first 6 shimmering issues of the darkly addicting Grim series. Join saucy heroine Wren and her best friend Chloe as they team up to toss out their unwelcome houseguests from The Other Side. With Ouijah Boards, Voo Doo Dolls, zombies, psychic gypsies, and deviant neighbors -- it's a paranormal smorgasbord of quick wit, sarcasm and silly humor. \"What more?\" you ask? How'z aboutz Ted the Wonder Snail! Eerie extras, sparkly Special Guest Artist Pin-ups, spooky sketches, and cut-out goodies galore! (It was going to be \"scratch and sniff\" too, but no one could decide what ghosts really smell like.)",
