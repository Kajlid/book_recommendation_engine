  "description": "Everything is going great for Madison Moriarty. She's got nice parents, good friends, and she's headed to UCLA at the end of the summer, the first step on an exciting journey towards becoming a world famous author just like her late father.OK, so she may dress like she survived an explosion at an uptight, buttoned up Martha's Vineyard branch of Tommy Hilfiger, but she's a good girl, damn it, from her boring top-siders to her preppy sweaters right down to her stupid My Little Pony laundry day panties.Rafe Stone... well, Rafe Stone is an asshole, and he's going to fucking jail. That's what happens when you steal your foster parents' Camry and drive it halfway across Colorado, the passenger seat strewn with empty beer cans and a homemade bong. He's been lucky so far, but this time the judge won't be satisfied with a slap on the wrist... unless Maddy's stepfather takes him in.This is what happens when two worlds collide.This is what happens when a nice, polite little princess gets thrown in with the stepbrother she never knew she had, a tattooed thug with a tight t-shirt, torn jeans, a pack of smokes and a bad attitude.This is a story of love, hate and David Fucking Bowie.You're gonna love it.",
