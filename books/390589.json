  "description": "All Tyrell Fannin and his cousins Isaac and Micah Burnet want is to get out of a Texas jail and go home to Mississippi.Delia Lavalle didn't need three outlaws to escort her and her sisters to Louisiana but she doesn't really have a choice.The outlaws aren't happy about escorting nuns, but figure they might bring them luck, because not even Santa Anna would harm a holy woman. A week into the trip, however, the outlaws find that the nuns are sisters but not of the cloth and that their tempers would make an angel's wings shrivel up and fall off.Tyrell is determined to finish his job and forget all about Delia's piercing blue eyes, that tumble of black hair, and her hot temper. Delia can't wait to be away from Tyrell's constant judgment, but along the way she finds herself drawn to him.Will they get what they want safe travels home or will fate intervene and bring them something altogether different?",
