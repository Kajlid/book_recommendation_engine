Lucas first met old man Limmer back in 1952. Only now Limmer is much younger--and the idea that someone can actually age backward in time is almost too much for Lucas and his wife, Maude, to handle.But Limmer is here to turn the Hawthorns' Kansas home into a time-travel depot for the Whispers, mysterious beings from the future.  The Whispers mission? To find the beginning of time.So the Hawthorns land smack-dab in the middle of a drama that spans history, past and future: from ancient Troy to colonial Kentucky to a Camelot of the next millennium, where a murderous tyrant thirsts for immortality.He just needs time . . .",
