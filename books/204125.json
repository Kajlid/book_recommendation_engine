  "description": "Noah Baker is about to meet the toughest woman in Texas—right before he marries her. Harley Wilson, of the Texas Wilsons, is being stalked by an unscrupulous creeper who is intent on doing her harm. In order to protect herself, Harley asks Pamela Jones to find her a groom. She needs someone who can hold his own in a firefight and happily sign annulment papers when this nightmare is over. Noah Baker thinks he’s hit the jackpot as a Billionaire Marriage Brokers’ groom. The position is the perfect opportunity to move forward and put the past behind him once and for all. However, Noah must dig into his training as a police officer and doing so brings up demons he buried two years ago when he left the force. Time runs short for Noah as his list of suspects grows to include an almost fiancé, a twisted cousin, and Harley’s step-brother. With Harley’s father breathing down his neck, Noah finds himself falling for Harley in a way that makes this assignment as personal as—well, marriage.",
