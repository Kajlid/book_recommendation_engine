  "title": "The Crofter Trilogy",
  "description": "Three generations of Historical Fiction and Romance, on and off the seas. From I, Walter where a boy runs to the Sea, and learns to trust his own instincts; to I, James where Walter's son James is forced onto the water; and then to James' daughter Mary, who loves the Sea and goes to it with Ã©lan, and stays close to it for a lifetime. Each of these novels tells us about the courage and the valor and the struggles of the 1600s. If The Canterbury Tales by Chaucer is a comparison, I would think that Walter could be the Sailor. James the Banker. And Mary the Teacher.",
