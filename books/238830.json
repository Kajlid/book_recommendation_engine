  "description": "In the quiet town, snowflakes lightly fall. Though the road to town is not well-travelled, a special visitor is to appear. It is Daniel's first Christmas and he eagerly awaits him. Who is Santa Claus? Daniel wants to find out and see for himself! When his parents are fast asleep, the sound of a Christmas carol makes him stir. His eyes slowly open, and the rumbling singing halts not. He must be here! Running to the living room, his joyful gaze of anticipation meets that of the one and only Santa Claus, and does he have a job for Daniel! This year, a Christmas wish is made come true! Being Santa's little helper, Daniel finds out this is the season of love, joy, and giving!",
