  "description": "\"Kept in the Dark\" is a subtle study of a man's jealousy and indignation. Unlike Trevelyan in \"He Knew He Was Right,\" who is wrongly convinced of his wife's past. Before her marriage to Western, Cecilia Holt was engaged to the spiteful, conceited Sir Francis Geraldine. As she is unable to find the right moment to confide this to her husband, Western discovers the fact from Geraldine himself, and in a fit of wounded pride deserts his young wife, refusing to hear the truth from her lips.Originally published in serial form May through December, 1882, in Good Words and in book form in 1882. Trollope died during the last month of serial publication.",
