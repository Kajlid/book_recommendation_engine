  "description": "*A new adult romance novel.Sullivan Hope is a total screw up. He finished university with the help of his father’s donations to the school and an ultimatum: Straighten up and join him in the family business, or screw up again and he’s cut off for good. This summer is his last chance to live it up before walking the straight and narrow in the fall, and the lure of a good party and, even better, alcohol is more than he can resist. Besides, he’s never met a situation he can’t handle or talk his way out of, or a pair of panties he couldn’t talk his way into. That is, until he meets Abby, the nursing student full of sarcasm and sass.Flying half way across the country to do her practical nursing placement at Stone Cliff Resort hadn’t been part of Abby Claire’s plans for the summer. When her first appointment, which would allow her to stay at home and care for her family, falls through, it’s either pack up and go or risk not graduating. Meeting the rich, God’s gift to all things on earth playboy, Sullivan Hope wasn’t in her plans, either, but the more she’s around him, the clearer she sees the man who hides behind the parties and liquor.When a summer fling turns into more than either of them had bargained for, Sullivan’s world begins to crumble and Abby gets dragged down into the rubble. He can’t let her in despite her healing touch. And Abby can’t risk getting too close and finding a reason to stay and save Sullivan.",
