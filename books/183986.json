  "description": "Dear Author,In a city full of real monsters, it’s easier to be invisible, overlooked, than to draw attention to myself. Especially since I was alone with no family or friends. I won’t trust anyone, not ever again. That’s why I spend my days by myself, impersonating a lost dog.My plan was perfect. At the very least, it made survival easy. But lately, a vampire has been coming by my alley to bring me food. I swore I wouldn’t trust anyone ever again. But then, why do I get the urge to follow him home?Photo Description: The photo is a manga picture of a shaggy-haired boy in a collar clutched in the arms of an older man. They both wear winter coats. While the man’s expression is one of smiling possessiveness and a certain degree of smugness, the boy has a wide-eyed look of startlement and seems a bit taken aback; however, his arms are around the shoulders of the man and his fingers are twisted in the man’s coat. There is a sense of homecoming and of finding safe harbor.This story was written as a part of the M/M Romance Group's \"Love is an Open Road\" event. Group members were asked to write a story prompt inspired by a photo of their choice. Authors of the group selected a photo and prompt that spoke to them and wrote a short story. This story may contain sexually explicit content and is intended for adult readers. It may contain content that is disagreeable or distressing to some readers. The M/M Romance Group strongly recommends that each reader review the General Information section before each story for story tags as well as for content warnings.",
