When Zach Wechsler, the object of Kyra's affection, begins to show interest, she has to be careful.Surely one girl can't destroy a band that's been together for ten years... only what if she can? Kyra knows she's one bad decision away from ruining everything she's worked for, and taking the hottest act of her generation down with her.",
