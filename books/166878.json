After her father’s betrayal when she was twelve years old, she was left to pick up the pieces of her mother that the man had left behind. Although she’s faced her every day since his abandonment with her chin held high, inside, Ember is a ruin. For the past ten years, Ember has bottled her pain inside so tight, she’s never found the strength to face it head on, so that she can lay it to rest. It’s not until the day that she arrives at The Donnelley Ranch to visit her best friend, Kamilla, that Ember finds herself working alongside the only man in the world strong enough to release the pain inside of her, so that he can help her fight it. Luke Donnelley is anything but intimidated by Ember’s pain and cold shoulder. Instead, he is determined to break down her guard, so that he can prove to her she is worthy of love and affection. Luke’s armor against Ember’s frosty front is hot, and before she knows it her defenses are melting against the one man who has the power to destroy her. Will Ember listen to her heart and fall into the romance of Luke Donnelley’s charms, or will she keep running, praying to find somewhere safe and without the risk love presents? A Tender Touch is book four in The Donnelley Brother Series. This story belongs to Ember Brighton and Luke Donnelley, as it focuses on their journey of both finding and capturing love. Throughout this novel, you’ll enjoy more interactions with the characters of the previous three novels, and of course, Gracie Donnelley.",
