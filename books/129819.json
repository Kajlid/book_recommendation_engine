  "description": "Sixteen-year-old Amber never expected to find romance while working in an old people's home...but then Jack Chant is not what she expected either. He's young, exciting and enigmatic - and deeply troubled by something that happened in his past, something he can't quite remember. Gradually Amber suspects that Jack's past might be a whole lot further back in time than he realises. Is he solid flesh and blood, or just some kind of dreamy fantasy?A sweetly romantic coming-of-age story in which Amber learns more than most teens about getting old, falling in love and letting go.",
