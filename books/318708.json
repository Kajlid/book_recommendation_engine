The first time I meet her, I kiss her. The second time I meet her, she's breaking into my neighbor's house. She swears up and down she’s not a criminal. Maybe not, but she is definitely a distraction I don’t need. I’ve got my hands full with my mouthy daughter and an insanely busy life as a hotshot firefighter.

I can’t keep my hands to myself when she’s around, and she kisses like a dream.Graham & Madison’s story is perfect for readers who love small town romance, hotshot firefighters, single father romance, alpha heroes, smart sassy heroines, frenemies to lovers, hate to love, opposites attract, slow burn, emotional romance with a dash of angst, plenty of steam and swoon, and a deeply protective grumpy hero.*A full-length, standalone romance.",
