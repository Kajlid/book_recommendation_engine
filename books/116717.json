  "title": "Paris Thibideaux and the World of Lost Things: A boy, a dream, a Gift for making Something out of Nothing",
  "description": "Paris Thibideaux believed in a World of Lost Things. He was convinced of the existence of this World because pieces of it kept turning up in his yard, in the alley, and in the great green basin of Powderhorn Park--odd bits of busted bicycles, broken toys, and rusty appliances. He was new to the city, and to him the alleys of his neighborhood read like a book that he couldn't put down. In the discards of other people's lives he read stories of loss and abandonment, of hurried departures and broken homes, of waste and want, and all he had to do to change their endings was pick them up.He moved through the neighborhood like a magnet passing through a box of nails. He was only eleven and until about a year ago, he and his mother had lived and worked in the country, following the harvests from season to season. He didn't know that the City is at once the Cradle of Civilization and the Reject Pile of Humanity--a place at odds with itself, full of contradiction, always welcoming new people and yet always falling apart and away from some previous grandeur that is more remembered than real. And yet, people keep coming to the City as they have throughout history, for opportunity and a better life--immigrants, refugees, the poor, the old, the broken, the lost, the artists and dreamers who don't fit in anywhere else--people like Paris Thibideaux and his mother.",
