But there’s a catch. To rescue the girl, Tegan must return to the city she once called home and fool the vampire she’s been harbouring feelings for all this time. She must play the role of a spy, and though she’s supposed to be pretending, as soon as she lays eyes on Ethan all those feelings she tried to suppress come flooding back. Her biggest fear is him discovering the truth, because then he might just end up hating her forever.Moonglow is book #2 in L.H. Cosway’s Blood Magic Series.
