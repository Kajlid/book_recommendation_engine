  "description": "Kerryanne Lashley is trying hard to pick up the pieces of her life after suffering a horrible betrayal. Not only did her husband of ten years, her high school sweetheart the man she thought would be hers for a lifetime cheat on her, but he did it with her best friend. Now she’s taken to hiding herself away in a ratty apartment, which is all she can afford these days. Kyle Clancy wants out of the little nowhere postcard town as soon as possible. He hadn’t set foot in the place since he was a kid, and the only reason he’s here now is to try to talk his grandpa into moving to the big city since his grandma’s passing. He had no more interest in a relationship of any kind than Kerryanne did, but one fateful encounter on a sidewalk in the early morning sun would soon set these two on a collision course with destiny.",
