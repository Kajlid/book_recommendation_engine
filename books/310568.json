  "description": "I never saw it coming...the bones...the magic...the betrayal.It’s no longer a question of who I can trust—the answer is no one. Now, it’s about survival.I’m in the heart of the Order, trying to solve a series of mysterious disappearances, while doing everything that I can not to become bait.Enemies are circling, and they can’t seem to decide if they see me as a pawn or as a threat. Oh, and there’s that little issue of being tethered to Rogan, who I now want to kill.It’s time to figure out just what I’m capable of though. Because fool me once...shame on you. But fool me twice...and I will crush your bones to dust.My name is Lennox Osseous, and I’m about to unleash the wrath of the Bone Witch.",
