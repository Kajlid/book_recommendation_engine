  "title": "This is Good: A Journey To Overcoming Adversity",
  "description": "Adversity is often seen as a bad thing. Something to avoid. But to accomplish anything worthwhile adversity is necessary. It is what separates the great from the mediocre, the champions from the contenders. The difference is in how you look at adversity. Success comes from learning to see it, think about it, and respond to it in a positive or productive way. Creating a “this is good” mindset will allow you to do this. This is a story within a story. It is how an African folk lore transformed a college soccer team to reach heights they didn’t know they could. You will follow their journey and the lessons along the way that enable them to cultivate a new way of thinking.",
