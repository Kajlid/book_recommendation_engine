Escape will require ingenuity, daring, courage. Natural Woman In a world where you can 3D-print your house, where plastic surgery and genetic science make any unnatural body-type, plant, or animal imaginable possible, a natural young woman is trying to find herself-when she spots the natural man of her dreams. Finagling her way upwards through the rigid hierarchy of society to locate him, she learns something about society, herself, and life.",
