  "description": "It’s not a real case, he’s not my boyfriend, and we aren’t partners.Three lies I told myself for survival.After ten months of shamefully stalking and showing up randomly on Tallus’s doorstep at midnight (for reasons), the sinfully hot records clerk decided he’d had enough of my games.In fact, he went out of his way to bring me the most ridiculous case (it was not a case) on the planet as an excuse to push me over the line (he wanted a date). Our arrangement (hooking up) didn’t suit him any longer.Could I say no? Of course not (this was Tallus).Five days, I told him. Five days to prove his silly theory, then we were done.Little did I know, Tallus had a deadline of his own.Investigating a mind-controlling-murdering psychic was hard enough (because it was not a thing), but resisting Tallus’s charm was the real challenge.It turned out, I was wrong about a few things.The case might be a case after all.Tallus had potential as a partner.And after all was said and done…I wasn’t sure I could let him go.",
