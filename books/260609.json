  "description": "When Maven Stone called my name, everything changed. I never expected to fall in love with him or with his frat brothers Chance and Banyan. I never imagined how that perfect, single, unconventional choice could change our lives.  Then Molly tried to burn me down and my parents took me away from school, from New York, from my guys. But no matter what happened in New York or halfway around the world, nothing could change our undeniable truth—I love them and they love me.  I’m Giovanna Amsel, and no one has to understand how we fit together. No one except us. This is our love story.",
