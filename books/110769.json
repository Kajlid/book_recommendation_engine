He meets Sindee Simpson, an amazingly-sexual and beautiful woman; they fall in love quickly, enjoying their new lives together very much. As an airline pilot, Hatfield travels very anonymously. No plane tickets, hotels in his name, or taxicabs, so the assassin is able to easily send Hatfield on jobs anywhere in the country. There is adventure, danger, and retribution in the jobs Hatfield successfully completes for his new boss. Suddenly, the situation takes a Hard Turn, exploding into something bigger than all of them when Mexican drug cartels and the CIA are involved.
