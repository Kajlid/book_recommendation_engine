  "description": "It's not a match made in heaven. Space, on the other hand..... Jules A. Jenner has got a good thing going on Earth. The former party girl has traded in her club dress and opened up a reasonably successful pub. She has parents who love her, nine sisters who keep a girl on her toes, and a life that's on track. Everyone thinks she's just a normal citizen. Nobody has a clue that aliens exist, or that Jules' mom is one, or that those nine sisters are mildly unhinged. Then one night a tall, hot, sharp-toothed alien named M'anu shows up at Jules' doorâ€”and suddenly Jules' normal citizen status is revoked in a big way. Now it's all space, plots, pirates, shootouts, and a sexy male who keeps misunderstanding her signals. Guess the universe will have to learn a valuable lesson: Never mess with a Jenner.",
