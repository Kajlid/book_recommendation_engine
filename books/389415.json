  "description": "Darby lives her life below the radar, moving from town to town in the coldest climates, eluding the demons that hunt her - and never allowing herself to get close to anyone. Now, in frigid isolation, Darby waits tables in a small town and tries to forget who she is - what she is - and the danger forever nipping at her heels. Until a new danger finds her - a lycan pack whose distant howls have the locals on edge. But the call of the lycans has also drawn a handsome, menacing stranger....For years, Niklas has searched for the bloodthirsty pack that murdered his mother and infected him. Darby is overwhelmed by his raw appeal and dangerous strength. Niklas senses her need and vunerability...and together they give in to the hungry attraction blazing between them - but desire this fierce brings dangers of its own. When Darby is targeted by the lycans, the stakes are higher than ever - and Niklas is not about to lose another woman he loves to their evil bloodlust.",
