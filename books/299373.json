  "description": "For more than 25 years Noriko Morishita studied and practised the intricate ceremonies of the famous Way of Tea, attempting to learn its complexities and achieve a perfection of movement and mood that few can master. In The Wisdom of Tea Noriko describes her gradual discovery of freedom and insight within the very rules that once seemed so constricting. Looking back across her life, Noriko illuminates the real teachings of the Way of Tea: to live absolutely in the moment, to notice and delight in the smallest of details, to embrace the vital skills of patience and perseverance, and to allow yourself to be. The Wisdom of Tea is a distillation of the life lessons Noriko learned through many seasons, spanning girlhood to adulthood. It is a wise and inspiring book that reveals the lasting relevance of an ancient ceremony.",
