  "description": "Mark Malone just wants to finish high school so he can get into a good college, win a few hockey games, and complete his internship at the University of Virginia’s computing center. But when he is coerced into helping a Russian crime syndicate foment their plan to flood the market with a lethal new drug, his prospects for an uncomplicated future quickly vanish. Meanwhile in California, MIT dropout and unrepentant hacker, Lin Pace, happens upon the intricate plot. His early optimism that the new medicine could help his ailing mother is soon dashed when, after stealing Mark’s identity to gain access to proprietary files, he discovers the drug’s hidden deadliness. Their virtual relationship becomes decidedly real when Lin races across the country to help a now addicted Mark combat those who would profit from the drug’s exploitation. As their initial alliance deepens into love, they must put their faith in Lin’s hacking skills and Mark’s passion for the truth to combat the mob and build a future together.",
