  "title": "Tales of Love of Madness and of Death / Cuentos de Amor de Locura y de Muerte",
  "description": "This is an English translation of the famous collection of 18 weird tales of Horacio Quiroga, which is presented as a Spanish/English bilingual edition.Most of the stories are dark and strange and describe situations that offer no clear way out for the protagonist. Some stories are set in the countryside or the jungle, and others in the city, both showing the lives of the poor and disinherited but also of the most favored members of society.Quiroga portrays sharply the social miseries and limitations of the protagonists, which often end up deciding their final destiny. Irony mingles freely with social denunciations, love, madness and death.Also this book is useful for students of Spanish, to learn Spanish through reading, since the side-by-side presentation of the Spanish and English texts, makes it easy following the original Spanish text.The tales presented in this book are:Una Estación de Amor / A Station of LoveLos Ojos Sombríos / The Shady EyesEl Solitario / The SolitaireLa Muerte de Isolda / The Death of IsoldeEl Infierno Artificial / Artificial HellLa Gallina Degollada / The Decapitated ChickenLos Buques Suicidantes / Suicidal ShipsEl Almohadón de Plumas / The Feather PillowEl Perro Rabioso / The Rabid DogA la Deriva / DriftingLa Insolación / InsolationEl Alambre de Púa / The Barbed WireLos Mensú / The MensúYaguaíLos Pescadores de Vigas / The Beam FishermenLa Miel Silvestre / Wild HoneyNuestro Primer Cigarro / Our First CigarLa Meningitis y su Sombra / Meningitis and its Shadow",
