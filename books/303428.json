  "description": "IT'S HARD TO KEEP A GOOD PSYCHOPATH DOWNTIME... And it's harder to figure which psychopath to fear most! Senator John Caddrick hires a professional assassin to murder his own daughter and threatens to destroy the whole time-touring industry. Caddrick's hired gun plans a high-level double cross -- but then everyone's plans are thrown into chaos when Jack the Ripper's killing spree spreads from Victorian London to Time Terminal Eighty-Six. In this breath-stopping sequel to Ripping Time, retired time scout Kit Carson and ex-con man Skeeter Jackson enter an unholy alliance that surprises everyone -- including Skeeter and Kit. All they have to do is track down Senator Caddrick's missing heiress, lost somewhere in history, rescue Ianira Cassondra from the clutches of a madman, and keep the most famous time-touring station in the world open for business, while avoiding death in The House that Jack (the Ripper) Built.",
