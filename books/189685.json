  "title": "Charity Rain (Charity, #5) The Drake Triplets",
  "description": "AVAILABLE NOW!!!Thirteen years have passed since we last saw the young Drake triplets, and they are no longer adorable, but smokin’ hot eighteen year olds coming into their own. Their wolf senses are on high alert as they’re learning to control and master the change. The summer is over and school is about to start. This will bring Glorianna and Journey back home from the summer months spent in Alaska with Raven and Rose, but that is not all. Not only have the girls grown and matured over the summer, but they’ve brought the beautiful Rain, half vampire/half werewolf, with them. It’s chaos at best as the competition between brothers ignites and sends the Drake pack into a spiral of events that may just destroy them all.",
