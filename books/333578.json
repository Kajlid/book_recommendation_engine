  "description": "COSMIC WARThe planet was called simply A-9. The air was unbreathable, the water poisonous. But it had to be conquered, for it was the home world of the most implacable enemies that cosmically expanding humanity had yet encountered.Body armor had been devised for the commando forces that were to be dropped on A-9—the culmination of ten thousand years of the armorers' craft. A man in that armor would be stronger than a 20th century tank force. But the enemy had a weapon that was its equal—sheer murderous mass attack by a horde of thousands of antlike almost unkillable beings.But there is more to war than battle—there is always the question of the human being within that armor. And in this unforgettable tale of such a man, John Steakley has given us a novel of cosmic combat that will stand against the best of Gordon Dickson or Poul Anderson.",
