  "description": "Can hope be found when everything seems hopeless?When illness threatens her brother’s life, deaf peasant Calaine Kalen vows to do anything to save him—including finding work near a war-torn area overrun with giants and nefarious schemes. When war threatens Prince Renner Leorin’s kingdom, he vows to save it no matter what—even if that means convincing a surly former enemy to help. Neither peasant nor prince ever imagined their efforts would place them in each other’s path. She needs a cure. He needs a miracle. Can tragedy bring two unlikely hearts together, or will heartbreak shatter any hope of both love and saving those they care about?A Silent Hope, a New Adult, faith-filled retelling of The Wounded Lion, is a standalone novella, complete with tropes like rags-to-riches, concealed identity, and a deaf heroine. It is part of the Hope Ever After series, a collection of twenty hopeful and uplifting fairy tale retellings. Each book is written by a different author, so it can be enjoyed in any order. The proceeds from this series are donated to the O.U.R. (Operation Underground Rescue) to rescue children from exploitation and trafficking.",
