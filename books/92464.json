  "description": "He Walks with Dragons takes place when what was, what is, and what shall be were one in the same. Draig, a boy on the verge of his manhood, is summoned to the majestic mountain by the Great Ones. There he finds out he is about to transcend the ages and risk his life to prevent the destruction of mankind. Born into the naïve innocence of ancient man, Draig lives a simple pastoral existence in a quiet, small village. But one day he is flung on a magical journey into a forbidden new world. There Draconos, a dragon, befriends the boy, training him in the art of warfare. From this day forward, the young boy finds himself in awe at the wonders the world holds for him. Not only has Draig become a man, but he is living like a dragon and learning their mystical powers. “From the time Man first crawled upon this earth . . . we found him worthy to take his rightful place among the creatures that walk upon the earth. While hiding in the shadows, we have protected him. We have nurtured him all these many ages. But now man grows in great numbers and makes war on everything he sees.”And when the time comes, will Draig be willing to lay down his life for the sake of saving the dragons? And when the dragons are gone, where will he go? He is no longer just a man. Stan Thornton has always had a passion for myth and ancient history. His profound understanding of ancient myth and legend brings to life the lost age when boys ventured forth as dragonriders riding on the backs of dragons. Here history and mystery converge to make for a transcendent experience.",
