  "title": "Indigiqueerness: A Conversation about Storytelling",
  "description": "A tender, eclectic reflection from an Indigenous author on his life, work, and queer identity.Evolving from a conversation between author Joshua Whitehead and Angie Abdou, Indigiqueerness is part dialogue, part collage, and part memoir. Beginning with memories of his childhood poetry and prose and traveling through the library of his life, Whitehead contemplates the role of theory, Indigenous language, queerness, and fantastical worlds in all his artistic pursuits. Indigiqueerness is imbued with Whiteheadâ€™s energy and celebrates Indigenous writers and creators who defy expectations and transcend genres.",
