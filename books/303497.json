  "description": "Love doesn't live here anymore. Mercedes Baxter, raised by a strict mother after being deserted by her father. Mercedes's thoughts on her mind conform to the life and rules that her family has set for her, but she's not trying to hear it. Her weakness for a bad boy has her crossing paths. Casanova Griffith was never her plan, a wannabe thug. Searching for a man's love, she settles for what he's offering. Casanova, always looking for money the easy way, draws Mercedes into a lifestyle that she's not ready for, confusing love for lust she willingly accepts. Longing to be loved may be a blessing, lesson, or a curse as it blinds her to the world around her. Will love cost her freedom, or will it make her stronger? Flex Boston, rebellious, well raised, always steered clear of love until he crossed paths with Mercedes again, no longer a little boy crushing on her but a grown man looking to build a future with her. Attraction and chemistry throw their ages and preconceived notions of each other out the window as they both release all inhibitions as they live have always been intersecting and destined.",
