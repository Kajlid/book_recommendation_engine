  "description": "Hitler's once great army is broken and demoralized, the end of the war is imminent--but still soldiers are rounded up like criminals and sent to the front. Jews are evacuated, guns are fired, shells explode. In this novel Böll paints war as a series of idiocies, senseless accidents, and bizarre coincidences related only through death.",
