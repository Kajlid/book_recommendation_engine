  "description": "Adapted to picture book format. In the first edition of A White Heron, writer Sarah Orne Jewett posed some tough questions for the youngsters reading her book: What is an individual's responsibility to nature? Does our desire to understand the world give us the right to dominate plant and animal life? Should human relationships take precedence over relationships with other species? Is there any way for humans to co-exist with nature, or must we trample, dissect, or attempt to control it?",
