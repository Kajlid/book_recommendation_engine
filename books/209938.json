  "description": "I’ve been with the sexiest women in the Caribbean, but I never met one who didn’t want me for my money. Or own island. I kind of like it. But then I meet Paris Jones, the winner of an essay contest for a free vacation at my resort. The girl knows what it’s like to be at rock bottom. And she definitely doesn't need to be lied to anymore. Still, I love the fact she likes me for me. Should I tell her I own this place? Add Tatiane trying to get her claws back into me, and I’m caught between two worlds and two women—the one who wants to own me and the one I’m going to lose if I don’t step up my game. Will money or love seal this deal?",
