  "description": "GAME THEORY - How the world really works...The most precious things come at a cost—something fraud investigator Katerina Carter knows all too well. She struggles to cope with uncle Harry’s ever-worsening Alzheimer's just as she lands her biggest case ever - a massive Ponzi scheme. Billionaire Zachary Barron’s business is in free fall, somehow connected to the shadowy World Institute. Game Theory uncovers how the world really works, where an ever-smaller pool of winners gain from the suffering of others, leaving the masses to fight over the crumbs remaining. And the players will stop at nothing to get what they want.",
