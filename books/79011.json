To save the doc from madness, The Haven's new director must analyze the hell out of Hyperlink from Hell. Is Canning's tale of kidnapping, murder, time travel and wardrobe malfunction fact or fiction, deceit or delusion? Can she solve the murders, save her boss and find Canning? Or will she need a padded suite of her own? \"Hyperlink from Hell: A Couch Potato's Guide to the Afterlife\" isn't just the latest of the funny vampire books. It's the great American mystery... in hyperdrive.",
