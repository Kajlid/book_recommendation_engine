  "description": "‘Till death do us part…   Dean’s a tigon shifter who’s found himself accidentally married to Natasha, a mob princess. Ever tangled with a (literal) mob of Russian Siberian tiger shifters? It’s a great idea if you’ve ever dreamed of being fitted for cement shoes, but not exactly Dean’s style.  Dean always knew his not-so-innocent wife would one day return and it’s been nothing but explosions since. But he’s not about to bounce his responsibility. He made a vow, and when a tigon weds, it’s for life.",
