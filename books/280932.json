  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Jason Moss was used to playing roles. As a boy, he perfected the art of fitting in with different crowds but never having one of his own. Then, partly to satisfy a college assignment, he turned to a new crowd: men who'd blazed their way into the American consciousness and now languished in prison. Men named Dahmer, Manson and Gacy.Posing as an ideal friend - or perfect victim - Jason wrote letters to the infamous killers. While Moss corresponded with Charles Manson and Jeffrey Dahmer, none was more fascinating than the 'killer clown', John Wayne Gacy. Obsessed with his new pen pal. Gacy's letters became weekly phone calls and eventually, an invitation to his prison - a showdown Jason tells in nightmarish detail. With Gacy the clear master of his prison domain, the eighteen year-old was forced to look into the abyss and consider that he might become Gacy's last victim.As Jason slips further and further into the underworld of Death Row convicts, his everyday world spins around him, becoming more and more surreal. Impossible to put down and brutally honest, The Last Victim stunningly mirrors our society's fascination with the most violent and depraved among us.",
