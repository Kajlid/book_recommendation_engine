It takes zero point two seconds for your brain to identify love versus lust, it's a scientific fact. Your brain knows it. Your body knows it. What about your heart? Undeniable chemistry can't be ignored. Temptation can be irresistible. You know you are inevitably going to get burned, but the carnal desperation you feel can't be easily brushed off. The risk of being vulnerable and getting hurt is overcome by the possibility that fairytales may exist in the real world. They are just a little dirtier, messier and definitely less innocent. Where does it lead? Crushing hard. Falling even harder. Emotions run high, because how can they not?Falling in love is easy. But love isn't only blind, but deaf, handicap and degenerate. An all-consuming love can take you down. You may never get up.We instinctively tend to run away from things that could possibly hurt us. However, an intense relationship is at least real, not dull, predictable and boring. Even if it's raw and painful.When you find someone who brings out the best and worst in you, you don't focus on the bad, but simply feel alive. The moment your eyes meet is the point where your life turns on its axis.Is it avoidable? Hell no.Is it always flawless and perfect? Probably not.Is it worth it? Absolutely.Warning: 18+ This book is intended for a mature audience and isn't suitable for young readers.Note: This book is part of a series but doesn't end on a cliffhanger, can be read as a standalone.Coming Summer 2015, exact release date TBA soon.",
