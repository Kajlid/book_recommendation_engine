  "description": "\"The journey in the tunnel of light was swift and long, joyful and painful, past memory, past history, past all knowledge of evil, past anger at his shooting and the separation from his family, until there was little that remained of the Earth being. Only life as it had been in the tunnel of light.\" Earth is a mistake in the Universe, a violent planet destined to be destroyed by nuclear war in 2070. William Blake, a visitor from a peaceful planet, believes that human violence can be cured through genetic and environmental manipulation, and that Earth should be saved. Blake looks like an exceptionally handsome human being and no one suspects he is an alien. He learns that Earth is an extremely violent planet where murders, mass shootings, wars, and genocides are commonplace. He also learns that it is a place of great natural beauty, creativity, and extraordinary love. As the action unfolds, Blake is consumed by the violence he seeks to end, as the story catapults toward a spectacular and unusual conclusion.",
