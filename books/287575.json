You become part of her life as you share in her intimate moments. This recollection of life is a touching and amusing series of stories that we all can relate to, no matter where we grew up, or no matter where our life has taken us. Elly's journey will lead you to recall your own life's metamorphosis. You may even laugh or cry at some of the experiences in the most typical, daily slices of life that we have all encountered.

Life is a constant and never-ending passage of events in time, treasured for generations. Telling one's personal stories makes one live forever. Searching for Serenity in My Crazy Life. Fun, fascinating, and memory provoking. Growing up doesn’t mean growing old. Growing up is a life story.",
