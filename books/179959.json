What she didn't plan on is the plot twist who walks into her life (or rather, her psychotherapist brother's waiting room) in the person of Anton Akhmerov, more popularly known as The Russian Bad Boy of Tennis.Anton Akhmerov, five-time Grand Slam tennis champion (except for Wimbledon, which continues to elude him), seems to have everything — money, fame, and a supermodel girlfriend — except his ranking has fallen to 200 after a shoulder injury. The only thing he cares about is becoming number one again, but getting back on top seems not only difficult, but impossible, what with his temper and racket breaking problem. His manager tries everything to help him get his head on straight: first there's psychotherapy, and then there's his new PR assistant Sophie, who thinks he's nothing more than a self-conceited jock.They might be from different worlds, but as their paths cross, they find their lives inevitably changing in new and unexpected ways.Book 1 of a contemporary romantic comedy series written in a multi-POV he-said she-said style with the main protagonists and minor characters alternately telling their side of the story.",
