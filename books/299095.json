  "description": "My entire life, I've longed for freedom. I was only twelve when I witnessed my mom's murder and was handed from one foster home to the next. No one wanted me, so on my eighteenth birthday, I gathered all my determination to finally make a change - to make my life my own. But fate worked in mysterious ways. After painfully colliding with Jake, I found someone to confide in and share my shattered past with. It didn't even matter that he seemed like the worst candidate to show my true self to - son of a wealthy real estate tycoon, he threw his life into work and alcohol, hoping to rid himself of his inner demons. We weren't so different, after all, and our experiences brought us closer together, teaching us to love ourselves for who we were, and not what the world wanted us to be.",
