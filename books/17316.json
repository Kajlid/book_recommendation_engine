  "description": "Part of the First Time For Everything Daily Dose 2011 collectionAll Patrick Hinsen wants is a little action, a little release, and a little bit of courage to approach the new guy in Human Resources. Instead of hitting the bar, he decides to give anonymous phone sex a try, thinking nothing of envisioning Carter, the smooth talker on the other end of the line, as the new HR guy. It’s all fun and games until it starts affecting his work. Finding himself drifting off in sexy fantasies at the office is bad enough. It’s downright crazy when he learns that the hot new HR rep’s name is Robert Carter. When Patrick finally invites Robert out to a hockey game, the similarities start stacking up—and their fledgling relationship may flounder when the coincidences become too numerous to ignore.",
