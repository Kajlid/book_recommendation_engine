  "description": "The dreamy lumberjack from Kat’s work retreat is only supposed to be a vacation fling. He’s not supposed to show up on her doorstep in NYC. And he’s definitely not supposed to be her new boss...What happens at the lame work retreat in the mountains stays at the lame work retreat. That’s the saying, right? Somebody really ought to tell Bryce. Or rather, Bryce should have told Kat who he really was. As it is, she’s about to find out the hard way that her vacation fling has followed her home. And all those perfect plans she’s made for her future? He’s threatening to blow them all to pieces with his swoony kisses and his over-the-top grand gestures. There can only be one winner when it’s a battle for her heart. The only problem? The more time Kat spends with Bryce the less sure she is that she wants to win. Because winning this battle might just mean losing her heart...NOTE: This is the sweet and majorly revised edition of a book formerly published as Lust for Life in the Sexy in Spades series.",
