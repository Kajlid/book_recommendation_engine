  "description": "Lycan Warriors, Book ThreeShe went down in a hail of bullets, but even hell didn't want her.In the eyes of the law, Cristoval is a freak who ought to be hunted down and destroyed. To the thousands who look to him for guidance and strength, he's the resistance's charismatic leader, a man who sacrificed even his own happiness for the cause. When he meets a woman who eclipses every other, a Valkyrie fierce and forceful, he knows he's been given a second chance.To a woman who faced death and came out on top, the towering lycan with the haunted eyes is an anchor in a sea of chaos, a pillar in a world gone mad. He'd be more if she just let him. And she wants to. But the enemy has to pay for what they did to Cristoval and her, for stealing their chance, for twisting something good into an aberration.If she has to drag her enemy down to hell herself, then she'll do it. She's been there. She knows the way.",
