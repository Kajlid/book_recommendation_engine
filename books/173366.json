Normal wasn’t a path ever set for Cereus. She was her Father’s daughter but my soul mate, even if I disputed ever owning one. She was struggling without me in her life, the vacant ache inside her leaking out. I can’t not go to her, the need is too strong and like with all of my urges I embrace it.",
