  "description": "England, 1680HOW EASILY ONE'S HEART CAN BE STOLEN...DEPENDS UPON THE THIEFKnown to some as Gentleman Jack and others as Swift Nick, Jack Nevison preys on the wealthy, stealing coin (and the occasional kiss) on England's darkest roads. Jack's dangerous deeds are legend, but the thrill of a highwayman's life is growing cold—until he meets the intrepid travel writer and spinster, Arabella Hamilton. Beautiful and bold, Arabella may come from the world Jack despises, but she's a kindred spirit at heart. When circumstances bring them together the sparks ignite—yet they remain on opposite sides of society and the law and with each encounter they risk more. To be together, will one of them have to give up their world forever? The adventures and exploits of real-life highwayman Swift Nick and the observations of 17th century travel writer Celia Fiennes are woven throughout this tale—which takes the reader from the privileged world of London’s aristocracy to the highways and byways, inns and hunting grounds of some of England’s most celebrated rogues. I hope you will enjoy it, and think it worth the wait.",
