  "description": "\"Two best friends create a computer that can see one year into the future. But what they can't predict is how it will tear their friendship--and society--apart. Ben Boyce and Teddy Chaudry are outsiders struggling to find their place in Silicon Valley. But when Ben reads Teddy's graduate dissertation about an obscure application for quantum computing, he has a vision of a revolutionary new A computer that can see forward through time by communicating with its future self. The two friends quit their jobs and team up to form a business, building a company that will deliver their groundbreaking device to consumers around the world. Rival tech giants try to steal their innovation, while government agencies attempt to bury it--but Ben and Teddy are helped by their own cutting-edge technology, staying a step ahead of the competition and responding to challenges before they arise. As the tension mounts, Ben and Teddy's friendship begins to fracture under the weight of ambition, jealousy, and greed. Most frightening of all, they discover the dark side of the machine they've created--the ways in which viewing the future sets them on a path toward unavoidable disaster of epic, apocalyptic proportions. Unless they can disrupt the technological system they've created, there won't be any future at all. Told through emails, texts, transcripts, and blog posts, this bleeding-edge tech thriller chronicles the social costs of innovation and asks how far you'd be willing to go to protect the ones you love--even from themselves\"--",
