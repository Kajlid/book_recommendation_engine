Then, when the plug is pulled and her thinly veiled mask of respectability slips, everyone will know what she has known all along… She is married to a monster.She has to weigh up what will be worse - being known as the woman whose husband is the devil in disguise, or breaking her own silence. When the moment arrives, which path will she choose?Or will it be decided for her?FIVE STARS from Readers' Favorite'The depraved and twisted nature of Casey's husband is outrageous and sickening, but even more disturbing is the realistic reaction Casey portrays.'This hit-the-nail-on-the-head account is an accurate rendition of an abusive situation and how the recipient excuses their aggressor. Although it was hard for me to read, this story gave me a good idea of how a victim relates to their situation and why they respond the way they do. This is an excellent true-life portrayal that can inspire women to stand up for themselves.'",
