  "description": "One day, the world found out about newly discovered star, that was \"eating\" other stars. At first, it was so far away, that it became just a nice curiosity entertaining people in their normal daily lives. Then, it begun to come closer and closer, finally eating some of the solar system's planets and taking a straight course for Earth itself...Jigokusei Remina is a spectacular tale of ultimate and unavoidable destruction of humankind, that came unexpected and without humanity's own \"help.\" It's also a solid overview of how people can't cope with their own most primitive instincts (blind revenge), even in the face of final doom.1.
