  "description": "French poet Paul Verlaine, a major representative of the Symbolist Movement during the latter half of the nineteenth century, was one of the most gifted and prolific poets of his time. Norman Shapiro's superb translations display Verlaine's ability to transform into timeless verse the essence of everyday life and make evident the reasons for his renown in France and throughout the Western world.\"Shapiro's skillfully rhymed formal translations are outstanding.\" — St. Louis Post-Dispatch \"Best Book of 1999\"\"Paul Verlaine's rich, stylized, widely-variable oeuvre can now be traced through his thirty years of published volumes, from 1866 to 1896, in a set of luminous new translations by Norman Shapiro. . . . [His] unique translations of this whimsical, agonized music are more than adequate to bring the multifarious Verlaine to a new generation of English speakers.\" —Genevieve Abravanel, Harvard Review\"Shapiro demonstrates his phenomenal ability to find new rhymes and always follows Verlaine's rhyme schemes.\" —Carrol F. Coates, ATA Chronicle",
