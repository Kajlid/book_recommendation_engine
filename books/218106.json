  "description": "Jock LGBT Erotic ContemporaryIf you think Jocks and Nerds have nothing in common, come to the Jock Dorm!Cute, nerdish Dar has no idea what to expect when campus housing places him in the Jock Dorm. He certainly doesn't expect his Jock-God of a roommate, tall, hunky, muscular Gregg the champion wrestler. Nor falling head over heels for him. Workouts, friendship, a little hurt and comfort, and pretty soon Dar can't take being in love with his straight roommate.But maybe Gregg isn't so straight. He's been keeping secrets of his own, like a murdered first love and a family that's pretty much disowned him for being gay. Though he vowed never to fall again, he's not figuring on Dar and how the cute little nerd unfreezes his fearful heart.For once, the nerd gets the jock, but different interests are the least of their problems. They can't keep their hands off each other, but coming out is the hardest part.Publisher's This book contains graphic male/male sexual practices.",
