  "description": "Best friends make bets all the time. But when the stakes involve taking your neighbor’s virginity, it’s never a good idea. Especially when he turns out to be your soul mate.Charlotte Bowman thought all teenage boys were alike. She had been warned all her life that they were only interested in one thing. Then along came Ryan Taylor, her long lost neighbor. After a terrible car accident claimed his father’s life and seriously injured his mother, Ryan was forced to leave the prestigious Abbott Hall Academy in London and return home to South Carolina. His only intentions were to help his mother with her rehabilitation and take care of his out-of-control younger brother.Though Charlotte hadn't talked to Ryan at all during the last six years, and had scarcely spoken with him since he returned home, she couldn't deny that there was a little chemistry there. On a whim she made a bet with her best friend, Olivia, that she could have sex with Ryan even though it was rumored that he was saving himself for marriage. Being a virgin herself, Charlotte quickly discovered she lacked the finesse needed to seal the deal. She ultimately finds herself stuck in a high stakes poker game where she’s about to lose much more than a bet.",
