  "description": "Writer by day, sub for hire by night. Blond, built and as hot as they come, Josh knows his dream of D/s romance has no place in the dungeons where he bares his body for any Master’s whim. Michael, piercing blue eyes, movie-star smile and compelling Dom persona, can have any man he wants with the snap of his fingers. On an impulse he checks out Dungeon Dreams, known for its stable of hot male submissives. Though the scene is controlled, “slave j” reacts with an unexpected passion to the kiss of Michael’s whip and his sensual touch. Slave j’s intense response steals Michael’s breath, but he’s determined to forget the green-eyed man since by definition their “relationship” can never be more than a game. Josh—his body, imagination and perhaps a piece of his heart—is captured by the sexy Dom. He finds his carefully compartmentalized world crumbling. Somehow he must face and conquer his desire for a man he might never see again, one who regards him only as a sub for hire.",
