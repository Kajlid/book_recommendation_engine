  "description": "Hello, my name is Jamie Baker—and I am not a superhero. I I am not a superhero. Sure, I may have more in common with your friendly neighborhood Spiderman than, say, anyone else on the entire planet, but having superpowers doesn’t make you a hero. Superheroes use their powers for the good of mankind. I only use mine to score excellent takeout and eavesdrop on entertaining conversations. Bestselling young adult romance author Kelly Oram is back with the second book in the Jamie Baker series! Jamie Baker, the only girl in the world with superpowers, has now accepted who she is and learned to control her power. Not to mention she has the best boyfriend on the planet. Life is finally looking good. But the day she witnesses an accident and decides not to save the guy out of fear of being exposed, she realizes that simply being Jamie Baker isn't enough. After seeing Jamie so wrecked with guilt, the ever-helpful Ryan Miller decides it's time to make all of his fantasies about turning his girlfriend into an honest-to-goodness superhero become a reality. Of course, coming up with a decent Super Name and fending off all of Ryan's attempts to get her into spandex aren't the only problems Jamie faces. The more her alter ego starts to make headlines, the harder it becomes for Jamie to hide her extracurricular activities from her best friend, the government, radical scientists, and the mysterious new guy who is determined to steal her from her boyfriend.",
