  "title": "Recovery is my best revenge: My experience of trauma, abuse and dissociative identity disorder",
  "description": "What is it like to live with Dissociative Identity Disorder? In this first volume of her collected essays, Carolyn Spring writes candidly from a number of perspectives about her experiences of living with trauma-related dissociation. 'Memories of Mummy' is an evocative piece told mainly through the eyes of a child; 'Rediscovering Eden' is raw and disturbing; 'Dissociative Moments' is a profound insight into the experience of dissociation. This volume covers topics such as shame, child sexual abuse, and the complex meanings of 'madness', but finishes with a determined vision of recovery and the journey towards it. Carolyn Spring is a writer as well as being Director of PODS (Positive Outcomes for Dissociative Survivors) and its charity framework START (Survivors Trauma and Abuse Recovery Trust). PODS works to make recovery from dissociative disorders a reality through training, informing and supporting, and is run by Carolyn and her husband, Rob, who is Director of Client Services as well as being a qualified psychotherapist. Carolyn is Editor of 'Multiple Parts', a magazine/journal produced three times a year for PODS, and also spends a large proportion of her time training at PODS' many events throughout the UK. She developed Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) as a result of prolonged and extreme childhood abuse but believes passionately in recovery and the dignity and respect that is due to all human beings, but especially those who have been abused as children.",
