  "description": "A painful unsolved mystery resurfaces after decades of confusion in this emotional story about inter-generational trauma, family, and the beauty of Puerto Rico. Thirty years ago young music student Emilia Oliveras married Paul, her dream man. Their Caribbean honeymoon cruise was idyllicâ€”until the night he disappeared from their ship, presumed drowned. Reeling from the loss, Emilia was horrified when Paul's wealthy, vindictive family tried to railroad her as a gold-digging murderer. She escaped home to Puerto Rico and then across the country, where she became Emily Oliver, suburban wife and mother of two. Still, the trauma and secrets of her past ruined her second marriage, and created a disconnect with, and between, her grown daughters. But now a mysterious phone call suggests Paul is alive and well.",
