  "title": "lotería literaria: 54 Short Stories",
  "description": "Lotería Literaria is a collection of short stories that is a literary lottery because each story is as unique as the Mexican Bingo cards they draw inspiration from. Furthermore, this short story collection is diverse, with each story written in one of the following dark humor, dirty realism, magical realism, science fiction, horror, or light erotica. Some stories are flash fiction, while others are slightly longer traditional short story lengths. The stories pull from influences of celebrated authors such as Hemingway, Steinbeck, Vonnegut, Bradbury, and Márquez to name a few. Stories take place in Mexico and the U.S. and deal with classic and contemporary issues. Themes in Lotería Literaria are mostly framed around the struggles and absurdities of life and death.",
