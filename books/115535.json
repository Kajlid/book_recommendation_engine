  "description": "Candace Marie Browne has been the head cook-hell, the only cook on the Crooked E ranch for the past three years. She’s come to care for the owner Mr. Everson like a second father and the ranch hands like brothers…all except one. Mason Edwards, foreman on the Crooked E ranch was as far from being a brother as a man could be. After walking in on her fiancé and her best friend going at it on her new furniture she needed a break from men altogether. So like any mature woman…Candace moved out of her hometown of Helena, Montana and picked up the first waitress job she could find in Butte and didn’t look back. That’s where Hank Everson found her a few months later and offered her the job on the E. Within a week she felt like she was home. Mason had noticed the beautiful redhead the moment she walked into the dining room at the E. But what really got him? Was when he saw the woman actually cringe at the dinner he had put made. Every day since he’d noticed her even more. The long shiny auburn tresses, big brown puppy dog eyes, a body that was rounded in all the right areas. Oh yeah! He’d spent a lot of time thinking about his Candy Girl. Plus, the extra corn bread biscuits she snuck him every Friday after their weekly chili dinner didn’t hurt either. Yep, Mason had discovered Candace was…Sweet as Candy! This book contains numerous hot as hell cowboys, a Rottweiler who sees herself as a lapdog and a curvaceous woman who craves high-handed behavior in the bedroom from one former rodeo man.
