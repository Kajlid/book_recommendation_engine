  "description": "Duty--or desire? Revered businessman Falco Orsini has left life in the Special Forces behind--though he uses his powerful skills occasionally, when duty calls. But duty is always on Falco-s terms! When his estranged father asks him to protect a young model who is being stalked, he begrudgingly agrees--only because of the vulnerability he can see in her eyes. Elle Bissette won't be a victim--she can take care of herself! And surely big, dark, devilish Falco is dangerous? Because one kiss from a man like him will leave her breathless.",
