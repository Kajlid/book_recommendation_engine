  "description": "Gaby Triana's first novel about Desert McGraw, a famous rock star's daughter who wants nothing more than to lead a perfectly annonymous life. In this hip debut novel, rising star Gaby Triana uses her immensely accessible voice and humor to paint a mesmerizing picture of a life not quite in the spotlight–but not quite out of it, either. As the daughter of a famous rock star, Desert McGraw has led a glamorous existence. But now that she's sixteen and living in yet another new town, she just wants to call one place home. In fact, Desert will do nearly anything to lead a normal life–even if it means breaking up the band.",
