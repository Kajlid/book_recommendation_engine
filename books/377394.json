  "description": "Aliens love underpants, in every shape and size, but there are no underpants in space...You probably thought aliens came down to Earth with a view to taking over the planet - but, no, they simply want to steal your pants!When little aliens fly down to Earth, they don't come to visit because they want to meet the Earthlings. They simply want to steal everybody's underpants! They like them large or small, they like them red or green, and they like them in all other sizes and colors, too. They think that Mom's pink, frilly panties are a perfect place to hide. And Grandpa's woolly long johns make a super-whizzy slide!The text is in verse, the illustrations are big and bright.",
