  "description": "Writing an article for the Sydney Morning Herald on the Cannes Film Festival is every journalist’s dream. For Audrey Scott, and her nuisance inner voice, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood heavy weights is the chance in her career she’s been waiting for. But when an American heiress, and fellow guest of the luxurious La Ferme, is found at the bottom of a dry well, Audrey finds herself pushed in a different direction. Isolated and with a killer in their midst, Audrey must identify the murderer – before he or she decides to strike again.",
