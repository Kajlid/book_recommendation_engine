Her own failed marriage proved that men would only use her. It doesn’t matter that she longs for a man to love her, hold her, protect her, and want children with her. It just isn’t meant to be.Alexander Gregg and Butler Roman, enforcers for Beckett’s pack, are stoic, often brutally serious wolf shifters that no pack member or outside challenger ever crosses. Their lives hold no tenderness, no softness, and no mate to complete their triad.The Fates have gifted them with Nikki. She brings laughter and tenderness into their lives. And hell no! She is not afraid of them!They need her to be safe and understand that sometimes giving up control does not mean weakness. All they have to do is convince her to put aside her stubbornness and accept them as her mates and the fathers of her babies.Word Count: 127,349",
