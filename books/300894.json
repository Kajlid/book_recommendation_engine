Start with Alpha and welcome to Ghost Mountain!The Ghost Mountain pack has been waiting for their fancy new den building for months, but it won't be the only thing unloading off the trucks.The coming days will have a lot of surprises - for pot-scrubbing dominants, for betas who weren't expecting to lose their hearing just yet, and for an elder who was present on the day her pack was born and every single day since.Myrna was ready to stand at the center of her pack's rising. Except that isn't where they need her to be.",
