  "description": "Growing up in the Ozark Mountains of northeastern Oklahoma, Billy Colman wants nothing more than to own the pair of coonhound pups he saw advertised in a sportsman's magazine. Although the sum is tremendous, Billy is determined, and after two years of hard work and saving, the two puppies become his.Billy's pups are his \"shadow,\" following his every move through the dark hills and icy river bottoms in search of the elusive raccoons. The three gain a fine reputation as an inseparable team when they win the coveted gold cup in the annual coon-hunt contest, capture the deceptive ghost coon, and, in the most difficult battle of all, put up a fierce struggle against a mountain lion.But the victory over the mountain lion turns to tragedy, and Billy's days of freedom and innocent boyhood rapidly end. Yet much remains for Billy: he not only has his wonderful memories, but he learns a beautiful old Indian legend which gives them sacred meaning.As it has for generations, this modern classic is sure to warm the hearts of young and old alike.--front flap",
