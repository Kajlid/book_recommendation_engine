  "description": "A HUSBAND IN DESPAIR. AN ENEMY IN NEED. A LIFE AND DEATH VOTE.  “Bane, I know it’s risky, but I think I should do this speech. We’ve got to win... If we don’t, we’re all dead...” In three months, the citizens of the EuroBloc will decide whether or not to abolish Sorting, the grim annual harvesting of “imperfect” teenagers for their organs. If they vote the wrong way, then Margo and everyone she cares about will die. While Bane struggles to cope with the loss of his eyes, the lives of millions of young people and Believers are at stake as Margo embarks on increasingly risky political missions out of the Vatican State. But threats soon loom from the most unexpected quarters, compromising even the security of the Vatican itself, and with the vote hanging in the balance, the media battle threatens to turn into real war. Bane is desperate to join Margo in the fight, but how can he without his eyes?
