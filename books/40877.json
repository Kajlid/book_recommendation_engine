  "description": "“I should sue the people who designed the My Little Pony Crystal Rainbow Castle I played with in kindergarten. They led me to believe that castles were filled with rainbows and cupcakes and pastel-pink furniture. Not stone and fire and . . . blood.” Eighteen-year-old Jessica Packwood is having a hard enough time feeling regal with her new vampire husband, Lucius. But when he’s charged with murder, Jessica’s suddenly on her own. She knows that with no blood to drink, Lucius’s time is running out. Can she figure out who the real killer is—and who she can trust—before it’s too late?",
