  "title": "The Church of Tango: a Memoir",
  "description": "The Church of Tango is a passionate memoir of tragedy and adventure, lust and music, romance and tango, and above all, survival. A dancer all her life, she'd had to put it on hold while raising her artistic sons and caring for her dying husband. Now as she set her suitcase down on the ancient cobblestones of a Paris courtyard, she wondered -- 48 years old, 6,000 miles from home, knowing no one -- what she was doing? Each time disaster strikes, Cherie forges ahead, struggling to save herself from the wreckage by listening to the music and dancing, first in Los Angeles, then France, Mexico, Holland, and finally in the tango salons of Buenos Aires.",
