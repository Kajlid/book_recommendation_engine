  "description": "A year ago, he gave her his heart. Now he wants it back.Meg never expected to find the love of her life sitting in a coffee shop. It wasn’t like life was good right then, and she knew she wasn’t any great catch. But handsome Edward, with his sexy British accent and irresistible kisses, was very persuasive. Meg handed over her heart without much resistance and expected it to be for keeps. When Edward suddenly disappears, though, she is forced to confront her deepest fears. Has she been a fool?Months later his brothers appear, begging for Meg’s help and telling a story that is almost impossible to believe. Caught between the love she once shared with Edward and the demands of his new, agonizingly-different persona, Meg is faced with a choice. His family is counting on her to get through to him, but only she can decide whether to stick it out, despite the uncertain outcome—or cut her losses and move on.
