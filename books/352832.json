But one scream of terror changed all of that and Angel ended up with so much more.Cara Michaels was on top of a table dressed in nothing but a damp towel when he kicked in the door and came to her rescue. He was every erotic fantasy that she could think of, all rolled into one. And Cara was more than ready to indulge her inner vixen. Cara was ready for anything and her merciful Angel was willing to give her a glimpse at just how erotic it could be.",
