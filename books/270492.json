  "description": "Not one of them had imagined it would affect their lives directly, but sadly each of their husbands was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease. They found themselves thrust into the role of chief caregiver, but they also discovered a close bond developing between them as they shared the difficult journey of the deteriorating health of their spouses. Eventually, a new road faced each one, the loneliness of being a widow.This story shares humor, bittersweet memories, suspense, and romance as Marvel and her friends decide to accept the challenge of this new chapter in their lives and take a vacation together. Little do they know of the adventure that awaits them. The story was inspired after watching my mother and her friends over the many years they spent together while visiting their husbands suffering from Alzheimer’s in the nursing home they shared. My mother called this group of women, the Last Wives’ Club. Together they provided each other support and laughter while sharing stories, going on outings, and picking up the pieces after losing long-time partners.I believe those who read The Adventures of the Last Wives’ Club will find it charming and heartening, especially those who finds themselves alone after a spouse’s death. You’ll smile and chuckle as these four friends travel west together, experiencing the added dilemmas faced in our golden years.",
