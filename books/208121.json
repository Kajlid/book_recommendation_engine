  "description": "Jonas... Book 3 in the Vengeance MC series  After losing the woman he believes was destined to be his in an act of senseless violence, Jonas Williams is spiralling out of control. With nothing left to hold on to, no anchor in sight, Jonas decides to put everything he’s worked for on the line to seek vengeance for the woman who stole his heart.  Blaine Adams has never been accused of being a stupid woman, but she is beginning to question her sanity when it comes to the heavily tattooed, intimidating, volatile man she was bound and determined to save. Even if it meant saving him from himself, Blaine refuses to give up on the man in imminent danger of self-destructing.  When history threatens to repeat itself, claiming Blaine as another one of its victims, Jonas is faced with startling realization that perhaps he hadn’t lost everything after all. Maybe there was still a beacon of hope just within his reach.  But with time running out before Blaine too is lost to him forever, Jonas must choose between the lesser of two evils. Can he save himself and the woman he has come to care deeply about, or is it safer to live in the darkness that has become his only solace?  *** While this book is part of a series, it can also be read as a standalone with no cliff hanger and a HEA. ***  ~ Available Now ~ Book 1 ~ Call Me...Vengeance Book 2 ~ Fury  ~ Coming Soon ~ Book 4 ~ Gage Book 5 ~ Cash Book 6 ~ Sly  *~* Please be aware this book is recommended for readers over the age of 18.
