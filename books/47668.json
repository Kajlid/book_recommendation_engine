You will never go wrong with a Delilah Devlin story and you will never be disappointed.\" ~ 5 Cherries, Whipped Cream Reviews \"[Delilah Devlin] is borderline genius...\"~ BDSM Book Reviews Overview of TWO WILD FOR  It's double the trouble when two ornery cowboys come courtin', Texas-style... Lone Star Lovers, Book 6 Sam Logan's hell-raising twin sons have a bad rep in Two Mule, Texas. All of it earned. When it becomes clear those two troublemakers won't settle down without another nudge--make that a boot to their butts--Sam reissues his challenge. Find a wife. There's only one woman who's ever held Mace and Jason Logan's attention for more than one night. Molly Pritchet, their former teacher. She's been too worried about a pesky morals clause to let them close, but they're older now and ready to prove to her that some rules are meant to be broken. Molly thought her path was always a teacher, never a mother or a wife. Until she finds those two Logan \"boys\" in her backyard, all grown up and digging around in her business. More accurately, starting her koi pond for her without asking. Well, it's about time someone taught the Logan twins some manners. A little mud, a lot of yearnings she thought she'd suppressed, and Molly realizes she's the one being schooled in the art of indulging in forbidden desires. Two hot-as-sin twins romance their former high school teacher. Things are bound to get down and dirty quick as two bad boys tag team to sweep one curvy, sexy woman off her feet.",
