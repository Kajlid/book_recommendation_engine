  "description": "An enthralling, genre-crossing novel about the Kennedy assassination that weds the thriller to science fiction for an illuminating and surprising examination of what actually happened that day. As history records it, John F. Kennedy was killed at 12:30 p.m. on November 22, 1963 by two of three bullets fired from the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository by Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. But there are far too many matters that history failed to record. Charlie Cross woke up late one summer morning in 1962, exactly forty years in his own past. Why he was sent back, and who sent him, are a complete mystery, until he begins to detect differences between the past as he knew it and the one playing out around him now; a paradox that could have apocalyptic consequences for both Charlie and his reborn world. With the aid of characters from both past and current lives, including Laura Mills, a journalist who becomes his supporter, rival and lover, and Secret Service Agent Ed Rossi, who has some secrets of his own, Charlie undertakes a mission that will literally change the course of history; a mission that will earn him powerful allies including John and Robert Kennedy, and Chief Justice Earl Warren, and dangerous enemies like J. Edgar Hoover. In Dallas, on November 22, 1963, the truths of both of Charlieâ€™s lives will lead him to the grassy knoll, and the horrific choice between his future and ours.",
