  "title": "All Forgotten Now",
  "description": "A life that crisscrosses Zimbabwe, England, and Canada. A self-imposed exile, a state of constant waiting. Jennifer Mariani’s poems grieve a life she can’t return to, even as she struggles to belong elsewhere. Never far from the page is the reality of growing up white in post-independence Zimbabwe: Jennifer’s own privilege juxtaposed with everyday poverty and racism. The poems in this book cry out with grief and rage and loss, and sometimes celebration. Every page is warm with the heat of Africa and wet with the tears of unbelonging.",
