  "title": "The Universal Happiness Method - How to Be Happy and Live Without Stress",
  "description": "The Universal Happiness Method is an original teaching and modern method for gaining conscious control of your mind. Once you understand and experience how your mind operates on the deepest level, you can consciously direct your attention, manage thought, control emotion and be present naturally. This conscious control of your mind can release you from stress, fear, unhappiness and a host of other unwanted experiences and allow you to experience the peace, stability, clarity, confidence, and lasting happiness you have been seeking your entire life. The Universal Happiness Method is short and to the point by design to accommodate your busy, modern lifestyle. It was developed so you can read it in an afternoon and use the knowledge for a lifetime of happiness. The teachings and method are easy to follow, practical and results oriented and they are based entirely on the authors' experiences of regaining conscious control of their minds without the help of a teacher. - www.innercirclepublishing.com",
