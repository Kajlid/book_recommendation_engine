  "description": "The beloved Buddhist meditation teacher and  New York Times –bestselling author of  Real Happiness  offers encouragement and inspiration for anyone on the spiritual pathBuddhist teachings have the power to transform our lives for the better, says Sharon Salzberg, and all we need to bring about this transformation can be found in the ordinary events of our everyday experiences. In  A Heart as Wide as the World , Salzberg distills more than twenty-five years of teaching and practicing meditation into a series of short essays, rich with anecdotes and personal revelations, that offer genuine aid and comfort for anyone on the spiritual path. Many chance moments, both small and profound, serve as the basis for Salzberg's hearing a market stall hawker calling, “I have what you need!”; noting hotel guests’ reactions to a midnight fire alarm; watching her teacher, Dipa Ma, bless a belligerent dog; seeing the Dalai Lama laughing uproariously at his own mistake. Each passing moment, Salzberg shows, can help us down the path toward “a seamlessness of connection and an unbounded heart.”",
