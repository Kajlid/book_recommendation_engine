  "title": "Living with the Himalayan Masters",
  "description": "\"I will tell you how I grew up and how I was trained, about the great sages with whom I lived and what they taught me, not through lectures and books but through experiences.\"- Swami RamaReading it, you will discover the human side to this yogic master. He is a young boy, full of mischief. He is a teenager, full of curiosity and adventurous zeal. He is a seeker, with certain strengths and weaknesses. Just like us, he sometimes fails to distinguish the fake gurus from genuine masters, mistaking magic for spiritual achievement. Living with the Himalayan Masters is one of those rare books that contains the seeds of transformation within its pages―sowing those seeds in the heart of the reader, and creating the potential for true spiritual upliftment. These stories record Swami Rama's personal quest for truth and enlightenment―inspiring, illuminating, entertaining, mystifying, and often droll and humorous. This life-changing book will bring you face-to-face with some great twentieth-century masters, including Mataji of Assam, a ninety-six-year-old sage who never slept; Gudari Baba, who taught Swami Rama the value of direct experience; Yogi Sri Aurobindo, who integrated meditation with action; Uria Baba, who demonstrated that every human being has the potential for healing; and Mahatma Gandhi. Read the humbling story of the man who founded the Himalayan Institute, and the great teachers who molded him into a Himalayan Master.",
