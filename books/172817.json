  "description": "Care of the Soul, the seminal number one New York Times bestseller by Thomas Moore, introduced the idea that the soul is an essential ingredient of life. Now, with The Re-Enchantment of Everyday Life, Moore takes another radical step, applying the principles of caring for the soul to our surroundings and the concrete particulars of how we live. Starting from the premise that we can no longer afford to live in a disenchanted world, Moore shows that a profound, enchanted engagement with life is not a childish thing to be put away with adulthood but a necessity for our personal and collective survival.With his lens focused on such specific aspects of daily life as clothing, food, furniture, architecture, ecology, language, and politics, Moore describes the renaissance these can undergo when there is genuine engagement with beauty, craft, nature, and art in both private and public life. When all is said and done, what makes life worth living? Not electronics, entertainments, or rapid information retrieval, but a spiritual and soulful vision that arises from enchanted nature, a fantasy-filled childhood, intimate neighborhoods and homes, and a public life dedicated to the needs of the heart.",
