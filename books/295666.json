  "description": "(Ruin Me is Part 1 of The Summer of Secrets Series. It is a 30k-word novella, and can be read as a complete standalone, or as the first part of the interconnected series.)  Eleanor “Kitty” Bordeau, the baby of three sisters, lives by rules of the heart.  Too young to remember their lives before the tragedy, she’s always gotten away with being impulsive and responsibility-free.  And after running away from everything she ever knew, with heartbreak at her heels, passion only existed in the form of poetry.  Now, two years later, she’s back in her hometown, where her muse still haunts her.  But when heartbreak—also known as Joey Madden—catches up to her, Kitty decides to rewrite her story. And this time, she won’t allow his lies to once again ruin both their lives.",
