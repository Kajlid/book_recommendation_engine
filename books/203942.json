  "description": "Caidi became Acine - alpha female - of her pack at a young age. In the years since that hard time, she has led her pack of shape-shifting Zarain into prosperity, all without the help of a single male. She has almost everything she could want, except for one thingâ€¦ a baby. Caidi knows that even getting pregnant won't be easy, but she's willing to take the risk to get what she wants. \nAnd then everything goes wrong.\nRaven, an alpha Shadatai Zarain warrior, doesn't know the blonde woman who approaches him in a tavern, but he knows he wants her. After just one night with her, he has no doubts. He's found his mate-and she isn't getting away from him. Now that Raven has found his mate, her safety is one of his highest priorities. Caidi's life is dangerous and she needs his protection. \nWhether or not she wants to accept it doesn't matter.",
