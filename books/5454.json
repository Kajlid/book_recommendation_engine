  "description": "CPA Lauren Hughes has been so busy working on taxes, she hasn’t managed to cultivate a love life. She’s so desperate for fun, she accepts a ticket to what she thinks is a rave. When she finds everyone at a mansion playing board games, she thinks she’s been had…until she doesn’t win and learns that Richard, her host, has very special consequences for losing. If only she hadn’t been too vain to wear glasses, she’d have read the rules in the foyer and have a clue about what the players expect her to do next. But with tall, dark, and sexy Richard in charge, Lauren can’t bring herself to leave before she learns exactly what he has in store for her.",
