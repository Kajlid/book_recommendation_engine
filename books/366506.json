  "title": "Bushwhackers and Broken Hearts: Letters from Missouri during the Civil War",
  "description": "This nonfiction book portrays life in rural Missouri during the War between the States. Candid letters to a Union soldier give insights into the lives of his people back home. An up-close and personal glimpse into the Civil War on the home front. It is a saga of love and infidelity, of patriotism and desertion, of troubled birth and tragic death, of commodity prices and crying babiesâ€”the stuff of daily life in a Missouri torn apart by fear and animosity. Authentic Civil War letters, fully annotated and discussed.\"An excellent job of publishing and interpreting the letters.\"---LOUIS S. GERTEIS, professor of history, University of Missouri at St. Louis, author of \"Civil War St. Louis\"",
