  "description": "A panicked puppy in a Los Angeles shelter deemed too terrified for adoption is scheduled to be killed. When a rescue volunteer frees her at the last minute, the little girl is 15 pounds underweight and covered with open sores, swollen ticks and thousands of fleas. Her ears are stuffed with blood and wax, her paws filled with concrete. The victim of severe neglect and confinement, her muscles are atrophied - even her tongue lolls in her mouth. It hurts her to walk more than a few feet, and she limps. She has chewed and licked through the skin on her limbs. Physical ailments can heal, but the greatest challenge will be to overcome what life has taught her about humans: that they are to be feared. Named Roo, the puppy is randomly assigned to a volunteer foster parent with neither special skills nor experience with fearful dogs. He writes that he is, “just as scared as she is.” Notes from a Dog Rescue in Progress is the emotional and inspiring true story of Roo’s journey and the powerful bond formed as she and her foster dad develop the trust and understanding to address her fears and problems one at a time. It’s the story of an attempt to redeem an unredeemable dog.This series originally appeared online, where it received nearly 20,000 likes, shares and comments, making it the most popular dog series of 2012. It is accompanied by 20 images and links to numerous videos and online resources.",
