  "description": "The second in the fascinating series about the lives of the beautiful Beth Cunningham, her family and friends.  Britain moves ever closer to the 1745 rebellion and the impending attempt to restore the Stuarts to the British throne.  With no other options available to her, Beth marries the effete and tedious social butterfly Sir Anthony Peters.   She resigns herself to a future of formal parties and dismal social gatherings, whilst accompanying a husband who is both tiresome and physically repellent to her, but consoles herself with the thought that if she is not to know love, then at least she will have a secure and comfortable life. It may be uneventful, but she will be free of her brother.  The ink on the marriage contract is hardly dry, however, when Beth makes a shocking discovery, one that turns her world upside down and throws her whole future into doubt once more.  Almost immediately she must make a decision. Will she opt for the safe but dreary life her husband wishes her to lead, or will she fight for a life of passion, adventure and excitement, knowing that in doing so, she risks not only her own life, but the lives of those she loves?  Join the rebellion of one woman and her fight for freedom inâ€¦  THE JACOBITE CHRONICLES",
