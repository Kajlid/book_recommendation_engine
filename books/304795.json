His feelings of frustration come from his life of toil in his Grandfather's garage and being the son of an enigmatic yet legendary \"hero.\" One day, a large LFO (Light Finding Operation) craft called Nirvash falls from the sky and a beautiful young girl named Eureka emerges and asks for repairs. When a smitten Renton literally falls over himself to help her, the two begin a journey that will change both of their destinies. From one of DBD's newest publishers!",
