Olive\tI’ve loved Axel my entire life. The boy next door.We didn’t talk about the attraction building between us,until one fateful night those sparks finally burst into flames. But when he broke my heart, he left me with a souvenir.A walking, talking little reminder of the man I will always love, but can never again trust with my heart. Now he’s back, wanting to pick up where we left off. And there’s no way I’m letting him know about our baby.",
