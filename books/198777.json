  "description": "Elaine has spent her sixteen years proving that she's nothing like her murderous father--but no one will let her forget her dark family history. So when her best friend Talia goes missing, Elaine takes the search and rescue into her own hands.  But on her quest, Elaine finds herself in a wilderness where teenagers are worked to death in mines by an evil organization known as the Flamestone Society. Elaine barely escapes, but her boyfriend doesn't. Because of her, his life is now in danger right along with Talia's.  Now Elaine's alone in a vast wilderness with only her survival instincts on her side. There's no Facebook. 911 is useless. As if that's not bad enough, she failed summer camp and the Flamestone Society is closing in. Armed with only an ax, Elaine will have to embrace her dark family history in order to survive. Along the way, she'll have to face some terrifying secrets about her own past.  Alone is the first book of the Flamestone Trilogy, a dystopian fantasy for fans of The Hunger Games and survival fiction. The next two books of the series, Found and Freed, are also available.",
