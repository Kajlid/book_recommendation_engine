  "description": "All Quinn wants for Christmas is quiet. She can't afford a tree, and she doesn't have any family to celebrateâ€”except for Tara, the little sister she inherited from her mother. She especially doesn't want to have anything to do with Morgan, the guy across the hall who broke her heart. But when Quinn finds out that Tara still believes in Santa, she must put aside her feelings for Morgan long enough to make a little Christmas magic. The only problem is, he keeps finding ways to make her crazy. Can she get through the holidays without getting her heart broken?",
