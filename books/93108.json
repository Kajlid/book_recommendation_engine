  "description": "Kathryn's book talks about today's decline of the family structure, the dysfunction seen among many children today, and a society that refuses to believe. Find out how to be more aware as a parent and learn what lurks out there waiting to prey on your child. There are no fancy terms, medical jargon, or textbook answers... just plain English, and many pages of sick cop humor. The words are hers and the content is real.",
