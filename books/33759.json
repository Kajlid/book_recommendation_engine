  "description": "As Sophie gets used to her magic, her relationship with the adorable Jonathan Tait is blossoming. There's only one problem: Jonathan's twin sister, Melissa. She's a total mean girl who seems intent on making Sophie's life miserable. On top of that, Melissa somehow seems to sense that Sophie has powers--and manages to bind Sophie to her in a totally self-serving way. Can Sophie figure out a way out of this--without ruining her chances with Jonathan?",
