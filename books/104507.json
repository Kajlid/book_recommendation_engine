  "description": "A Holiday Thief?Millie Corwin had snuck into Dry Creek's café to leave gifts for the townspeople, not to rob them. But she'd been caught. And now that she was in the custody of one infuriatingly good-looking Samaritan, the entire town--including her handsome captor--had branded her a criminal.Brad Parker was minding his own business when he noticed Millie sneaking into the café. She claimed she wasn't a robber, and he wasn't sure what to believe. Because how could a thief be so lovely to look at, and--Brad soon learned--lovely on the inside, too?One thing was certain. Robber or not, this stranger seemed to be stealing his love-resistant heart. . .",
