But with her daughter determined to ruin herself and Emmeline’s own marriage crumbling to pieces, she has to decide whether or not that precious reputation is a shield or a jail.Jumping between two generations, Honor and Redemption is a story about how our mistakes can shape our world and how the bond between mother and daughter, friends and sweethearts can break when we are afraid to open our hearts.",
