  "description": "\"... he held the scissors to her face and he began to cut.‚Äù The \"drifting ghost spider\" has no scientific name. It has never been encountered before today. It is small, semi-translucent, and carries a unique non-lethal venom that causes momentary, debilitating pain. In large doses it will induce violent psychosis. As an infestation of these arachnids descends on Barton, KS, a troubled teen and his family fortify their home. But the duct-tape around the windows, the rags in the vents, and their layers of protective clothing will not help them. Many of their neighbors have already succumbed to the excruciating bites. Maniacs, gone mad from the pain, wander the streets breaking into homes and murdering whomever they find. For Paul, his parents, and his little sister Everleigh, it becomes a question of wit, survival and escape through a town cut off from any form of help. But all of the cleverness in the world might not save them either. Something far more sinister follows close behind. The handwritten manuscript for WE ARE THE SHARPEST SCISSORS was found in Joshua Ventley's possession on the day we collected him for maximum-security quarantine. Mr. Ventley calls it a \"penny dreadful\": a short, unrefined, cheap novel.
