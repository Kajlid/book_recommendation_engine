  "description": "Azzie Vokaty is living a perfectly normal life in a perfectly normal small town in the midwest, dealing with a rare blood disorder alongside rude classmates and distant foster parents.Except there is no “normal” anymore, not since the JANUS-23 pandemic decimated the world’s population.And it isn’t a town, it’s a military base.And Azzie isn’t exactly thrilled with the golden cage she’s living in.The same day that sketchy, middle-aged men in cheap suits show up at her door, new faces appear in her orbit: a set of gorgeous, identical triplets at school, and a nosy new tech at the hospital…All incredibly handsome faces. All of them seeming to pop up wherever she is.Seriously, do they think she’s stupid?",
