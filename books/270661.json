  "description": "How could I have been so arrogant?  How could I have allowed my guard to drop and for that monster to not only find her... but take her?  Every moment between now and when we find her is time he'll have to break her apart, piece by piece, and I can't let that happen. She may have started as just another girl to rescue. Another victim in need of saving.  But she isn't anymore. She's mine. She's ours.  Whatever I have to do to get back my slave, I'll do.
