  "description": "Jessica has it all. An expensive condo in the city of dreams, San Francisco. A high-powered, prestigious career as a management consultant that takes her all over the country… to passionate Roberta in Chicago, to delicious Marilyn in San Antonio… To all those cities and all those willing women Jessica has recorded in her well-used little black book.Sex with these women doesn’t really mean a thing, Jessica tells herself. It’s all just good times. Because she is not really a lesbian. No, of course not. Her sexual adventures are merely keeping her occupied until she decides to settle down with a man.Then she meets Cat, the alluring young hotel executive who lives across the hall from her new condo. What is Jessica to make of her chaotic feelings, her yearning―and yes, her deepening love―for the sensuous, captivating Cat, who offers entrancing friendship, but nothing more?",
