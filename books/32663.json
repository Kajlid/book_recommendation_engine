  "title": "Mrs Darley's Pagan Elements: A Celebration of Air, Fire, Water, Earth and Divine Spirit",
  "description": "The third in the 'Mrs Darley' series of books by Carole Carlton explores the Pagan practices of celebrating the elements of air, fire, earth and water. However, a fifth element of Divine Spirit that sanctifies life is also explored. Again, the inimitable Mrs Darley is the central and pivotal character, as she imparts her wealth of Pagan knowledge with her musings. If you have ever ventured into a raging sea, warmed your hands by a mid winter fire, planted fragile seedlings in the rich dark earth or balanced precariously on the edge of the wind, then you will understand the magical power of the elements that bless our natural world. To have an understanding of the four classical elements of air, fire, water and earth is to have an appreciation of what is essential in order to survive on our beautiful planet. To have an understanding of the mysterious fifth element of ether or Divine Spirit is to have an appreciation of the sanctity of life. This book is a celebration through poetry and prose of these sacred elements and the way in which they shape our lives. Throughout the book, the wise Mrs Darley and a selection of her intriguing friends share their knowledge and often unworldly experiences with the author as she continues to journey along her own spiritual path.",
