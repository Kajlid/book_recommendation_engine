  "description": "Erdi is a silencer. His life is one of blood, duty and shadows, and he has resigned himself to his role—until a mission leads him to Jensen Moore.Erdi’s heart and his instincts know the truth—that Jensen is his other half. But silencers don’t have mates, and Erdi knows he doesn’t have the right to even desire Jensen. He is both relieved and crushed when, after the mission, Jensen doesn’t remember him at all. Given a chance to start over, he sternly reminds himself that, no matter what, he will never deserve Jensen.But Jensen is nothing if not very determined, and very curious. His friend Parker’s abrupt departure leads him to start digging—and soon, he finds himself smack dab in the middle of the werewolf world, meeting Erdi for a second time.The attraction between them is impossible to suppress, but guilt, pain and sorrow still weigh heavily on Erdi. And the surprises aren’t over yet. Between Jensen’s sudden bouts of nausea, and an unexpected threat from the past, can the couple, and the Lone Wolf Pack, truly start over?",
