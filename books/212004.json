  "description": "Ryl, on the death of the father she barely knew, discovers that she is now the co-owner, with a grandfather she's never met, of a rundown property among the cane fields in northern New South Wales. It's the home her father grew up in - the one her grandfather hasn't seen in decades. The decision to go out there and fix it up, with her difficult grandfather tagging along, is more a matter of contrariness than anything else. Making the property profitable again is a challenge Ryl rises to, and along the way she learns about herself and her family.",
