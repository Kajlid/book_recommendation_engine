  "description": "\"I never thought I'd see him again.\"  Former assassin Fabrizio \"Faby\" Keli'i wanted something more normal and stable to do for a living, wanting a safer life for his young sons. So, when his best friend Chevy gets him an audition for a movie he was doing the music for, Faby jumped at it. He didn't know that also working on this film is Innocenty Kasprowicz, his fly-by-night ex, whom he hasn't seen in seven years. That's shocking enough. Even more so, though, is the news that Innocenty is playing his costar!  Seven years ago, Polish-American White Wolf shifter Innocenty \"Inno\" Kasprowicz thought he had it all: a great boyfriend who was hotter than the Seventh Plain of Hell, sexier than sin, two adorable twins, and a very large family. That is, until his fake mother, in all her manipulative trickery, finds him one night, and threatens to destroy Faby's life if Inno doesn't come back home with his new kid. Fearing she'll go through with it, he agrees and leaves, not telling Faby about it. Now, seven years later, Inno is an up-and-coming actor, and has just been hired for a movie over the summer.  Faby and Inno come face-to-face for the first time in years, and it's emotional and volatile from the start. Faby wants nothing to do with Inno, despite his body's reaction whenever they're together. Inno wants nothing more than to put the past behind them and start over. But when Inno gets attacked by his supposed best friend, wearing an ancient ring meant to kill Wolf shifters with one cut, Faby realizes two things: That the past is the past, which is where it belongs, and that he's still very much in love with Inno.",
