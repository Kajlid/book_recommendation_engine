  "description": "GREAT SHAPE FOR A BOOK THIS AGE-REALLY IS LIKE NEW THE COVER ON THIS BOOK SHOWS VERY MINOR EDGE WEAR. THE COLORS ARE STILL BRIGHT AND VIVID AND JUST VERY MINOR FLAWS TO THIS COVER. THE BINDING IS STILL TIGHT AND THE SPINE DOES HAVE SOME MINOR CREASES BUT NOTHING TO RUIN THE INTEGRITY OF THIS GREAT BOOK. THE OUTSIDE PAGES HAVE YELLOWED BUT THE INSIDE PAGES ARE STILL IN TERRIFIC SHAPE. EVEN WITH THESE MINOR FLAWS, THIS IS STILL A WONDERFUL PAPERBACK BOOK.",
