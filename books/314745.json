  "description": "What if someone came along and offered you a chance to take the 'road less travelled', the chance to live a dream? It began as a day no different than any other. Three men are brought together by circumstances that will forever change their lives. Each one are from a different walk of life but become connected through one particular event and little did they know that their day was about to be a whole lot different. A strange man arrives, claiming to be a wizard, talking of magic and of a different world. He offers the three \"an offer you will you find very hard to refuse.\" What they discover is a world where magic thrives Where races thought to be of folklore and one's imagination are actually real It is a world threatened by a witch bent on vengeance The three are asked to help in a quest for three stones, which, when united can provide the power to stop the approaching darkness. Fighting their own disbelief's, the witch's minions, and even those they are asked to lead, the three need to find a way to overcome them all and in doing so, perhaps prove not only to those who have asked for their help, but to themselves that they are the 'heroes' this strange world has been looking for. With a little luck, they might even show that there is a little bit of 'hero' in all of them.",
