  "description": "Von Sellers has given up on love. After losing his wife in a fatal car accident, he resigned himself to focusing on the soccer team he coaches, and thereby blocking any and all matters of the heart. Carol Longford Hutchison was looking for nothing, except picking her daughter up from soccer camp, when she visited one of Von’s practices. A single mom, her heart closed to romance when her ex-husband abandoned their family after their daughter, Rosie, was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Yet when the two commiserate over their lackluster histories, Von and Carol discover an attraction they can’t ignore. To save their battered hearts, their every impulse tells them to run from the magnetic pull drawing them together. It falls to Rosie, Carol’s precocious six-year-old, to break down their barriers with her innocently brilliant views on love and life. Can she convince Von and Carol to let go of the past and make a play for a future together? Or have their hearts already retired from life’s ultimate game? From author Angela Nicole comes, Through Rosie-Colored Glasses, a sizzling Over Forty Romance!",
