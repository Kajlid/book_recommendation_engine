  "description": "Blue DuBois wants the world to leave her alone, but the world has other plans.It's summer, 2011, and for four and a half years, all Blue has been looking for is a normal life after losing her family in a suspicious fire. But what is normal for a fourteen-year-old that can hear what no one else can? And what should she do when she hears something that presents a tantalizing opportunity to avenge her family? With an unexpected new friend and ally, she comes up with a slam-dunk plan. All she has to do is risk everything, including both of their lives.Whether you like coming-of-age or teen thrillers or mystery (and just a touch of paranormal/sci-fi), you will find an enticing blend of all these elements in this first book of a unique YA series set in down-to-earth rural Vermont. With just a touch of maybe-this-could-be-real scientific conjecture as an intriguing element, this is a story more about friendships and those magical bonds created by shared terrifying experiences during a formative time of life.",
