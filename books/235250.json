  "description": "Addison Kent is the sexiest little thing to ever walk into my office. Those pouty red lips beg to leave lipstick stains on my tattooed skin, and those emerald eyes make me come undone with just one smouldering glance.  But I’m a cop, first and foremost. The NYPD Chief of Police, to be exact. And because of that, I know there’s something she’s not telling me. Something she’s afraid of.  I also know there’s something about her I desire. Something I want. Something I need.  And it begins with feeling her, tasting her…and possessing her.  And I will, even if it goes against all the rules.  I’m an enforcer of the rules, and for her, I’d break every damn one of them.  **The Law Of The Beast is a steamy, standalone romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.**",
