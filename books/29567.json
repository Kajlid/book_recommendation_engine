  "description": "Sleeping with her flatmate, Sam, had been a mistake–becoming a strip club manager’s pimp was a disaster.Meg’s mother can't even say the word sex. Her great aunt is a nymphomaniac. The few men she’s slept with left her frustrated. The closest she’s come to sex was as the unwitting visual aid for hot flatmate, Sam’s cowboy style wanking session. No wonder her libido went on permanent vacation and she substitutes ice-cream and chocolate for sex. With so many hang ups, why does she agree to no strings sex with Sam? Why is hunky, strip club manager Michael bent on seducing her? And why the hell does she invest in a male escort business offering extra services? Sam’s delighted when he convinces Meg to let him go looking for her missing G-spot. A ride on his wild stallion shows her how good sex can be...with the right man. One encounter leads to a dozen. Sam is living every man’s dream, sex with no commitment, too bad it’s not his dream.His new life turns into a nightmare when Michael enters the scene. Will the Irishman steal her away, or will his involvement in her Male Order business lead to a disaster that gives Sam a chance to prove to Meg their relationship is more than a sexual rodeo?",
