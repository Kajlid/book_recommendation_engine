Being an assassin for hire helps, but in no way prepares her for the trials ahead. In her race to uncover the mysteries unraveling before her, she’s forced to face the fact that the few people she’s ever opened up to have been lying to her all her life… about her life. A life she discovers is surrounded by a supernatural world she’d never even considered believing in.Kay I’ve never been accused of being a nice person. In truth I have an uncanny ability to inspire record breaking levels of loathing. Lucky for me, it never bothered me being universally hated by the same sheep who wanted to follow me.  My life was pretty much exactly the way I wanted it; one in a long line of doting boyfriends, a killer job that I love, a beautiful and legendary bike that I love more… even Cady – the insistent friend – who just wouldn’t take no for an answer and wound up growing on me, like a fungus. Of course, I should have known that it couldn’t last. In one day the boyfriend-of-the-month bolted, Cady got snatched, the devastatingly gorgeous and thoroughly irritating EX – Donovan – got dumped back into my life; not to mention my parents… basically everything came crashing down around me. The process of picking up the pieces turns out to be much more complicated than I could ever imagine.Follow me is a steamy new paranormal / fantasy romance geared towards mature readers.",
