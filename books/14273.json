  "description": "High school is hard enough when you do fit in, but if you don't look a certain way or have the right friends, you'd better hope you grow a thick skin to defend yourself from the ones that do. Arianna Weller and Evan Drake are worlds apart, moving in different circles until they are forced together for a science fair project. Putting aside their differences from the past is not easy for either of them, but can they do it long enough to realize that they're not that different after all?",
