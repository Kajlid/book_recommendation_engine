  "title": "The Wormhole Effect",
  "description": "A team of physicists, including the beautiful Anna Markham, perfect a revolutionary technology for the U.S. Navy designed to track submarines when they stumble upon a tool for locating hidden holes in space-time. Teaming up with an unruly group of Navy SEALs, they track a large one to the mid-Atlantic and come face-to-face with a violent rift in the fabric of the universe. Daniel Ross, an Army Air Corps pilot trying desperately to abandon his stricken aircraft over the Dutch countryside during WWII, plummets down the throat of a rogue wormhole and hurls 70 years into the future before splashing into the sea. When he is rescued by Anna and her team, the two feel a powerful bond between them and lose their hearts to one another. However, nameless men in black suits intervene, and Daniel disappears. Any trace of his existence is gone, except for the burning passion in Anna's heart. Undaunted, Anna and the outlaw SEALs attempt the impossible and infiltrate the most top-secret base in the world to rescue him. What Daniel and Anna discover in the desolate Nevada desert will reveal secrets long-hidden, foreshadow our common fate, and fold history back on itself.",
