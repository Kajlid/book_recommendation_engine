  "description": "Perry is back for her sophomore year, anxious to bask in the freedom and independence that college brings. All summer she anticipated being reunited with her friends who have been a huge support system in her life. But this might be her last year. Perry's tyrant parents threaten to remove her from school if she does not excel. She has to achieve high grades to be accepted into the highly competitive junior year Life Science classes to stay at school. She can't imagine leaving this school or her friends - so failing is not an option. Besides trying to earn incredible grades, Perry has another problem that arises. Her friendliness has encouraged more than one of the guys in her inner circle to pursue her. Perry is a novice in this area and is doing the best to try and save the friendships that jealousy threatens to destroy. Would she lose them all with her poor decisions or find the love of her life?",
