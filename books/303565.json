  "description": "The small Scottish town of Auchenmullan is dead, and has been for years. It sits in the shadow of a mountain, forgotten and atrophying in the perpetual gloom.Forty-seven residents are all that remain.There's nothing to do there, nothing to see, except for a solitary grave near the top of the mountain. MAGGIE WALL BURIED HERE AS A WITCH reads the faded inscription.But sometimes the dead don't stay buried. Especially when they have unfinished business.A relentless folk-horror nightmare from the author of The Forgotten Island, Maggie's Grave will disturb and shock in equal measure.",
