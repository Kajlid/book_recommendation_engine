  "description": "Fitzwilliam Darcy is a man with a great many secrets to keep, one involves his sister, and the other involves his heart. The problem is, he cannot just keep the secrets. They demand attention, and action, and in hopeless times, a good man does not always think things through, even when he is desperately trying to do the right thing for the two most important women in his life. In Jane Austenâ€™s Pride and Prejudice, Fitzwilliam Darcy arrived in Ramsgate before his sister could leave with George Wickham. Things are not so easily remedied in this two-volume variation. This story contains scenes of a mature nature between a happily married couple.",
