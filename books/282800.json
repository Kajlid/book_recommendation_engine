  "description": "Two lonely souls with countless secrets — what’s the harm in one more?Zoey McCarren goes by many labels: keyboard player, fashion industry darling — but she is not a lesbian. As the only not-queer woman in the infamously queer band, The Shrikes, she spends an exhausting amount of time resisting that title. In fact, she’s spent so much time being the not-lesbian that it would be a cliche if she ever did find herself attracted to a woman. Luckily, she’s too busy focusing on her career to date at all.Pia Marino has everything she’s ever wanted. Almost. She’s the host of a popular daytime talk show, she’s a household name, and people respect her. She’s achieved such wild levels of success by her mid-40s that others only dream about. But most people don’t realize that the smiles and comedy conceal that tragedy has underscored her life in the ten years since her wife’s death.When Pia and Zoey find themselves alone together at midnight at a New Year’s Eve party, neither one expects anything more than a simple kiss to distract themselves from the loneliness they feel. And after, when they find that one kiss wasn’t enough...But they soon realize that secrets and lies do nothing to dull the ache of hiding their true selves, and who they bring out in one another.",
