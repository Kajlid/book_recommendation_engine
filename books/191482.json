  "description": "Tom Riddle's Schooldays is a book series; the prequel to the Harry Potter stories.❝ Tom found the Leaky Cauldron easily enough from Dumbledoreʼs directions. There was a small doorway, set slightly back from the level of the shops on each side of it, which the people in the street were all passing by, and perhaps not only because they had their heads down on account of the rain. It seemed to belong entirely to another world. Tom pushed at the door, which opened with a slight creak. ❞~ from Chapter OneWhen Tom is given the chance to escape from the humdrum life at Wool's Orphanage in London, he's very glad to finally be amongst people at least a little bit like him. Even in the magical world though, Tom finds he is still something of an outsider.",
