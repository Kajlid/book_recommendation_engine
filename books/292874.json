  "description": "I grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, an area that even the cops avoided. The only light in my dark, was the boy next door. He was my hero. And I was his Sunshine, at least that is what he called me.  Liam Kane wasn't just my neighbor, he was my first and only crush. He looked after me when I couldn't look after myself. When he disappeared my life returned to an endless grey.   Now after all these years we're face to face. But we're standing on opposite sides of the law.     He's a part of the Heretics MC and I'm a deputy.  I’m all grown up and more than capable of handling myself. But I dream about Liam’s capable hands. Everything has changed... except my feelings for him.",
