Desperate to get her life back on track, Lilly sets out on a new path towards fulfillment. Convinced that she can build a life without Clive, she makes decisions that will have far reaching consequences.  He wants her to understand his motivations. She wants him to accept their reality.  When things finally make sense to them both, the past appears and everything they've worked so hard to attain is stolen away in an instant.  Note: This ends in a cliffhanger. Part Three will be released very soon.",
