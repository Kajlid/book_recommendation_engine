  "description": "Lionel is sick of his brother picking on him and of his mother yelling at him. One day, while cleaning the closet his mother has been after him about, he discovers not only boxes and old clothes, but a lucky charm with more magic than he bargained for. After an unusual encounter with his brother, Lionel knows things are about to change for the better. Together, Lionel and his lucky charm are able to stand up to his big brother as well as make Carrie—the cutest girl in his class—notice him. While learning the quirks of his magical charm, Lionel ends up at a casino in Las Vegas, escapes an evil dog, becoming a hero to the other kids, and finds himself playing in the Great Series with his favorite professional baseball team. Will Lionel master the trickster, over-the-top magic, or will it mess things up beyond repair?",
