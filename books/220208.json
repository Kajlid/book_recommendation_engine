  "description": "I thought I put my past behind me.  I lost everything when I testified against my fiancé for the murders of three women. After the jury delivered a life sentence, I ran. I hoped if I could disappear, maybe the horror he caused would, too.  When I return to Florida for the first time after his conviction, I’m determined to face my fears and get my life back. Then, a woman is murdered and I’m the only one who believes her death features the same signature as those I’m trying so hard to forget.  Instinct tells me to run again, but local cop Logan Blackwell has never let a suspect–or a woman–get away. He’s made it his own personal mission to solve the case and he needs my help to do it.  I have no choice once we learn I’m the next target, but I’m not interested in getting close to another man, especially not a sexy former Marine who has secrets of his own.  This is a FULL-LENGTH, STANDALONE, with NO CLIFFHANGER.",
