  "title": "Black: The Human Soul",
  "description": "Lost in a mysterious darkness, a man seeks answers. In the end, he will discover that the blackest darkness resides in the human soul...Of all the journeys conjured by the writer, of all the lonesome paths walked by heroes and villains alike, the journey into the human soul is by far the darkest. No imagination of men could ever match the true depravity of the human soul. No external tale of gloom and horror, however well-constructed, could possibly match the darkness of the blackest corners of the human heart. However well groomed a manâ€™s exterior, however authentic and winsome is his smile, the soul of even the best human being is the dark truth that lies behind a paper-thin veneer.This is a tale of two people, caught in a post-apocalyptic horror of perpetual night. A blackness that matches the darkness of the human soul. Based on Lord Byron's \"Darkness.\"",
