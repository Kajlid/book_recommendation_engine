  "description": "The year is 1911.Mill-worker Jenny Clegg has grown up in a world where women are second-class citizens to the men they look after. She works all day to provide for her family, but can only look on helplessly as all of her mother’s savings and possessions are wasted by her cruel father.Her life seems to be heading the same way – even the man she admires from afar believes women only belong in the home, leading her to question if she could ever love someone so against her own sex. However, a chance encounter with one Mary O’Neil, the young daughter of an aristocrat, changes Jenny’s life for good, and opens up her world to radical political activism. Soon she realises that she holds the potential power to make a real difference...Set across multiple landscapes and featuring women of all classes, Constance Maud’s No Surrender is a powerful and hugely enjoyable narrative based on some of the true, harrowing events surrounding the fight of the Suffragettes.From accounts of marches and protests to troubling descriptions of force-feeding in prisons, Constance Maud’s narrative captures the spirit of the Suffrage movement, and offers an exciting glimpse into the thoughts and determination of the women of the day.Constance Maud (1857-1929) was the eldest daughter of a rector from Surrey and was educated in France. She wrote numerous children’s books as well as five autobiographical novels. No Surrender was published in November 1911, it is a faithful depiction of the fight for votes for women, which Maud was actively involved in.",
