  "description": "Frederick Douglass was an American abolitionist, editor, orator, author, statesman and reformer. Called \"The Sage of Anacostia\" and \"The Lion of Anacostia,\" Douglass was one of the most prominent figures in African American history, and one of the most influential lecturers and authors in American history. His towering posture showed dignity and strength, and when he spoke, his baritone voice was powerful. These features together gave Douglass a strong presence. He was a firm believer in the equality of all people, whether black, female, American Indian, or recent immigrant. Douglass devoted his life to advocating the brotherhood of all humankind. He was fond of saying, \"I would unite with anybody to do right and with nobody to do wrong.\" \"Those who profess to favor freedom and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground, they want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the roar of its many waters.\"",
