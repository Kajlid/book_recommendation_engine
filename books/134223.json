  "description": "When my older brother let me move in with him I made one huge mistake—telling him he’s not the boss of me. He may be twelve years older than me, but I’m an adult now, too.Although as it turns out… not a very good one.But no matter how badly I screw up, Knox doesn’t say anything. He never corrects me. Never gets mad. And certainly never spanks me, so I’m not sure why his horrible ex-wife even suggested something crazy like that.Until Knox explains.When they were together, things ran a lot differently than they do now that I’ve moved in. He was the head of the household, and she followed his rules or else submitted to the consequences.But who would be jealous of that? Not this boy… said the lying-est lying McLiar ever to lie.(Me. I’m the liar.)But then it turns out maybe he didn’t love her more than me after all. Maybe I don’t even have to be jealous. Because once Knox stops listening to what I say and starts paying attention to what I really need, he’s not just happy to give it it to me.He insists on it.",
