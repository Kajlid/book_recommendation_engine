  "title": "An African Student in China",
  "description": "As a former African student in China, Emmanuel John Hevi has on-the-scene knowledge of the social and educational structure of the New China, and the motives and methods of Mao's regimeâ€”with specific reference to Africa. Influenced by what he had been told in Ghana, Hevi eagerly looked forward to working and living in the land of \"the Great Leap Forward.\" His fascinating impressions of the New China were written on the basis of extensive journeys in the country and on his experiences and those of his fellow African students.Written for Hevi's fellow Africans, AN AFRICAN STUDENT IN CHINA is nevertheless of equal importance to students everywhere, not only as a story of China but of international communism.",
