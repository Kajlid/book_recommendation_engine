Yet something about the green-eyed vision he meets on the plane to New York calls to him, in more ways than one. He will have her beneath him—or on top of him—tonight.Career-driven graphic artist Samantha Raven has many talents, her psychic abilities among them. But nothing could’ve prepared her for the talents of a sexy rock god who seduces her into his bed—or the obsessed fan who threatens her life. Her sizzling night of passion with the infamous Jerico front man is purely chance…or is it? Betrayal and danger follow their wild ride of orgasmic exploration. Seems fate had a plan neither Jesse nor Sam saw coming.",
