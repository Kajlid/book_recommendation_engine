  "description": "Libby has hit a bad patch in life, and just when she thinks things can't get any worse she's killed in a car accident alongside her dog Rufus. During their transition to the afterlife's Sunray Bay, Rufus somehow manages to absorb her soul - which, in turn, gives him human-like qualities and renders her soulless. Accompanied by her now talking dog, Libby tries to unravel the mystery of her slippery soul, encountering many setbacks and dilemmas along the way. She has no idea why a group of monster slayers, headed by an ex-convict, are hunting her down, and when she teams up with rogue Peace & Order Maintenance Officer, Grim, she's shocked to discover that there's a mob of disgruntled vampires and a very angry mayor hot on their heels too. Libby has never felt so unpopular, and begins to wonder whether it's possible to die twice in one day...",
