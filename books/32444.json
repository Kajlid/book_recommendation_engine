  "description": "Nearly every ancient religion of the world has a flood story. This adventure will take you on a journey filled with history, excitement, and mysticism. When Atlantis’ ruling Lord becomes suddenly ill, Aedon may be the only one who can obtain the cure from a magical garden – a place no one has a map to, and most don’t believe exist. Along the way Aedon will face mermaids, unicorns, pythons, and others who will fight to the death to obtain this prize.This story is the first in the Atlantis Series by David Speight. Look for the story to continue in \"Atlantis: Fall of the Gods\" and its conclusion in \"Atlantis: Rise of the Nile.\"",
