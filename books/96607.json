  "title": "Othrinia's Rain",
  "description": "If truth gave a freedom that could destroy all you've ever known, would it be better to live shackled to a lie? When the kingdom of Othrinia was split down the middle at the hands of feuding twin kings, leaving Othrinians scattered and the new land of Veodue secluded in desolation, these two lands, worlds apart, became the epitome of light and darkness.Raenah Brookshire is not a typical Othrinian young woman. She yearns for adventure and chases danger with a passionate drive that is unmatched by the people of her village, Farreloch. It would seem as though her life is rich with possibilities, but she has no idea just how far theyâ€™ll take her.A mystery of her birth is uncovered by sheer chance that leaves her reeling in shock and betrayal. The key to who she is lies in the hands of a dark Veoden stranger who begins to plague her dreams. He has the answers to her undying questions, but refuses to offer them without a price.Caught between the life she knows and a passion more rich than the darkness before the dawn, Raenah must decide her own fate.**Paperback coming in October.",
