  "description": "We are thrilled with the quality and variety of prose and poetry for our first annual Nature's Gifts anthology. More than twenty pieces, from haiku to villanelles, from essays to short stories, will delight nature lovers everywhere. Take a walk in a garden or hike in a national park. Reflect on the moon. Learn something new. Laugh and cry with our writers as they discover the beauty, the joys, and the raw power of nature. The Nature Conservancy will receive a donation of 50 percent of the profits for every book sold in both print and e-book editions for one year. Dedicated to protecting our rapidly vanishing natural environment, The Nature Conservancy has protected more than 117 million acres of land in 28 countries. The selected poets and authors are: Kathi Anderson Douglas G. Campbell Malcolm R. Campbell Betsy Collum Chelle Cordero Helen Fanick JCGlaze Kelley Harrell Robert Hays Donna Hennes Lisa Houff Victoria Howard Leah Mooney Thom Newnham Deanne Quarrie Connie Spittler Smoky Trudeau Kimberlee Williams Scott Zeidel",
