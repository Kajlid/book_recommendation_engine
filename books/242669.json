  "title": "All the dirty things I would do to you",
  "description": "Perhaps the most important Lesbian pulp novel. Banned for years as it became a popular gateway for young women who lived in rural areas without a thriving urban bar scene, and who had no other way of exploring their sexuality. Republished for you from a single copy, an Amazon exclusive. Many of the tropes in LGBT erotica and romance novels can be dated back to this work. The author is still unknown, but many have speculated, based on her writing style, to have been one of the most popular fiction authors of the day.",
