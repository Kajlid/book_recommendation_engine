  "description": "Mineral levels in meat and milk plummet over 60 years and \"We Want Real Food\" explains why and how it can be reversed. We are all being encouraged to eat more fresh fruit and vegetables and many of us regularly spend more on organic produce in the belief that is better for our health and taste buds. However Graham Harvey illustrates how our increasingly industrial farming techniques are denuding our soil of the essential nutrients, minerals and structures needed to produce quality produce. Everyday fruits and vegetables have significantly lower nutrient contents from those grown 30 years ago, and are set to diminish further unless action is taken now. Harvey argues that many of the illnesses that plague modern society from obesity, tooth decay, arthritis and cancer to social disorder caused by increasing numbers with Attention Deficit Disorder have their roots in our diet that is low in the essential nutrients and minerals that our bodies have evolved to need. Far from the solution being too complex Harvey shows how the integration of small amounts of ground rock can re-mineralize the soil.This process mimics the action of the glaciers that provided us with the fertile soils we have been exploiting since the end of the last ice age. With the re-introduction of these essential minerals soil fertility is drastically improved producing bumper crops with a substantially improved flavour. This is an important book that is the next stage in the debate about the food we eat and how a simple solution can improve the nation's health and environment.",
