  "title": "Ever After: a medley of tales in rhyme and prose",
  "description": "Ever After is a medley of daydreams and nightmares, laughter and tears, memories and fantasies all woven into the labyrinth of my quirky imagination. Just like in life, the ever afters in this book don't always lead to a happy ending but if you dare travel the labyrinth you will find rose colored days and a piece of fairy tale heaven mixed in with the joys and sorrows of strong characters who meet adversity with pluck and optimism. Indomitable spirit is one of the tenets learned in Taekwando. It means that you never give up, are never defeated, and are always willing to pick yourself up, brush yourself off and try one more time. Although none of the them are martial artists, from a mouse on an iceberg to a man on a gallows, I have tried to infuse each of the characters of Ever After with an indomitable spirit. At every turn you'll find something unexpected from the larceny of squirrels to a new beginning for a dying kitten. Come and hitch your wagon to a star. Although the twists and turns may sometimes lead to nowhere, you'll ride with those who speed headlong into life, whatever it holds for them. ASIN: B00LWGBDD4",
