  "description": "He has no memory whatsoever. All he knows now is that he somehow survived a plane crash this morning and managed to reach the safety of an unknown island. At first he believed he may have found refuge on an island in the South Pacific, but that unknown ringed planet on the horizon suggests he isn’t on Earth at all. And to make it worse, the island’s sole resident recognizes him and insists he crashed his aircraft in the ocean and washed up on her beach before… multiple times. Only this time, she’s not putting up with his nonsense and she’s got quite a story to tell him if he’s willing to listen. Maybe he can discover what's causing an unusual loop in time that only she recalls. Maybe he can discover a way to escape from this confusing island and perhaps rescue her in the process.

The technology and scenarios are realistic enough for this sci fi fan and if you like a good storyteller Mr. McElhaney knows how to do it.\" ~Top 50 Amazon Reviewer and Vine Voice Michael Gallagher",
