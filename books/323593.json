When I screw up my chances of being matched with a pack, I’m sent to the Omega Auctions. There I’m sold to a royal pack to be their maid.I’m hardly qualified to clean and I’m not sure being stuck with an unmated pack is the best idea because my first heat is coming and these guys are H.O.T. HOT.My name is Reagan and I’m a bad omega who refuses to fall in love. Let’s just hope my heart gets the memo because that’s knot the life for me.",
