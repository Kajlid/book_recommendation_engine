  "description": "I'm Lindsay, and I'm a teenage visionary with a few big problems. My mother is way overprotective. My best friend is an airhead. My boyfriend joined the Army. And I can see murders before they happen.  At the age of eight, I realized that I'm a visionary - that I'm \"sighted,\" as my mom calls it. She tells me I need to learn how to manage my ability. She insists that it's a gift. That's so not true. I think she's just trying to make me feel better about it. I mean, I already have enough to contend with. Like surviving the continuing drama that is my best friend Sara, and finding the time to be with my boyfriend Scott, all while trying to get myself graduated from my small-town high school so I can go to college and have even more to contend with. My visions of grisly deaths - past, present, and future - kind of complicate things, especially since I'm still learning how to handle them. Every now and then, I see them wrong. So while Mom calls it my \"gift,\" I disagree. If this is a gift, then I'd like to give it back.",
