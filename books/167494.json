  "description": "To coin a phrase, large oaks from little acorns grow.So when this newest of P. G. Wodehousean romps begins with a small case of shoplifting such as any reasonable person might understand, it comes as no surprise that this turns out to be merely the first step toward the involvement of almost everyone in the book (including the hero) in trying to steal a priceless Gainsborough miniature, “The Girl in Blue.”For good reasons.And bad.If you are a Wodehouse fan, and either you are or you are a poor deprived spirit who ought to have someone lobbying in Congress to help you, that is all you’ll know or need to know before snatching up this copy, paying for it (rather than shoplifting it), and rushing home with it to enjoy the most delightful reading of the season.",
