  "description": "Andrew Barton \"Banjo\" Paterson (1864-1941) was a famous Australian bush poet, journalist and author. He wrote many ballads and poems about Australian life, focusing particularly on the rural and outback areas, including the district around Binalong, New South Wales where he spent much of his childhood. Paterson's more notable poems include Waltzing Matilda (1895), The Man from Snowy River (1890) and Clancy of the Overflow (1889). In 1885, Paterson began submitting and having his poetry published in the Sydney edition of The Bulletin under the pseudonym of \"The Banjo,\" the name of a favourite horse. Paterson, like The Bulletin, was an ardent nationalist, and in 1889 published a pamphlet, Australia for the Australians. In 1890, he wrote The Man from Snowy River, a poem which caught the heart of the nation, and in 1895 had a collection of his works published under that name. Paterson authored two novels; An Outback Marriage (1906) and The Shearer's Colt (1936), wrote many short stories; Three Elephant Power and Other Stories (1917), and wrote a book based on his experiences as a war reporter; Happy Dispatches (1934).",
