  "title": "A Covenant of Justice",
  "description": "A genetically altered vampiric race known as the Phaestor threaten to overrun the galaxy, but the opposition--an outnumbered band of malcontents--fights savagely to preserve their freedom. The galaxy is dominated by the Regency, a government of vampires and dragons and other mutated humans. Finn Markham, a mercenary tracker, and his brother, Sawyer, have been hired by the sinister Lady Zillabar and then betrayed by her. Infected with a horrific vampiric blood disease, Finn is near death. Sawyer and his colleagues of the Alliance for Life must capture Lady Zillabar and defeat the Dragon Lord. After accomplishing that sure-to-be-impossible task, they can use the enigmatic powers of the Time-binders to pull down the Regency and replace it with a more equitable covenant of justice. Gerrold is able to infuse his electrifying adventures with humor (the dangerously ravenous pfingle eggs come to mind) while keeping the action cascading past the reader at the speed of light. Saving the universe has never been more enjoyable. --Dennis Winters",
