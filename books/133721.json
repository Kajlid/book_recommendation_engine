  "description": "Zoe Dunham's annoying ex-husband was making her desperate for a vacation. Little did she expect to spend it aboard a privateer's ship engaged in the War of 1812! But that was exactly where she found herself, thrown at the feet of Captain Black Jack Alexander, otherwise known as Winn.From his velvet eye-patch to his white silk shirt, Winn was the image of a swashbuckling hero. And the sinfully handsome body beneath those sexy clothes was enough to make even a nun take notice. From the moment she met him, Zoe was hooked.\nBut how could a beleaguered divorced mother from the twentieth century possibly dare to find love with a nineteenth-century pirate?",
