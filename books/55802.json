  "title": "Loathing on the Left: The Liberal Compulsion to Hate Conservatives",
  "description": "A prominent legal affairs expert whose examination of the Clinton impeachment earned her widespread recognition and praise, Ann Coulter now takes on an even tougher issue. At a time when relations between the two parties should be overwhelmingly congenial, she argues, American political debate has become increasingly hostile, overly personal, and insufferably trivial.With a sharp mind and incisive reasoning, she looks at the events and personalities that have shaped modern political discourse; shows the cult-like behavior of the political left; and offers solutions to the bickering, backstabbing, and name-calling that have made cultural mountains out of partisan molehills.Refreshingly honest, and unerringly timely, Loathing on the Left is certain to stoke the lively debates taking place in courtrooms and in the media, on campuses, and at cocktail parties across the country.",
