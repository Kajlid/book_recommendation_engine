  "description": "In the year 2275, Planet Earth is still reeling from the devastating effects of Global Warming. Tsunamis have decimated coastal areas worldwide; droughts have turned entire continents into vast, uninhabited wastelands. Domes have been erected above most large cities in the United States in order to protect the population from the polluted atmosphere, but life beneath the Dome has become increasingly difficult for sixteen-year-old triplets Daisy, Rose and Violet Budd. They are viewed as \"Wasters\" by their peers because their parents, Sunellen and Prentiss Budd, have violated the one-child-only law that has become stricter over time. Rumors that Earth is slowly recovering beyond the confines of the Dome is causing dissension in the family; should they leave the relative security of the Dome to become Pioneers? Readers will find out in the breathtaking conclusion of this timely and important a \"must read\" for anyone concerned about the future of Planet Earth.",
