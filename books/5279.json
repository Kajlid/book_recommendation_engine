  "description": "Nineteenth-century Europe abounds with conspiracy both ghastly and mysterious. Jesuits plot against Freemasons. Italian priests are strangled with their own intestines. French criminals plan bombing by day and celebrate black masses by night. Every night has its own secret service, perpetrating forgeries, plots, and massacres. But what if, behind all of those conspiracies, lies just one man?",
