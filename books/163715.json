  "description": "The Reconstruction phase is slow going at best throughout most of the country. Evie and those she surrounds herself with have managed to not only survive, but to find the silver lining in the remnants of a broken down and shattered financial system. Turning crap into gold has become a visionary gift and although Evie is the driving force in their success, they all grow to be the foundation of the whole. The bonding and sisterhood that forms is unmatched and unbreakable.There’s something to be said of those who come from a similar background˗˗ memories and scars that give courage and strength. It’s exactly what these young women have in common and never allows them to be detoured, no matter how hard life kicks them to the floor. Wisdom is acquired over time and has its own purpose. Tenacity, however, is earned through battle, bringing one to a place above wisdom˗˗empowerment.Two years ago, Evie’s husband abandoned her in a war zone amidst the hunters that roamed the streets of Phoenix. Today, her tribe thrives and adopts her passion to rescue others who are still left behind. Life is different now and so is the work that pulled them far away from what was destined to be their graves. Remembering their struggle, but not getting caught up in it; is both the strength and hilarity in this modern life of the Skin Traders.Evie’s Tribe continues where Skin Trader left off. Maynard, Tracey, Taylor, Evan and some quacking friends all return, as well as some vibrant new recruits who will leave you in stitches. Although both books can be read as stand-alone novels, some introductory information will be lost by skipping past Skin Trader. Erotic, steamy, satirical and witty situations; all line the pages again, as relationships form, fall away and sometimes re-form again.",
