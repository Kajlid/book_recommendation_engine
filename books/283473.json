  "description": "‘A hot, sweet romance that will have you reaching for the sloe gin’  One very attractive woman. Two ridiculously handsome men. And erotic Greek statues.  Starting out alone at Nottingham University, Sophie Ashworth finds herself sharing a house with soulful, grieving Jasper and charming, irresistible Alex, who is determined to have Sophie all to himself. After all, he’s Alex Van-Zeller and he always gets the girl, right? But he hasn’t counted on the slow-burning affection growing between Sophie and Jasper, and Jasper’s own quiet self-belief.  Then the bloke that you are up against becomes your best mate, and neither is prepared to back down. The two men leave Sophie to make an impossible choice, which goes horribly wrong. It takes a lot of gin, love, and friendship before the solution is discovered. Oh, and a trip to Skegness.  The first of a trilogy charting the lives of Sophie, Alex, Jasper, and friends as they navigate young adulthood, hearing aid batteries, and each other’s bodies.   This is a slow burn MFM over a three-book series",
