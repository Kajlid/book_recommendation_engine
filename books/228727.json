  "description": "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.Bullshit.Words destroyed me. “I’m sorry. She didn’t make it.”“Daddy, he can’t breathe!” “There’s nothing more we can do for your son.”Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will never harm me.Lies.Those syllables and letters became my executioner. I told myself that, if I didn’t acknowledge the pain and the fear, they would have no power over me. But, as the years passed, the hate and the anger left behind began to control me.Two words—that was all it took to plunge my life into darkness.“He’s gone.” In the end, it was four soft, silky words that gave me hope of another sunrise. “Hi. I’m Charlotte Mills.”",
