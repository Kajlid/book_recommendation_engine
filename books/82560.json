  "description": "Set in 1993, Nobody Special: The Death of Johnny Salinger chronicles the last night of the iconic poet as he struggles to end his haunted past or salvage himself from the crash and burn of living in a state of desolation and terminal sadness for too long. Psychologically trapped in his room and hiding from the chaos of a massive New Years Eve party where over-zealous hangers-on have turned his home into a hostel for degenerates, Salinger challenges Fate to decide the outcome of his contemplated suicide as he pens a poignant epitaph for a generation that celebrated the belief that it was the last, and laments the 1980's SoCal Punk scene and lifestyle. Through sincere prose, he exhumes the deep and lyrical themes of the Punk and Beat Poet subcultures to create a poetic tribute to the tragic end of a doomed era and the death of an elusive American Dream. It's an anti-hero's emotional descent into a white-hot madness to convince the audience in his mind that everything is special, everything matters, and that \"Sometimes, life's greatest mystery is ourselves.\"",
