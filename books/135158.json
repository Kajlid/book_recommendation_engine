  "description": "Elena’s dad is injured and trapped with his horse, Gato, in the Andes mountains. Above them, the condors are circling, ready to strike as soon as they consider their prey weak enough. The man and horse need help, quickly.Elena is the only one who can get to them on time, but she doesn’t want to believe that they’re in danger. She’s afraid to go into the mountains alone – and she certainly doesn’t trust the strange girl who says she’ll help, the girl who rides the wild mare that no one has ever been able to tame.",
