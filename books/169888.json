  "description": "In the autobiographical Each Wind That Blows, author and horsewoman Susannah West Cord returns to Kenya after a thirty-year absence. A horseback safari across the famed game reserve Maasai Mara draws her back to the land that gave birth to her most cherished childhood memories, where Susannah soon finds there is much more in store for her than just an exciting holiday. An adventure of mind, body, and spirit, Each Wind That Blows gallops across the savannah in the company of lions, leopards, and elephants, a journey underlined by the joys and sorrows inherently found in the African wilderness. Finding her inner struggles reflected in the life of the savannah, Susannah seeks to come to terms with the eviscerating grief and regret following the loss of a loved one and the struggle to discover and define a sense of purpose. The echoes of childhood still heard by the adult and the yearning for a connection to the greater mystery that underlies all life will hold the key to her future.",
