  "description": "GWEN I knew that I would have to see his face, but I never knew it would be in person. Seeing him in person, after all this time, could break me even more. I always had the protection of the TV screen between us, and he never knew I was watching. It's been four years. He shattered me when he left to chase his dream. He proved to me that I was nothing to him. So why now? Why is he trying to contact me? DEAN We are in danger--no, she is in danger. I need to get to her. To protect her, even if she hates me. Seeing her face again will be easy because leaving her was the hardest thing I have ever done. I had to leave. I thought I was doing the right thing even though it killed me. After all this time, I still want her. I never stopped, but that doesn't matter now. The only thing that matters is her safety. I hope I'm not too late....",
