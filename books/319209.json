  "description": "OliverTo catch a thief... you have to think like a thief. And Rian Beaumont was my mark. I’d start by stealing her kisses. But I already knew that wouldn’t be punishment enough. The only crime I committed was almost stealing her from my brother, and for that, I served my time. She thought she knew me, but she had it all wrong— I was nothing like my brother. To prove her wrong, I was going to steal her heart and make her mine. RianOliver Wexler might not have been the one that ruined my life five years ago, but he basically drove the getaway car. The only thing more dangerous than kissing the enemy... sleeping with the enemy. Good thing I had no intentions of doing either. But Ollie had a pesky habit of sticking his nose— and his lips--where they didn’t belong. Even though I’ve already learned my lessons about falling for a man like him. Because with a Wexler brother, it was never only your future on the line . . . but your heart too.",
