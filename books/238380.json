  "description": "They say that behind every great man is a great woman…but what if that woman is a Werewolf?\n\n\n\n\nThe readers love Terry Henry Walton:\n\n“So much action in this book and yet the characters are distinct and thoroughly formed. Your heart beats with each of them.”“This series just keeps getting better. Awesome Craig has done it again and then some. Speechless.... I love the characters and how the story seems to flow.”“It was long .... but Craig Martelle filled in a lot of stuff we, as readers, really appreciate. I loved it!”“…wow I don't care how long a book is when it is good it is not long enough…”\n\n\nCivilization has returned to humanity and brought with it the vices of the civilized.\n\n\nThe fight for the end begins as petty power seeks to fill vacuums. From China to Chicago to New York City, Terry and Char are fighting for their lives. \n\n\n\nThe FDG, Vampires, Weres, Michael, and Valerie all collide in this epic climax to the Terry Henry Walton Chronicles.\n\n\nWhen the finish line isn’t the finish at all, but the start of something new. \nIt’s a whole new battle, one for the FUTURE of mankind. \n\n\nTerry’s just not sure where it will be fought.",
