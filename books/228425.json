  "description": "“Donald Wolfe has written one of the most absorbing accounts of Marilyn’s life to date.”—Fred Lawrence Guiles, author of Norma Jean “Admirable!...Wolfe takes us very close indeed to the dark truth about Monroe, the Kennedys, and that lonely death in the California night.”—Anthony Summers, author of The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe Fifty years after her death, the Marilyn Monroe mystique remains as strong and alluring as ever—as evidenced by Michelle Williams’ Golden Globe-winning performance in the critically acclaimed film, My Week with Marilyn , and NBC TV’s drama Smash about the creation of a Marilyn-themed Broadway musical. In The Last Days of Marilyn Monroe , author Donald H. Wolfe, a former Hollywood screenwriter and film editor, examines the tragic starlet’s final weeks and offers startling evidence to support his provocative claim that Marilyn’s alleged suicide was, in fact, a homicide. A powerful and intimate look into the dark side of Hollywood and John F. Kennedy’s Camelot, The Last Days of Marilyn Monroe is a must-read for movie buffs, true crime aficionados, and the many still enchanted by the Monroe magic.",
