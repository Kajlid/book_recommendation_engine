  "description": "Jill Shalvis’s outrageously funny, deliciously sexy romances are as wild as they are steamy-hot. Now, she brings together four wacky employees, two best friends (and complete opposites), one big secret, and a sexy Australian bad boy in a novel that’s hopelessly romantic and recklessly yours…This Just In: Hell’s Officially Breaking LooseIt’s bad enough that gutsy pilot Mel Anderson has to clean up after her lovable but completely disorganized best friend and business partner, Dimi, while her certifiable employees make more work than they do. Now, the one man she hoped she’d never see—the man who owns the deed to her airport, thank you—is back and looking for trouble. Scratch that, he is trouble. Amazing, holy cow, more please trouble…Bo Black wants his family’s airport back, and he’s determined to get it. This laid-back Aussie is nobody’s fool. Thing is, neither is Mel. She’s intense. Uptight. Sexy. And very, very tempting. Suddenly, Bo’s thinking less about revenge and more about kissing and touching and falling into a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-underpants kind of forever love…Now, somebody’s going for broke; somebody’s going crazy; somebody’s going to try everything; and somebody’s going to play a very risky surprise…",
