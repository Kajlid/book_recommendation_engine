If you’re listening in your car, the story may just fog your windows it’s so delightfully naughty.” —Love Romance Passion Refers to the audiobook version. What if Cinderella didn’t want to marry the Prince? And what if she discovered that a man who was in control of his life all day enjoyed giving up that control in the bedroom? Mariella goes to the prince’s balls to find a husband. Unfortunately, in trying to avoid one suitor she finds herself in the arms of the one man she doesn’t want. Teodor is captivated by the woman he meets at the three events, especially by her openness and sexual skill. Thrilled to have found a bride before his coronation, he proposes, only to have Mariella turn him down. Mariella has been trapped in one situation that was out of her control, and has no desire to exchange it for another. In addition, she has experienced the pain of love lost and is determined not to go through it again. Still, Teodor intrigues her, so she offers a proposal of her own. They will live together until his coronation and then she will make her decision. Hopefully, she can enjoy him in her bed while keeping him out of her heart. Unbeknownst to them both, there is another who wants Teodor’s crown and will stop at nothing - not even murder - to get it. What",
