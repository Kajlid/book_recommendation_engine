  "title": "Mathias Sandorf",
  "description": "First serialized in Le Temps in 1885, Mathias Sandorf is Jules Verne's epic Mediterranean adventure. It employs many of the devices that had fared well in earlier novels: islands, cryptograms, surprise revelations of identity, technically advanced hardware and a solitary figure bent on revenge. Verne dedicated the novel to the memory of Alexandre Dumas pere, hoping to make Mathias Sandorf the Monte Cristo of The Extraordinary Voyages.",
