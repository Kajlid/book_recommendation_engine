  "description": "It was tragic enough dying on Christmas Eve...but what on earth are Cathy and Don Angel doing in a bar in Boston, MA. with an archangel, a rule manual and a seemingly impossible mission? It begins when the thirty-something Angels leave New York in a rush of traffic, headed for Connecticut and the prospect of spending Christmas Eve with friends and family. The accident is inescapable and catastrophic; the aftermath, almost beyond belief... Don and Cathy are briefed by Gabriel himself. They're on probation, and must perform three miracles before midnight. If they fulfill their quota, they just might get their wings and a permanent place in the upper realms. Don has a hard time believing it, but Gabriel isn't one to mince words. On earth, they might have been known as the Angels, but that isn't going to earn them any halos. Heaven has much stricter requirements. The apprentice Angels soon find their fates inextricably entwined with the lives of several strangers, all of whom are in desperate need of some divine intervention. Challenged to find solutions where none come easily to hand, Cathy and Don must use all their ingenuity, compassion, and fledgling other-worldly skills to complete their celestial perambulations and come full circle. And in those precious moments between life and death, they just may discover a realm where hope never dies...impossible dreams come true...and miracles can happen.",
