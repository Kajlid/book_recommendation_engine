  "description": "It's the Merc with a Mouth in a pulp caper filled with lies, spies and shapely thighs, courtesy of Mike Benson & Adam Glass (Deadpool: Suicide Kings, Luke Cage Noir) and Laurence Campbell (Punisher)! Wade Wilson. Codename: Deadpool. He's the CIA's deadliest agent. He's also certifiably insane, suffering from Multiple Personality Disorder and haunted by the ghosts of his past. In other words, he's the perfect soldier in a Cold War where it's impossible to tell friend from foe and reality from a lie. Collecting: Deadpool Pulp #1-4",
