  "description": "She’s his first and best friend. No freaking way he would fall in love with her too. That would be a disaster.After everything Jordan Tanaka had done for him throughout their childhood, Carlos Fuentes is more than willing to offer her a place to stay when she moves from Los Angeles to Cincinnati.Unfortunately, the more time they spend together as adults, the more likely his innocent gesture of friendship will turn into a torrid catastrophe.Because when Carlos sees her in that red dress—wickedly tight and temptingly gorgeous—he doesn’t see a friend. He sees a woman who takes his breath away. His desperation for Jordan is like nothing he ever experienced before.He already has her understanding, kindness, and loyalty. He shouldn’t want her beautiful body, too.What good would come of it? What risk?This is no friends-to-lovers romance. This is a story about a red dress and a bad idea that threatens to ruin everything.Contains mature themes, adult situations, and spicy scenes that are not appropriate for readers under the age of 18.",
