  "title": "Time in Literature",
  "description": "This book is a perceptive analysis of the treatment of time in literature and its relationship to science and philosophy. Although Meyerhoff does not restrict himself to a particular period in literary history, most of his references are to twentieth-century writers who have been especially preoccupied with the subject of time - writers such as James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, F. Scott Fitzggerald, Thomas Mann, and Thomas Wolfe.If Literature, like music, is a temporal art; if, as Thomas Mann said, \"time is the medium of narration, as it is the medium of life\"; and if \"once upon a time\" is the \"timeless\" theme of every story told by man, from fairy tales to the opening sentence of Joyce's 'A Portrait of the Artist as the Young Man' - then to be engaged in literature leads naturally to questions about the meaning of time for art and man.The purpose of the book is first, to analyze in detail the major elements of time in literature and experience; second, to show how this literary portrait of time differs from the concepts of time constructed by science; third, to give some explanation for the increasing concern with the theme of time in contemporary literature; and fourth, to suggest what may be the meaning of the literary and scientific treatment of time for philosophy.",
