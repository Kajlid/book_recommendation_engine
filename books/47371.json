  "description": "Follow our teenage witch \"Alexi\" as she goes on a wild ride into the rich secrets her hometown of \"Ravenswood\" keeps under lock and key.Alexi Carvelle is your typical teenage girl, dealing with school and a recent tragedy in her life. Follow her as she learns to deal with the loss of her Mother, navigates a new found love growing for her best friend (Logan Stewart) and suddenly gets thrust into a world of magic she did not know existed until a mysterious boy by the name of Kyle Huntington arrives in town throwing everything into chaos. This is the first book in this new series by paranormal author Rue Volley that skirts YA minus a tad bit of language and some situations that border adult in nature. Filled with new creatures, plenty of magic and lots of humor to overshadow the grief, this is a story that easily draws you in and keeps you wanting to know more. It is available on amazon.com along with all of Rue Volleys other books in the Kindle Store.",
