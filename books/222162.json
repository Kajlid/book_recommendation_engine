  "description": "Without my box I can’t be meKidnapped by a clown close to the seaHe’s torn inside where one equals twoOne I hate, the other I love trueSecrets and lies become alibisSivan is damaged, it’s in his eyesRiddles unravel when you know who mastersNow Imogene’s only home is MastersAn eye playing spy held me togetherWhen I broke, he broke, two ends of frayed tetherWe’re joined by the past like twin souls in hellInnocent angels molested, and fellI escaped it, but need to go back.To love the man with his face painted black.The circus is known for its eternal magicOur tent of freedom is simply tragic.Once a little girl fell, then she fell for meI’m a fool, and she’s a fool for meThere’s a clown inside us all; a purposeBut this life, it’s all just a circus.",
