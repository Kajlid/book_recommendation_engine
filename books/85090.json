  "description": "A SEXY JOURNEYI've always been a good girl. I grew up in a small town, dated my high school sweetheart all the way through college, and married him. I even waited until our wedding night for my first time. Yeah, that kind of good girl. Finding my husband in bed with the church secretary came as quite a shock, needless to say. Finding out he'd slept with just about every female in town was an even bigger shock. Discovering those dirty little secrets is what sent me on a journey that I will never forget.LA VITA SEXYAfter I found my husband boffing the church secretary, I got on a plane with a mission to get away from it all and figure out my life. Instead, I fell into the arms of sexy Italian wine-seller Luca, who rocked my world, and now I'm all kinds of confused. I can't get enough of him, but the intensity of our connection scares me. The incredible things he does to my body scares me, if only because I like them so very much. So what's the problem? I'm supposed to be on a trip around the world, on a journey of self-discovery, but I haven't even gotten past Italy, past Luca. My heart and mind are saying one thing, but my body is saying something much different. One thing is for sure. I will never be the same.A SEXY SURRENDERI called, and Luca came. And then he came again, and I came with him. The problem isn't sex. The problem is love, and If I'm ready for it again so soon.",
