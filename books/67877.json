  "description": "Princess Vivienne never planned to get lost, when she set out to find the truth about her mother. She also never planned to be chased by wolves, break her arm, or be plucked from the snow by an enigmatic, scowling, beast of a man. Uncertain of just who has rescued her, she decides to hide who she is, all the while wondering who her grumpy savior is. Truly, it's a maddening situation.Fain MacTÃ­re has a problem. A beautiful, troublesome woman has appeared--injured and alone--practically on his doorstep in the dead of winter. And while he'd like to trust her, he hasn't kept himself and his men safe for so long by being foolish. He has dangerous enemies, and they're perfectly capable of sending a spy to worm her way into his band of rebels. Besides, his instincts are telling him that she's not being truthful, and he's learned to trust his instincts.As the Last Petal Falls is the second book in the Once Upon a Romance series, and it offers a whole new version of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" With charming characters, political intrigue, and a little dose of magic, this is truly a fairy tale for a modern audience.",
