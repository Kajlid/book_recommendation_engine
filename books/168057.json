  "description": "I wasn’t supposed to want him. Everyone said it was wrong. Taboo. Disgusting. None of it changed the fact that I do want him and as it turns out, he wants me too.I was always a decent girl; kept my grades up, didn’t sleep around, didn’t drink or do drugs, but something came along that changed me… my father’s boss. The day I met him was the day he took on a starring role in my fantasies. Unfortunately he always seemed oblivious to me. Sure he was a gentleman, treated me like a boss would treat his employees family, always with an easy smile. My overactive teen hormones wanted more. The night of my 18th birthday I made my move to finally see if he was worth the years I spent pining over him. What I got was meant to push me away, instead it made me want more. When I run into James Sterling again, I take the opportunity to make those fantasies a reality. I may just be getting more than I bargained for.  Avery Clarke is just as I remember her, beautiful and full of life. She has always been a temptation to me, an itch I can’t scratch. She teased my control for 2 years until she went away to college and I thought I was finally free of her sirens call. That one night when I got a taste of her was one I tried hard to forget. When she comes back into my life in a cruel twist of fate I’m not sure I can stop myself this time. But there’s something she should know, something that should make all good little girls run, I’m not a gentle man. In fact, I’m not anything like the man she’s built me up to be in that pretty little head of hers. Too late now, she’ll know soon enough.",
