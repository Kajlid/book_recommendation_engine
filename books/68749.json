  "title": "Mrs Darley's Pagan Paths to Magick",
  "description": "The fifth in the ever popular ‘Mrs Darley’ Pagan series of books investigates why the word witch still holds such negative connotations and provides a stark account of the barbaric witch hunts of Europe, Britain and Salem. Again, the ever likeable and enigmatic character of Mrs Darley leads the author Carole Carlton further along her magickal path as she reveals some of the Pagan secrets that underpin the workings of real, divine magick.The word magick evokes an air of mystery, wonder and excitement - but can it really be as simple as waving a wand and chanting a spell? In truth, the practice of magick, which is explored within this book, is far more complex than we might imagine, requiring the practitioner to be both disciplined and dedicated.",
