  "description": "Presented in Eliot Weinberger's excellent new translation with the Spanish texts en face, this is the 1957 poem \"that definitively established Paz as a major international figure\" (Sagetrieb). Written as a single cyclical sentence (at the end of the poem the first six lines are written again), Sunstone is a tour de force of momentum. It takes as its structural basis the circular Aztec calendar, which measured the synodic period of the planet Venus (584 daysâ€”the number of lines of Sunstone). But, as The New Republic noted, \"this esoteric correlative design... does not circumscribe its subject. [It is] a lyrically discursive exploration of time and memory, of erotic love, or art and writing.\"",
