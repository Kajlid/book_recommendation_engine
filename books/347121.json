  "description": "Miss Julia—that Southern spitfire of a certain age who is never less than charming, even when she’s at her most opinionated—has been praised by Fannie Flagg as “one of the most delightful characters to come along in years.” Don't miss Ann Ross's newest,   Miss Julia Raises the Roof , coming April 2018 from Viking.In Miss Julia Hits the Road , she is becoming increasingly concerned about her gentleman friend, Sam, who has suddenly started wearing cowboy boots, sending her flowers, and writing bad poetry. And when he shows up on a Harley-Davidson Road King and asks her to hop on, she’s convinced he’s lost his mind. Meanwhile, her invaluable housekeeper, Lillian, has been evicted from her home by her greedy landlord. Deciding that Lillian’s need is greater than her own fear (not to mention loss of dignity), Miss Julia takes Sam up on his offer and sets off on a motorcycle Poker Run to raise some fast cash.  She’s ready to risk life and limb in Sam’s sidecar to save Lillian’s home from the bulldozer, but will Miss Julia’s scheme work?",
