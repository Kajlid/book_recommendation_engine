  "description": "(out of print)The invincible knight, Sir Julian Lackland is a man of intense passion, the highest honor, and deepest loyalties. A mercenary, a bold warrior and a brilliant tactician, he is at times reckless beyond comprehension, and at times suicidal; throwing himself into both battle and love with his entire being. Lackland battles the strangest of magical creatures, and his personal demons with the same enthusiasm. His innocence and sense of humor are his greatest weapons.But for all that he is the invincible Great Knight there must be a crack in his armor and there is: His own burden of guilt. Eventually Lackland breaks under it, becoming the Lost Knight. An incident occurs that changes everything and begins his descent into madness, but Beau Baker manages to keep him glued together. As Lackland often remarks, he just has to live as well as he can, and so his two great loves, Lady Mags and Golden Beau form the framework of his life anchoring his sanity and making a love triangle unlike any other.No matter what comes along, Lackland is Lackland, and even in the depths of madness Lackland remains the very soul of knightly courtesy and true nobility; endlessly seeking that which was lost, and always making the world a safer place.",
