  "description": "From the author of the bestselling Taken: The Vampire's Concubine books comes a brand new series...  Briony was tough. She had to be to survive the dangerous streets of devastated Earth. But not even the vilest street punks could have prepared her for Scorched... or the dangerous werewolves who called the planet home.  Along with ten other women, Briony is seized and transported to a mysterious but primitive world filled with gorgeous Vikings... and there she discovers the real reason why they've been taken.  Forced to participate in a barbaric competition underneath the light of a full moon, the women are freed. They are given a ten minute head start... before thirty alpha werewolves are cut loose, all of them eager and determined to mate.  This book is part one in an ongoing serial series. It is not a standalone. Each release in this smokin' hot series is 17,000 to 19,000 words in length. Enjoy!",
