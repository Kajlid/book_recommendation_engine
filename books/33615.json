  "title": "Grey",
  "description": "Grey is a paranormal thriller dealing with the unseen world of balancing powers. Too often life is viewed in terms of good and evil, black or white, and the balance point tipping in either direction is ignored. Why should the afterlife be any different? We are given a choice when we die to move on to the Source, stay on earth and slowly evolve into more of what we were (good people become angels and bad people become demons), or a chosen few can work to keep the Balance between them. The title character Grey is such a warrior who works to maintain that balance. He wishes to retire by moving onto the next phase of existence (the Source), so he needs to train a replacement. Grey recruits Pete to learn how to destroy demons and when necessary smack angels around to keep them in line. With help from an eclectic crew of other metaphysical “policemen and women, like the no nonsense Raven,” Grey and Pete stop the biblical demon Legion from destroying a small town in Illinois, setting off a chain reaction that could upset the balance in this supernatural buddy cop comedy.The novel is written in two styles. Each chapter begins in a soliloquy from the title character Grey, where he tells pieces of his back-story intertwined with philosophical muses in his western argot that pertain to the subsequent chapter. Said chapter is then told in a third person narrative.",
