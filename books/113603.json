  "title": "The Betrayal of Flynn Monroe",
  "description": "Flynn Monroe is used to taking abuse. Why else would he stand by and let his girlfriend rename his ship something as derivative as the Lightning Bug? (He was perfectly happy with the Bloodless Warrior) When she brings him a job – one that isn’t on the level any way you spin it – he can’t help but wonder if she’s playing him for a fool. The problem is, with Calliope, he wants to be that fool. Calliope Druthers has been sinking her claws into Flynn for months. She’s almost got him where she wants him – if it weren’t for his suspicious brother, he’d be there. When a Grey diamond heist is waved under her nose, she can’t resist the temptation of stealing the precious, engineered stones from prim society types like her parents. If she can pin the whole thing on a puppy-dog-eyed Flynn… so much the better.",
