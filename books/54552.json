  "description": "Swingers in the sun - and murders in the shadows... the island was a magnet for every seeker of kinky kicks and far-out thrills. A weird bearded prophet had made it the home of a new religion - one that worshiped the sun, called clothing a crime, and recognized no vice save that of inhibition. The old-time residents said it was a shame and a scandal. But soon it was more than that. Kooks were one thing but corpses were another - and Ellery Queen arrived in nudist land to find that everything was in easy view except one fiendish killer.",
