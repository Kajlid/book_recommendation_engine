Recovered from a horrific injury sustained in a Taliban ambush, he has made strides in returning to his normal civilian life.

As the hunt for the killer escalates and demons from his past return, Reece must deal with his own survivor's guilt and face hard choices that could either give him peace or destroy him. He must rely on the bonds of brotherhood forged both on the battlefield and in the horrors of the past to find a way to survive and save his family. The worlds of politics, war and crime collide in a story that will pull the reader into a world where very little is as it seems on the surface.",
