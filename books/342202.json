  "description": "Natalie Quackenbush is approaching thirty, drowning in debt-and did she mention she lives with her parents? It's the kind of small talk she'd rather avoid. So she and her friends have found a new way to entertain themselves on the Scottsdale, Arizona singles scene: lying. It's an innocent game, but when Natalie meets a guy she actually likes-and wants to see again-how will she explain that her mother isn't actually insane? Or that she doesn't really work with convicted murderers? If she can find a way out of her lies without destroying this fragile new relationship along the way, she might just wind up with something real.",
