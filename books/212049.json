  "description": "Whether bringing to life the legends of the mightiest Greek and Norse gods in their widely beloved collections of myths, or retelling Chekhov’s tale of a little lost dog as they do in Foxie, the d’Aulaires excelled at the arts of storytelling and illustration. Foxie’s tale, wonderful to look at and delightful to read, is certain to charm both young children and early readers.Poor Foxie! With her “head like a fox and her tail like a cinnamon roll” she is adorable enough to charm anyone. But all her young master wants to do is tease her—and he isn’t very good at remembering mealtime either. One day his pranks go too far when he lures his dog out onto the busy city streets with a tasty bone and loses her. Foxie is soon rescued by a roly-poly circus-animal trainer who spots her flair for singing and adds her to his act, alongside a piano-playing cat and a strutting rooster. Opening night is full of surprises, though, and Foxie is overjoyed when she hears a familiar voice in the audience, calling out her name.",
