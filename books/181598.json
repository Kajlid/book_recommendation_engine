  "title": "The Listening Project: Lessons of Life, Love, & Listening to God",
  "description": "The Listening Project tells the true story of a woman who decides to make an unusual and quirky deal with God to become a better listener. What starts out as a step-by-step business model approach to learn about listening to the Divine voice within, soon turns into a far more personal and unexpected journey of loss, grief, healing, and love. An inspiring and at times irreverent book, The Listening Project makes you laugh, cry, and think about the many opportunities we have to hear God in our daily lives, especially when life gives us hurdles too big to jump on our own. As the author shares her experiences and lessons learned, readers are encouraged to explore their own unique spiritual approach to life, the ways they listen to God, and the inherent human challenges and rewards of hearing and following Divine guidance.",
