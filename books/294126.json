He's just landed his dream job at beautiful independent bookshop, Woolf and Wilde, but he soon discovers being a bookseller is a very different game to being a customer - the hours of shelving books, logging ISBNs and dealing with customers is overwhelming.

He just hadn't bargained on his new colleague, Hannah, seeing through his fa√ßade.Then Ed discovers that his mum is dating for the first time since splitting up with his dad. He decides to distract himself by being the best bookseller Woolf and Wilde has ever seen, but will it be at the cost of his Paper & Hearts Society friendships?If Ed can find a way to be himself, he might find making new friends and keeping old ones comes more naturally, and even get to know himself a little better in the process ... Can Ed let his guard down for the love of books?",
