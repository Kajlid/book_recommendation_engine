  "description": "\"That first breath of freedom you get is the best adrenaline rush you'll ever have. I was blinded by the lights, the people, by not having any responsibilities for once. Even though I had to sleep huddled next to a dumpster that night, I still felt like it was a small price to pay for freedom.\"  I thought I was free, but it turns out that the very freedom I coveted came with a price. I was desperate to get away and that's when he came.  With steel-blue eyes, muscles for miles, and enough attitude to sink a ship - he made an offer that left me reeling. But as it turned out, I wasn't the only one running from the demons in my sleep.  Is it possible for two damaged souls to save each other?",
