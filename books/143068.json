Why don't you just read the book and find out?\"Green Tea Won't Help You Now!\" is a stand-alone novel.But those of you who read Dasha G. Logan's debut, \"Billionaire on Board\", will be reunited with some beloved characters.SIZZLE FACTOR: Slightly saucy chick lit (no ten page long in-and-outs, fireworks or chain-climacting pregnant virgins. I would not call it clean, but it's not dirty either.)LANGUAGE: Characters tend to be outspoken! Nothing truly disgusting, but expect the occasional four letter word and the rare mentioning of body fluids.This book is written in British English, spelling and grammar may vary from American English. Approx. 58.000 words",
