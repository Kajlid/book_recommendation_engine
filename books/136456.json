  "description": "All Lily Hamilton wants is for things to go back to normal - well, as normal as normal can get nowadays. For her, the experiment is over, but that doesn't matter. Not to the universe, anyway. Even though her personal hell is over, a whole new one is brewing just over the horizon. Because the end of the experiment was supposed to be the end of the Zeds, right?Not exactly.Someone close to Lily cut a hole in the fence that surrounds the Control Zone, effectively unleashing the monsters that were contained within to the rest of the world. It's up to Lily to put a stop to the walking plague before the rest of the world is reduced to mindless cannibalism. But, being quarantined in Ground Zero doesn't help her situation out much.Finding a safe haven in a real-life hell seems almost impossible, but the sand in the hourglass is about to drop its last grains, and Lily and her family are the only hope mankind has for survival.",
