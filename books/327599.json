The greatest sex I’ve ever had.I never expected to see her again after graduation, so when she shows up in my kitchen in the middle of the night, I don’t know what to think.Apparently there’s some psycho after her and she needs my help. My family owns a private security firm, but I can’t protect her from Wilder.And maybe I don’t want to. Her presence brings up old feelings I don’t want to confront. It's easier to blame her for the past than face the truth.With all of us living under one roof, it’s only a matter of time until tensions reach a crescendo, and this time, none of us will escape.Welcome to Ridgeway, Em, where you will have to survive more than just your stalker.",
