  "description": "Wayra is one of the last of the Andean Shaman, who stands between the Seen and the Unseen. She grew up learning all the secret mysteries of life and the universe. Mountains, rivers, and clouds speak to her. She journeys between the realms of the living, and the dead. She senses countless energies that affect our world. In the ordinary world, she struggles to find her place- both as a young adult, and as a healer. A healer in a society that no longer understands the power and importance of cosmic forces. At 19, Wayra is coming into her power as a healer and shaman. It is her role, keeping the Seen and the Unseen in balance. The two aspects intertwine and affect each other continuously. Something from the Unseen begins stalking this world, starting with Wayra. From disrupted dreams to friends in trouble to her animal totems dying, the Unseen is slowly taking over her life. Wayra must figure out what the force drawing toward her is, because it might be more than her own personal world at stake.",
