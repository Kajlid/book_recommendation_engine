Thanks to his participation in a mad scientist’s time-travel experiment, he got to do his childhood over again, and fixed a lot of the mistakes he made the first time around. He’s a Captain in the United States Naval Reserve, serving as an openly gay man in an Armed Forces that no longer discriminates against gays, he’s co-owner of a multi-million dollar business, and he’s legally married to the man he’s loved for the past twenty-four years. What could possibly go wrong to upset the wonderful life he’s built thanks to a Do Over?",
