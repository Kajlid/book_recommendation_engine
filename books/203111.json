  "description": "Catie Bay has worshiped much older Chad McCray since she was a child. When she fumbles a seduction attempt after her graduation from high school, she flees to Europe, hoping she can forget her unrequited love.  Four years later, Catie returns, now a beautiful, worldly woman, and Chad, the quintessential bachelor, takes notice. He’s still not looking for love, but he wouldn’t turn down a romp in the sack with sexy Catie. She’s no longer the lovesick girl next door, though, and sometimes a man doesn’t know what he wants until it’s too late.",
