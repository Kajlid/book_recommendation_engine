  "description": "When Stink buys a huge jawbreaker that doesn't break his jaw, he writes to the manufacturer -- and receives 21,280 jawbreakers for his trouble! Soon he's so obsessed with getting free stuff that he misses an envelope in the mail pile, until his best friend starts looking as mad as a hornet. Thirty-six idioms are sprinkled through the story, inspiring a search that's more fun than a barrel of monkeys.",
