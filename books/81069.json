In the aftermath of the war, the world is unrecognisable and has become a simple fight to find food and shelter, to stay alive.Yet there is a glimmer of hope shinning from a new realm which emerged from the raging war. It is a world of wonder and magic, but it also holds darkness. The shadows are closing in, eclipsing the light and once it finds her, no one will be safe.",
