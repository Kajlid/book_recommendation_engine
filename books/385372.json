  "description": "Follow the humorous chronicles of Faredoon—known as Freddy— Junglewalla on his rise to success as he attempts to assassinate his insidious mother-in-law, prevent his son from becoming a holy beggar, and cope with a variety of traumas. At the dawn of the twentieth century in Pakistan, Freddy Junglewalla moves his family — pregnant wife, baby daughter, and Jerbanoo, his rotund mother-in-law — from their ancestral forest home to cosmopolitan Lahore. He opens a store, and as his fortunes grow, so does the animosity between Freddy and his mother-in-law. While Freddy prospers under British rule, life with the domineering Jerbanoo is another matter entirely. This exuberant novel, full of rollicking humor, paints a vivid picture of life in the Parsee community.",
