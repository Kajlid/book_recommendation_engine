  "description": "Unemployed university professor Tyler Marsh is pounding the pavement looking for a job. Disillusioned with academia, she’s aiming for an analyst’s spot in the private sector but after a year of rejections based on her over-qualification, she’s dumbed down her resume in a desperate attempt to get her foot in the door somewhere—anywhere! When Buffalo’s leading marine engineering firm offers her a low-level placement as a personal assistant, she’s sure it can’t get any worse, until she meets the woman she will be working for. Chief Innovation Officer and wounded veteran Georgie DiNamico doesn't want an assistant or anyone else bothering her. She has her work, her dog, and her nightmares to keep her company. Heir-apparent to her family’s engineering firm, a head injury suffered in Afghanistan has left her feeling too broken for anything else. Georgie has no use for the helper that her family insists she hire. But when Tyler’s resume lands on her desk, along with a company background check listing the advanced degrees she omitted, Georgie sees an opportunity to add a researcher to her R&D team. Tyler quickly realizes Georgie is not the damaged goods everyone sees. Thoughtful, forthcoming, and generous is Tyler’s first impression of her would-be boss and it alleviates much of her trepidation. The outrageous salary and benefits help too, but working with the woman the family sees as shattered looks like the least of her challenges. She recognizes something special in Georgie DiNamico, garnering trust, loyalty, and something more…something Tyler hasn’t thought about for a very, very long time.",
