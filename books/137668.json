  "description": "The basis of the forthcoming NETFLIX series Grand Army . Hailed by Gloria Steinem as “truthful, raw, and immediate,” SLUT examines sexual violence and rape culture through the eyes of high school students at a New York City high school.\"She's such a slut.\" Sound familiar?When a sixteen-year-old Joey is sexually assaulted by three friends, her life is thrown into upheaval after she comes forward and realizes the extent of society’s deeply-rooted sexual double standards and rape culture. By turns heartbreaking and hilarious, the play SLUT captures the real lives of teens and young adults as they negotiate sex and the cruel scapegoating that still hobbles female sexuality and power.This groundbreaking play and guidebook, written in collaboration with New York City high school students, offers communities and individuals concrete tools to inspire change and disrupt rape culture. SLUT includes production notes, a guide for talk-backs, and provocative essays by Leora Tanenbaum, Jennifer Baumgardner, Farah Tanis, Jamia Wilson, among others, providing the resources to inspire change within our communities and ourselves.",
