  "description": "Emma’s to-do list: 1- dump Tyler 2- survive new school 3- rock senior year   My life was as perfect as a teenage girl could hope it would be; friends, boyfriend, straight-A student, loving parents, and all that jazz. Until my entire world comes crashing down. Alright, that may be a bit dramatic, but come on, what sane person wants to move half-way across the country after their senior year has already started?  That’s not all that happened, but I digress. My entire world gets shaken up and suddenly I find myself in the middle of freaking nowhere Nebraska surrounded by three cute guys… Reid, the clown of the group, Kingston, the laidback, go with the flow kind of guy, and Jesse, the closed off one you don’t even want me to get started on.  Anyway, so here I am facing all sorts of challenges I never even thought of like a creepy classmate, a mean Assistant Principal, and trouble with the law, but they’ve got my back.  We can totally handle our senior year and make it to graduation, right?   The High School Clowns & Coffee Grounds Series is a WhyChoose/Reverse Harem trilogy featuring MFMM meaning the female main character doesn't have to choose between her love interests.  This book contains references involving PTSD, sexual assault recollections, abuse, underage drinking, and other themes that some readers may find triggering. This is the first of three books and DOES end in a cliffhanger.",
