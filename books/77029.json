But that was five years ago, before her testimony against an international assassin forced FBI agent Robyn Richards to fake her death, change her identity, and forever forsake the man she loved in order to protect him.But now, a life-and-death emergency forces Robyn to seek her husband's aid in saving their child...the daughter Grant never knew he'd had. And although Robyn must keep her true identity hidden, nothing on earth can stop her from responding once again to Grant's sweet murmurs of love...the sensuous feel of his body in her arms...and the delirious, dangerous heat of rekindled passion.",
