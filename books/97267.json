  "description": "Sydney Johnson is a nerd and proud—always doing the right thing, and following the rules. But routine fails her one evening, as she finds herself the random target of a kidnapping and assault by a group of boys. As a result of being blindfolded, she never sees her attackers or the location of the crime, so she decides to keep the incident to herself. She later drowns herself in college academic tasks, her only companion her childhood best friend—until she meets Nicholas Dhalton.  Devil-may-care Nicholas doesn’t know much about consequences. A rich heir, he finds little reason to acquaint himself with responsibility. But everything changes when Sydney Johnson enters his life.  Once their paths cross, and against their better judgments, Nicholas and Sydney embark upon an unconventional relationship at the risk of all that is familiar and stable.  As their relationship grows, and they reveal their deepest secrets, they eventually realize they have a damning past. With race and class trying to separate them, can their love survive yet another obstacle?  WARNING: Dark themes, heavy subject matter, some profanity, and other things that will make you clutch your pearls.",
