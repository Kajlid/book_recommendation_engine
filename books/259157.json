  "description": "He stalked me from the moment he saw me. He watched me day and night. Butcher is what everyone calls crazy. They see all the tattoos and scars and to be honest, to most people he looks downright scary. He’s dangerous. He is after all the enforcer to the Devil Souls MC. But to me? He’s just Butcher. I see him. I see who he really is. I see a man who will do anything for the people he cares about.

I will die for him and he would kill for me.  What everyone doesn’t know is I have the same crazy inside of me...",
