  "description": "For Joanna the month's holiday was to be an escape, a chance to paint and think and release the bitter memories of the war in Greece and of her mother's death. She had chosen the dazzling island of Santorini, remote and inaccessible as her own heart. The holiday was to be a solitary experience. But that was before Joanna met Ulysses, the mistreated little donkey.",
