  "title": "One Hundred Pounds",
  "description": "The year is 2076 and the world is in the stages of healing from a series of apocalyptic catastrophes. America is celebrating its three hundredth birthday and is now an empire, controlling and owning much of the world. Advancements in technology and science have slowed and almost ceased. The human population, which has dwindled to under two-billion has fallen into a simpler, less progressive way of life. Certain tree and plant life have gone extinct for unknown reasons, including the once wrongfully demonized cannabis plant. When the antihero, Patton Godart, just happens to acquire one hundred pounds of it, it doesn't take long for his loud and vulgar friend, Baxter Fulton, to convince him to cash in on his valuable possession. But, can they both survive the trials and tribulations they find themselves in while exploring the brutal black market to see a profit?",
