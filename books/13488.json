  "description": "Social worker Natalie Danvers never thought she would fall head first into her very own dimensional tear, straight into a fey lord's lap. The handsome but infuriatingly vague Lorh insists she's stuck in his land for three weeks and that only she can discover the reasons behind her appearance in TirAnn. Natalie's convinced this is all nonsense until forgotten memories of Lorh and his siblings resurface and collide with reason. Just who and what is she to Lorh and his family?",
