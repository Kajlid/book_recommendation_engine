  "description": "I'm not a hero. I’m a De Courcy billionaire. A single dad who’s lost his way, but I’ve put the never-ending parties on hold, trading drugs for bedtime stories and alcohol for girly tea parties. These days, I have sole custody of my daughter. That’s what happens when you accidentally knock up a hot stripper. Babies are dropped off on your doorstep. Tilly De Courcy is my only priority. My whole world. An anchor holding me to sanity in the long months following my girlfriends death. Then, Raen Cartier shows up out of nowhere, claiming to be my daughter’s family and begging for my help. She’s a stunning contradiction of beauty, scarred by torture. And as much as I try, I can’t deny the stir of intrigue that’s suppressed by grief.It’s forbidden. Unwanted. A buzz. Pleasure instead of pain. Raen’s days are numbered. She claims her blood runs through my child. And I’m her hope in a hopeless situation. Sparks fly. Chemistry bonds us. But real life isn’t straightforward. She has to escape the psycho who’s stolen her existence. It’s dangerous. Blood will spill. People will die. Can I risk everything to help a beautiful stranger find safe passage out of Ireland forever. And most of all, when the time comes, can I let her leave?",
