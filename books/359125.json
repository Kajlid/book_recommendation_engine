  "description": "Will Miguel’s whispered midnight promises ever see the light of day? Content with her job as small town waitress and role of single mom, Allison believes she's better off without a man. In her opinion, all they bring is chaos - and that includes the father of her child. So why has Miguel’s arrival shaken her so badly? It's not easy for Allison to keep Miguel a secret with someone poisoning the food in her bakery and the local sheriff believing she harbors a vendetta against the town because of her tormented past. And then there are the people waiting for her to screw up with the kids. The control Allison has always kept on her life is slipping out of her grasp. Allison is always upfront with Miguel. There isn't anything she hides from him. Miguel wishes he could say the same. The one thing that Miguel has hidden could be the very secret that drives Allison straight from his arms. Keeping their secrets and clearing Allison's name just might be harder than either of them have ever imagined.",
