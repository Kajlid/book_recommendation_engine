Mike has made millions in the hyper-secret, slightly seedy Messenger business. His gorgeous wife Tuesday is the hottest TV News personality in Los Angeles. Life bumps and grinds along, until Mike's paid too much money to deliver a message to a Wyoming beauty queen who's been dead twenty years. But posthumous message delivery turns out to be the only halfway sane assignment in this convoluted and dangerous job.",
