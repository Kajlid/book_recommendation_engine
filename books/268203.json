  "description": "One quest. One crown. One shattered heart.  The Royal Trials were never meant to be easy, not even for an imposter like Rybet Waise. But nothing could have prepared her for the magical storms, mutated animals and malicious gods standing in her way.  There is no time for tears, mere hours after being bathed in Prince Alexander’s blood, Rybet must embark on a quest. The second trial dictates she find a missing magical artefact--Queen Ophelia's crown.  Released from the overbearing confines of the royal palace, Rybet competes not only with the other remaining ladies, but also with the land itself. Magic is more volatile than ever, and the gods have come out to play.  Royal love interests who don’t know how to share only make things harder for this dirty pond-dweller--if that’s really all she is.  Rybet will do whatever it takes to make it out alive, and with her heart unbroken.  **SEEKER is book TWO of The Royal Trials trilogy and ends with another cliffhanger**",
