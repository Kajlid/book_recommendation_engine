  "title": "27 Years of Shoe: World Ends at Ten, Details at Eleven",
  "description": "Shoe , one of the most popular comic strips ever created, continues to delight millions of readers in hundreds of newspapers from Tijuana to Timbuktu.Edited by Chris Cassatt and Susie MacNelly, 27 Years of Shoe contains hundreds of cartoons from the Shoe collection, and is just as lively, vital, and vibrant as it was under the direction of Jeff MacNelly, whose death in June 2000 truly signaled the end of an era. Plenty of MacNelly extras pepper the book, including actual (and critical, of course) notes from Jeff's teachers, as well as photos and warm remembrances of the creative genius who won three Pulitzer Prizes for his editorial cartooning and two Reubens, cartooning's highest award, for Shoe .But best of all, 27 Years of Shoe includes year after year of Shoe, Perfesser Cosmo Fishhawk, Skyler, and Roz-along with Senator Batson D. Belfry, Irving Seagull, Wiz, Loon, and more-squawking, diving, and flying hard through life's ups and downs. Through the decades, Shoe has proven both successful and memorable, a tribute sure to be shared by this MacNelly collection.",
