  "description": "A fictional story of San Diego's own Wild Animal Park. From the back cover: \"Finsterhall and his friends--and some enemies--lived in the peaceful little San Pasqual Valley where the order of things had been established as far back as perhaps ten thousand grandfathers ago. But these little Southern California creatures had no built-in instincts to tell them how to live with the strangers who had come to the valley. The BIG strangers.\"",
