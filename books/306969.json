  "description": "It's Friday night and seventeen-year-old Paige Neubauer has to make a choice before Monday, when news will break that is going to ruin her life. She can stay and face the consequences from her conservative Christian parents, or she can run and be free of them for good. But a storm delays her choice and leaves her trapped in a local grocery store overnight with a classmate she hardly knows, and by the time the sun comes up, neither of their lives will ever be the same. Both girls are dealing with their own crisis, and somewhere between broom hockey, a dance party, and an ongoing debate about a pair of bagel-loving mice, they begin to confide in each other and learn that sometimes, someone you barely know can care for you in all the right ways.",
