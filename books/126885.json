On Halloween, my favorite holiday, I was informed my brother’s best friend, who is also my lifelong crush, would be moving into the house next door. The kicker is it’s just in time for Christmas. So, guess what I’ll be doing on Black Friday? Not shopping. I’ll be helping load up a storage unit and moving Callum’s belongings into his new residence. Meanwhile, he thinks of me as nothing more than Lachlan’s little sister. He’s a serial dater with a certain type. Unfortunately for me, it isn’t brown hair and green eyes. I’ll have to keep my feelings locked down tight as we work together to decorate the ranch for the holidays. Hopefully, I can get through the new year with my heart intact.Callum. Thanksgiving is over, and I get to move out of my dad’s house—finally. My new place belongs to my best friend. This means I’ll now be neighbors with his younger sister. Keeping my feelings for her in the friend zone was a struggle when we lived in different parts of town, but now it will be agony. I want her more than I can verbalize, but I can’t lose my best friend or my found family in the process.",
