I’m suddenly Crew-sexual.Sweatpant Sexual is a Best Friends Dad, Age Gap romance. If you like supportive friends and family, a Bi-sexual bear, age gap angst and lots of slow burny feels, this is the book for you!TW for past neglectful borderline abusive homelife, homophobic absentee mother of a secondary character.",
