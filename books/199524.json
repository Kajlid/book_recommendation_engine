  "description": "Family secrets are the most dangerous, hidden but not forgotten. Rijeka is a tomboy growing up in the 1960s Midwest, where poverty has grown in an extreme way. Through a shaming experience at school, she learns that her family is one of the least respected in the community.In the months after the suspicious and much gossiped about suicide of a close relative, it takes all the courage she can muster to recover from the deep emotional wounds the tragedy has wreaked upon her family and herself.The last thing Rijeka expects is to fall for a handsome young man who has probably dated every girl in the school except her. From middle school to high school, childhood attraction blooms into young adult romance and passion.Upon graduating, her world is once again turned upside down by an unwanted and surprising attraction for an older man. After a stormy run-in with this stranger who’s recently moved to her town, she learns that he’s a loner, discouraging intrusions into his secluded and secretive lifestyle.Focused on education and ambition, she finds roads open to her, but just as many others are blocked by cruel and petty persons in her small town. She refuses to be defined by persons obsessed with judging who and what she can become, but wonders what would bring her lasting fulfillment. Does a woman measure her success, individuality, and fortune in life through happiness and love, or through freedom? She is searching for a way to have it all.",
