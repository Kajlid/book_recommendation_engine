  "description": "Ascension is REAL, therefore DANGEROUS if you try to break the chains of this limited distorted REALITY… Inside ourselves we carry the answers to everything. Ariana is one of those People on this planet, with her physical Ascension capabilities still intact. Living basically a double life, she is trying to navigate between a normal type of existence where she is an architect, living in a foreign country, while dodging seen and unseen forces, meant to eliminate her and her potential for change of paradigm. There are PEOPLE/BEINGS and ORGANIZATIONS out there meant to keep everyone in the dark, submissive, easy to manipulate. THEY don’t want that you FREE YOURSELF from this PRISON OF THE MIND and SOUL.  Wake up before it’s too late…  The REVOLUTION IN CONSCIOUSNESS has begun…now it’s time for a real Ascension Path story.",
