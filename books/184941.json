  "description": "Everything changed for Daisy when Daltrey walked out of her life in search of rock and roll superstardom. Without Daltrey, Daisy’s world crumbled around her, leaving her broken—and determined to hide her secrets from the only boy she ever loved. When Daltrey finally found her again, Daisy was no longer the same girl he once knew. Only his love could help put her back together when she thought all hope was lost.  Now on the road together again, Daisy and Daltrey finally have their shot at happiness. All they have to do is handle the stress of a national tour, the pressure of fame, his bickering brothers, his controlling father, a few crazed fans, and the lingering demons of her past. Easy, right? But so long as she has Daltrey, Daisy knows anything is possible. Letting go and looking for the bright side has never been more fun!  This Ransom short story has 11,000 words or approximately 31 pages. This is a stand-alone rock star love story with no cliffhanger. You can read more about Daltrey and Daisy, as well as the rest of the Ransome brothers, in Rachel Schurig’s Ransom series.",
