  "description": "In her second poetry collection, Kat Georges consciously searches for joy in a world of growing darkness. Georges ( Our Lady of the Hunger ) has an adamant insistence on seeking light in the darkest of places, setting her work apart in a media-driven world bent on promoting grief and devastation for the sake of clicks. Georges provides both solace and inspiration for the reader. These new poems combine humor and deep insight into human nature to capture moments of much-needed wonder and enchantment. Kat Georges is an internationally-acclaimed poet, playwright, editor, and designer, whose work has been widely published in journals and anthologies, including The Outlaw Bible of American Poetry (Thunder’s Mouth Press) , Arriving at a Shoreline (Great Weather for Media), From The NYC Through the Eyes of Poets Who Live Here (Blue Light Press), The Verdict Is In (also editor; Manic D Press), Love, Love Magazine (Paris), and Anthologie de Littérature Féminine Américaine (13E Note Editions), and many other publications. She lives in New York City.",
