  "title": "Hot Chocolate and Angel Kisses",
  "description": "~Herald angels aren’t allowed love for the daughters of Man.~Surrounded daily by evidence of mankind’s inhumanity, Nathan finds peace and a ray of brightness only in the purity of a barrista’s smile. Cassie’s warmth, far sweeter than the cup of hot chocolate she sells him each morning, touches even an angel’s heart. Still, they seem fated to be nothing more than customer and shop girl, until, sparked by a simple act of kindness, attraction blooms on a snowy afternoon. One kiss frees the love in both their souls. But that kiss breaks Nathan’s covenant to guide and succor those for whom he bears a message. One kiss proclaims their love. There can never be a second.",
