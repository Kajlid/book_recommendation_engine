  "description": "Veronica Sutton came to Washington to do good–but she did even better. Tall, smart, beautiful, and Black, Veronica parlayed her brains, looks, and college activism into a top-notch, million-dollar consulting firm that greased the wheels of Washington politics–without regard to race, creed, or political ideology. For Veronica, it was a long way from Chicago’s South Side. But when she is found dead in her posh town house, only a woman who knew the real Ronnie Sutton can find out how she died–and why. Reporter Angela McKenzie chose a different path from her old friend’s, but now their lives are entwined again. Retracing Ronnie’s final weeks and days, Angela steps into a political maze of power, sex, secrets, and special interests. When people connected to Angela’s investigation begin to die, she knows she’s close: to a few astounding answers, to one more deadly question, and to a conspiracy that will rock Washington’s foundations– and kill anyone in its way. . . .",
