  "description": "NeoThe day I found her crumbled and shut down from the world, I knew it was going to take a miracle to bring her back to me. It would take all my strength to pull her out of the dark abyss. But no war is won without fighting and winning the battles before it. Little did I know it would take much more than only my strength to guide her through the dark. But rather my heart as well. As terror surrounds us, her demons refuse to leave her alone, leaving me crippled with one arm tied behind my back. Will I be able to save her in time before the demons snatch her from my grasp, or will we make it out with only moments to spare?",
