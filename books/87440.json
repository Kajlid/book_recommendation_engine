  "description": "This little book is a think-piece for adult readers who grew up with (or have been captured by) the fantasy worlds of C.S. Lewis, J.R.R. Tolkien, and J. K. Rowling. Rob Smith points out general themes in the work of these three authors and matches them to the ancient motifs of the biblical writings. The result is a discussion about the way in which we look at time, place, and the meaning of being human. The focus is less an explanation of the stories than a jumping off place to discuss our presuppositions about these important life matters. Rob Smith is an ordained Presbyterian minister who served thirty-one years in congregations before accepting a full time position teaching religion and philosophy at Wright State University in Dayton, Ohio. There he taught a course entitled The Life, Religion, and Fiction of C.S. Lewis. His familiarity with Lewis, Tolkien, and the other Inklings gives him a unique insight to this literature. His background in biblical studies also brings credibility to this work.",
