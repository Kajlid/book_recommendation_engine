  "description": "The beautiful, magical Crystalline Kingdom was in trouble. Something dark was steadily consuming it, and there was nothing that GiniRa, the kingdom’s genie, could do about it. Perhaps the Wishmaker could help, but where was he? Somehow, he did not seem to be answering her calls, and that had never happened before. Had he just been delayed, or was he in serious trouble somewhere along the River of Time? She had no idea that in fact the Wishmaker’s journey to her had, as she feared, been interrupted and he had crashed into the living room of a young man on Earth and was lying in terrible pain on the remains of Michael’s shattered coffee table.The Crystalline Kingdom had to be saved. Fairies, Djinns, Genies, Dragons and all manner of magical beings that lived here (to say nothing of huge flying cats with butterfly wings) would not be enough, it seemed. Perhaps, just perhaps, one boy from Earth might be the only one who could rescue them all from total destruction.",
