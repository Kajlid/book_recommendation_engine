  "title": "Osaka Games",
  "description": "Virtual video games, the kind where human game characters wear special video glasses uplinked to satellites that allow a game player on the other side of the world to see and hear the action while the game character is following the player’s commands, monitored by a Game Master who keeps everyone safe, to pick up bits of game magic.Suddenly everything changes when the Game Master witnesses a murder and kidnapping by a wealthy and powerful player. Osaka Games becomes a real nightmare when a billionaire tech executive goes rogue. He’s wreaking havoc in the game, but to what end? Could it be a play for world domination through his ubiquitous computer operating system? As all this is going down, the team in LA with the help of their nearly sentient computer, is dragged along with the game character in Osaka as that character experiences the murderous power of gangsters, samurai ghosts, body-swapping spirits and brutal Japanese sword fighting. It’s anyone’s guess who will survive this paranormal vortex of betrayal and bloodshed.",
