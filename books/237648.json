  "title": "Blind Harry's Wallace",
  "description": "The original story of the real Braveheart, William Wallace. Racy, blood on every page, violently anglophobic, grossly embellished, vulgar and disgusting, clumsy and stilted, a literary failure, a great epic! Whatever the verdict on Blind Harry, this is the book which has done more than any other to frame the notion of Scotland's national identity. The film Braveheart is based on the 1722 Hamilton edition of this epic poem. Burns, Wordsworth, Byron and others were greatly influenced by this version, said to be the book most often found in Scottish households (after the Bible).",
