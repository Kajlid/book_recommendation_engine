  "description": "Newly divorced dad Kurt Varley is having a rough year. He’s lonely. His kids are avoiding him. His widowed father’s behavior has started becoming reckless. And to top it off, Kurt’s house is haunted. But despite all this, he’s been trying to date again, a challenge after years of marriage, and the women he meets seem to sense his hopelessness.But things flip upside down when during an afternoon date, a mouthy staffer at an amusement park blurts out details of Kurt’s private life, things no stranger should know. The young man, Orion, claims to be psychic, but Kurt suspects he’s gotten his information elsewhere, and soon discovers they share an unsettling personal connection. But when Kurt’s fascination with the combative, charismatic Orion begins to overshadow everything else, the biggest mystery might be why he can’t stop making excuses to see him again.",
