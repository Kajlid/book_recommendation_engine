  "description": "I’m sure you’ve been through a situation where you get your hopes built up by someone, only to have them let down by a heart-wrenching disappointment. Well, Evie thought that the Captain was going to take her to see an unusual but beautiful planet where she would see things she had never seen before and probably never will again. However, her hopes were dashed when the Train landed on Earth, in Adelaide – where she comes from. No fun for Evelyn Bamford (Earthling), but loads of fun for Paulo Vistar (Serothian) as he had never seen the planet Earth before. Paulo is in for a treat when their curiosity takes them to the Adelaide Zoo where there has been a recent catastrophe.While Evie is forced to stay home with her parents to give them some much-overdue explanations, the Captain and Paulo are eager to solve the problem at the zoo. Little do they know that there is another catastrophe at a nearby school, and one determined teacher suspects that it is not of this world.Can a seven-year-old girl hold the key to the mystery of the strange, aggressive-looking creature? What’s it got to do with a roaming crocodile? And can the Captain come up with a permanent solution before the hostile visitors claim all the lives of the people of Earth?The Captain and Paulo find themselves becoming quick-change artists and ‘masters of disguise’, while Evie is kidnapped from her own backyard and comes face-to-face with the bullies of her past.",
