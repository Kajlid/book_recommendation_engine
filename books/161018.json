  "description": "Another sexy tale from a sultry new voice in erotic romance.Confident, freewheeling Maxim Cox has been thinking lately that something's been missing in his life. Then he sees his old college crush facing scandal in a tabloid and figures it out; it's Elisa Cross, the one who got away. Now he'll do anything it takes to have Elisa, in every way. To escape the scandal, Elisa has sworn off men and holed herself up in a cabin miles from anywhere. So when Maxim appears at her door in the middle of a snowstorm, she can't believe it. She swore she'd never give in to his devilish good looks, but the raging storm and her raging desires make him impossible to refuse. But Elisa's determined to keep the upper hand-and arranges a game of Hide and Seek. And if Maxim can play by her rules and find her, he can have her-all of her.",
