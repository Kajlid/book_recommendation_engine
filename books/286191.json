  "description": "\"Dreams are exactly that, girl. Dreams. A total waste of energy, and you sure as hell won't get far in life with that kind of attitude.\" My momma had my life planned out for me, but it wasn't the life I wanted.  I was nothing but a measly pawn in her evil and twisted games.  And I wanted out... no matter the cost.  Preston Rydel was supposed to be my saviour. Only it turned out he had some evil plans for me too.  As the KING of Rivington Prep, there's no way he'd ever keep his promise to me. Instead, he has his heart set on destroying me. For good.",
