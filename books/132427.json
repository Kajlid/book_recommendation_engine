  "title": "A Perfect Solution",
  "description": "A Perfect Solution is the story of a young man who does not at the beginning know whether he is gay or straight—so he experiments until he finds his true love. There is sex in it—but this is above all else a romance to touch the heart. Chris is a young man brought up with three girls and a girl is what he wishes he had been. The girls dress him as one of them and he revels in the life that opens up for him. If you don’t want to know what it is that men do when they’re in bed with other men, you should not read this book—but Chris finds that girls, too, are not without their attractions. He falls in love with one, but she is denied to him; he falls in love with another and loses her, too. In sadness he turns back to men—but Cupid has one last card to play before Chris finds his perfect solution.",
