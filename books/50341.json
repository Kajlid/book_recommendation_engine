  "description": "Hedonistic immortals live among us. They are drawn to a certain subset of the population who stubbornly refuse to relinquish control of their bodies, for the longer they resist, the sweeter the passion when they are overcome. For centuries these beings -- worshipped as deities or feared as demons -- have feasted on such pleasures.After over 1200 years, surprises are a rare treat, so during a routine acquisition of a spirited mortal woman, Fryar believes he has found a real treasure, for he has made mistake after mistake since meeting her --- something which has never occurred in all his centuries of existence. As he attempts to control her, he discovers he may only crush her spirit, not work his will on her. He soon recognizes her true value lies in her independence, yet freeing her also means losing her, for she would flee from him the moment he allows it, despite — or perhaps because of — the rapport they’ve developed.To someone whose life has been devoted to self-indulgence without concern over the consequences, such a sacrifice is impossible to contemplate. It may be better to destroy what he loves for the immediate reward and pain than to suffer the misery of what could never be for eternity.",
