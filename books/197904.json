  "description": "Alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here and herePioneering Literature  Literature has seen epic sagas. But surely, none on this scale. Few books specifically set out, almost madly, to reshape the world. Opening this kind of product is brave enough; then you don’t roller-skate in luxury, but hike through corrugated Africa with as many bumps as beauty. You exit, a changed mind and spirit. Above all, you leave with hope.  The creators are new-age activists. Their presentation is of society as a living person with ‘organs’. Their Global Eye quest commences with books 1 and 2 that ‘treat’ a country’s failing ‘organ’ of justice. Radical wisdom is offered, challenging ancient bastions of English law, successfully.  The stage of analysis is a pulsating real-life murder trial. A high court verdict is changed sensationally, ‘beyond reasonable doubt’. The criminal motive there eluded seasoned court experts. A layperson just quickly innovates a brand new genre of psychology - true - to unravel motive and challenge conventional psychology; besides pioneering new schools of self-help and philosophy in the melee. Unprecedented depths of the killer’s mind are probed. But this is not nearly as compelling, as the adventure into the strangest mind of all … your own.",
