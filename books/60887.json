  "description": "Dan is trying to live an ordinary life, well as ordinary as you can in the Kingdom. He has a good job working in the Library of Stories, even if his boss is a little flat—he is a magic mirror, after all. Then one day, Dan slips up and utters two little words—five tiny little letters—that are about to spin his story around and fill it with colour and laughter—and a Fairy Godmother. Who is a man. A man who sparkles.",
