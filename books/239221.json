  "description": "1892 Creede, Colorado  In a boom camp like Creede, most people want to get rich either mining silver or playing cards. LG and Davis have a different plan â€” sell beef. Fighting the bitter temperatures and the winter storms of the Colorado high country, they string wire and bring in cattle. But there are things more dangerous than the weather. Having run out of luck and out of Denver, con man Soapy Smith brings his gang up to Creede to start over. His vision of success if different than anyone else's, and it involves rigging the odds in his favor. No matter who it affects, or how far he must reach.BOOK TRAILER:www.goodreads.com/videos/149798-book-...",
