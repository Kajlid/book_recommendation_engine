  "description": "Screenwriter Jean Clarke's first novel is an intelligent, perceptive, and sometimes hilarious look at coming-of-age in rural America.  Set in the pre-Elvis 1950s, we experience a rollercoaster year in the life of a female wild-child who survives family chaos, abuse, love and loss.  Add cowboys to the mix and you have a fascinating read.",
