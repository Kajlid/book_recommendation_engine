Years later she still struggles to face a secret sheʼs hidden from everyone since she was little. With her brother, Jeremy, and her boyfriend, Luke having the time of their lives at Northwestern, she makes the hardest decision of her life--to let them go. Unfortunately, that means giving up her own heart to protect theirs.

Heʼs attending his favorite University, has the girl of his dreams, and lives with his best friends. The one morning when he wakes to find her scribbled note telling him sheʼs leaving flips his world upside down. Unable to cope, he turns to booze and pills to numb his pain. It isnʼt until almost two years later and losing all hope when he stumbles upon Maggie. And of all places, working in a strip club.Convincing her to come home with them is the easy part, but finding out the real reason for her leaving could destroy them both.",
