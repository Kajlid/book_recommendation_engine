  "title": "The Path of Glory: Being the Memoirs of the Extraordinary Military Career of John Shipp",
  "description": "John Shipp (March 1784 - 1834) was a British soldier and author best known for his memoirs which were popular and ran to at least four editions. Shipp began his military career as a drummer boy at the age of ten and twice won commissions from the ranks due to his ability and conduct; he had to sell his first commission due to a lack of funds. He attained the rank of Lieutenant in the 87th Regiment. The Times reviewed the third edition of Shipp's memoir in 1890 where the work was listed as one of the \"Books Of The Week\". The reviewer states that \"for a man of little more than 30 to have twice won his commission from the ranks was.an achievement unique in the annals of the British army\".",
