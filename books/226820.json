  "description": "Rosalind Ines Pastrano has just experienced the worst summer of her life. She has no interest in learning how to drive and has blown off all her friends. The only thing her heart wishes to do is to spend each day mourning the loss of her beloved ghost and true love, Jimmy, whose spirit finally crossed over to the other side.But what Roz doesn't know, is Jimmy never made it into the Light he stepped into. He is very much alive and well, and somehow, trapped inside the body of enemy, Parker Evans. Now, Jimmy must do everything he can to convince Roz that he is not the one who tried to kill her, but is actually her love. It's a feat Jimmy believes will be easy to accomplish, until he comes face to face with Parker’s mother- a woman who will stop at nothing to control “her son” and use his magic for her own wicked gain. **This is the sequel to the award-winning Rest in Peace Roz, and should NOT be read as a standalone. To enjoy your reading experience, please begin the series with Book 1Some scenes may be triggers for more sensitive readers as the nature of the series deals with child abuse and it's lasting effects. However, this story is also filled with joy, hope, love, and inspiration, because good ALWAYS wins against evil.",
