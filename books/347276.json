  "description": "The Time Warp Trio find themselves in the middle of an adventure in prehistoric times, where cave art is a form of graffiti and \"rock\" music takes on a whole new meaning.Some people will do anything to get out of doing their homework. The Time Warp Trio is back - and they're going back in time, all the way to the Stone Age, where there aren't any math problems. But there are plenty of other problems to keep Sam, Joe, and Fred on their toes, including a tribe of hostile cavewomen, a hungry-looking saber-toothed tiger, a bone-rattling earthquake, and a woolly mammoth who wants to turn them into toe-jam. But worst of all, how can The Book get them back home again when writing hasn't even been invented yet?",
