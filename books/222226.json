  "description": "When the Rules Aren't Right is a graphic novel for all ages. It is the story of Emma, your basic fed-up teen, tired of parents who only talk about work and money, a self-obsessed older sister, and a brother who's moved back home because he's drowning in student debt. She hates her chores, her know-nothing classes and she's oblivious to the bigger world out there that could use her help. One night, her Nana visits her and takes her in a magical time machine to show her people with real problems....and real solutions. When the Rules Aren't Right offers readers a look at the struggle of workers -- let's them stand in the middle of the action and watch ordinary people achieving extraordinary things.",
