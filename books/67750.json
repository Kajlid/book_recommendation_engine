  "title": "The Unknown Mother: A Magical Walk with the Goddess of Sound",
  "description": "It isn’t every day that one meets a goddess, let alone a Matrika or being that presides over the sounds of language. It is said such deities can bring us complete liberation. Will that prove true for vocalist Wrenne Raphine when a mysterious woman appears and offers to help her find her True Voice? This beguiling and eccentric teacher guides us all on a deep and powerful journey through 10 mystical gates of sound, sharing great insights, secrets, and profound wisdom about the power of letters, words, and our very own voice to transform the world around us. This isn’t standard knowledge; this is a gift for our times, taking the reader into the very heart of sonic revelations.Written in a narrative fashion similar to the Castenada books or Victor Wooten's popular work, The Music Lesson, The Unknown Mother gives the reader an experience far beyond what straight nonfiction alone could ever deliver.",
