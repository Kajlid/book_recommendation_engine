The beautiful nurse whose selfless devotion calmed the seething hostilities among them. Their one previous reminder of a world before war. The woman each of them adored.IN LOVING ONE MAN, SHE FOUND THE WEAKNESS OF HER HEART.The arrival of decorated hero Michael Wilson changed everything. His outward toughness of body and mind didn't match the official reports of something shameful and disturbing about him. Yes despite Honour's fear about his true feelings, she was becoming possessed by Michael. And after a night of passion so long denied, the tensions among Honor's men exploded into a violent tragedy of jealousy and death...and a heartbreaking choice that Honour Langtry would endure for the rest of her life.AN INDECENT OBSESSION is more intriguing, more thought-provoking than THE THORN BIRDS.",
