  "description": "Can Freya resist The Paranormals' drummer's Rex appeal? After throwing herself at Rex Colton for a week and being cast aside, Freya has decided to move on. So, typically, that would be when Rex decides to declare that she's his mate. Well, it's too late. Freya can't know whether it's a genetic error that has triggered Rex's mate-ometer, or if he now genuinely has feelings for her, and her heart isn't willing to risk another rejection. But Rex has decided she's the one for him. He's a wolf and thereâ€™s no stopping his pursuit of his mate. Can he make Freya realise that this is real, or is he destined to be a lone wolf? One thing's for certain, with watermelon whimsies, impromptu duets, and demon drummers, it's sure to be wild.",
