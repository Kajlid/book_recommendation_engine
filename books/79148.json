  "description": "Alice is the most rootin’, tootin’ cowgirl in all of Dallas . . . Pennsylvania. Each day she puts on her favorite boots and hat and sets off on her stick pony for school with a “Yippee ki-yay!” Alice is used to being the only cowgirl around, until Lexis from Texas arrives at school one day. Lexis seems to be a real cowgirl, with her fancy hat, jingling spurs, and lasso tricks. Alice decides there’s only one way to know who the best cowgirl is: a school-yard showdown at high noon! But will Alice learn there’s room for more than one cowgirl in town?Bestselling author and illustrator Marilyn Sadler and Ard Hoyt team up to create a rollicking tale of friendship that will have readers dancing the Texas Two-Step and shouting “Yee-haw,” no matter where they’re from.\nPraise for Alice from Dallas\n\"The comic watercolor-and-ink illustrations don’t miss a beat in capturing the amusing rivalry that turns into friendship...The clever ending is a yee-haw moment that will rope in readers as quick as tumbling tumbleweeds.\"--Kirkus Reviews\"Hoyt’s bright ink-and-watercolor illustrations gleefully capture the girls’ enthusiasm for all things western, from their fringed cowgirl blouses to the bandannas tied jauntily around their necks. A lively story for cowgirls everywhere, with a breezy lesson about jealousy.\"--Booklist",
