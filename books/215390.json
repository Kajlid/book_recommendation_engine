  "title": "Guide to Manly Health and Training",
  "description": "A giftable, illustrated collection of short quotes and pithy advice on the art of \"manly health and training\" by quintessential American writer Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman was the epitome of a 19th-century American gentleman--a poet, journalist, essayist, and the father of free verse--whose legacy lives on to this day. He also had strong opinions about the manly arts of grooming, dress, working out, and health science: in 1858, under a pseudonym, Whitman wrote a nearly 50,000-word journalistic series entitled \"Manly Health and Training,\" which wasn't known to be his work for the past 150 years. In the series, Whitman outlines how to achieve \"a perfect body, a perfect blood,\" and dispenses advice on sports, footwear, bathing, women, alcohol, shaving, food, dancing, mental health, and more. Walt Whitman's Guide to Manly Health and Training excerpts the best of Whitman's treatise on masculinity in an accessible, small, illustrated format, making it the perfect gift for men of all ages.\"",
