Only people who have not read this book could suggest that he is not a fine writer. It is a heart-thumping read” - Daily Express (UK)“McNab is the best suspense thriller writer to put pen to paper since Alistair MacLean” - Stephen Coonts“McNab is a terrific novelist. When it comes to thrills, he’s Forsyth class” - Mail on Sunday (UK)“McNab’s great asset is that the heart of his fiction is not fiction: other thriller writers do their research, but he has actually been there” - The Sunday Times (UK)",
