  "description": "At War with Man and NatureIn a frozen corner of the north, World War II rages amidst mountainous gales, terrifying blizzards, and deadly icebergs. The lone U.S. Coast Guard trawler Arluk is commanded by \"Mad\" Mowry, a salty old drunk, a raging tyrant -- and the finest ice pilot around. But when Mowry cracks up, two greenhorns are suddenly thrust into command. Paul Schumann and Nathan Greenberg must conquer the icy Greenland seas, the brutal Arctic elements, the fog-enshrouded Nazi gunboats -- or die.Based on personal experience, Sloan Wilson, author of The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit, has written a gripping story of war at sea, of the officers and seamen who fight fear and the enemy. The solitary trawler Arluk and its crew become a microcosm of the entire war.",
