  "description": "GarethI don't know how I get myself into these situations. But here I am, a tenured college professor in his early 30s, standing in for his twin brother like we're back in high school. Only this time it isn't the AP US History exam, it's some greyhound rescue's charity bachelor auction. Even though it's for a good cause, I'm not thrilled with the thought of being sold to the highest bidder - until I realize she's the stunning but shy brunette I found hiding out on the terrace before the auction started. The chemistry between us is off the charts. But will it still be there when she finds out I'm a scholarly English teacher and not a high rolling Wall Street power broker?KitI'm going to kill my best friends. I'm sure Bianca and Suzette, my fellow volunteers at Forever Grey, mean well when they bid on - and win me - a date with the hottest guy up for grabs at the rescue's charity bachelor auction. They just want me to let loose and have a little fun, something I haven't done much of since moving to New York a few months ago. But there's no way I can go out with this guy. No matter how hot he is, or how nice he seemed when he found me behind a potted plant, trying to fend off a panic attack by playing with the meditation balls Bianca gave me. He's everything I ran from San Francisco to escape from. Rich. Entitled. Arrogant. I lived in that world once. Never again.So why can't I stop thinking about him? And why did I just agree to meet him for drinks? And what will happen if he finds out I'm not who everyone thinks I am?",
