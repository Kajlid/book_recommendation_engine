Sir Henry is devastated by the loss of his young wife and heir to the estate, especially since there is no evidence, no witnesses, and no apparent motive. But nothing is what it seems, and the gruesome find is only one link in a chain of events that started long before. Forbidden love, family secrets, and betrayal have led to this moment, ending months of speculation and gossip and bringing it to a shocking conclusion.",
