  "description": "The Cheeseman family is back from back-in-time. Or at least, they're in the LVR (their super-secret time machine) and on their way to save the life of their beloved mother, Olivia. But then the LVR gets kicked off the Time Arc into a place called Sometimes. And unlike olden times or present times, Sometimes doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's got dinosaurs and Vikings and jumbo jets, all in one place, at one time. Luckily, it's not a long time before the family is back on course again. And just as they're about to rescue their mother at last, the kids confront something utterly surprising. Something wilder than dinosaurs, Vikings, or jumbo jets. More unbelievable than cowboy poets and psychic dogs.They are about to encounter... Dr. Cuthbert Soup.And the alternate versions of themselves!",
