  "description": "A new collection from \"one of the real treasures in poetry of our time\" ( Washington Post ). Linda Pastan writes, \"the art that mattered / was the life led fully / stanza by swollen stanza.\" That life is portrayed here, from memories of the poet's earliest childhood and the ambiguities of marriage and love to the surprises that come with age, always with a consciousness of what is happening in the larger world.",
