We blew it, darling.\"Take two Cousins from Faction Paradox.Give them a world – the Earth, for example – and give them the power to change that world’s history as they see fit.Then stand back and watch what happens…Just what would happen if a couple of Cousins used our planet as their personal game board? As they create one alternative reality after another, twisting history and reality into knots, only one outcome is sure: whoever wins, the human race loses.TOCPlaying for Time I - Kate OrmanDreamer in the Dark - E.H.
