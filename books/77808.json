  "description": "Danger rides on Ben Kirby's shoulder. At least that's what Sterling Aegar believes. And that's a problem. Two years ago Sterling ran away from a passionate relationship with Ben because his work scared her. A cop herself turned private investigator, she's suffered more than her share of losses, and with the death of her sister's husband, also a cop, she couldn't contain the idea of loving Ben, then losing him to his police work. But now, two years later, a mutual case has slammed them together again. Though for Ben, encountering Sterling has triggered physical attraction that has never gone away, it's also reminded him how deeply he has always loved her. As Sterling and Ben confront grave danger on the job, they both must face their troubled pasts and decide to choose love or let it go..\nSensuality Level: Sensual",
