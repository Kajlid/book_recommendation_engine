Oh, not just any vampire, but Tamara Hightower, Master of the East Coast, whose name and reputation quakes fear in every other vampire, not to mention a few Counsel members that crossed her path. Can this modern day relationship between a half-witch and a vampire work out or am I just fooling myself? No doubt, she stole my heart, but can I command her pleasures?",
