  "description": "Her brother's near mortal wounding hadn't done it. Fleeing to the rolling hills of the Highlands had failed as well. And while being captured by the most dangerous-looking Scotsmen she'd ever imagined had come close, it was staring up at two of the thickest, most well-muscled thighs she'd ever seen that drove Kyla over the edge. But the madness that overwhelmed her felt strangely like desire. It warmed places she'd never known existed. Nit, even should the handsome Galen MacDonald sweep her up and marry her, she would still be sworn to return and destroy her enemies. Yet if she could enlist the fierce warrior's aid? The Scottish laird had claimed that the sweetest dish of all was never served coldâ€¦ tonight she'd see if he was right.",
