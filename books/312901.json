  "description": "Sassinak was 12 when the raiders came. That made her just the right age - old enough to be used, young enough to be broken. Or so the slavers thought. But Sassy turned out to be a little different . . . and bided her time to become the fleet captain of a pirate-chasing ship of her own.",
