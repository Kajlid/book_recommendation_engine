Suffering greatly in his imprisonment he is caught unaware when a mystical light sparks within his soul, irrevocably drawing him towards Alhena - a child of the Sinti. But as the light intensifies, darkness seduces. For 329 years, The Blood Countess has roamed the earth, searching for the one that will release her from a never-ending loneliness when she comes upon the camp of death.

But when Alhena perishes in the gas chamber, the light in his soul is severed and The Blood Countess damns him to an eternity of darkness. Until he feels the glowing thread winding it’s way into his dead black heart from his mortal life…",
