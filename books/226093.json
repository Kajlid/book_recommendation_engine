Nature study activities teach subjects such as science, art, math, language arts and geography in ways that get kids excited about learning. They can be done virtually anywhere and can involve all ages of children. Nature provides free and nearly free opportunities in every season for children to learn, grow and explore. This book provides 52 nature study activities, broken up into four seasons, for homeschooling families to do together. Kids can use natural materials to dye homemade play dough, track the length of daylight in the winter, experiment on weeds to see what makes them grow or die, test the pH level of various liquids with purple cabbage water and much more.",
