  "description": "The revelation inside the pages of this book is life transforming.Until God gave me this revelation, I had no idea that Scriptures I had circled even as a child would have special significance in the years to come. After having see Jesus face-to-face at the age of eleven, I knew I wanted to hear His voice again. That is what sparked this amazing search. I learned through this revelation how to hear the voice of God again and again-through His Word. As a little boy who desperately wanted approval, and was accustomed to nothing but rejection, I could very easily have lived my life compromising to gain acceptance. But this revelation has kept me from doing that. Instead, I have sought Divine affirmation - to turn my equity into currency, and my influence into favor. The thing that frightened me most was not that I was inadequate, but that I felt with my whole heart that I was called to manifest the light of God. I realized that staying small would not serve my world. Shrinking to accommodate my critics would not transform the world around me. The words of the prophet Jeremiah cried out to me: \"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you; Before you were born I sanctified you; I ordained you a prophet to the nations.\" May the Spirit of God open your eyes to this revelation! Once you get it, you will refuse to be obsessed with what you're going through; you will be obsessed with what you are going to.",
