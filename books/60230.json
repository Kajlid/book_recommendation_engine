  "description": "When Yulvia awoke from Stasis to find her world destroyed... She did not know what was worse. Was it the mutated beasts roaming the land? The ruthless men raping and killing? Perchance it was the vastly changed environments, that are as strange as they are dangerous, or maybe it was the simple fact that she had awoken alone and her family missing? Or... was it the very one who had awakened her. Their Journey is the story of Vlad and Yulvia as they journey through a post-apocalyptic world in search of Yulvia's family. Together they encounter dangerous mutants, vicious environments, battle ruthless humans, and face even one-another along the way.",
