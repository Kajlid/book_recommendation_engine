  "description": "\"A warm-hearted yet fierce fairy tale.\"―H. G. ParryIn the early 1900s, two sisters must navigate the magic and the dangers of the Fae in this enchanting and cozy historical fantasy about sisterhood and self-discovery.There is no magic on Prospect Hill—or anywhere else, for that matter. But just on the other side of the veil is the world of the Fae. Generations ago, the first farmers on Prospect Hill learned to bargain small trades to make their lives a little easier—a bit of glass to find something lost, a cup of milk for better layers in the chicken coop.Much of that old wisdom was lost as the riverboats gave way to the rail lines and the farmers took work at mills and factories. Alaine Fairborn’s family, however, was always superstitious, and she still hums the rhymes to find a lost shoe and to ensure dry weather on her sister’s wedding day.When Delphine confides her new husband is not the man she thought he was, Alaine will stop at nothing to help her sister escape him. Small bargains buy them time, but a major one is needed. Yet, the price for true freedom may be more than they’re willing to pay.Praise for The Fairy Bargains of Prospect Hill :\"Brimming with folk magic and delightfully sinister hidden worlds. Truly enchanting.”―Leslye Penelope\"A beautifully written tale of feminine power, sisterly devotion, and magic as old as the hills themselves.”―Louisa MorganFor more from Rowenna Miller, check The Unraveled KingdomTornFrayRule",
