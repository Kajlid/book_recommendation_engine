  "description": "SECRETS OF A VIRGIN is a **very** hot erotic HEA novella with two characters I hope you’ll love as much as I do. It’s part of my Austen series, erotic romances loosely inspired by Jane Austen but set in the modern world. Penelope Padgett is a young woman on a mission--seduce billionaire Cole Dawson, the man she has yearned for since she was sixteen. Ten years her senior and a friend of her family’s, Cole has resolutely refused to acknowledge that the winsome teenager with a crush on him has grown into a beautiful and very determined woman. Until, that is, Penelope contrives to bring herself to his attention in a way that shatters even Cole’s iron control and propels them both into a confrontation with their deepest, darkest desires.",
