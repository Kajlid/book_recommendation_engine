  "description": "When the Imperial prison barge Purgeâ temporary home to five hundred of the galaxyâ s most ruthless killers, rebels, scoundrels, and thievesâ breaks down in a distant, uninhabited part of space, its only hope appears to lie with a Star Destroyer found drifting, derelict, and seemingly abandoned. But when a boarding party from the Purge is sent to scavenge for parts, only half of them come backâ bringing with them a horrific disease so lethal that within hours nearly all aboard the Purge die in ways too hideous to imagine.And death is only the beginning. The Purgeâ s half-dozen survivorsâ two teenage brothers, a sadistic captain of the guards, a couple of rogue smugglers, and the chief medical officer, the lone woman on boardâ will do whatever it takes to stay alive. But nothing can prepare them for what lies waiting aboard the Star Destroyer amid its vast creaking emptiness that isnâ t really empty at all. For the dead are soulless, unstoppable, and unspeakably hungry.From the Hardcover edition.",
