  "description": "\"When we are gone, these darkened fields that have held so much sorrowâ€”they will be remembered as glorious.\" With Maria Pike unmasked at last and an ancient terror awakened to ravage the land, Archer's heroes set out on a quest that will ask more of them than they know. Strength, sacrifice, and unheard-of feats of courage are required if they are to break the curse that threatens the land they love. Yet as friendships are broken and allies topple one by one, the men and women of the Western a Territory begin to realize that the greatest threat of all lies not in the curse, but in themselves.",
