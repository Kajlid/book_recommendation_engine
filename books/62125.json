Getting it from a man as mysterious and resolute as Ian was a challenge she never anticipated.Francesca knows there's only one way for them to move forward—to follow Ian to London and show him that she doesn't want him to suffer alone. But when Ian's past and inner torment is revealed, he experiences a nearly unbearable volcanic mix of emotions for the woman who has dared to love him, despite his inner demons. After exposing Francesca to the limits of his anguish, he wonders if he's lost her forever. Can he bend enough to compromise to true intimacy...and something called love?Includes a bonus excerpt of Beth Kery’s Wicked Burn, now available.",
