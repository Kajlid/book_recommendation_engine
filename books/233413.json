A cosmic reimagining of Romeo and Juliet and homage to two literary classics in a compelling novel about fate, love and time travel from an award-winning author.YEAR: 2083. LOCATION: LONDON. MISSION: WAKE ROMEO.It's the end of the world. Literally. Time travel is possible, but only forwards.

But things are far from rosy for Jules. Romeo is in a coma and she's estranged from her friends and family, dealing with the very real fallout of their wild romance. Then a handsome time traveller, Ellis, arrives with an important mission that makes Jules question everything she knows about life and love. Can Jules wake Romeo and rewrite her future?A highly original mashup that delights as it disorients ... and asks what would have happened if two great literary love stories were somehow intertwined.",
