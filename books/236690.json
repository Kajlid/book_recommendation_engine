  "description": "Lana is a monster hunterâ€”she takes bounties to kill the creatures of the night. Her first contract without her mentor takes her to the California mountains, where she's digging up dirt on an ancient Transylvanian lord who may be one of Dracula's grandchildren. While he's trying to buy some beachfront property, she's busy trying to figure out how you kill something that's five hundred years old, and debating whether or not to give in to the flirtations of a strange hunter who may or may not be related to Abraham Van Helsing.  This is a prelude to the full-length novel, #iHunt: Killing Monsters in the Gig Economy.  Content warning: Drug use, violence, sex",
