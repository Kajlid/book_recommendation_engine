  "description": "Now an Amazon TOP 5 Bestseller, Amazon Most Sold, and #1 New Adult & College Romance! It's wrong, but feels so right. For months, I’ve watched her. I know she’s off-limits, but she’s so sweet, so innocent… and so sexy that she haunts my dreams. Maggie doesn’t belong in this world, this seedy underbelly of the city. But there she is, my Angel with her wide eyes behind her nerdy glasses. So, when she needs help, I’m the only one who can protect her. It didn’t even take a single kiss for me to fall in love with her. I know I shouldn’t—a man like me doesn’t deserve an Angel. I’ll hurt her, break her… ruin her. Still, I can’t help myself. She’s going to regret this later, regret me and probably even hate me. But I’m a selfish man, and if she wants this now, I’ll give it to her. I’ll give her everything.",
