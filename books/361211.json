  "description": "Meet Discord Knight. All she wanted was to die and swap her dark past for eternal bliss, but Fate had other plans. Those plans mark Discord's soul for repatriation and she wakes up dead, in the Heavens, and seconded to an elite department created to remove the vilest of criminals on Earth. Discord embraces her new position, tracking one man in particular ~ the one who delivered her soul to the Heavens in the first place. Joining her are Elle and Lucy (supreme rulers of Heaven and Hell), and their separate staff. In a modern day setting of overworked and overstressed offices, our narrator, Cupid, escorts us venomous betrayal, crime tsunamis, mountainous paperwork backlogs, and an IT system testing all to breaking point. Add to that, an attraction between Elle and Discord, a scheming and vitriolic Amazon Council set on overthrowing Elle, and a bored Lucy overcoming her ADD by trying to cheat a win in the biannual Soul Count that dictates control of Earth for the next six months. Heaven's Hell explores the intertwining nature of salvation and damnation, where good people do bad deeds for the right reasons and bad people do good deeds for the wrong ones",
