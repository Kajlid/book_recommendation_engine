  "description": "The king of Vitoria is dead, leaving only a squabbling council of noblemen to rule. Now, the vicious Zhedian horde gathers, an uncountable swarm of warriors and Hell-spawned creatures of nightmare. Under the rule of the cruel King Mortegrim, the dark hosts march on Vitoria’s stronghold city of Knevermoore. For Gedrick, past his prime and days of valor, the coming war brings summons from Lord Rendell of Knevermoore, brother of his dead wife and no friend of the aging warrior. Gedrick thought his battles finished, but now the bloody horn is sounding once more. He cannot ignore the call. He is Gedrick, the Soulcutter, champion of Vitoria, wielder of the demon spear. One last time, the Dark Spearman marches to war. For Fel, denied his dreams of following in the footsteps of his heroic father by an impure bloodline, the coming war means nothing but the destruction of a nobility he despises. That all changes when fate crosses his path with Avera, a warrior maiden pursued by demonic creatures as she searches for a secret temple of mystics to aid her father, the Lord of Knevermoore, against King Mortegrim’s host. Fel is no noble, no hero like his dead father, but fate seems to have other ideas.",
