  "title": "The Business of Pleasure",
  "description": "An erotic novel by best-selling Black Lace author, Justine Elyot. If one call could set you on a trail to the heart of your darkest fantasy, would you make it? Charlotte does, and her bold decision propels her into a world where no desire is too outrageous, decadent or extravagant to be satisfied, for a price. Her own fantasy life merges with reality when she is hired to work for the shadowy organisation she first encountered as a client. She organises an array of wild set pieces involving banquets, film productions, mansions full of pleasure slaves, as well as thoroughly researching those requests that chime with her own kinky tastes. Two men, one woman, and every sexual fantasy imaginable, these are the ingredients that make up the business of pleasure. Praise for Justine ‘It's a fruity, frisky fun fest that has something for most tastes, and will get you horny in no time’ Lucy Felthouse on On Demand ‘Justine Elyot’s story-telling is controlled, measured and manages to balance a practical British realism with enough erotic imagination to make the story sing’ Ashley Lister, Erotica Readers and Writers Association",
