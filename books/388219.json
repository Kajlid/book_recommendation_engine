  "description": "Bigger bank accounts. Better clothes. More toys. Bigger, better, more is how the world determines who's special and who's not. It's a message you and your kids are hearing every day. But it's not God's message. God's truth is simple and It's not what you have, it's whose you are . And this is a truth that the lovable Wemmick Punchinello hears again at the knee of Eli, his creator. And it is a message to share with the ones you love.",
