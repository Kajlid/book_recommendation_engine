  "description": "Winner of a \"Discovery\"/The Nation AwardWinner of the 1999 PEN/Joyce Osterweil Award for PoetrySome Ether is one of the more remarkable debut collections of poetry to appear in America in recent memory. As Mark Doty has noted, \"these poems are more than testimony; in lyrics of ringing clarity and strange precision, Flynn conjures a will to survive, the buoyant motion toward love which is sometimes all that saves us. Some Ether resonates in the imagination long after the final poem; this is a startling, moving debut.\"",
