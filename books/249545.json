  "description": "It’s been over three decades since James and Sophie North’s parents saw their family savagely torn apart by the cruel actions of one malicious man. Both of them lost a vital piece of themselves that night so long ago. Pete was left a shadow of his former self, having failed to protect his only love. Miranda persevered for the sake of their children, but her grief remained.Now, more than thirty years later, the child cruelly ripped from their arms has suddenly resurfaced—and all the love in the world may not be enough to reconcile their tragic pasts. For even as Pete and Miranda are still reeling from the knowledge of their newfound son, the powerful malevolence of their old enemy is already reaching out to destroy them again…this time from beyond the grave.",
