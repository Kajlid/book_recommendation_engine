  "title": "Play Time!",
  "description": "A third pocket-sized collection of play-themed Simon's Cat cartoons selected from the first three Simon's Cat books. In full colour (on compatible devices) and featuring a selection of brand new cartoons, Simon's Cat is back, smaller, cheaper and cuter, but still up to his usual tricks.NB: Although the cover states 'Simon's Cat' before the 'Play Time!' title, the title page of the book simply states 'Play Time!' and that is therefore how it is catalogued.",
