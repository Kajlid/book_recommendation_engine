  "description": "Audrey Valdez didn’t mean to fall for Will Anders. He isn’t her type. At all. But his goofy smile, Star Wars quotes and athletic body make it impossible. She's lived so long in the darkness and Will is like the sun. He makes her laugh more than she has in years and cares for her more than her own family.  But there are things about Audrey that Will doesn't know, things he can't know. She tries to push him away, but he just ends up getting closer to her, and to her secret. Is the risk of losing him forever worth the chance a being with the only person she's ever loved who has loved her back?",
