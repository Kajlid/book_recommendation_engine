  "description": "'Whether you feel the victim or the offender, you might, in fact, be a little of both.' Once upon a time, there was a woman called Beth Chambers. She wasn't a princess, by any stretch of the imagination, nor did she live in a fairytale kingdom far far away. What she did have was a broken relationship, a broken spirit, and a shattered view of life. After four years in a destructive relationship, Beth decides enough is enough. Then she meets Amy Fletcher, the woman who has it all . the woman whom she believes would never want more than friendship. But what she fails to realise is that everything is relative, and there is definitely two sides to every story.",
