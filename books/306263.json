  "description": "She told him goodbye six years ago, and she meant it.Could someone please tell her heart that?Ingrid had a plan that if she ever saw Tyson again—something she thought about way, way too often—she’d simply turn around and walk away. Smooth, sophisticated, polished.He was the one who’d messed up, so she could add righteous to her list.Yeah, that would feel good.But then Ingrid never imagined meeting him at an isolated Alaskan resort, one she couldn’t escape from quite so easily. Or, that running away would mean giving up a shot at her dream job.No, she would endure every uncomfortable and awkward situation with her ex so that she could have the satisfaction of winning the job for herself.If only he’d stop looking at her in that way that makes her smooth, sophisticated, righteous knees go weak. And making her laugh, like he always did, which is totally not fair.But that’s okay. She can resist him for four days. As long as the unpredictable Alaska weather holds, she’ll leave this island with her dignity intact, if not her heart.A sweet romantic comedy set in Alaska, with snow, an isolated resort, a couple who messed it up the first time around, and, if they’re very lucky, a second chance at romance.
