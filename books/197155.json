  "description": "Shane Bradford has been put on a mandatory two-week vacation from his job. He’s also been handed a gift list from his ultra-controlling mother that includes visiting a tea shop that contains more than just flavorful teas. The substitute storeowner intrigues Shane, but finishing the shopping list has to come before finding out if his vacation could end up being more than sitting and staring at the Christmas tree in his condo. Baris Ardor didn’t expect his last customer of the holiday season to be the one that was hotter than the boiling water he used to make tea for his mother’s customers. But after an awkward meeting and accidentally keeping Shane’s shopping list, can Baris find him and make a better impression? When Shane finds out that Baris is just a temporary visitor to the city, will his vacation become something more permanent? Or will he let the one man who warmed his Grinchy-heart just walk away?",
