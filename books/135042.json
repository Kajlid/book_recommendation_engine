  "description": "Flawed characters. Enemies to lovers. Banter, hell yes, all the banter.Grief coils in my stomach like a saw-scaled aggressive, lethal, terrifying. Grief just might kill me.But I’m not dead. Teddy is.It’s months before I can really bring myself to talk to anyone, months before I start to feel like I didn’t die right there in the car beside my kid brother.Barrett, probably the most persistent person I’ve ever met, drags me back to the land of the living.It hurts.But Avery, his twin sister, without a doubt the most annoying person I’ve ever met, might just be worth living for.If she doesn't kill me first.Passion for music fuels this series about a \nband of misfits\n. Wonderwall brings together a cast of characters you can’t help but love (and occasionally love to hate).Is this a comedy or tragedy? Much as in life, the answer is both. Witty, poignant, irreverent, Wonderwall will charm your socks off.*The included playlist contains all-time favorites from the worlds of pop punk, grunge, and ska rock.",
