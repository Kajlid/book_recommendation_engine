It was not appropriate for the sheriff’s deputy to be lusting after the mysterious stranger in town or the man’s brother, especially not when she was dating the sexiest man in the whole county, Cal Sanders.Confused, embarrassed, and completely unnerved by her out-of-control libido and nightly dreams of ménage a quatre, Louise tries to avoid all three men. `But that might prove to be a fatal mistake. Aiden and Zeb have been tracking a rogue werewolf, but when they finally manage to corner the criminal in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere, the local sheriff’s deputy is caught in the melee. `Injured and bleeding, the only way to save her life is by making her one of them.

There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings. Paranormal 37,084 words** A Siren Erotic Romance **",
