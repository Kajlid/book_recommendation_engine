  "description": "In the little, invisible town of Waresville nothing is as it seems. This place has been thriving off death and destruction since the beginning, and now that a new and strangely furry biker gang has come to town, no one doubts that the revenue is about to start flowing again. When the town finds the first partially eaten body, you can almost hear the cheers and drinking songs all the way to the border. Finally, they won’t just have to make due with witches and ghosts. Some real supernatural talent has come to Waresville, and things are about to get hairy.  Yes, everyone in Waresville is rejoicing, except a foxy witch who owns the local disco skate. Amateur sleuth by day and disco queen by night, Harper “Foxxy” Beck usually heralds the arrival of a new mystery for her to sink her teeth into. Unfortunately, with a new addition to the household she shares with handsome detective Wyatt Bennett and his son, Cooper, this case hits a little too close to home. Soon, Harper will have to decide who to trust and if she can trust anyone at all. The wrong choice could lead to an early grave for herself, the innocent life depending on her, and her relationship with Detective Bennett. All in all, this could be Foxxy’s most challenging ride yet.  Novella (approx. 40,000 words). Seventh Volume of the Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck Mystery Series. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
