  "description": "I’m an ex-Navy SEAL. A wounded warrior with a hard-ass exterior and a checkered past to match. All I care about is my outdoor survival business—teaching others the skills they need to survive in the face of danger.  But fate has a wicked sense of humor.  From out of nowhere this brunette-beauty with the easy smile and doe-eyes walks into my life…and it’s not the first time.  Summer doesn’t remember me. But she’s the one I can’t forget.  I know that she’s in danger, and I’ll gladly give in to every protective instinct I have when it comes to keeping her safe.  There’s a reason fate sent her my way for a second time.  Only, this time…I won’t fail her.  Not again.",
