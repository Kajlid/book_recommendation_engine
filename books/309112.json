  "description": "He’s a grumpy silver fox who’s about to become a grandfather, and she’s the sunshiny young midwife who wants babies of her own…Owen Kincaid knows how hard it is to have a kid when you’re still a kid yourself, and eighteen years after the fact, the paramedic watching his daughter go through the same thing. The last thing she needs is him falling for the new woman in town—her midwife.Kerry Humphrey finds her new client’s father...unsettling. He's tall and brooding and always there, hovering in the background of appointments. And then there's the crackle of off-limits chemistry every time they’re alone. She hates that, too, but Pine Harbour is a tiny place, and avoiding the young grandfather-to-be in a town of six hundred people and a single Main Street proves impossible.Everything about their attraction is ill-fated. But it won't go away.",
