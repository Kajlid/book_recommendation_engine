  "description": "Murder was the last thing Gen and Cammie wanted or needed in their lives. They’d left the complications of work and city life. Marriage had even left them—Gen was divorced and Cammie was widowed—so coming back to the old house on the marsh at Lafayette Beach was supposed to be a new start in a new life. But a dead body found nearby, a threat to a local community, and something destroying the marsh itself drew the sisters into a search for the source of the darkness. Under the ancient oaks dripping with moss, in the sunny channels of the tidal creek, and at home in the old house, the sisters try to remake their own lives, but the clouds of danger are closing in.",
