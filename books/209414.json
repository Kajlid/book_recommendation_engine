  "description": "THEY SHOULD HAVE LET HIM REST IN PEACE. Just as Rene Faulk starts to get used to the idea that his life is doomed to be as average and boring as suburban life can be, his son's best friend is stabbed in front of the whole class. When the boy falls into a near catatonic state no medical expert can explain, Faulk finds himself falling into the old habit of following long dormant instincts. Those instincts lead him to a fast growing, new age religious movement claiming they alone have the power to heal the boy. As Faulk digs deeper, as the secrets behind the facade of the Seven Day Resurrection Ministry come to light, the shadowy leader of the group learns that he isn't the only one with a violent, hidden past. Intrigue and violence collide across exotic locales in this suspenseful thriller that proves not everyone is who they pretend to be, and some men are better left dead.",
