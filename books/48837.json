No wonder, as every night she sucks the blood of assorted men. She is a vampire and wants her grandchild to follow the family tradition.Her granddaughter, Jerne, has just returned to Budapest after a posh education at the English college Winterwood. Reincarnations of the Brontë sisters taught her to write fairy tales. Jerne writes children's books, but they are considered too bloody to be published. Grandmother is adamant: Jerne will have to give up her literary ambitions and become a vampire. In the meantime, she takes an undemanding job as an editor. But the married couple who run the publishing house behave more and more suspiciously.This is a story of a death and the afterlife told by a witty and irresistible narrator. It is the first Budapest vampire story from the home country of Béla Lugosi.",
