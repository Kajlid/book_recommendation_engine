  "description": "Love, Freedom, and Aloneness is a classic Osho text that is newly fresh and pertinent to today's complex world where freedom and connecting are more important and more fraught than ever before.We are striving for both freedom and connection. However, until we learn to live with that freedom, and learn to live by ourselves and with ourselves, we are denying ourselves the possibility of finding love and happiness with someone else. Osho shows us that love can only happen through freedom and in conjunction with a deep respect for ourselves and the other. Is it possible to be alone and not lonely? Where are the boundaries that define “lust” versus “love”...and can lust ever grow into love?In Love, Freedom, and Aloneness you will find unique, radical, and intelligent perspectives on these and other essential questions. In our quickly-changing world, free of out-of-date morality, we have a golden opportunity to redefine and revitalize the very foundations of our lives. We have the chance to start afresh with ourselves, our relationships to others, and to find fulfillment and success for the individual and for society as a whole.",
