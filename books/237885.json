  "title": "DAWN - Poems & Thoughts",
  "description": "Writing a poem is like sailing deep oceans at the mercy of shifting winds and streams that carry uncountable words, some emanating from the still, unseen deep, others from the ever changing emotions that flutter and sometimes rage at the surface. It may also happen that a poem wants to write itself, for poems can have feelings and secrets of their own that we never imagined, and are only revealed when one begins to write. The extra- ordinary discovery that it implies, is what makes the adventure of writing poetry the more exciting and worthwhile. Unique. To write what I sometimes would like to set free and express, I am never able to do completely. Therefore, I often need to hear what a poem wants to say. And that is a way of learning about myself too. That part that I left lonely and unnoticed for a long time while, incomplete, I chose my way through life. Within my limitations, I wrote this book with deep respect and admiration for the art of many great classical and modern poets, and sympathy for all those that have courage to expose their feelings. The book reveals some feelings of mine and a few opinions. It is a book about emotions, love, joy and sorrow, beliefs, and thoughts on life. About the world we live in, the Universe from where we came, and to where we will return one day. It is a book about lions too, birds, rain, the sun and the sea. It is about living creatures and stones. And Gods, time, existence and the naive hope of an eternal restart. It starts at Dawn.",
