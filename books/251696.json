  "description": "The stunning conclusion to the All In Duet... In Vegas, there was one man who was off limits. One man... and I fell for him. I knew there were risks. Still, I played the game. When Dario Capece called, I answered. When he beckoned, I came. When he broke all my rules, I looked the other way. I knew there were risks. I just never realized they included death. Note: This book should be read after Even Money (available now).",
