These poems scan the shifting horizons of our world, all the while swerving elastically through the multitude of selves that live inside our memories and longings--\"all those me's that wish to be set free at dawn.\" The work of these poems is a counterweight to the work of the world. It wants to deepen the mystery we are to ourselves, stretching toward acceptance and tenderness in ways that are hard-won and true, even if fleeting.",
