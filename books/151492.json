Each flower becomes a gift, and whether the gift is noticed or ignored, both giver and recipient are transformed by their encounter. \"Written\" by award-winning poet JonArno Lawson and brought to life by illustrator Sydney Smith, Sidewalk Flowers is an ode to the importance of small things, small people, and small gestures.",
