  "description": "It’s time for bed and Mole is feeling very sleepy. But where is his bed? Mole climbs into Elephant’s lumpy bed, Mouse’s squeaky bed, and Kangaroo’s bouncy bed, but none of them feels quite right. Children can slide Mole through the slot in each picture and help him find his very own cozy bed. This is the perfect story for sharing at bedtime.",
