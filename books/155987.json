  "description": "by Herriman, Ware, & BlackbeardGeorge Herriman integrated full spectacular color into Krazy Kat in June, 1935. The gorgeous evolution continues in this second color volume, which includes the Sunday strips from all of 1937 and 1938. The color format opens the floodgates for a massive amount of spectacular rare color art from series editor Bill Blackbeard and designer Chris Ware's files. Most of these strips in this volume have not seen print since originally running in Hearst newspapers over 70 years ago. Never-before-seen Herriman memorabilia is included as a bonus!",
