Justin Hardy is a normal, small town guy trying to build a career as a photographer. Mike Simpson is a world class mountaineer looking for adventure, romance, and his next big climb. When they join forces and set their sights on Mars' highest mountain, Olympus Mons, they get a lot more adventure than they bargain for. Mountain disasters, brawls in orbit, radiation storms, and alien geology challenge the team of four as they race to reach their summit ahead of a team of Russians set on bagging the first ascent before them. But surprises await beneath the mountain that make a simple first ascent, even the biggest in history, seem secondary.Science fiction and Mountain tale merge in this grand adventure that drinks, fights and climbs it's way across three worlds.",
