  "description": "Laos, 1961. The Communist Pathet Lao threatens a Laos takeover with Russian military support. Newly elected US President John F. Kennedy contemplates military intervention in the small Southeast Asia country. Aware that military confrontation could escalate into nuclear war, Kennedy elects to fight a covert war using CIA surrogate assets.The intelligence agency chooses as its surrogates for the war Meo tribesmen and college-age US Forest Service firefighters, smokejumpers without military experience.For newly-recruited smokejumpers Thanasis, Charlie, and Dog, the CIA's offer brings excitement, damn good money, and good times at Lulu's in Vientiane. It's a sweet adventure for the three young men until they realize the CIA is willing to sacrifice both smokejumpers and Meo to control Laos.Based on battles and events recalled by surviving smokejumpers, \"Kickers\" involves readers in a thirteen-year secret war most Americans don't know was fought. Similar in tone to Philip Caputo's \"A Rumor of War,\" Patrick Lee's story of betrayal and covert ops sets a new standard for Cold War novels.",
