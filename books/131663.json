  "description": "In Glory, Kansas, a fairy-tale wedding has local tongues wagging. But through this false engagement, can a wounded warrior and the woman he's protecting find true love? Byron Hawkins doesn't want to be responsible for anyone ever again. The former Black Ops soldier is better at taking lives than saving them. But on mission in Tunisia to deliver a package to safety, Hawk is dismayed to find that the precious cargo is actually a hostage rescue, and that his orders are to take Princess Demara Petrakis back to US soil and hide her in plain sightâ€”as his newlywed wife. Back in Hawk's hometown of Glory, Kansas, petite, fierce Demara keeps surprising him; she may be royalty, but she's fully trained in martial arts and will sacrifice anything for her country. As the town rallies around the returning hero and his bride, he's finding that it's way too easy to play the part, and after the hell he has seen, that terrifies him. Hawk didn't want another life to save, but the passionate beauty he's sworn to protect might just turn the tables and save him, instead.",
