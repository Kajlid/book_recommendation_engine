  "title": "Inexhaustible Life of Chaos: Angst & Anger",
  "description": "This is a book of poetry about anger, contempt, sarcasm and rage. It's also about depression, loss, the angst of love. In Inexhaustible Life of Chaos, Angst & Anger, we see how childhood trauma has informed the author's poems. They are beset with fears of abandonment, loss of interpersonal connections, and despair over the loss of love.Angst is full of sorrow, regret and loss. The emotions in the poems are visceral and potent. Reflecting on numerous relationships gone awry, the author delivers feelings of loss and broken love with intensity and vigor. In Anger, part II of the anthology, the author portrays the people who hurt him the most with biting and sarcastic language. He pulls no punches as he lashes out at perceived injustices, mis-treatment, and betrayals. Sometimes rhyming and sometimes writing in the free-verse style, the author delivers in Inexhaustible Life of Angst & Anger, a tour de force of raw, in your face emotion and feelings that seem to bleed on the very pages they are portrayed on.",
