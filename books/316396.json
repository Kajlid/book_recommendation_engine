  "title": "A Crowe's Song",
  "description": "Some secrets can’t stay buried forever... A dusty old journal led me to a forgotten town full of drowned love, sunken promises, and a stranger with familiar eyes and a rumbly voice that made my soul beg for more.  Drew’s dark eyes and warm, soft lips were like a memory of a place I’d never visited. They made me believe that our meeting had been set in the stars, as if Fate had schemed with Destiny and devised this elaborate plot to bring us together. With each day I spent at Black Bird Resort, I learned more of Drew’s history. And the more I learned, the more I questioned. Until I realized just how much the past could tear us apart.  I may not have been prepared for the journey fate had led me on, but no one was prepared for the reason why.",
