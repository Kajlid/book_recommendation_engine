  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Iggy likes his panties…a little too much. His favorite types are the ones with slits on the back, like the one he’s wearing that’s blue with pink hearts.He also likes his big brothers who are nineteen-year-old triplets, but he likes them in a way most people don’t like their own brothers. They haven’t always been super close, maybe a little, but definitely not in the way he’d like to them to be.However, all that’s about to change the moment he walks into his room.And he may have to keep his panties on for the ride of his life.",
