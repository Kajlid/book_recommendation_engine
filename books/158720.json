  "description": "Early in the Morning of 28 Juna 1940, Adolf Hitler visited Paris for the first and only time in his life. Looking down on the city from the heights of Montmartre, he congratulated the city for not having destroyed it, as he had Warsaw. His tour lasted only three hours.But his army and bureaucrats stay for 1500 nights in France's capital. What was it like to live in a familiar city that had suddenly, and seemingly without end, become sinister?Historical scholar and critic Ronald Rosbottom takas us through the experiences of those who lived, worked and hid in Paris during this traumatic period. He also gives us a sense what it was like to be posted there as a German soldier, bureaucrat or diplomat.",
