  "description": "There is conflict in the whanau. The young man, Te Rua, holds a \"secret for life, the one to die with.\" But he realizes that if he is to acknowledge and claim his daughter, the secret will have to be told.\"The Sisters\" are threatening to drag the whanau through the courts. But why? What is really going on?Meanwhile, wider events are encroaching. To this East Coast site visitors will arrive in numbers, wanting to be among the first in the world to see the new millennium sunrise. There are plans to be put into action, there's money to be made, and there's high drama as the millennium turns....Like Patricia Grace's award-winning novel Potiki before it, Dogside Story is set in a rural Maori coastal community. The power of the land, the strength of the whanau, are life-preserving forces. This rich and dramatic novel, threaded with humor, by one of New Zealand's finest writers presents a powerful picture of Maori in modern times.",
