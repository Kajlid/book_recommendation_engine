  "description": "Mudville is Casey at the Bat turned on its ear, seen through the sulfurous light of hellfire. Its the bottom of the ninth, the Mudville Nine are down 4-2 with two outs as Casey steps to the plate. And what follows is an apocalyptic retelling of an American folk tale. A story of violence through generations at the heart of the American dream, from the 19th century to the present day--of a people shaped by brutality, and the \"better angels of our nature\" becoming the killer-devils who at any moment threaten to destroy us.",
