  "description": "A sexy, new brother's best friend romance from USA Today bestselling author Alexa Padgett.He’s my brother’s childhood friend. I’m pregnant with another man’s baby. What a time to fall in love… Coming home seemed like a good idea at the time. My ex-fiancé split, I was almost done with my master’s degree, and I was already working at the family architecture firm. When I move in next door to pediatrician Ryder Mackay, I’m not expecting the connection—or the passion in his eyes that I feel deep in my soul. He’s the best doctor for my baby, but he’s not the guy I need. Still, the way Ryder looks snuggling my puppy—and my infant daughter—to his rock-hard chest makes me wish this sexy, smart, compassionate man was mine. Maybe, it’s pregnancy hormones. Or...maybe this magnetic pull is forever.",
