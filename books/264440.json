When sexy Texas rancher Beth Harman hires strong, tan, and ruggedly handsome Jo Merrick to build a room onto her remote cabin they both know there's trouble ahead. Three years after the death of her beloved partner, Jo tries to resist Beth in order to honor her commitment to the past. As Beth and her daughter Tracy begin to chip away at the walls Jo has built around her heart, she begins to believe that she could find love again. But Beth's past, too, threatens this new passion: when Jo learns Beth's terrible secret -- and discovers that Beth has a lover -- she tries to protect her heart and walk away. Were it not for the series of dramatic events that follow, and Beth's commitment to their fledgling relationship, Jo might never again make room for love.",
