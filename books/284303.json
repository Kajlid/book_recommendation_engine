  "title": "The Windsome Tree: A Ghost Story",
  "description": "Mercy Amoretto, a grieving mother of four who lost her youngest child to leukemia, finds an old rope and a tire in her garage and, in a fanciful moment, creates a tire swing. Unknown to her, the rope, the tire, and the tree share a violent history. Once connected, that history is unleashed in the form of two child spirits from decades past. While on the swing, Mercy hears cryptic messages from the spirits and believes the voices are key to finding her dead daughter. Hope turns to horror when two of her children begin to taunt her in torturous ways, and when they go missing, all eyes turn to Mercy. Sheâ€™s convinced the ghosts are to blame, but how can anyone believe her when only she hears the voices?",
