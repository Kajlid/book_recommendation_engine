  "description": "**WARNING: CONTAINS ADULT LANGUAGE, QUESTIONABLE CONTENT, AND SIDE SPLITTING SHENANIGANS**On the outside, Larry appears to be an average, ordinary guy. Wife, two kids, house in the 'burbs, office job, etc. But...nothing could be further from the truth. He may appear harmless--minding his own business and treating everyone with professional courtesy--but he's actually dreaming up and acting out elaborate plots of revenge for every single 'darwin dodger' he encounters on a daily basis. He may have no recourse in the real world, but in his mind nothing is off limits. So strap on a diaper (so as to not soil your pristine panties) and hop on this roller coaster of hilarity or you may just find yourself on the receiving end of some awkward hip thrusts and middle digit tomfoolery.",
