  "description": "In the wonderful tradition of Elizabeth Jane Howard, \"War Story\" tells an extraordinarily authentic tale of both rationing and riches during the war years and at the same time unfolds a mesmerizing and unforgettable love story. After war breaks out in 1939, Dulcimer Hall, deep in rural England, is a haven of tranquility in a world rocked by conflict. The Dulcimer children run amok in the rambling grounds, blissfully unaware of the threat of invasion and also unaware of the dramas developing in the lives of the sophisticated adults around them. Antonia is a vivacious yet shallow widow in search of a new husband; Dart is a dashing, sometimes reckless war hero; and David is a skilled American pilot determined to join the RAF. Into this charmed circle comes Maggie Dunlop, a Scottish girl taken on as a nursemaid. The daughter of the gamekeeper in a Highland glen, Maggie's previous life has been nothing but hardship. Soon she's thriving in her new post, adored by the children, and well liked by both staff and family. Little does she know that her popularity is sowing dangerous seeds of jealousy, or that innocent feelings of affection can grow into a deep yet impossible love. With warmth and humor Sara Hely brings to life a rich cast of characters and an era filled with life-and-death drama, outstanding courage, and hope.",
