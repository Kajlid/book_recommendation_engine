  "description": "Princess Bess has loads of clothes  made with satin, snaps, and bows.  And she changes them all day,  for her lessons and ballet.  But if a certain truth be told,  her favorite clothes are much less bold.  She carefully keeps them out of sight  until it's time for bed at night.  Then in her room without a care,  she plays in what she loves to wear.",
