  "title": "Life after Life: A Story about Real-life Transformations",
  "description": "This book is a guide to and through life or at least it could be, if you like. It is intended for all who love life and dare to live or aspire to a better existence! For some people the brain is only an organ of minor importance, as an ancient philosopher once said. Therefore, I would like to dedicate the following narrative or short story to all who acknowledge the importance of the human mind, together with its positive and beneficial demonstrations in people's actions, senses and emotions.",
