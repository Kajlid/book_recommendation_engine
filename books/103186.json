Things seem to be going well as they grow into the roles of their unconventional D/s relationship, each learning the give and take of power and pain, accepting and giving love unconditionally, and respecting each other's wants, desires and need for control.But Isa has been fighting with the demons of her past. Recurring nightmares have begun to plague her and fear of the future overwhelms her on a daily basis. Her desire for control and independence prevent her from sharing her deepest fears with the man she loves, threatening to drive a wedge between the couple. With gentle yet stern prodding from her cherished Dom, Isa confides in Dylan and their bond grows deeper. But their kinky fairy tale existence is all too good to be true when Isabel's father sets forth a chain of events that will test their love and loyalty for each other, and Isa is forced to decide which is more important - Dylan's life or her happily ever after.",
