  "description": "Heart pounding, she woke abruptly. It is still dark. Her mind cleared- it is always dark now. Within a heartbeat, an accident changed Teresa’s life, took her sight, and left her scarred.  Red is a typical German shepherd, well, except for the whole talking-in-Teresa’s-head thing. He’s sassy and opinionated, and pretty handsome, even if he does say so himself.  If a smart-alec dog isn’t enough, Sebastian and his friend David came to town and both have set their sights on Teresa. Neither of the sexy guys are above using military tactics to secure their target- and so begins the Siege. And, don’t forget to consider the implications of a talking dog… the police department certainly has. ********************* This SPECIAL EDITION contains some adult situations and mild swearing, but not too much because the dog repeats everything. If it were a movie it would probably be rated as PG-13. Storyline and protagonist ages are changed from original version.",
