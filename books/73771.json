  "description": "Stacey Morgan held the rare object in her hand, and she knew that this old silver dollar could lead her to big money, a shopping spree, a better life. But when she takes her coin to a major convention, she doesn't know where to turn. That's when Jacob Grant stepped in. A rare coin expert, he examined her coin and informed her that her dollar is a previously unknown coin--a dollar that collectors would pay millions to own. But why is he so secretive? Stacey wants to spend time with Jacob, but his refusal to discuss his personal life makes her wonder what he's hiding. Then, unexpectedly, she discovers his secret...he is a football player for the Chicago Clout.",
