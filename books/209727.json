  "description": "Operating out of Henry, Michigan, a military sanctioned capture and kill division hunts vampires and werewolves, and any human who dares become one. They don't care whether it's by accident or on purpose. Their only concern is how long it'll take to be rid of their target.  When Erin Thompson finds herself at the focal point of their latest hunt, she has to decide if she wants to fight back. She didn't ask to become a vampire, nor does she have the slightest clue as to who turned her into one, but with the help of a werewolf pack, Erin finds a coven willing to take her in. Willing to train her, and teach her what it means to be an immortal creature.  It's a task far from easy, and Erin often finds herself wavering between accepting her new life and feeling severely unprepared, but when the division takes a secondhand approach and starts to play dirty, Erin's own feelings cease to matter. She has to swallow her fears and take a stand. Otherwise, her life won't be the only one lost.",
