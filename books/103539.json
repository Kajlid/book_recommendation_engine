  "description": "Nikolai Petrovic is a man of refinement. He collects fine art, enjoys gourmet cuisine, and trains boutique sex slaves for some of the wealthiest-and most morally dubious-men and women in the world. Charged by a wealthy client to buy a man to train but not break-to shape into a skilled, obedient slave who will yield with hatred rather than love in his eyes-Nikolai finds the perfect raw material in Mathias Carmichael. But there's a problem: he was auctioned off in a lot with his beautiful younger brother.Douglas Carmichael is a lovely, trainable thing, but Nikolai never takes on more than one slave at a time. As a master trainer who's never once failed in his task, he knows he's up to the challenge, but it will take formidable skill and planning to mold these drastically different brothers into their best selves. And in order to make them obedient to Nikolai and their future masters above all others, he'll first have to break their greatest loyalty of all: their dedication to each other.This collection contains:The Flesh Cartel #3: ChoicesThe Flesh Cartel #4: ConsequencesThe Flesh Cartel #5: Wins and LossesThe Flesh Cartel #6: BrotherhoodWarnings: explicit violence, non-consent",
