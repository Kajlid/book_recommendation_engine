  "description": "TAMING SAMANTHA: Sea Island Wolves 2Samantha Hark is running from one werewolf when she ends up in the arms of two. Can she overcome her fears and insecurities to trust in the love they offer her or will her time run out as her past closes in with deadly intent? JD and Caleb McBane aren't about to let anything or anyone stop them from claiming their mate, even if that person is Samantha herself. Their mating musk may render their feisty mate pliant to their commands, but when it wears off, Samantha is back in fighting mode. Can JD and Caleb tame Samantha before her enemies strike the killing blow? *** \"I love werewolf stories and menages, so I combined the two! What I most loved about this story is the concept of the mating musk. It acts as the ultimate aphrodisiac. While it may render Samantha pliant to the commands of her two Alpha mates, it doesn't take away from her feisty nature!\" ~ Jenny ~",
