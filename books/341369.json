  "title": "David's Dilemma",
  "description": "(Gay / Contemporary) When David's father moves in, David loses more than his study. He loses his life. His father has Alzheimer's and each day is a struggle for both of them. His father's blunt, bigoted attitudes about David's lifestyle, friends and neighbors pushes David out of his circle of support and into a world of loneliness, repeated conversations, and the fear that his father will wander off or burn down the house while David's at work. With David's life in turmoil, now is not the right time to meet a man. And definitely not the time to try to have a romantic relationship. But when his father does wander off, David turns to the local police for help, and he meets Detective Travis Hart. Travis's life is not much better. Just coming off a nasty break up with his much younger lover, Travis struggles with his attraction to David. A rebound romance is not what Travis is looking for; he wants commitment and forever. Both men realize what they really need at this point in their lives is not a lover, but a best friend. Through phone calls, they begin a friendship and share the moments in their days, David's coping with his father and Travis's struggle with his job as a cop. But as their friendship and attraction turns into the love, David's father spirals deeper into a disease that robs him of memory and replaces it with fear and delusions, until the situation becomes something that neither David or Travis ever expected...",
