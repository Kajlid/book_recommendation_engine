  "description": "Lillian Cauldwell has written an imaginative, multi-cultural, adventurous mystery with a riveting twist. The young and inquisitive heroine, Anna-Mae, along with her brother Malcom and their best friend Raul want to change the status quo at school and so they stir the pot with their curious antics and with grandmother's sage advice. In her endless quest to be understood, Anna-Mae teaches us courage, acceptance and resolve through her paranormal interactions with a mysterious ghost with a message. This coming of age story allows us to understand how fear and struggle with school friends are resolved by tapping into the available energy of supernatural forces. Lillian breathes life into this heartfelt mystery through her creativity and intelligent metaphors. It fills up our senses and guides us through an emotional roller coaster that we cannot ignore. If Harry Potter read this book he would want to take a class from Anna-Mae. --Anna Maria Prezio, Ph.D., Author of \"Confessions of a Feng Shui Ghost-Buster\"",
