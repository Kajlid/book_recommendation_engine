  "description": "Thrust into a reality that should be myth, Honor does what she has to do to survive. Some things are easy to say goodbye to. Others things, like her very being, are not so easy to let go of. And when she does, what then? What will she become? As Honor fights to remain unaltered when everything around her, including her, has been, she is met with adversaries and champions. Ryder, Christian, Nealon—they all have a goal. Only Honor doesn’t know if their goals coincide with hers...or Superior August’s and the UDK society. One thing she does know: the world isn’t big enough for all of them.",
