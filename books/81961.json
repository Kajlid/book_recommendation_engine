Except he's stuck in an airport waiting for his childhood friend. Maybe a quick lunch, a fast game of catch up, and he'll be out the door. Until a goddess steps off the plane and he's left breathless and eager to change his plans. In Key West for a conference, Alexa Westlake can't wait to see Ty again and prove once and for all her silly girlhood crush is just that, a crush. But when she finally sees him, all those old feelings come rushing back, combined with a woman's needs that leave her trembling with desire.A few days is all they have, but will it be enough for Lexa to finally put her fantasy hero in the past or will she permanently succumb to Jagger's moves?",
