  "description": "A story of bizarre connections between a billionaire family, a ghost in Oregon, a serial killer, and a girl who went missing from her prom. The perfect series for a binge reader who loves mystery, suspense, and horror. \"This story had danger, intrigue, love, betrayal, and a graphic novel sensibility that appealed to me, personally, on every level. Honestly, I couldn’t put it down. In conclusion, I can only say that as an author, I wish I’d written Onyx Webb, and give Richard Fenton and Andrea Waltz major kudos for a job extremely well done.\" - Rose Shababy, Author & Book Blogger \"... this book is stunningly well written. The characters quickly capture your attention and compassion, even when they’re not the shiniest of souls. They are all complex and interesting people stepping unwittingly into the bigger picture this book is starting to weave. If you like season 1 of American Horror Story, then the twisted and macabre horror and historic elements that are blended into this story is going to be a literary feast for you. \"",
