And now that the French have infiltrated England's intelligence network, Captain Richard Drayton has sworn to ferret out the traitor. But he'll be damned if he'll let a woman distract him......Even one as intriguing as his sister's governess, Rachel Maitland Ross. The Captain suspects that Rachel is not what she appears to be, although her education is impeccable, her manners exquisite, and even Drayton's wayward little niece is captivated by her gentle ways. But the Captain has been marked for death--and badly wounded--by agents aiding the enemy, and Rachel's true identity as the niece of an immensely wealthy Anglo-Jewish banker remains a mystery. Still, he must trust her--if he is to survive.Rachel has heard the whispers: the handsome Captain is a rogue and a heartbreaker, though he is unquestionably brave. Indeed, when they were both kidnapped, he risked his life to save hers--but their unexpected intimacy has compromised her reputation. Like a true gentleman, he has offered for her hand, yet she must refuse. Rachel cannot betray the bonds of kinship and of faith...although the bonds of love may prove even more powerful...",
