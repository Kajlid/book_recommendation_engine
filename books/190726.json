  "description": "PaigeHe’s everything I’ve never wanted—an egotistical womanizing MMA fighter. Yes, he’s easy on the eyes with a body to die for, blue eyes to fall into, and a smile that will make your heart skip beats. His smell is intoxicating, and he’s fun to be around, but I’m not interested in being another notch in his bed post. I can’t lie and say I haven’t thought about what it would be like, I have. Unfortunately, I know a woman like me can’t make a man like him settle down.LeviLook at me, I’m everything she wants—a sexy MMA fighter who no one can resist. What? I can’t help they all want me. I know she fantasizes about my naked body on top of hers, who doesn’t? But she has a telltale sign—her glassy green eyes, her crimson red cheeks, and the sweat that glistens her face—she wants me. I’ve never had to chase, you know, put in effort to get the girl in bed, but she is sending me on the longest treasure hunt I’ve ever experienced. Not even my smile can make her panties drop. But somehow, somewhere in the mix of chasing her, I’ve developed feelings. This cannot be happening.",
