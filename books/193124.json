One minute, he was in the present, shooting up the Broken Buck Motel, where his tramp of a girlfriend had betrayed him with his best friend. The next, Lucky finds himself hunted down, hogtied, and tossed into a gorge, only to be hurled back in time to the Wild West! There he comes face-to-face with a saucy, sexy vixen who vows she will marry him to win a contest with her brothers.Spirited, beautiful Molly Reklaw has her eye on the prime parcel of ranch land her father Cole has promised to the first of his five children to marry and produce a grandchild. When handsome Lucky Lamont comes crashing into her life, Molly is certain he is the hero of her dreams. Hauling Lucky home, Molly announces to one and all that she has found the man who will marry her, give her a baby and win the contest for her, lickety split. When her outraged brothers holler foul and her flabbergasted \"fianc√©\" dares to protest, Molly goads Lucky into a reckless kiss that will surely seal his fate and force him to the altar. But Molly never counts on her virile bridegroom's determination to turn the tables on his feisty bride and dish up some steamy newlywed revenge.",
