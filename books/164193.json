  "description": "The Civil War has torn Isabelle Holloway’s world apart. Now she has little help to manage her vast Georgia plantation. And when the Union Army leaves a brash Yankee Zouave behind, Isabelle is inexplicably moved to nurse this gravely wounded, startlingly beguiling soldier. Alice O’Malley wants nothing more than to recover from her injuries, don her male attire, and rejoin the Federal Army. After the alluring Southern Belle discovers her true identity, their clash of wills soon transforms into passion-filled nights in each other’s arms. But Alice has been in love with a woman before, and fears risking everything for her enemy lover. As war returns to Isabelle’s doorstep, both women discover the wounds of the heart are far more vital to heal than the wounds of the flesh.",
