  "description": "I’m Caleb Baumgarten, the “bad boy” drummer of Red Card Riot. The world knows me as C-Bomb, but I assure you, it’s Lil Miss Rule Follower, Aubrey Capshaw, who’s the human equivalent of an atomic bomb. After tragedy strikes and the toddler with half my DNA inside her loses her beloved mommy, I get the bright idea to hire my daughter’s remaining lifeline, her “Auntie Aubbey,” as my live-in nanny. Also, embarrassingly, as my sobriety coach, so I can fulfill the terms of mandatory rehab.Going into my forced living arrangement with Aubrey in her small town, I’m determined not to give in to my growing, thumping, white-hot attraction to her. There’s only a month before the custody hearing that will decide my fate as a father, and I’ll need Aubrey to testify on my behalf. Well, you know what they say about best laid plans, right? Yeah. My bad.I expected Aubrey and me to scorch the walls of my bedroom, once I got her into my bed. What I didn’t expect, though, was that Aubrey would become the center of my universe, along with my small daughter. My family. My home. Which is why, when danger threatens, I don’t hesitate to protect what’s mine.\nFinding Home \nis a standalone, small town, single dad rockstar romance with suspense, deep feels, spice, no cheating, no third act breakup, and a happily ever after.
