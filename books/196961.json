A serial killer begins systematically eliminating members of the Catholic Curia. As priests die, their darkest sins are revealed to the public, tarnishing the church and everything Father Michael believes.  Michael and his wife Regina fight to uncover the evil behind the murders before the Pope’s scheduled visit to America. The evil could change Christianity forever and tear apart the commitments Michael and Regina made to each other long ago.  The news media further incites the killer by dubbing his crimes The Catholic Murders.  Under pressure from the church and every level of bureaucracy, decorated New York Detective Carlie Carlyle frantically works to apprehend the killer and put an end to the Catholic Murders. When the assassin makes an attempt on Father Michael’s life, Detective Carlyle realizes she has two choices: let Father Michael die, or save the husband of the woman with whom she has fallen in love.  Passion, suspense and the dark side of human nature come into play to make this one of the best new murder mysteries of the season.",
