  "description": "Warning: graphic sexual scenes. The darker side of BDSM.  Two beautiful, young, California women set off to enjoy their much needed vacation in the Florida Keys. By chance, they meet up with wealthy, James Welborn. The intriguing older man, was well-known about town for his elaborate parties aboard his yacht, Pleasure.  The girls take a chance to join James and his special friends, for an ‘exclusive party’ aboard Pleasure, but they had no clue what they were in for.  They soon find themselves swirling in the decadent world of BDSM; intense torture, kidnapping, and piracy upon the high seas!  When someone discovers they have a proclivity for the unusual; it’s not that they are deviant, they just have a deeper, more primitive sexual need. Lucky are those who meet a partner who shares similar pleasures.  Pam's body betrayed her during the horrific ordeals that occurred; awakening her to a life changed forever.",
