  "description": "\"This is a previously-published edition of ASIN B075C3L5PK”.Sometimes, falling in love means falling apart.Mercury Fie is a freak of many natures, created in a lab. Driven by desires and the imaginary fairies in his brain, he is directed by a moral compass set in the land of make-believe. Feared by criminals, hated by cops, and adored by the public, Mercury rules his illegal empire with a velvet fist and violent temper.Sean Argeneau is a good cop. Coming from a less-than-perfect childhood, he's the poster boy for overachievement and quiet humility. Although he makes little mention of his part in capturing the notorious Mercury Fie, he's tasked with transporting the mob boss to trial. As a former Federation pilot, Sean is no stranger to space travel, but the sickness he gets from jump-gates has kept him grounded.Sean’s cynicism turns out to be his saving grace when everything that could possibly go wrong, does. He wakes up bound by police-issue handcuffs, and staring down the barrel of his own gun. Being a good cop hasn’t prepared him for surviving this insanely bad situation, and Mercury goes beyond any brand of crazy Sean has ever met.When survival clashes with duty, both men must abandon their agendas to stay alive. But to make it work, Sean must succumb to a little bit of crazy, while Mercury struggles to understand what it's like to be sane.",
