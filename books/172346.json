  "description": "When happy-go-lucky mother of two Diane realises there's no food in the house again, her motivation as it usually does once a fortnight, takes a nose dive... With a husband working for nothing all the time and two demanding teenage girls, it's no surprise the Luck family are always down in the dumps?... That's until on one certain day, when there's nothing to eat for breakfast or any clothes for youngster Teagan to wear to school, Diane goes on a shopping trip that changes her life forever... Question is... What do you buy if you can have anything in the world? And will any of those future purchases actually fix the family and their real issues with each-other?",
