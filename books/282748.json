  "title": "The Week I Tore Up My Book: Recognizing Grief Expression in Young Children",
  "description": "All children will experience death and loss. Without language and concepts to make sense of death, childhood grief can be confusing and scary. The Week I Tore Up My Book uses the power of story to create a safe and authentic space for children and caregivers to talk about death directly and meaningfully. The narrative observes the emotions and behaviors of a young boy the week following his grandfather's death. Supporting the story is a guide for parents on how children conceptualize death, and how to speak with your child when someone has just died.While reading this book, the realistic watercolor illustrations marry the tender text in a union of emotion and connection, normalizing grief within the family and opening channels for honest and meaningful processing of loss.",
