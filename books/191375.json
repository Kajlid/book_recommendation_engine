  "title": "Plain Living: A Quaker Path to Simplicity",
  "description": "Must reading for anyone feeling too busy or too stressed and seeking to simplify their life--to listen to the longings of their heart. Most of us living in this complex and time-pressured era have moments when we wish we were living simpler, more meaningful lives. Sometimes these wishes are fleeting desires, but for many today the search for a life of greater simplicity and meaning has developed into a deep longing. There are many routes to simplicity. This book focuses on and provides direction to the gimmick-free spiritual path followed by Quakers. For over three centuries Quakers have been living out of a spiritual center in a way of life they call \"plain living.\" Their accumulated experiences and distilled wisdom have much to offer anyone seeking greater simplicity today. Plain Living is not about sacrifice. It's about choosing the life you really want, a form of inward simplicity that leads us to listen for the \"still, small voice\" of God. This book goes beyond the merely trendy to make the by now well-worn Quaker path to plain living accessible to everyone.",
