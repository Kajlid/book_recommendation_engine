  "description": "When the plant-eating Green Sox face the meat-eating Rib-Eye Reds, baseball will never be the same. Tied zip to zip, the game is a pitchers' duel until the Green Sox's hothead manager goes snout to snout with the dodo umpire and gets tossed out. The Sox respond with their veggie-powered bats and score three runs! Momentum swings back to the Reds before the seventh inning stretch, and they're all tied up in the bottom of the ninth. Will this game need extra innings, or will Apatosaur save the day?Book  Library BindingPublication 4/1/2010 32Reading Age 5 and Up",
