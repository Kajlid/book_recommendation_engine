  "title": "The love child",
  "description": "She was lovely--that was certainly true. And sufficiently charming and clever to have secured a position as companion to the Dowager Duchess of Karr. Lotta Chilton was fine company at dinner, as delightful as a lady as one could wish to have for a walk in the garden, but she was emphatically not the type of female with whom an attractive, unattached peer of the realm should fall in love, much less seek to marry. But there it was. From Timothy, Duke of Karr's first glimpse of Lotta, at his mother's gala winter festivities, he had followed the girl around the splendid halls of Grasmere Castle like a lovesick puppy. Unshaken by his mother's dire warnings about Lotta's Italian parentage, unfazed by the whisperings of the other guests, the Duke sets out, vowed to claim the adorable nobody--despite the protestations of propriety on the part of almost everyone, including Lotta herself.As Timothy, Duke of Karr, presses his suit amidst the extravagant entertainments of a winter house party, secret, scandalous forces are at work which could well alter the destinies of himself, his beloved, and the eighteen other visitors to Grasmere Castle.",
