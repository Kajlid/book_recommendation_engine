  "description": "The year is 2117, and Lydia Klein has lived a sheltered life in New Augsburg, a small town established as an oasis in an increasingly secular world. In the face of a government that heavily regulates publishing of explicitly Christian materials, Lydia’s family operates a privately owned press dedicated to printing books that proclaim the timeless Word of God.Faced with the loss of their parents, her brother’s unwillingness to carry on the family business leaves Lydia uncertain of the future.When the charming and polished Zachary Barrett, a wealthy son of the town, expresses interest in marrying her and buying her family’s press, she imagines that her problems may soon be solved. But as disagreements and new acquaintances threaten to come between them, will Lydia learn to act out of trust or be trapped in fear?",
