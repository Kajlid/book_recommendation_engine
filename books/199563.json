  "description": "When the emperor of Braavadom, Ixalien Varlk, discovers he is to die soon, he sets in motion a plan that will keep the house of his ancestors at the helm of the empire. The throne is no longer hereditary, and that has haunted many emperors for a while. But Ixalien has arrived to a solution, one that is bound to change the course of history. He will force a group of lawmakers to make his daughter a queen. The young princess is ignorant of her father's plans. Nurtured and spoiled from birth, she has little concern of what goes on around her and does not know that her father has just put her at the center of a dangerous world, where men struggle for power, proud men, who'll stop at nothing to possess a great crown-the one crown of the world, the crown of Braavadom.",
