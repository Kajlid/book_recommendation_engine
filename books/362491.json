  "description": "He Married For Money, Not For Love. Fortunately, His Wife Did Quite The Opposite...Young and spirited Glee Pembroke had always been secretly in love with her brother's best friend, Gregory Blankenship. So when she learned that this dedicated bachelor must marry by his twenty-fifth birthday or lose his inheritance, she boldly proposed a marriage of convenience, while secretly planning to win his love. Knowing of her new husband's reputation as a lover of loose women, Glee decided she must become \"fast\" herself--in order to capture his attention.Though marriage to Glee did seem a sensible solution to his dilemma, Gregory had no intention of giving up his rakish ways, and he certainly wouldn't tolerate his bride gallivanting about Bath like some wanton female. Her outrageous antics were causing him no end of aggravation--and strangely--inspiring a jealousy he was not used to feeling. When did he become so possessive about his wife? Surely, he was not succumbing to the one condition he had so studiously avoided...love?",
