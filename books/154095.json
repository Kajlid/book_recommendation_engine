  "description": "With five siblings to care for, Prudence Hixsby 's duty comes first, even if it means becoming a spinster. When the eldest—and most cherished—of her younger brothers decides to join the war, however, Prudence is determined to keep him safe. So she strikes a bargain with an old acquaintance: her body in exchange for her brother's safety. In the dead of night, she slips into the bed of a man whose touch is both fierce and passionate... little knowing she's just seduced the wrong man.Harrison Carlisle, the Duke of Sutcliffe, never imagined that that lovely Prudence would honour his bed, or just how bewitching those lush curves could be. Yet he keeps a gentleman's silence. After all, a spy for the Crown can ill afford to marry. But when Prudence's brother is killed, they find themselves uniting to track down the traitorous murderer. And while death lurks within the shadowy world of espionage, there is also passion... and the unbidden thrill of seduction!",
