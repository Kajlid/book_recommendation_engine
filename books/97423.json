  "description": "Emil Radle is a dedicated member of Hitler Youth. He's loyal to the Fuehrer before family, a champion for the cause and a fan of the famous Luftwaffe. When his friends Moritz and Johann discover a shortwave radio, everything changes. Now they listen to BBC broadcasts of news reports that tell both sides. Now they know the truth. The boys, along with Johann's sister Katarina, band together to write out the reports and covertly distribute flyers throughout their city. It's an act of high treason that could have them arrested--or worse. As the war progresses, so does Emil's affection for Katarina. He'd do anything to have a normal life and to stay in Passau by her side. But when Germany's losses become immense, even their greatest resistance can't prevent the boys from being sent to the Eastern Front. For Katrina's sake, and for his family, Emil hopes he will survive the battle. He knows they've already lost the war.",
