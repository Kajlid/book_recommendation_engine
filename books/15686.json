  "description": "Four teens struggle to survive in an apocalyptic world gone mad in this “brilliant novel that is a fascinating blend between I Am Legend and The Hunger Games” (VOYA).Since the beginning of mankind, civilizations have the Romans, the Greeks, the Aztecs…and now us. Huge earthquakes rock the world. Cities are destroyed. But something even more awful is An ancient evil has been unleashed, and it’s turning everyday people into hunters, killers, and crazies.     This is the world Aries, Clementine, Michael, and Mason are living in—or rather, trying to survive. Each is fleeing unspeakable horror, from murderous chaos to brutal natural disasters, and each is traveling the same road in a world gone mad. Amid the throes of the apocalypse and clinging to love and meaning wherever it can be found, these four teens are on a journey into the heart of darkness—and to find each other and a place of safety.",
