Smart, stylish, and self-determined, she lives with her longtime lover, Kip, in a Greenwich Village brownstone. Their lives together usually simmer along nicely--except when Lauren becomes obsessed with a case.Lovely, shy Lake Huron has been raped and refuses to talk to the police. Her older half-sister, Ursula, brings in Lauren, who seems to win the young woman's trust.

The closer Lauren gets to the truth, the more her own life is endangered--by a past that can't stay buried and fragile questions that have no easy answers...",
