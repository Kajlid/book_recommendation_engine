  "description": "From a vineyard in the south of France to the sophisticated city of Paris, Ella Moreau searches for the hope and love she lost as a young girl when her mother abandoned the family. Ella's journey is portrayed through a heartbroken child, a young woman's struggles during the tumultuous times surrounding World War II, and as a reflective adult.  Through a series of secret paintings, her art becomes the substitute for lost loveâ€”the metaphor of her life. But when her paintings are discovered, the intentions of those she loves are revealed.",
