Sharyah Jordan was not supposed to be here. Blast if he didn't hate complications, and Sharyah with her alluring brown eyes and silky blond hair was a walking, talking personification of complication.Now was probably not the time to tell her he'd made a huge mistake last summer….Two broken hearts. Dangerous Outlaws. One last chance at love.Step into a day when outlaws ran free, the land was wild, and guns blazed at the drop of a hat.",
