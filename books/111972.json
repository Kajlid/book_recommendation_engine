  "description": "Teenager Emma Watts doesn’t believe in true love. After all, she’s worked for two years in her family’s P.I. business catching cheating husband’s in the act. Then Owen Emerson arrives (while she’s in the middle of a stakeout, no less) claiming Emma has inherited a deceased aunt’s ability to supernaturally match soul-mates. Emma wants nothing to do with her aunt’s powers, nor with the frustrating and perfectly handsome Owen Emerson. Too bad she’s stuck with both for the rest of her life. Owen Emerson is a Protector, a person fated to protect Matchmakers for eternity. A guy who does things by the book, Owen figures he’ll rationally explain to Emma her newfound abilities and they can have the professional relationship he’d had with her much older aunt. But as he soon finds out Emma Watts is anything but professional. Fortunately, when she has her first vision matching two friends she has no alternative but to believe Owen’s claims. But Owen isn’t the only one interested in Emma. When the supernatural world discovers how to exploit Emma’s matchmaking abilities for their own, she has no choice but to trust the man who holds her life, and her heart, in his hands.",
