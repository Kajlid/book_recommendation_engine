  "title": "Love the One You Hate",
  "description": "Nicholas Hunt is the man I hate.For good reason.His opinion of me is tainted by prejudice even before my arrival at his grandmother’s estate, and my first impression of him is just as abysmal.His arrogance and icy demeanor make it clear that he’s the type of man who’s best handled at a distance.Fortunately, space shouldn’t be an issue inside this Gilded Age mansion and its lush gardens. If I stick with the servants and he keeps to his sailboat and vintage Porsche, we should hardly cross paths at all. Unfortunately, at Rosethorn, I find that all roads eventually lead to Nicholas Hunt.Sparks fly as we spar at the dinner table. Fighting words are flung in the shadows of the palatial halls. We hang suspended in our hatred of one another, painfully oblivious to the heat and tension that build with every moment we’re left alone. We’re liable to kill one another, I think…right up until my eyes land on his lips and a new feeling grips hold of me: lust. What’s worse? He knows it.They say you should keep your enemies close, but when Nicholas tightens his grip on my waist and draws me near, I’m not sure if it’s out of loathing or love. One thing’s for sure—I intend to find out.",
