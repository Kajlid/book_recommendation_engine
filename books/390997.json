  "description": "Big Star, Small-Town ChristmasCountry singer Riley Jensen would never have returned to her small Missouri hometown if her publicist hadn't come up with the scheme to tape a Christmas special there. So she never would have known that the man who broke her heart at eighteen—causing her to flee to Nashville—was now a widower with a seven-year-old daughter.

But suddenly, she can't help thinking of all she gave up by running away...Ethan Kent knew Riley had the talent and the drive to make it as a singer. He also knew she wasn't going anywhere if she stayed in their nowhere town for him. Then one night and one huge mistake sent her running on the road to fame. Which doesn't mean he ever stopped loving her...But with so much separating them, can Riley and Ethan find their way back together one magical country Christmas?Book 1 of the Kent Brothers Trilogy30,000 words",
