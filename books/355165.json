  "description": "“Masterful. . . . Evans demonstrates a fluent style and a sweeping grasp of the Third Reich’s history and of the enormous historical literature. . . . Evans’s fellow historians as well as a broader public will read this work, not quite with pleasure, for there is little joy in this story, but with admiration for the author’s narrative powers.” ― Publisher’s Weekly  (starred review)A New York Times  bestseller!An absorbing, revelatory, and definitive account of one of the greatest tragedies in human historyAdroitly blending narrative, description, and analysis, Richard J. Evans portrays a society rushing headlong to self-destruction and taking much of Europe with it. Interweaving a broad narrative of the war's progress from a wide range of people, Evans reveals the dynamics of a society plunged into war at every level. The great battles and events of the conflict are here, but just as telling is Evans's re- creation of the daily experience of ordinary Germans in wartime. At the center of the book is the Nazi extermi­nation of the Jews. The final book in Richard J. Evan's three-volume history of Hitler's Germany, hailed \"a masterpiece\" by The New York Times, The Third Reich at War lays bare the most momentous and tragic years of the Nazi regime.",
