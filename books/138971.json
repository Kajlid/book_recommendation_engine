  "description": "From an Amazon reader review: \"Jane Powell is a really good actress, since to watch her in films such as \"Holiday in Mexico\", \"Two Weeks with Love\", \"Nancy Goes to Rio\", \"A Date With Judy\", \"Rich, Young and Pretty\", and her best-known title, \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\", one would never know what a rough personal life she actually has had until fairly recently. Goes to prove, once again, that Hollywood public imagery was and is often a long way from the reality. One interesting point I do want to bring up is the sympathetic portrait of Louis B. Mayer that Powell paints, one that's shared by a great many other former MGM actresses in the biographies I've read. Mayer was a complicated man, sometimes tyrannical and abusive, but at the same time, as Powell and others state, it's plain that he really did see his actor and actress employees as part of a huge extended family with himself as the father-figure.\"",
