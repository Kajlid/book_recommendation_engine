  "description": "Chris Paget's well ordered world is blown apart by his love for his assistant, Terri, in the sequel to Degree of Guilt. Terri's ex husband, Ricky, is determined to destroy them both and instigates a child custody battle for Terri's four-year old daughter, accusing Terri of neglect and Paget's teenage son of sexual molestation. Then Ricky is murdered and Paget finds himself the principle suspect, on trial for his life. Eyes of a Child demonstrates why North Patterson is an international bestselling author. The pace is superb, the court room scenes unsurpassable, but most importantly the compelling characters, particularly Ricky, Terri's cunning and amoral husband, show North Patterson as one of the strongest storytellers writing today.",
