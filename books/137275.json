  "description": "Tallin \"Jagger\" Landon isn't a good man. In fact, he isn't a man at all but a bear shifter and the president of the Grizzly MC. When he takes in the wounded female of a rival MC, retaliation from that club is inevitable. But Jagger doesn't expect to be so territorial of a female that isn't even his.  Sonya White is desperate for a way out and will do just about anything for her freedom. Taken as a teenager by Trick, the Wolverine MC president, she has been the sexual plaything for the sadistic shifter for years. But the drama keeps unfolding with the dominant and possessive Jagger declaring Sonya is his, and a jealous club whore and Trick coming back to settle the score. Sonya can either run from the MC life or let Jagger claim her fully like he demands.",
