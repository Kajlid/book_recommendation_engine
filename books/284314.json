  "description": "Devan Dheer lives life as a wallflower. But he has everything figured out, juggling multiple jobs and acing school. Social interaction is his weak spot, but even that can be planned and figured out, like a game of chess. His love life is nonexistent and it’s not like his three-year crush on Leo Griffith is going to become a real possibility.  Leo Griffith has had life handed to him on a silver platter, helped by his family’s good name and their money. Unfortunately, that family name is now in the gutter. Things aren’t easy, but he has faith in his luck and in fate. And the fortune cookies from the local Chinese restaurant always seem to know precisely what to say.  When Devan finds out the man of his dreams puts blind faith in the fortune cookies he writes as one of his part-time jobs, Devan hatches a plan to get the school’s star rower to fall for him. They’re nothing alike, but maybe they’ll be stronger for it.",
