  "description": "What goes on behind closed doors?Mark and Caitlin Crawford are living the American dream just outside of Washington DC. Mark is a rising star at work; Caitlin, starting the third trimester in another pregnancy, stays at home and takes care of their three beautiful children. They live next door to a widower whose yard becomes an enviable floral masterpiece each year and who the children call Grandpa Bill. Mark’s brother, Cody, a drug-addicted and alcoholic petty criminal who periodically intrudes, is the only dark spot in an otherwise picture perfect existence. However, the idyllic happiness cannot last forever.A Flower for Hope takes readers behind the door of Mark and Caitlin Crawford’s home and offers an intimate look at what goes on in a family whose lives change in a way they never expected, or could have predicted. As they pass through the crucible, Mark and Caitlin are forced to discover things about themselves that are painful to learn as they question their very fundamental beliefs about life, love, and what is most important in life. Surprisingly Cody is the most affected and has to make a choice that will affect his life and the life of his family forever.A Flower for Hope is written as inspirational fiction but is based on many true life experiences of families who have suffered, as well as the author’s own poignant experiences. This inspirational book is a simple, yet powerful story that opens the closed doors to understanding of the journey through tragedy to hope, torment to comfort, and pain to peace.",
