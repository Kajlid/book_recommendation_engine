Return To Finkleton is a wonderful mystery book for children aged 9-12. KC Hilton does it again in this magical adventure book for pre-teens! There are 28 action packed and fast flowing chapters that include everything from the magical valley, mysterious visitors, new magical items to discover, and ghosts. I loved every minute of reading this book as if I were a child again. I can easily see this series made into a movie series on the big screen and would be disppointed if it doesn't.",
