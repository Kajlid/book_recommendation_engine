  "description": "This macabre and engrossing tale of the Caliph Vathek's all-consuming search for the secrets of the universe is generally considered to be the first great Gothic novel and an undoubted work of genius. The Caliph - ruler of one of the most powerful Arabian kingdoms - is seen to pursue his obsession far beyond the limits of safety and sanity by indulging in barbaric rituals and sacrifices. In an early attempt to win favour with an evil spirit he is commanded to renounce his god and sacrifice fifty of the most beautiful children in his kingdom; this he does. Plunging further in his search, Vathek is directed to a subterranean palace inhabited by the undead - corpse-like beings who wonder endlessly through its caves and passages. Finally, in a climax of stark horror he is confronted by the fleshless bodies of past rulers who also presumptuously sought the secrets of life - and is condemned to eternal torment.Originally published in France in 1787, Vathek did not appear in Britian until several years later, and even then against Beckford's wishes. Until publication of this Four Square edition, copies have been extremely difficult to obtain.(Source: front page)",
