Bluegrass Symphony deals with cowboys and fallow fields, shapeshifters and rednecks, superstitions and realities in harsh prairie country-and a whole bunch of other things thrown in the mix. In her introduction, Ann Vandermeer writes, \"These stories are about more than people just trying to get something from one another. These stories are about power and redemption, transformation, and sacrifice.\"",
