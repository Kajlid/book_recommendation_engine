On his eighteenth birthday, Will is sent alone to a desert isle where he must kill a vicious shape-shifting beast. The beast will test all of Will’s courage and resolve, but no more so than the evil men, who in his absence have murdered his father, and are now out to kill him. Will escapes the assassins, only to be kidnapped by sky pirates who pilot him thousands of miles from his home to be sold into slavery. Thus begins an epic journey that will take Will into the most savage and fantastical worlds ever imagined.Inspired by the works of Shakespeare, driven by the winds of Homer, and molded by the imagination of one of Hollywood’s greatest mythmakers, Mr. Wallace has invented an Elizabethan Fairy Tale and Sci-Fi Fantasy Adventure story of the grandest order. Written with a nod to the poetry and style of the Bard, those who love Shakespeare are assured of a fantastic read. And for those who love Fantasy and Adventure, be prepared for a ride on one of the most incredible literary roller coasters ever invented. Welcome to the strange and beautiful world of DJ Wallace.",
