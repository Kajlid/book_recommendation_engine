  "title": "Keata's Promise",
  "description": "Young, naive Keata Kia was kidnapped from Japan along with his cousin and three other young men. Struggling to make a home in America, he discovers the men who took him in are wolf shiftersâ€”and one of them is his mate. Unfortunately, Keata's mate has refused to claim him. If the human remains unclaimed, there is no shortage of eager wolves ready to step in to teach the beautiful and innocent Keata a thing or two about making love. When Keata is kidnapped and it's discovered the prince of vampires has him, Keata's wolf goes crazy, ready to kill every vampire in the area. But the wolf's plans change when it's discovered Keata has a little secret that now has everyone scrambling to protect his life. Each book in Lynn Hagen's Brac Pack collection features a different romantic couple. Each title stands alone and can be read in any order. However, we recommend reading the series in sequential order.",
