  "title": "Women and Men on the Overland Trail",
  "description": "This classic book offers a lively and penetrating analysis of what the overland journey was really like for midwestern farm families in the mid-1800s. Through the subtle use of contemporary diaries, memoirs, and even folk songs, John Mack Faragher dispels the common stereotypes of male and female roles and reveals the dynamic of pioneer family relationships. This edition includes a new preface in which Faragher looks back on the social context in which he formulated his original thesis and provides a new supplemental bibliography.Praise for the earlier edition:“Faragher has made excellent use of the Overland Trail materials, using them to illuminate the society the emigrants left as well as the one they constructed en route. His study should be important to a wide range of readers, especially those interested in family history, migration and western history, and women’s history.”—Kathryn Kish Sklar“An enlightening study.”—American West“A helpful study which not only illuminates the daily life of rural Americans but which also begins to compensate for the male orientation of so much of western history.”—Journal of Social History",
