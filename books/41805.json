  "description": "Matt Pulaski and Declan Foster are DEA agents in San Diego. When Declan nearly dies during a raid, Matt volunteers to keep an eye on his adrenalin junkie partner. Declan’s near death experience causes him to reevaluate his life. In his bucket list are some urges that he’s been suppressing. Fortunately, Matt is willing to help. Declan’s newly recognized feelings come as a surprise, and he’s pretty confused. Being a DEA agent is no walk in the park. Danger is always around the corner and bigotry doesn’t tend to be too far away even if things are changing.",
