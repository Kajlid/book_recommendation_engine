What could go wrong?It's 1969, the year of the global Space Race, and Fawhikwuff the demon has made a dangerous bet with the most powerful demon in the Pits of Despair: he must come up with a plan to conquer the moon in one human year or he'll be sent to a place even demons don’t want to go to—Hell.Annie Mae, a twelve-year-old Girl Scout from Virginia, has also entered a bet of sorts, but the prize she's trying to win is the chance to meet astronaut Michael Collins. To do that, she has to sell the most cookies in the country.Upon meeting Annie Mae, Fawhikwuff hatches a plan that is as simple as it is ridiculous: If he helps Annie Mae sell the most cookies, he can meet Michael Collins—who is going to the moon—possess him, take his place, and claim the moon as his own. What could go wrong? What he doesn’t bargain for is the high drama and turmoil of the inner-life of twelve-year-old girls. Or unexpectedly coming to care about them.Charleigh Frederick’s comedic and heartfelt tale combines found family, middle school squabbles, and demon antics into a wholesome, unforgettable story beloved by adults and children alike.",
