  "description": "People never stop talking do they?And from his perch at Las Flores cafe, Feathers hears every word- and repeats a good deal of what he hears. The problem is that the words sometimes get a little jumbled up, turned around, stretched out of shape. That's what happens one morning when Julio finds a ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. By the end of the day- and with the help of the talkative Feathers- Julio's bit of good luck has grown to immense proportions- at least in the minds of the regulars at Las Flores. Feathers' misadventures take place within sight of the palm trees and blue ocean waters of Miami Beach, Florida. Illustrator Andra Chase's sunny water colors depict a kaleidoscope of local color and characters, not least the multi-hued, madcap Feathers. Author Linda Talley's comic story about a parrot determined to keep up his end of the conversation will remind readers of the children's game of \"gossip,\" where what goes in one ear is not always what comes out the mouth. It will give readers young and old a moment's pause to consider the hazards of hearsay and the unreliability of rumor.",
