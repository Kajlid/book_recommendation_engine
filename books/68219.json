  "description": "My name is Cordelia Kelly and I'm an empath. I know what you're thinking. In fact, I know what you're feeling, too. I could use your emotions against you or free you from their constraints. My choice, really, and depends on my mood. You see, I filter both light and dark emotions from humans, but which I chose depends on which side of me is in charge.I'm not normal. I am the line walker and restorer of balance. A Royal. Think black sheep with red hair - not the blonde bombshell princess. I'm an aberration and unique. Not fully light, nor fully dark. Not accepted by anyone, but wanted by everyone. Mostly for their own amusements or nefarious purposes.Except for Sol Winterborn. He sees the real me. When fate throws us together to unravel the mystery of my grandmothers death, we have to choose our destiny. Walk together... or continue alone?The problem is I've been found by those who want me dead, and Sol has deep secrets of his own. My only choice now is to fight... or die.â€¨The road is dark, yet I follow the light.For now.",
