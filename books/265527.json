  "description": "He’s drowning in rejection. She’s riding the waves. Can a rich boy and a surfer girl find love at the beach? Aidan isn't used to losing. But when his popular girlfriend dumps him, and he tanks at the end-of-year swim meet, he’s not sure if his golden touch will ever return. Embarrassed and dejected, Aidan heads to the rough end of the beach and meets the surfer girl who’s about to change his life. Every passing week gets Harley one step closer to escaping her crappy house and a mother who doesn’t care about her. Charging the rich pretty boy for lessons could be her post-graduation ticket out of town. But her fiercely independent streak starts to fade when her feelings of pity for Aidan evolve into something more. As Aidan and Harley’s undeniable attraction comes in with the tide, suspicious friends and an interested ex make waves. Can the unlikely pair overcome a culture clash to find love’s perfect break? Over the Falls is the first book in the Ryder Bay YA sports romance trilogy. If you like beach culture, hot guys, and youthful passions, then you'll love Jordan Ford’s fun-drenched novel.",
