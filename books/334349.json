Tensions are rising between the three countries of Riehse Eshan, and the true identity of Quareh’s hostage threatens half a century of tenuous peace.And that’s not the only secret kept by the bloodied walls of la Cortina. Facing betrayal and subterfuge on all sides, Ren and Mat find themselves turning to each other as they’re forced to navigate Quareh’s increasingly dangerous politics. But even allied against a common enemy, they may not survive what comes next, not when it seems everyone has their own plans for the prince and his wayward northerner, including fate itself…-An enemies-to-lovers M/M dark fantasy romance where Reign meets Captive Prince: the Riehse Eshan Series blends humour, spicy scenes, LGBTQ+ representation, a Spanish-influenced setting, and the exploration of themes of belonging, sacrifice, overcoming ignorance and oppression, and challenging damaging long-held beliefs.A Whisper and a Breath is the second book in the series, and contains a slow-burn gay romance. Recommended for adults only; reader discretion is advised.",
