Sure, her rebellious attitude, smart mouth and purple panties still drive him crazy, but now it's a different kind of crazy. The kind that has him driving her home instead of to the nearest airport.And when Luke offers to solve all her problems if she'll only say I do, Marc realizes he's just crazy enough about her to forget whose heart he wanted to protect.Warning: Contains two people who don't like each other very much, a Toyota that can't quite handle the road trip home, and a spontaneous proposal. Or two. Or three. And foreplay with what else pie filling.",
