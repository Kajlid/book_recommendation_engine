  "description": "Our love was fatal. Weston Carter was all kinds of wrong for a girl like me. He was musician, a womanizer, and a first class heartbreaker. But our love was epic, the kind people wrote stories about. We fell into it hard, unable to control our feelings. The first time we met I knew. Emilia was my love. My muse. The woman who owned my soul. Emilia was perfection. Two shattered hearts. Two broken lives. One fucked up love story.",
