At night I dance and the movement sets me free, and I become whoever I want under the bright lights. My extravagant costumes and hairstyles started as a way to disguise myself, but soon, my look becomes my calling card, providing me escape from the real me—Zel Tress.My life in shambles, my pride’s the only thing keeping me alive, clothed, and moderately fed. Asking for help isn’t in my nature, but I soon find a safe haven and place to belong at The Tower. Three men offer me something I was desperately needing and I find acceptance in their love. Trouble catches up to me as it always does and I find myself questioning everything. My calling card has run out, and they’ve come to collect.
