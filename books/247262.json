But when her friend, a senator’s daughter, is killed, she’s forced to partner with Detective Rhys Morgan, or get assigned to ‘the backside of hell.’  More deaths with bodies matching their first victim brings Interpol Agent Quinn Kingston to the team.  As their investigation uncovers a secret genetic research program, a government cover-up, and a warning to ‘walk away,’ the case turns deadly.  The hunt for a killer, a boutique drug, and an unearthly ingredient unite these three in ways they couldn’t imagine.  Soon, they discover the truth leads to a hell they never knew existed.  DREYA LOVE ticks … like a bomb.                Dana Lyons combines the hottest trend in romance—reverse harem—with shape shifting and crime solving, to deliver a smart and sexy adventure with a double dash of the unexpected!",
