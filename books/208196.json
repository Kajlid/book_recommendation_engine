  "description": "Megan Phenix and her sister Nancy own a popular bar and grill in gay-friendly Eureka Springs. Following two failed relationships, Megan has sworn off women, but that seems to have only increased her appeal to single lesbians in town. Labeled as “playing hard to get”, she finds that some will go to any lengths to snag a date with her. Megan soon finds she’s the source of amusement for everyone, including her sister, as a partial photo of her appears on Facebook. The town’s resident nympho threatens to reveal the nude photo—piece by piece—unless Megan agrees to a date. If only she were seeing someone…maybe the women would leave her in peace.Leah Rollins thought fifty was too young to retire, so instead, she plans to open a store in the touristy shopping district of Eureka Springs. Leah quickly learns that sisters Nancy and Megan Phenix are polar opposites…one pleasant and friendly and one decidedly on the grumpy side as she and Megan spar over parking spaces and anything else they can find to argue about. When Leah catches the attention of the multitude of single lesbians in town, including Nancy, she searches for a way out. Could the grumpy grill owner next door be the answer to her problems?Megan and Leah strike an unlikely alliance and conspire to rid themselves of the unwanted attention by fake dating. Can they pull it off?As they pretend to date and convince everyone in town that they really are a couple, the pretense becomes harder to hold on to. But there’s just one problem…they don’t really like each other.Or do they?",
