  "description": "At just fourteen years old, Jackson Cunningham quickly learned his place in the world when he was shot and left for dead on the side of the road. He didn’t expect to be rescued, and he never imagined his savior would turn out to be his own mate.For the next four years, he waits patiently, eagerly looking forward to his eighteenth birthday, to the day that his mate will finally claim him. Only, that day never came, and now, at twenty-one, he’s done waiting for Talon to want him.Talon Cartwright doesn’t exactly have a reputation for possessing a kind and gentle nature. There are very few things in life he cares about, and Jackson is right at the top of that list. Claiming him, however, binding them—body, heart, and soul—isn’t an option.Cursed by a rare genetic disease, he knows his days are numbered, and he refuses to allow Jackson to suffer the same fate that awaits him.When dreams of a brother he left behind begin to plague Jackson, it doesn’t take long for him to realize they aren’t dreams. They’re calls for help. Can he save his brother and convince his stubborn mate to claim him? Or is he destined to lose them both forever?",
