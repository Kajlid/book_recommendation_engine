  "description": "Harlie Steele is building a new life for herself and her two-year-old daughter, away from her controlling ex-husband. When she falls in love with rock legend Lex Callatori, their whirlwind romance pulls her away from her small-town home and sweeps her into his tempestuous world of paparazzi, tabloids, and bodyguards. She wonders why heâ€™d fall so hard for her when he could have his pick of buxom blonde groupies, and whether the tabloid reports of his violent temper, womanizing ways, and drug addiction could be true. She opens her heart to Lex while emotional scars from years of domestic violence begin to fade. But trouble looms near, casting a sinister shadow on Harlie and Lex as their passion grows stronger. Driven by jealousy, someone is hell-bent on ending their relationship, one way or the other. Harlie literally fought to stay alive when she left her abusive ex and has no intention of being anyone's victim ever again, but when an obsessed stalker raises the stakes, her strong spirit and will to survive are put to the test.",
