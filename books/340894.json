  "description": "If you've ever lived with animals, have spent time in the country wondering what those howls and hoots were all about, thought living next to a pet cemetery might be a good idea, or if you just like to speculate about \"things that go bump in the night\" and spend endless hours playing some of the more amusing fantasy games available today, Zombie Raccoons & Killer Bunnies is the perfect book for you.The fifteen tales included here range from chilling to humorous, from fairy-tale settings to high-tech situations. What they share is originality and critters. From an ongoing conflict between chickens and killer bunnies, to a raccoon ready to defend its own at any cost...from a Siamese cat in league with a super squirrel to a story about the white bull of Tara - you'll find tales about both the creatures you see around you every day, and those you should hope never to meet.",
