  "description": "In the winter of 1890 a six-year-old boy arrives in the Canadian town of Balfour with a square of oil-cloth sewn on his coat bearing this inscription: 'This is Ludar Prentice.' He was to join his father that he had never met, and that no one in town had ever heard of. Fortunately, some kind citizens stepped in and he was offered a home. Never quite fitting in, he lived with them until adulthood where he is determined to find out who he is.",
