  "description": "The third in this cutting edge four-book series about gay and lesbian youth catapults readers into the middle of Erik and Isabelle's junior year. Eccentric Isabelle returns to her artistic roots and creates a compelling public art project that forces open Foresthill's eyes. Yet, these aren't the only roots she reconnects with--Mandy's back, determined to reclaim Isabelle's heart from Maxine. Meanwhile, having developed a secret relationship over the past year, rising scholar Erik and celebrated athlete Mark Slater tackle their school's most sacred the Junior Prom. Ready or not, Foresthill High must reckon with the forces of Erik and Isabelle, ever determined to live their lives with dignity. Never content with the status quo, they chip away at intolerance by never failing to demonstrate the power of love over injustice. If you don't already wish Erik and Isabelle were your real life friends, then this is the book that will make you turn that corner.",
