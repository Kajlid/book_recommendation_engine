  "description": "Caleb McNamara took one look at the golden hair beauty and fell like a ton of bricks. As a captain in the army he knew how to live hard and play harder. He’s never found a woman who could keep him locked down for long, but something tells him he might’ve met his match. Melissa Jackson knew she wasn’t society’s ideal of beauty. After year's of her own mother's put-downs, she saw her healthy size as a detriment. It had been drilled into her head so often she knew that in this life she'd have to settle for the first nobody to show an interest in her, and be grateful to boot; at least that’s what she’d always told herself. So how was she to believe that the movie star gorgeous captain with the amazing tattooed body was really interested in her? It had to be some joke between him and his army buddies. Right? She soon learns differently when Caleb pulls out all the stops to win her heart.",
