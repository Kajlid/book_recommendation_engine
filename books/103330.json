  "description": "Cranky Pants is back—but much to his chagrin, his joyfully rambunctious little sister is along for the ride. \"The Little Stinker never gets in trouble, has mushy oatmeal hands, sticky grape jelly hair, a runny nose, and smelly feet.\" When she goes missing in a department store, her big brother realizes that life without her just wouldn’t be the same. Can he save the day? Little Stinker welcomes back the lovable, albeit cranky, protagonist from Cranky Pants and celebrates the bond between brothers and sisters. Adults and children alike will delight in exploring the book’s vibrant, retro-inspired illustrations featuring 1970s icons like Holly Hobbie, GI Joe, and LiteBrite. Little Stinker is sure to become a bedtime-or-anytime favorite.",
