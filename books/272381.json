  "description": "Just one month ago, secret government operative Sasha Trudeau thought she'd tasted victory. Orchestrating détente between the warring factions of the supernatural world had nearly cost her life―but it also opened the door to a future with Max Hunter, her mate and fellow Shadow Wolf. Until now. A poisonous virus is wreaking havoc on Hunter's immune system. And the passionate man who Sasha loves has become unpredictable, dangerous―and possibly deadly. When Hunter disappears the night a human is found ravaged, Sasha is thrust into a race against the clock to find the cure for her mate…and the traitor who's determined to see them both dead.",
