Orphaned at birth and encompassed in a fortress of lies to protect her identity, she never truly understood her purpose on this earth. But now that she has ascended, embracing her destiny, the ghosts of her past have come back to haunt her.  Even with insurmountable power running through her veins, part of Gabriella is irreparably broken. And with old enemies working to destroy the tiny shred of normalcy she has left, she'll be forced to face the ugly truth about Dorian, the man she chose to love despite his darkness.  Everything she loved is a lie, and everyone she thought she knew is a stranger. And now that Gabriella is about to be thrust into the battle of her life, she discovers that she may be fighting for the wrong side.  *This is book 3 of The Dark Light Series, the highly anticipated conclusion to Gabriella and Dorian's beautifully tragic love story.",
