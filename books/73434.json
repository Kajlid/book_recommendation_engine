  "description": "In this wonderfully readable collection of essays, Ramachandra Guha defends the liberal centre against the dogmas of left and right with style, depth and polemical verve. The essays turn a critical eye on topics as wide-ranging as Hindutva, the Communist left, and the dynasty obsessed Congress party. Whether writing about politics or profiling individuals, this book confirms Guha's standing as India's most admired historic and public intellectual.",
