  "title": "The Long Ride",
  "description": "It's 1865, and a band of renegade deserters left over from the American Civil War abduct newlywed Judith Johansen and head to the wilds of Rupert's Land, soon to become Western Canada. They are about to find out that they have made a huge mistake. Judith is the granddaughter of Moses Munro, a wily old mountain man who survived as a trapper in the Rocky Mountains during the 1820s and '30s. When Moses finds out that Judith has been kidnapped, he-along with his son Captain William Munro (Judith's father) who has just returned home from serving in the Civil War, and his grandson Jimmy (Judith's younger brother)-head out on the trail, hellbent on rescuing her. And no matter how far they need to ride, or what they encounter along the way, they will not stop until they have brought Judith safely back home. \"While the main characters in The Long Ride are fictional, the background details in the story are historically Governor William McTavish, the Indigenous tribes, the places, the trails, the forts, even the dilapidated scow of a ferry at Fort Garry! I'm hoping this book will whet the reader's appetite for learning more about this fascinating time in Western Canadian history, while enjoying a rollicking adventure story with plenty of action.\" - Del",
