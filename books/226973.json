  "description": "In the town of Waresville, things go bump in the night, and the citizens sell tickets. The supernatural keep the town hall doors open and have made Waresville famous for witches, ghosts, and all kinds of spooks. And nothing's going to change while the people of Waresville still have a say in it. But now, the event of the season-Harper Beck's wedding-is bringing on chaos. Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck, detective, witch, and groovy owner of the local disco skate is marrying the town's golden boy-if they can survive the week. Harper is at her wits' end. Not only does she have to worry about walking down the aisle in front of Wyatt Bennett's judgmental family, but she might be losing her mind. Despite expert planning from her mother-in-law, nothing is going right for her wedding. Priests are disappearing, Harper's skin has seen better, less hive-covered days, and as hard as she tries, she can't get the smell of cake out of her hair. Then, there are her new brother-in-laws, who are every bit as handsome as their brother but aren't quite what they seem. A tip from a gypsy woman sends Harper down the rabbit hole into a mystery where you can't trust your eyes, and you definitely can't trust your family. It's anyone's guess if Harper and Wyatt will even make it down the aisle at all. Novella (approx. 40,000 words). Ninth Volume of the Harper \"Foxxy\" Beck Mystery Series. It is a standalone (reading prior or future volumes not required to enjoy the book, no cliffhanger).",
