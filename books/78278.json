  "description": "Forensic accountant Maggie Martin's well-ordered life is shattered by her husband's untimely death and the double life he concealed. Dealing with the financial and emotional wreckage left in Paul's wake, she is stunned to learn he inherited an estate known as Rosemont in the seemingly-serene Midwestern town of Westbury. Seeking a fresh start and a quiet, solitary life, she moves halfway across the country to make Rosemont her home. Before she can unpack her first box, she's knee-deep in a battle against political corruption, where defeat and retreat are not an option. Still bearing the scars of betrayal, will she find joy, romance and possibility in Westbury?Coming to Rosemont is the first book in the Rosemont series.Praise for Coming to Rosemont:\"In a category that doesn’t often feature felonious crimes as a main plot point, it’s somewhat surprising to see this title — with corruption, fraud, and arson coursing through the story — in a list of top performers. But with enough twists and turns to hook any reader’s attention, an adorable dog on the cover, and some classic women’s fiction tropes, Coming To Rosemont delivered more than enough firepower to win over our readers!\" BookBub's Best: Women's Fiction (#4)",
