What's more, her surname, Yarrow, is at the end of the alphabet and when the roll gets called out she's always at the end. She hates it. She feels she's always at the end of the line.Not that Ruby is a misery bag at all. She's bright and vibrant. She has great friends and loves clothes, fashion magazines and sewing, which she has a real knack for. She's very keen to go on the school trip to Brazil and so she gets a job to earn the money for her airfare, working in a supermarket for an old grump. She also learns a bit of Portuguese and meeting exchange students.This book is about having a dream and aiming for it. Ruby learns to stand up to her parents, gets some backbone and starts to see herself in a much better light. There's even a bit of romance.",
