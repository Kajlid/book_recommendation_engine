The Pop-Up Kama Sutra!This lively distillation of the world's most famous sex guide features choice excerpts from the original text, translated in 1883 by the renowned explorer Sir Richard Burton, and is illustrated with vintage color plates from India. Best of all, six incredible pop-ups present the Kama Sutra's most interesting, instructive, and wildly acrobatic positions in three dimensions. More Bollywood than museum piece, this fun gift book adds a new dimension to the literature of lust and romance. Author Bio: Sir Richard Burton (1821 1890) was an English explorer and author of 43 volumes about his adventures. While working for the East India company, he was stationed in India where he acquired a thorough knowledge of the Persian, Afghan, Hindustani, and Arabic languages. This enabled him to publish the first English translation of the Kama Sutra as well as a complete translation of the Arabian Nights, for which he is best known.",
