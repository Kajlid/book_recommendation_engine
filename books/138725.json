  "description": "Some people are born to be heroes. But I was born a survivor.\nWhen an otherworldly attack forces Olivia Blake to accept a harrowing new reality, her greatest weapon against those that haunt and hunt her is also her greatest curse. Her blood. Deadly yet intoxicating to the vampires who pursue her, day and night.After a decade of hiding in the shadows, Olivia’s reclusive life starts to unravel when she’s taken captive by one who shouldn’t survive in her presence. But blood drinker Callahan Tilbrook has no need for Olivia — his mission has a far deadlier price.When the bargain goes awry, Callahan and Olivia find themselves on two sides of the same terrible coin. With thousands of lives at stake, Olivia realises this is no longer just her secret to keep. And maybe it never was.",
