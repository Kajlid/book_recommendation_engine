  "description": "Everyone fears the Monsters in the Dark Forest, beyond the Great Wall. Fierce and terrifying creatures with lethal fangs and claws that can rip a man to shreds. When I’m captured by Tarak—one of their kind—my first thought is of escape. But when his eyes meet mine, he claims I am his Fated One—his Valnara. Humans and Monsters have been enemies for centuries, but the fated bond is sacred among Tarak’s people, and he refuses to let me go. Now, I find myself wondering: What does it mean to be Claimed by the Monster? **Steamy content. Not a dark romance**",
