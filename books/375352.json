  "description": "Organized crime and current Native American culture hit head-on in this brutal series as the lead characters inch closer and closer to the vices that could do them in for good. Fifteen years ago, Dashiell 'Dash' Bad Horse ran away from a life of poverty and hopelessness on the Prairie Rose Indian Reservation in search of something better. Now he's come back home armed with nothing but a set of nunchucks, a hell-bent-for-leather attitude and one dark secret. He finds nothing much has changed on 'The Rez' â€“ short of a glimmering new casino run by a corrupt leader named Red Crow, and a once-proud people overcome by drugs and organized crime.Collects: Scalped #35-42.",
