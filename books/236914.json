  "description": "We've all heard of the Itsy-Bitsy Spider right? But have you heard of the the Hugely-Wugely Spider? He's just like Itsy-Bitsy except he's a little--no--a lot bigger.The Hugely-Wugely Spider went up the water spout, well not really, because he wasn't invited by the other spiders. And maybe because his size was bit of an issue . . . But that didn't stop him from trying. The Itsy-Bitsy Spider and his friends get into a bind when down comes the rain and threatens to wash them out, and only the Hugely-Wugely Spider can save them. With his quick thinking and huge thorax, Hugely-Wugely clogs the drain and saves the day.",
