  "description": "From the Dynomike Series: Dynomike has too many shoes-shoes upon shoes-so many he doesn't know which pair to choose. Realizing that life would be easier with fewer pairs to dig through, he decides to simplify, realizing in the process that getting rid of what he doesn't need can be fun and help others. We all know that too many choices can be overwhelming. But the funny rhymes and illustrations in Dynomike: Happy Shoes show kids-and parents alike-that less can be more, and letting go of the stuff can mean more happiness for all.",
