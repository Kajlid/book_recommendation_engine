  "description": "I am Lili. After spending my whole life pleasing my grandmother and helping her stay young, I lose everything. I have to run for my life, as far away as possible from the town that she keeps under her control. But life in the woods is not easy and challenges never stop coming.  Is this a fairy tale? I don't know. I don't like fairy tales. So let me ask you: do fairy tales have more than one prince charming? Because this one has.  Here's what I can tell you for sure. Above all, this is a love story. Sometimes dark, sometimes funny, sometimes complicated, sometimes sweet, completely unconventional and probably judged by many of you, this is my love story.",
