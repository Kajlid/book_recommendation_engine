  "title": "Abducted by My Father's Best Friend",
  "description": "I’ve been framed for a crime I didn’t commit. The only person who can help clear my name is the tempting daughter of my best friend and business partner. I have to act fast, abduct her in a pinch and lead the spoiled mafia princess around the world while we search for who is behind it all. Did I mention she’s tempting? Well, she’s a red-hot flame of excitement ready to burn down my control and I can’t focus on anything when she’s around. But I need her. With me. Under me. On top of me. Obviously that can never happen. It won’t happen. Ever. Even though I can’t stop fantasizing about the way her pouty lips would taste. Or how her curvy body would feel beneath mine. Mia DeWinter is more than I bargained for and if I’m not careful I may just risk it all to be with her.",
