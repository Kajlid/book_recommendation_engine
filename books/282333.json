  "description": "Cat's life is forever changed when she falls victim to the California wildfires. She loses everything- her home, her possessions, even a little bit of the person she once was. When she meets Jake, the firefighter who risked his own life to save her, Cat starts to find herself again. Jake is sullen and brooding, mysterious and closed off, but he stirs something in Cat that she had long ago repressed. Cat quickly discovers that Jake is as wild as the fires that altered her life. His dark secrets and risque past threaten to destroy everything she built. Though it is dangerous to play with fire, the smoldering connection between them keeps Cat coming back for more. Now, her life will never be the same.",
