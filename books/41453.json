  "description": "Shaw is in Fiji to sell a stolen painting to the crime boss, Vornis. It will be the deal of a lifetime, if Shaw can pull it off. But then Vornis has to parade his latest toy around in front of him--a captured DEA agent whose time is running out. It's none of Shaw's business, and it doesn't matter that under any other circumstances Lee would be exactly Shaw's he's young, he's hot, and he might even have a personality if they hadn't beaten it out of him. Too bad there's no way Lee is getting off the island. Too bad there's nothing Shaw can do for him. And too bad there are some lines that even Shaw won't cross.Keeping his hands off Lee proves harder than he thinks, but Shaw's not stupid enough to fall for the tortured captive of a dangerous crime boss, is he? If he did, it wouldn't be just his job he would be risking--it would be his life.Publisher's This book contains explicit sexual situations, graphic language, and material that some readers may find male/male sexual practices, violence, flashback to rape/sexual violence.Publisher's Readers with a history of rape or sexual abuse may find elements of this story disturbing.",
