  "description": "They say our twenties is the time in our lives when we truly discover ourselves. The problem is, J. has been an awkward twenty-five year old for nearly a century and still hasn't figured it out yet. When his 100th birthday rolls around, J. realizes that he has put so much of his life into denying his true nature, that he has somehow forgotten to live it along the way. So, J. sets out with renewed determination to finally be a part of the world he has so desperately been clinging to. But, when an attempt to be the hero and save the girl goes horribly awry, the botched attempt to save Angieâ€™s life turns his world upside down, plunging him, his friends, and the girl of his dreams into a world none of them knew existed--A dangerous world full of ancient secrets, temptation, and blood. Instead of answers, all they find are more questions. Will J. figure out what it all means and who he really is in time to be the hero? Could he finally get his wish for a \"normal\" human life, or was the monster J. had worked so hard to bury, even closer to the surface than he ever thought possible? May contain graphic sex and language not suitable for anyone under eighteen.",
