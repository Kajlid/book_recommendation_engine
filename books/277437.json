The largest and most dangerous gang in the history of the American West, they rode, robbed and killed as late as 1911. When they died, the Old West died with them.This book is the truth. It is based on actual memoirs, letters, interviews with the Wild Bunch themselves, as well as on the first-person accounts of the Pinkerton detectives who pursued them from Wyoming to the Bolivian frontier, where the history of the Wild Bunch ends.",
