  "description": "Long ago, nine powerful men walked the Earth; each with their own specific magical attributes. They joined forces with the intention of improving the world, but one of them had a different agenda. When their travels took a destructive turn, The Aprīcōrum (ancient elders and acolytes of the Light God) intervened. The nine men were all cursed—sentenced to walk the Earth as one of its other inhabitants to teach them to respect the sanctity of life.Centuries later, Augustus mopes about, his heart wrecked with despair and loneliness like most nights since his curse began. He trolls the stone walls of En Tutum, a luxurious rustic tourist attraction where he is forbidden to leave. Suddenly he hears a faint whisper, “Mother,” as a jeep pulls into the property. He sees Selina Horton, a college student and visitor to En Tutum. He immediately senses an ancient magic in her—a power—that, if detected by the property owners, will put her in grave danger.This newcomer may be the key to answering the prayers his soul has sought. Therefore, he must protect her from those that are close to discovering her gift. However, his curse comes with many limitations. Can she trust Augustus, a cursed man, with his own motives, to protect her? Does she really possess the magical gifts he’s willing to risk his life for? The answer is drawing near.",
