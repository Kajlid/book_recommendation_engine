  "description": "Two cups of an arrogant, dirty talkin’ firefighter who has an obsession with peaches and the forbidden girl who smells like them.One tablespoon of a sweet schoolteacher trying to find her place in the world while attempting to resist her brother’s sworn enemy. A slice of fate that has their hearts questioning the past and the consuming need they have for one another. A dash of desire.A pinch of rivalry.A sprinkle of déjà vu. Mix together in a large bowl to create a combustible passion and a future that neither of them could have ever predicted.Bake at 350° for a rich serving of destiny and a love that could burn for eternity. A timeless recipe that is sure to fill your heart with a generous helping of Sweet Haven.***This a longer length novella and is the second book in the Sweet series. It is told in dual POV, has an HEA, and no cliffhanger. Since Samantha and Jase are recurring characters from Sweet Temptation and Sweet Love, I recommend reading both books prior to this but it isn’t a must. Warning: Due to mature subject matter, such as explicit sexual situations and coarse language, this story is not suitable for anyone under the age of 18.",
