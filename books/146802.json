  "description": "Mark Savannah has already lived two lives and is planning to live another one. He is an agent who has been burnt, looking for a future with a past he cannot avoid. Professor Zimmermann of the University of Buenos Aires has warned him: \"They have been able to stifle the whole affair and destroy all the evidence\". Mark discovers an extraordinary secret hidden deep in Colonel Reed's past and in the operations of Biosketch Technologies Inc., a biotech company he has come into contact with while studying some civilian and military neural transplant patients and hiding from Anaïs, the sniper that is hunting him. Project “Transtem 1.1″ is just the tip of the iceberg of Reed’s dark plans, and in order to get his life back, Mark has to break the ties connecting Reed, head of Biosketch Technologies Inc., with Colonel Kozlov of the Russian counterintelligence service. The consequences of Reed's plans could compromise international security and Mark, in order to once again be free, has to stop him at all costs.
