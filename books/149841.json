  "description": "Do librarians and bikers mix?  Librarian Elizabeth Williams is drinking her cares away at Perdition, a notorious biker bar in her hometown. She meets Ryker, a member of the Four Horsemen MC, and they start a fun, sexual fling. Ryker finds himself falling for Elizabeth, but an outlaw has no business with a \"good girl.\" Hell, he's not even sure he'd be worthy of one. He's mostly been \"wham, bam, get the hell out\" with the wild women who hang around his club. Meanwhile, Elizabeth is being stalked by her ex and Carl's behavior is becoming more and more erratic. If Ryker can keep her safe, they might have a shot at something lasting.",
