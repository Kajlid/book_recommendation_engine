But Night Hawk is a valuable ally, so Perry convinces Quinn to go.All goes well until Perry is taken by an old enemy.

And Captain Ashburn is waiting in the wings to pick up their old affair.When everything in their path seems intent on keeping them apart, will Perry and Quinn find their way back to each other?",
