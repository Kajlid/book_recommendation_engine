  "description": "What do I have in common with Tucker Holden?Nothing and everything. But mostly our loyalty to my brother. Which is exactly why I’ve kept my feelings for Tucker a secret. At least until I went and drunk dialed him… and proceeded to word-vomit everything I’ve tucked away for the last however many years. Including how I wouldn’t mind if he rocked my world, even if just once. Although, of course, I’d prefer a lifetime of his affection. But that’s not the point. That message? Yeah, he heard it. Every drunken detail. But when Tuck catches me in the act and admits to listening to my message more than once, I quickly find out that what's between us is so much more than just a drunk dial.It could be forever.",
