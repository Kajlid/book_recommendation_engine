  "title": "Authentic and Free: A Journey from Shame to Self-Acceptance",
  "description": "Have you ever looked in the mirror and hated the person looking back at you? Has the voice in your head ever said you’re not good enough, smart, thin or attractive enough? Bullying is a serious problem among today's youth, especially those who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning or queer (LGBTQ). What about those of us who bully ourselves? If you're like Courtney was, you are tired of your inner bully, tired of self-doubts, and ready for a dose of confidence, self-acceptance and self-love. Ready to Spread Your Wings and Soar as the Authentic You? Here’s Your Inspiration... “The authentic you is the person inside—the one who’s always been there, hiding beneath the fears, masks, and costumes. She just needs to know it’s safe to step out and show up.” Smiley and caring, Courtney seems to have it all—an adoring boyfriend, loving family, good grades, and bright future. However... -Why does she never feel smart, pretty, thin or good enough? -Raised in a household and religion with rigid rules, what happens when she realizes her attraction to boys… AND girls? -Will she honor the call of her authentic self, or will she spiral downward in self-destruction? -With a critical inner bully and invisible eating disorder, how can she possibly shake off the shame and learn to love and accept herself? Authentic and Free is a thought-provoking work of creative nonfiction that will inspire you to transform self-doubts into self-love by discovering your inner beauty, strengths and light. It’s time to set aside rules and expectations, be the powerful person you came here to be and experience the sweet freedom of an authentic life!",
