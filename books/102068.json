When she shows a house to Ambrose Slater, of the renowned Slater’s Bakeries, she has no idea she’s about to become “addicted to love.” Unable to resist him, Abby is drawn to the handsome but sensitive hybrid vampire, who is a powerful mortal despite his vulnerability. As she witnesses the deterioration of his brother Stefan’s marriage to Heather, a regular woman like herself, Abby must decide if she can embrace the vampire lifestyle or give up the only man she’s ever loved. And Ambrose must choose whether to risk losing Abby’s love or setting her free, even if it kills him…Old Town Nights is the story of two species of human beings who need one another in a special, intimate way. Added to the mix are the quirks of their colorful families, the rigors of operating a bakery, and the challenges of fitting into today’s ever-changing world.",
