  "description": "A hotshot pilot and a Southern princess looking for a fresh start collide in the wilds of Alaska.The first time I met Daphne involved three things: a cute skirt, a bear, and mud. Lots of mud. Daphne is everything I don’t need, and she makes me crazy in all the wrong ways. This princess does not belong in the wilderness. Or, so I think. But then, thought is hard to come by around Daphne.Between flying tourists all over Alaska’s skies, hotshot firefighting on the side, raising my sixteen year old sister who has enough attitude to run the world, and fending off demons from my days in the military, I don’t have time for women.But time’s been laughing at me ever since Daphne showed up. I can’t get her out of my mind, and my control has fled the building. Oh, and I’m her boss.One night, just one night, I let things go too far. Now, all bets are off.*A full-length, standalone romance.",
