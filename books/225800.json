  "description": "ATF agents Thayne Wolfe and Jarrett Evans are back and this time, they’ll be facing a familiar foe. International arms dealer, Mills Lang, has acquired a stolen cache of tabun, a powerful nerve agent, to sell to the highest bidder. The last thing either Thayne or Jarrett wants to do is get involved with the psychopath again but duty calls. Jarrett is sent in undercover as an Iranian who’s looking to trade cold hard cash to stop the deadly weapon’s sale only to learn he has to bid against the world’s nastiest scumbags. Thayne has spent countless nights lost in the nightmare of what happened when he’d been undercover in Lang’s organization. The time has come to face old demons and save thousands of lives, putting Lang down like the rabid animal he is. Unfortunately, the assignment requires Thayne to sit helplessly on the sidelines, forced to watch the man he loves put himself in the monster’s path. Jarrett has revenge on his mind. Holding Thayne when he’s woken screaming from nightmares, he wants the mad man responsible, behind bars or better yet, dead. Unfortunately, the assignment involves getting close to a former lover. Gorgeous Mossad agent, Adael Dayan, is Jarrett’s only way into Lang’s circle with Thayne forced to watch from the sidelines. Thayne and Jarrett have faced the Devil before, but always together. Will this case drive a wedge between them or will their love endure? “Locked and Loaded” Contains an exciting excerpt from “Point and Shoot” (Death and Destruction Book 5)",
