And she most certainly didn't expect her own desire to burn so fiercely when Parker came closer.But there was a problem: the Vella and Kreuger packs hate each other and have hated each other for centuries.An unexpected kiss will propel Charmaine and Parker down a grim-fated path. Can they keep their love a secret from their respective families and can they bear the consequences if it's discovered?",
