  "description": "When locals want the lowdown on what’s going on in their own state…They turn to Amber Richards’ Exploring America series! That’s why travelers are catching on to this invaluable series as well. More than just travel guides, these state-by-state editions, dial-in to the locales, the events, the goods, the foods, sights, sounds, and characters you MUST experience if you want the right to say, “I’ve been there!” It is not a typical travel guide, in the sense that the focus is not about where to eat and where to stay, but rather on where to go and what to experience to get an authentic sense of Alaska. In this edition, Amber collaborates with a local Alaskan to pop the cork on America’s true wild frontier. From well-known attractions and the history behind them, to the obscure less traveled experiences, Ms. Richards delivers the real Alaska to your fingertips! Spoiler alert: pack bear repellent, dancing shoes, waterproof matches, a sturdy steak knife, and your favorite beer mug. See you on the wild side!",
