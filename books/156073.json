  "description": "When human explorers sling out to the edges of the known universe, most of the actual surveying on exploratory missions gets done by machine. On a mission that goes precisely to plan, the actual humans have nothing to do but keep each other from going crazy, file a claim on behalf of their sponsoring nation and/or corporation, and then sit around dictating report summaries that help the folks back home prioritize the information coming back.  It is not a coincidence that missions never go precisely to plan.  The six men who rode one-way tickets a quadrillion miles away from the next nearest humans would have done well to settle on the moon of the Earth-like planet they discover: Jeremiah.  Humans can’t breathe Jeremiah’s air, but a toxic sky won’t stop Captain Parker and his crew from settling on the surface of a planet swimming with water and teeming with life.  And they may be light-years from any human being. But they’re not alone.  Nestled in the hills near the shore of an alien sea, a city of millipedes bustles with peaceable activity. For now.",
