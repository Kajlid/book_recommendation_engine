  "description": "On the outside, Ashen Black seems normal but on the inside … not so much. Problem is, an injury has left a Grand Canyon sized hole in her mind, leaving Ashen oblivious to who -or what - she is. Enter Knox Stoke. Tall, gorgeous, and one hundred percent not interested in Ashen’s instant affection, Knox is a mystery all on his own. One that Ashen doesn’t have time to puzzle out. Dealing with the consequences of her father’s legacy, Ashen rushes to understand why someone wants to hurt her and how she’s going to survive an enemy she doesn’t remember.",
