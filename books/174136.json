  "title": "After \"The End\": Teaching and Learning Creative Revision",
  "description": "At a time when the writing process is sometimes viewed as a seven-step recipe, with revision one of those steps, author Barry Lane inspires language arts teachers to approach the subject with flexibility and playfulness. He encourages both teachers and students to enjoy a sense of discovery and surprise in their writing, as well as to examine and explore their own distinct revising styles. After \"THE END\" revises our concept of revision, illustrating it as a constant inventive search for new possibilities and divergent meanings, rather than mere correction or what students wearily refer to as \"redoing.\" For students in upper elementary to secondary school and beyond, and for every teacher looking to develop a common language of craft in the classroom, After \"THE END\" is a book of practical ideas and applications that inspire the reader to put it down and put it to use.",
