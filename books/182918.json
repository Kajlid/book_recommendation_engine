  "description": "Cindy Lambert thought she was done with the small town of Blevins, Wisconsin, but here she is, back in her home town, managing a bed and breakfast and following her grandmother's dream. The problem is, she's tired of being alone, and there are no single men for miles that she's interested in. Plus, with her busy schedule, she has no time to date anyway. When her best friend coerces her into contacting a matchmaker, she decides to make it work for her. Trey Zayne, a web designer from Texas is sick of his sister constantly trying to set him up with women he has no interest in. When he's contracted to do a website for a company called Matchrimony, he finds himself fascinated by the concept. A relational psychologist will interview him and find him a match. The only catch? They will meet at the altar. Can a techie from Texas fit in with a small town girl from Wisconsin? Will they find more than companionship and move straight to love?",
