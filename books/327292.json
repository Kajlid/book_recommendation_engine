  "description": "A witch with a healing gift. A warlock bred in violence. An immortal world on the brink.ColetteI’m a healer, not a fighter… and right now, my coven needs all the fighters it can get. Our territory is under attack, and we’re despised among our kind because they think witches should only breed with humans. Let’s just say, our mothers broke a lot of unwritten rules with their choice of mates.As the only coven of hybrids, we work twice as hard to survive our many enemies.But things can always get worse.A malevolent warlock clan has taken me captive to destroy my coven. I may not be a fighter, but I have to find a way to stop them from annihilating everyone I love.I just need to convince Makhi, the clan’s resident torturer–and my unwelcome mate–to help.MakhiI never imagined my mate would be a witch, the greatest enemy of my kind, but I am a male who enjoys a challenge.Colette is mine. Her pain, her pleasure… all of it, mine.The Goddess gives us strange gifts, and I will enjoy playing with this one.The little witch thinks she can control me through the mate bond.Foolish female, you will learn who controls whom soon enough.Note: Lifeblood is a deliciously dark and steamy paranormal romance. It features enemies-to-lovers, captor-captive, forced proximity, fated mates, a dirty-talking and villainous hero, and a heroine with more internal strength than she realizes. Each book in the Immortal Coven series has an HEA for the couple, but the series has an overarching plot. See \"Note for Readers\" in the book for the content warning.",
