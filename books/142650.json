  "title": "Mynydd Eimon - Private Hell",
  "description": "Samuel Watcher - resourceful, talented, damaged private investigator has returned to Mynydd Eimon after a gap of 7 years. He remembers very little about the past 7 years, nor his previous 14 when he grew up in the village. The book describes his awakening as he investigates a murder that hasn’t yet taken place. He uncovers events about his early years – his family, the village and what lies beneath the surface of a quiet timeless Welsh village. ‘Mynydd Eimon’ is part ‘Angel Heart’, part ‘The Big Sleep’, with elements of golf, Old Testament religion and an intriguing mystery. Beyond these elements however it is a very Welsh book with real welsh characters and ‘valley’s humour’ pervading everything. It’s intriguing, original, amusing, enlightening, slightly surreal and highly entertaining.",
