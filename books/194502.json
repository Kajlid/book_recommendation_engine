  "description": "At long last the rebel capitol of Richmond has fallen and the fabled Army of Northern Virginia led by General Lee has been captured. All through out the country citizens are taking to the streets to give thanks and celebrate the coming peace. Yet, for Abraham Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth, the struggle is just beginning.In the White House, Lincoln struggles to make peace with his part in the war and to face the daunting challenge of the coming Reconstruction when he is confronted with a new agony. Terrifying dreams that seem to predict his death and the persistent presence of the ghost of his dead son Willie unsettle him. Unable to sleep without being forced to visit the dark place in the forest where his corpse lay, Lincoln is reduced to spending sleepless nights wandering around his home and office alone in the dark, fearing every sound might be his dead son returning for him.Meanwhile, down the street at the Surratt House, John Wilkes Booth alternates between crippling depression over the collapse of the Confederacy and joy as he designs his plan to salvage the South's cause and etch his name into the history books. Chasing a maniac's desire for fame and redemption he relies on deceit and his force of personality to drag those around him down a dangerous path of revenge.Surrounded by the rejoicing residents of the Union capitol and interesting characters such as Mary Surratt and General Grant, these two men drift towards their dreadful encounter at Ford's Theatre on which the fate of the nation rests.",
