  "description": "LunaI was saved from one hell to only find myself in another one. Except, this time things are different. The first time I knew what to expect-- but here things aren't the same. Every time I turn around, I don't know what's coming my way. The question is: which way do I turn when the devil rears his ugly face again? Do I run to the shadows, or do I run to the people who can protect me? The only ones who I've come to care for immensely. Nothing is ever certain in this world, but I always know this-- your shadow will always be with you. It's too bad I fear the shadows as much as everything else, and when it comes down to it, I'm only left with one choice.",
