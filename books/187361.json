Throw in the Russo Famiglia and you get darkness where light should be.Sometimes the darkness turns to betrayal.Sometimes people aren’t who you thought they were.Sometimes people do things you never thought them capable of.Sometimes it’s better to walk away.But sometimes it’s not that easy.Sometimes people don’t take ‘no’ for an answer.Sometimes it’s make or break.For Meggie and Trace, it’s time to decide: is it all... or nothing?",
