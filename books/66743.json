  "description": "They're bikers. They're brothers.They're shifters, well, most of them... Lion shifter, Arbor has loved his bachelorhood. He has his brothers of the Howlers UP Chapter and a good job. He was content in his life, until Megan strolled in as the new office assistant at the logging company where he worked. His lion instantly took notice and made it known that she was his mate, but something in her eyes told him she wasn’t going to trust easily. Megan was running from her ex-boyfriend and the law, because that’s what you do after you torch his car when finding him cheating. She suspected he was following her, and had to keep moving. Commitments were something she didn’t have time for, but she also didn’t want to leave broken hearts in her wake. That was why she kept herself guarded and didn’t promise more than a bit of fun. When Arbor set his sights on her and made it known his intentions, the heat between them was too much for Megan to ignore. His laidback attitude put her at ease, and the sex was incredible. When strange things happen around the office, it isn't long before Megan's ex makes an appearance, and Arbor is determined to keep his mate safe. Will her ex make her pay for torching his car, or will he be the one cashing that particular check?",
