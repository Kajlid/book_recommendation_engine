  "description": "The world says those with superpowers are either heroes or villains. But what if you're both? Mathilda Brandt isn't the angry, out-of-control teenager she was before she got out of jail. She's hungry for a chance at a normal life, but when a gang threatens her sisters, she has no choice but to use her illegal superpower to protect them. A secretive government agency gives her a choice: go back to prison for life, or infiltrate a notorious super-villain group in order to stop a psychotic Empowered. To save her city, her family, and herself, Mat must become the last thing she ever wanted to be again: a criminal. Empowered: Agent is the first book in Dale Ivan Smith's The Empowered urban fantasy series. If you like heroes and villains, you'll love this fast-paced, suspenseful read featuring a strong female hero.",
