  "description": "The story is a thriller centering on the two main characters, who are friends working as journalists for a Scottish magazine. Whilst on an assignment in Argyll, Scotland, they discover the body of a young, female human-rights worker, and the story unfolds, taking a sinister twist. After the boyfriend identifies the body, he tells the journalists of a key to a locker containing documents. These relate to leaked information from the Foreign Office in London concerning a suspended British ambassador who had been working in Sudan, and a smear campaign mounted against him. The journalists find themselves in a murky world where they must use their wits to survive.",
