  "description": "An Entertainment Weekly Best Kids' BookWhen a skunk first appears in the tuxedoed man's doorway, it's a strange but possibly harmless occurrence. But then the man finds the skunk following him, and the unlikely pair embark on an increasingly frantic chase through the city, from the streets to the opera house to the fairground. What does the skunk want? It's not clearâ€”but soon the man has bought a new house in a new neighborhood to escape the little creature's attention, only to find himself missing something...This sly, hilarious tale brings together luminaries Mac Barnett and Patrick McDonnell for the first time.",
