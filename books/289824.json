  "description": "What do you do when the love of your life forgets? Not the good times. Not the love. Not the passion. But the pain and heartbreak and betrayal. He doesn’t remember that he broke my heart. But I do. He doesn’t remember the darkest parts of our marriage. He doesn’t remember that six months ago, I said goodbye. What do you do when the love of your life remembers your marriage but not your divorce?",
