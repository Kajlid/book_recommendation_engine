  "description": "Emersyn Daws is driving me crazy, has been for months. As soon as we met I knew I needed her by my side, soothing my ragged edges with her thick curves and sweet smile. Every time she walks past me, especially in one of her tight pencil skirts, I'm like a dog chasing after a bone. She was into me too, at first, then something changed and now she wants nothing to do with me. Every once in a while I catch her staring and right before she turns away our eyes connect and I feel the connection I felt the first moment I saw her. She's going to be mine, no matter what.This Christmas we're going to figure out what went wrong then I'll spend the rest of the night Decking Her Halls.",
