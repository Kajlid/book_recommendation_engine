  "description": "If you like paranormal stories by Amanda Hocking and Alyson Noel, you’ll love Shelley Adina’s Immortal Faith! In the small, traditional community of Minuit, Idaho, the people pray that God will deliver them from evil. They should have been more specific.Sophie Dupont is on the threshold of womanhood, standing in the door between her religion’s way of life and the possibilities of the world outside. She is also torn between two young David Martin, whom she has known since childhood, and Gabriel Langford, the new arrival. In a community that only grows when people are born into it, a convert—young, single, and with looks to die for—is the most exciting thing that has happened in years. Under the elders’ approving eyes, Gabriel is dedicated to worshipping God. But his methods may not stand up to too close a scrutiny . . . and Sophie is getting very close indeed . . .When Sophie’s uncle is found dead in the barn with his throat slashed and bitten, the community grieves—except Sophie, who has been abused by him since she was nine. What kind of awful person is she to be glad that someone is dead? And when another is killed the same way—and another—is she the only one who realizes that only the worst among them are being chosen? That the bad seed is being systematically weeded out of their beleaguered community? Sophie begins to suspect who might be behind it . . . and that’s the one possibility she can’t bear to contemplate . . .",
