  "title": "Tales of Hank",
  "description": "\"Tales of Hank\" is a collection of ten parables about Hank, and a tale about the talking fish Kali, beautifully illustrated by the author. The book seems to be for children at first glance, yet it is not. The stories are about love, loss, personal growth, transformation, and unexpected twists in human relationships. They convey the psychological complexity of human interaction in the simple format of a tale. The main character - Hank - is born with a magical gift. The gift that could make many people happy. Each new character he meets has their own gift, a different one. But it's not just magic and personal gifts that lead to happiness. Every tale has an unexpected turn of the plot and offers a life lesson. Some tales may appeal to a younger child, but mainly they are for a mature adult whose \"inner child\" is alive and wants to understand and learn more ways to love. The heroes of the tales are archetypal, thus you may recognize aspects of yourself, or some people you know, in the various characters. You may identify with one of them, or be reminded of an interaction that affected you deeply at one time, perhaps defining you ever since. This collection of stories will inspire you to choose love no matter how challenging are your inner conflicts. And you will be able to share some of the stories with your children if you choose to. The whimsical colorful illustrations make this book a perfect gift to a young adult, who appreciates reading a meaningful story.",
