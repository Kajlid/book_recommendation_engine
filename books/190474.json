  "description": "The star player. The chosen one. Tyler Kidd ruled the hockey league. He was driven hard by a hatred for losing. Yet behind his on ice persona he was damaged. Betrayed by the one he loved, he battled his demons with alcohol and women. One fueled the other and spiraled out of control. Losing his spot on the team was not on Tyler’s agenda, until it was. Faced with ruining his career, he had one chance to make things right and not lose the one thing he lived for. Hockey. Charged with taking hold of Tyler’s career, Paige Martin never dreamed her new job as Renegades PR assistant meant cleaning up after his mistakes. She never imagined she would see a side of him he showed to no-one. And she definitely never thought she’d end up in his bed. She was everything he never knew he needed and he was everything she knew she should never touch. Lines blur, careers are on the line. But what happens when you have no other choice than playing the game?",
