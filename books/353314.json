  "description": "[Out of \"Print\": see ASIN B007MCQOIG]Anya Vaedrin is a woman of extraordinary talents. A singer by trade, she has earned the nickname Angel with her voice, her white hair, and deep blue eyes--and a secret. In a time when telepaths hold positions of power and empaths are their weak discards, Anya is an explosive mix of the two talents. Able to both read emotions and cause others to feel anything she wishes, from joy to fear and pleasure to pain, Anya is a new breed that the telepaths would give anything to possess--or destroy. Pursued to the ends of human occupied space by a telepathic assassin, Anya has one last hope of safety before she must brave alien territory. Far Reach Station is known for its liberal policies towards alien species, but would they give sanctuary to one of their own when she is wanted by the Telepath Guild? Anya's prospects seem grim when she is confronted by Jason Salvatore, the surly second in command of the station. And Captain Marta Jamison makes the station a dubious refuge when it becomes clear that she has an agenda all her own.",
