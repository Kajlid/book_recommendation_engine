He’s a monster. I didn’t come here to fall in love. I came here to get my revenge, even if it means throwing away love to do it. This old club, this MC, they murdered my father. It’s time for payback. I’m going to look these men in the eyes as I slice their throats and scream my father’s name.  Maybe I’m the monster.   Her Monster is intended for readers over 18 due to strong language, violence, and explicit sex scenes. This is a standalone, full-length novel with an HEA, no cliffhangers and no cheating.",
