Then, in one very bad day that involves burnt toast and a police arrest, she loses everything – except for a winning lottery ticket her ex left behind.  Afraid to cash it, she decides to give up men and become a Bohemian novelist. She takes her laptop to Starbucks and literally bumps into caffeine-free, easy-going Josh Gray, a life coach and very handsome man. (Not that she’s noticing.) When he offers to help Amy get back on her feet, she decides to hire him. Her heart is telling her that he’s the man for her, but Josh is big on honesty and Amy has a huge secret that could push him away if he ever finds out.",
