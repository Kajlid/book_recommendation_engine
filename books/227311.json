  "description": "\"YOUR OBEDIENCE TRAINING BEGINS TODAY.\"Seke has no interest in owning or training a slave. Not even Leora, the beautiful human who had captivated his thoughts and fantasies since her arrival on their pod. As the Zandian Master of Arms, he has a war to plan and new troops to train. He can't be tempted by the breathtaking human slave, who, according to Prince Zander, grows aroused by punishment. Yet he can't allow another male to bring her to heel either. Not his Leora.In all her lifetime as a slave, Leora might have submitted in body, but never in mind. But the prince has given her to the huge, scarred warrior, Seke, for punishment and she finds he has unexpected ways of bending her to his will. Ways that leave her trembling and half-mad with desire. But her new master is unwilling to take a new mate, and she fears that once he deems her training complete, he will set her aside, leaving her heart in pieces.   Publisher's Note: This power exchange story contains dominance and submission, spanking and explicit sex scenes. If such subject matter offends, do not buy this book.",
