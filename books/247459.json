  "title": "Freed Love: A story of love and friendship after captivity (Censored version)",
  "description": "This is the second book in my ‘Friends, Family and Love’ series. The first book in this series is called ‘Captive Love’, and is now available free on Kindle at Amazon. The first book is best read before reading this book. Warning: This book is a censored version that has had the erotic scenes altered to fit a younger age group. It is also available as a 18+ version, which contains explicit erotic scenes. *** Introduction to this book: Lydia escaped from Sam in the first book with the help of her housemate Rob. Their emotions were high and they shared some kisses. Now that Lydia is back home again, she slowly starts to realise that their once so easy friendship has changed. When they separately realise that their feelings have changed, things become rather awkward between them. Will they manage to get their friendship back on track or will it be lost forever?",
