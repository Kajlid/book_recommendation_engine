Exceptional color reproductions of 86 of the artist's works, several of which are double-spread gatefolds, distinguish this volume, which features essays by four art historians on O'Keeffe's significance to the art world. Included is a special photography section with pictures of O'Keeffe, some taken by her husband, photographer Alfred Stieglitz, at different times in her long life.",
