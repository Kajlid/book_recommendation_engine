  "description": "Lauren Sullivan has the perfect life: Best Selling Novelist, Successful Investor Boyfriend, and a Fabulous Life in NYC. It all comes crashing down in true dramatic fashion, but she finds she is not really that upset about it. That is, until she realizes why her boyfriend kicked her to the curb. After her ex-boyfriend's choices come back to haunt her, she now fears for her life. Lauren’s Editorial, Publicity, and Publishing companies hire her a bodyguard at the strong suggestion of her publisher/best friend, Elizabeth. Of course, it is none other than the publisher's smoking hot older brother, Bradly. However, Lauren’s childhood friend, Devon, is not so sure that the so-called bodyguard is up to the job and a silent pissing contest begins for her attention. So soon after the revelation to the end of her four-year relationship, she far from looking for love, but with two handsome men chasing her, anything can happen. But one question still remains... Can they keep her safe?",
