  "description": "Destiny has been preparing me for this moment since I took my first breath. Unfortunately, if I don’t embrace the path I’ve been created for, Destiny will withdraw that breath. I’ve traveled countless miles only to realize I had the answers all along. I battled ancient creatures, evil men, and brought magic back to the Fae realm. I have many enemies whose knives are aimed for my back. Despite everything, I’m desperately trying to get back to my mate, my family, and my kingdom. A brutal war is coming to destroy everything I have left, and if I fail, all hope of a new world will be surrendered to an infinite age of darkness.",
