  "description": "A BRIDGE TO THE SUN...From the Benedictine monasteries of England to the sacred tombs of darkest Egypt, from the ancient temples of Jerusalem to the great cities of Italy, France and Hungary, here is a riveting saga of medieval times told through the lives of the passionate men and women who envisioned and engineered history's most triumphant and timeless monuments to humanity - the great cathedrals and castles of early Europe.A BRIDGE TO THE SKY...Born in a poor Suffolk fishing village, young Stephen of Dunwich was branded a witch by an ignorant peasantry frightened of his remarkable gift. Exiled with his mother, Maud, they were forced to seek shelter from the Black Monks of Ely where Stephen would become the apprentice of a cruel, cold-hearted monk whose true ties to mother and son were carefully guarded. Under Brother Daniel's harsh tutelage, Stephen would acquire the basis of the education he needed to become a brilliant architect; under the spell of a beautiful peasant girl, he would forsake his vows and seek his destiny as a master builder in the greatest cities of the East and the West. A rich, compelling blend of history and drama, A Bridge to the Sky is a magnificent record of Europe's first great burst of creative light after the Dark Ages, and the haunting, fascinating story of a man who dared to dream - and built his dreams in stone and mortar to last a hundred lifetimes.",
