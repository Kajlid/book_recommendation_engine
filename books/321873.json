  "title": "The Poetry of Pablo Neruda",
  "description": "The most comprehensive English-language collection of work ever by \"the greatest poet of the twentieth century - in any language\" - Gabriel García Márquez\"In his work a continent awakens to consciousness.\" So wrote the Swedish Academy in awarding the Nobel Prize to Pablo Neruda, the author of more than thirty-five books of poetry and one of Latin America's most revered writers, lionized during his lifetime as \"the people's poet.\" This selection of Neruda's poetry, the most comprehensive single volume available in English, presents nearly six hundred poems. Scores of them are in new and sometimes multiple translations, and many accompanied by the Spanish original. In his introduction, Ilan Stavans situates Neruda in his native milieu as well as in a contemporary English-language one, and a group of new translations by leading poets testifies to Neruda's enduring, vibrant legacy among English-speaking writers and readers today.",
