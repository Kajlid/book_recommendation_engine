Dayton and Colby present her with the shortened timeline she’s been given for her mission and answers to why she has to continue forward.

When Kyle reappears with another murder fresh on his hands she is no longer willing to be forgiving. Without the time she need on her side, she’ll commit a dose of her own magic in plain sight knowing her unconditional love will be the first of her messages, making her a musical force to be reckoned with. There comes a time in life you have to let go of who you thought you were and become what you know you can be.",
