  "description": "Earth is nothing like Romy expected. A disappointing fact made clear far too many times.Over the last year and a half, her world has shattered again and again, along with her sanity, and now Knot 27 is split in two with no sign of reconciliation. There is no end in sight.  When the leader of their rebel movement steps down, the man Romy loves takes over the role of commander-general. They are outnumbered. They are outgunned.  Not only are the Mandate Members as deprived of humanity as ever, another lethal player has taken the field. All it takes is a click of a button, and everyone she loves will die.",
