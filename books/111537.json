  "description": "Beautiful young women are being kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery by a ruthless crime syndicate that the law can’t—or won’t—touch. But after years of terror and abuse, one victim manages to strike back…with the help of PRIMAL. Now, the covert vigilante team lays siege to a medieval-era castle where the barbarism of bygone ages is alive and well. Once PRIMAL’s deadly operatives bring high-tech weapons and razor-sharp combat drills into play, they teach the flesh-trade slavers a lesson in preserving human rights…and punishing inhuman wrongs. But when one of the team trades valor for vengeance, it could jeopardize every member on the mission—leaving them, and the prisoners they’re fighting for, at the mercy of the criminal world’s most ruthless: the Yakuza.",
