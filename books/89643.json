  "title": "The Atlas Fracture",
  "description": "When a pioneering experiment in Antarctica somehow goes wrong, Perry Helion, an agent for the U.S. Defense Advanced Research and Projects Agency (DARPA), is dispatched to investigate the remote, windswept site. Soon Perry is involved with a terrorist gang carrying out a devious plan to wreak environmental havoc on a global scale. If the murderous terrorist team succeeds with their daring plan, they will alter Antarctica forever and plunge the northern hemisphere into a sudden climate change that will kill millions. Aided only by Dr. Ellen Kaminev, a young scientist tricked into participating in the suspect Antarctic research, Perry must stop the terrorists from carrying out their destruction. In the empty reaches of the ice continent where there is no chance of help, Perry and Ellen must use their guile to prevail. They must outwit the terror team’s leader and quash his twisted ideas for “transforming” mankind. Will Perry prevail against brutal cold, betrayal, torture and a bizarre medical experiment? Will the maneuvers of a shadow conspiracy prevent the DARPA man from final triumph?",
