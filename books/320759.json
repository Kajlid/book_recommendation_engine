  "description": "Minami Kyuki is ready to start a new life at McMillan's School of Arts. Her dark past lurks in the background, threatening to unravel her dreams. Will Minami lose the battle with her demons as the burden to keep her family's memory alive overwhelms her? AJ White, an impressive songwriter, is ready for anything, even a little bit of romance. While she soon finds herself involved with Derek, a talented singer with a killer smile, AJ develops feelings for her roommate and struggles at the implication. She's never fallen for a girl before-does this mean she is gay? Bi? Add in a celebrity attempting to blackmail her and a family who'll disown her if she reveals her true self, and AJ can't help but wonder if attending McMillan's was a huge mistake. Throughout the chaos, Minami and AJ fight to keep together the best thing that has ever happened to them-each other.",
