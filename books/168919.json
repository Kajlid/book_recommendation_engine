  "description": "Wyatt Fox and his friend Eli live in a world where everything, from clothes and cars to weather and weapons, is connected and monitored. Today’s “Cloud” has become IOTA, or Internet Of Things Access – a system that allows for constant connectivity, smart power grids, and safer guns. On the other hand, the technology has brought widespread surveillance, greater economic disparity, and less hope for change. Wyatt, a high school student with a unique talent for programming, notices something strange on his screens after the tragic and suspicious death of his father. As the intrigue deepens, Wyatt and Eli find themselves swept up into the inner workings of an underground organization whose plan to revolutionize the world changes everything the young men thought was true.",
