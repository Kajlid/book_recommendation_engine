  "description": "Some rules are meant to be broken…One night in college is all it took to change everything, to destroy my life as I knew it ... all at the hands of my brother. I walked away from the aftermath, never looking back, regretting nothing.Seven years later, we’re thrust back together following the tragic death of our father. All the loathing and hatred bubbles to the surface again when an ultimatum is woven into the last will and testament; work alongside him for a year and repair our tarnished relationship or risk losing our entire inheritance.Having no other choice, I pack up my life in Manhattan, leave my swanky penthouse, and fly to a small town in Montana armed with only my Armani suits and cocky attitude.Reconciling with my brother is the least of my worries when I meet Savannah, ‘Savy’, Martin. The sassy archery trainer is hellbent on turning me into a cowboy despite my obvious aversion to anything outdoorsy. Falling for her country charm and sharp wit should be out of the question considering she’s best friends with my brother, but after one fiery kiss, my tightly wound reservations and edicts disintegrate in a cloud of dust.But when the past doesn’t stay in the past, and relationships are tested, will love be enough to save us?In this small-town romance, secrets and unbridled passion are unleashed directly into the wild, wild west, setting all the rules on fire.",
