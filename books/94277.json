  "description": "My name is Adeena Frias. Don't laugh. Back in 2143, when I was 19, it was a fairly common name for young women. This story is my take on the big events of that year; it was the year that we humans, as well as the Rooninans, were changed forever. Looking back on it all, I have a lot of emotions about what happened to the gentle Roonians. I also find myself thinking about the Yadans, their message to humanity, the gravity of that message, and the enormity of it all. I turn it over in my mind, a lot-mostly I wonder if we humans have really learned anything after the tumultuous events of that time. It was a fun time, too. I met my friends, and I learned to love a lot of people. Dave, I will love you forever!",
