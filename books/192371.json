  "description": "Holt Medallion finalist!Christie Becker has always dreamed of a career in radio. After a few years of working a grueling desk job and attending night classes, Christie is finally ready to embark on her new on-air career. When she quits her job and gets hired as an overnight disc jockey, her life seems to be on the right track, but falling for her boss was not something she planned on.Rick Fox has been working in radio for ten years. In fact, it was his voice that got Christie through many college study sessions. With an established career, the last thing he wants - or expects - is to be attracted to the overnight jock. Especially when it is strictly against company policy; an affair would put both their careers in jeopardy.But when the two of them are thrown together in the studio it becomes clear that the static between them is more than just professional chemistry. Will Christie's career be destroyed before it even begins, or will Rick find a way to salvage both their jobs and put their love on the air?",
