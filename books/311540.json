  "title": "How to Ruin Halloween for the Grim Reaper",
  "description": "All Harmony, the Grim Reaper, wants is one day off. She has one more souls to collect before she can run away to the sun, surf, and a good book. But no matter what she does, he isn't coming with her. All Andy wants is a chance at life. When Death comes knocking in the form of a beautiful woman, how can he say no to the luscious lips and a smile to die for.  Instead of going willingly into the afterlife, he instead decides to fight for a chance to survive and to keep the sexy Grim Reaper  around for awhile. Now all Andy has to do is make Harmony realize that it isn't his soul in jeopardy, but hers.",
