  "description": "I hate Drew Woods, and she hates me.Even so, I'm not the cold jerk most make me out to be, and I have no problem moving the single mom and her baby into my home. I do, however, draw a line when it comes to acting on the way her loose lips make me feel.Alive.She's too mouthy, too prying, and her curves are way too distracting.I might have lost my way after a nearly fatal car accident, but I'm not stupid. Giving in to Drew would be a short-lived fix for this pain I'm saddled with, and I knead something permanent.I'd be insane to think what we have could be anything other than temporary...right?",
