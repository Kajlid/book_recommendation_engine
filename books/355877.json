  "description": "Previous Tomcat LGBT Shape-shifter ParanormalT.J.'s a man--okay, a shape-shifting tomcat--with a plan. He intends to ask his wizard lover MacGowan to officially move in with him and make this the best Festivus ever. Unfortunately--or not unfortunately, really--he keeps getting distracted by MacGowan's hot bod. You know how tomcats are. Purrrr.That aside, T.J.'s got a minefield's worth of hurdles to jump before he can give MacGowan the keys to his apartment. That list includes meddling Nereids, pointedly absent friends, and a Psychokitty with a decided inclination to meddle in the affairs of cats and men. As the cherry on top, MacGowan's almost too busy stressing out over learning to be a \"real\" wizard to pay attention to T.J.Still, this tomcat has learned that home is where the heart is, and he's going to hang onto his magical relationship with MacGowan with all four sets of claws, come what may. (And a lot may come, including them if they're lucky).Happy Holidays?Publisher's This book contains male/male sexual practices.",
