  "description": "“If I’ve told you once I’ve told you a million times, no jumping on the bed!”But Walter just can’t resist, so he ignores his father’s bedtime warning. Higher and higher he bounces gleefully, until his hair brushes the ceiling. But when he lands back on the bed—thump, creak, crack—it crashes right through the floor! Suddenly Walter finds himself visiting all the downstairs neighbors in his apartment building in a most unusual way!“Hip, hip, hooray for this delightful urban fantasy, a comic morality tale that explores the consequences of ignoring that age-old ‘momilie,’ ‘If I’ve told you once I’ve told you a million times, no jumping on the bed!’”— School Library Journal",
