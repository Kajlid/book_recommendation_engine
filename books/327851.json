  "title": "Scarlett Johansson Asked Artie Lange: \"Are You Too Fat to Fish Some Natalie Portman?\" He Answered: \"I Must Have Sex With Adriana Lima, Robin Quivers, and Eva Longoria Parker as They're My Life Calendar\"",
  "description": "Scarlett Johansson Asked... is one of those rare books that we never forget. This is beyond a doubt one of the most remarkable abstract literature novels. It is also one of the best. A truly perfect book wows readers today, and for good reason. Its unique language is sophisticated and humorous instead of outlandish, intriguing instead of garish. To get the idea of the book just read the first \"Whilst the taram pam pam were ooh la la on their ooh la la, tra la la constant ha ha ha, the ooh la la, who, of course, ooh la la not taram pam pam to ooh la la their ooh la la.\" This book is different. Number one on the must list.",
