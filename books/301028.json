  "description": "She was promised to the mysterious mountain men in order to have their baby. Now they’re ready to collect their reward.  Twenty-one-year-old Soraya has lived almost her whole life under the shadow of being promised to the mysterious men in the mountain – a deal struck in return for saving her father’s life. Now the time to present herself at their door has arrived.  For Soraya, this means going from the sheltered, friendless, cruel and unloving care of her grandmother to an equally daunting and strange situation in the eerie mansion hidden deep in the dark mountain. There are rumored to be hideous monsters gracing the dilapidated castle-like house, but nothing prepares Soraya for when she meets the three men determined to extract their repayment in full.  For the sake of her father, she’ll pay the debt, then she’ll start living the life she was meant to live…   Publisher’s Note: This steamy, contemporary romance contains elements of mystery, and power exchange.",
