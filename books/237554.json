  "description": "I’m here for pleasure. And in paradise, I don’t have a past. I don’t have pain, my secrets don't haunt me and I can be anyone I want.He’s here for business. Harry's intoxicatingly handsome, rich, and also the biggest jerk I've ever met. So, it's inconvenient that sparks fly every time our eyes meet. Indulging in an affair wasn't on my agenda. But fate isn't a mistress to our intentions; And what starts as a strike of lightening on a moonlit beach ignites a fire between us that will span continents. Meeting again in the unlikeliest of circumstances feels written in the heavens. And I'll need the courage of the gods to tell him the truth. They say the truth will set you free... but what if it destroys you first?",
