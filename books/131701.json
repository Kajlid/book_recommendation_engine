  "description": "Twenty -three-year- old Xavier Steel is his own man, despite what his brothers and Momma Joe think. He turns away from the family business and heads to New Jersey to start a production company. Xavier plans to follow his true life's passion and make a living playing and creating music. Taelyn Patrick takes a grueling job in order to make extra money to help her fianc√© Daniel through medical school. Besides, how hard can it be to help a spoiled rich kid throw his money down the drain? But Xavier isn't your typical spoiled rich kid. He shreds cash as quickly as he runs through women. And, despite everything, there is an attraction neither Taelyn nor Xavier can deny. Can Daniel curb his sexual appetite and focus on making his company a success while Taelyn pads her bank account and secretly reports back to his mother on his activities, or will they both find something in each other that they can no longer fight?",
