  "description": "It was supposed to be one night with no rules. One night just her and me. Etta is my best friend's little sister, I know I should stay away, but I can't.Booze has a way of sucking the oxygen out of your fears and feeding it to the parts of your heart you starve. It was the end of summer. The alcohol, fire and a wild look in her eyes was too much to turn away from.Now we're supposed to go back to college and pretend it never happened. Like, she's still just my best friend's little sister. The girl I grew up with. Not this addiction burning in my veins.I don't want to hide it. Or sneak around behind my best friend's back. But, Etta is more than just his little sister.And I need so much more than one night.",
