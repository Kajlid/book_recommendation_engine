  "description": "A HOWELL DOG BOOK OF DISTINCTION Since the first edition of this groundbreaking book was published, tens of thousands of people have been inspired to adopt ex-racing Greyhounds. These gentle, lovable dogs have special physical and emotional needs, and no other guide is more authoritative or complete in preparing potential Greyhound owners for the responsibilities involved than  Adopting the Racing Greyhound. This fully updated edition features veterinary information not available elsewhere, backed up by painstaking research by some of the country’s leading authorities. Respected Greyhound authority Cynthia Branigan—who has helped place more than 4,000 ex-racers through her organization—provides updated statistics on the costs of adoption as well as new health information, such as safe new flea, tick and heartworm preventives, anesthesia protocols for Greyhounds and suggestions on purchasing veterinary insurance. Branigan carefully explains how potential adopters can decide whether a Greyhound is the right dog for them—a critical issue in successful adoptions—and covers everything from feeding and grooming to training to extending the dog’s life span. She helps readers prepare a Greyhound for the arrival of a new baby; decide whether or not to add a Greyhound to an existing pack of dogs; determine when to return an adopted dog; and locate adoption agencies throughout the world. Branigan also offers a wealth of updated information on medical conditions in Greyhounds and the latest in tests and treatments.",
