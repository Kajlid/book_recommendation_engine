  "description": "If his sixteen years of experience have taught Mikey Alston only one thing, it’s this:Life is too damn cruel to face alone…The ice took our car off the road.The tree wrecked it.Tate and I didn’t make it out unscathed.My parents didn’t make it out alive…I was eleven, and that’s the day my whole world was ripped away from me.My brother, David, was twenty-one. All the family I had left, I needed him. He didn’t need me.David packed me off, far across the country from my hometown in Devon.Far from Tate and everything I’d ever known, to live with grandparents I’d never known. Six years is a long time. But now I’m back.(Not through choice. Not mine, anyway).And Tate’s still here. Only… He’s not the boy I left behind.He won’t speak to me. Won’t speak to anyone.The one upshot of my return to a life I no longer fit, and he’s letting me down. Spectacularly.Well, Tate, here’s the thing:I’m not giving up on you. I’m not everybody else. You can’t shut me out. You need me – we need each other. And we will be friends again. Best friends.I’m decided.It’s decided.PLEASE NOTE: Mild sexual content, moderate use of bad language and some difficult themes.",
