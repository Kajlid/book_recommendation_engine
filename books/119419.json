  "title": "The Clinic",
  "description": "They didn't have much to live for. Malcolm, Darren and Eddie, all had their own tragedies, their own demons to face. Malcolm was alone in the world, Darren might as well have been and Eddie, well, Eddie wished he was.  The isolated rehab clinic was not an easy target for these opportunistic thieves, on the contrary, it revealed a dark past and an evil that was sown way before their time. The sterile corridors and soulless rooms swarmed with a depravity that they never imagined possible.  The Clinic is the story of a regrettable heist, of three delinquents who find a lot more than they bargained for. A gripping, thrilling and spine-chilling story of suspense, fear and pure evil.",
