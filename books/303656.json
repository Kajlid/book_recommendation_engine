He shows her an entirely new world of a thriving underground subculture that takes Dianna out of her comfort zone and forces her to face and overcome her personal struggles as Drax fights to save her from herself, all while they both spiral into a crazy, toxic love affair with each other. Dianna must face some hard truths and learn some hard lessons as she sheds her skin to become a better version of herself...",
