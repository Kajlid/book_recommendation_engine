  "description": "Can we achieve perfection? While true perfection is fleeting, we often achieve a moment of perfection: a state of mind that is just right, a time when we are fully attuned to the needs of our body, mind and spirit. It is the potential for achieving this type of integration that Perfecting Ourselves: Coordinating Body, Mind and Spirit seeks to tap into. Author Aaron Hoopes explores the basic threads of the self-body, mind and spirit-and demonstrates simple methods of integrating the three through breathing exercises, meditation, focused quietism and conscious living. He considers the body and how we can become more fully aware of it by examining detrimental behaviors, exploring the effect they have and suggesting ways to counter them. In particular, he shows how deep breathing exercises and conscious awareness of the breath constitute a major pathway to physical health and well-being. He then looks the mind and how we can gain more control over our thoughts and feelings. In particular, he focuses on \"Quietism\" an approach that includes exercises for calming the mind and gaining clarity of thought. Finally, he discusses the spirit, which manifests itself when we have integrated a healthy, connected body with a calm, clear mind. When integration occurs, every moment of life becomes \"perfect.\" We can live in balance with our self and the world around us. Through breathing and quietism, the quality of life improves. We get sick less often and recover faster. Things that bothered us before become insignificant. Feelings of well-being invade us, and we feel ready to tackle any task or obstacle in our path. Follow along as Aaron leads you through simple exercises that will help you: * Develop healthy habits one step at a time * Holistically heal and strengthen your body * Reduce tension and stress through mindful breathing * Increase your connection between mind and body * Get in touch with your \"Universal Mind\" * Discover the joys of quietism * Achieve internal balance",
