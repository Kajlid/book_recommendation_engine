  "description": "She Just Found Love In The Last Place She Ever Would Have Expected  Shawna is a strong, well-educated woman who has worked hard for what she has, but true love has eluded her for a long time. When her friend Mikki convinces Shawna to keep looking, she eventually meets Virgil, a drop dead gorgeous rock star. He's incredibly smart, caring, and capable of lovemaking that puts everyone else in her past to shame, dedicating himself to pleasuring her in a way that has her crying out like she never has before.  However, in a world that is hardly colorblind, these two people from very different worlds will have to fight for what they have against jaded ex-lovers, the intense and dramatic disapproval of their elders, and Virgil's own haunted, violent past. Now they must both make pivotal decisions that will shape the rest of their lives: Shawna must choose between Virgil and the more traditional guy that is practically kicking her door down to be with her. Virgil, too, must decide between a former bandmate who he knows is bad for him, or Shawna, the new girl in his life that so many disapprove of.  This is a standalone, Interracial BWWM romance novel with some extremely sexy scenes and no cliffhangers! Lock the doors and schedule some alone time.",
