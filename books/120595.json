  "title": "Keoni and the Return of the Li'i",
  "description": "This is the third book in a five book series. It continues the story of a young Hawaiian Menehune boy and some of his exotic friends he makes while coming of age and growing in his magical abilities. It also covers teachers from all over the world who help him learn what he needs to do to fulfill his destiny.This book has something for everyone in the family. However, it was written for the 10 to 16 year old audience. There are 44 interactive hyperlinks, which bring up graphics, maps, photographs and explanations of items in the storyline. The character graphics are owned and commissioned by the author from the folks at Intense Media. This book is a major departure from the first offerings, in that while it carries the storyline of the first two books, it has been presented in a chapter format that is more suited to slightly advanced readers.The book conveys several messages of tolerance, peaceful resolution to problems and the ability to persevere in the face of hardship. It is sure to become a classic.",
