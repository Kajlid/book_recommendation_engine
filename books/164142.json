  "description": "The passion between beautiful food photographer Catherine Kelly and billionaire gourmand William Lambourne is now a full-course meal… Cat and William have had the right ingredients for mind-blowing passion from the very start, and now their whirlwind romance has gotten serious. Very serious. They’re practically living together, and sharing William’s luxury Chicago penthouse is even more delicious than Cat could ever have imagined. Whether he’s cooking her an elaborate gourmet dinner or satisfying her every need in the bedroom, William Lambourne knows how to take care of his woman and Cat couldn't be happier.But life with Mr. Lambourne in his mansion in the sky quickly becomes complicated. Demons from William’s past are back and they want to harm what’s most precious to him: Cat. He’ll do anything in his power to protect the woman he loves from danger, even hiring an elite security team to follow Catherine around the city. Cat loves that William wants to keep her safe, but she’s not used to being a target – or being so dependent. And then there’s Cat’s new boss Hutch Morrison, the ex-rockstar-turned-world-renowned-chef who stirs up another kind of trouble. Cat’s definitely not used to seeing her stormy-eyed sex god so riled up. Cat and William may be a perfect pairing, but when dangerous forces of all types threaten to keep them apart, it will take more than just their undeniable chemistry—and their insatiable appetites—to survive it.
