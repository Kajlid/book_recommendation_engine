  "title": "Grey Zone",
  "description": "From Adam, God created Eve, and from humanity, we have been formed. The year is 2059. 26 years ago an evolution occurred. Some referred to it as an infection, or a virus, but to those of us now locked behind the Dividing Wall, separated from the rest of society, we simply refer to it as the change. Most of the residents in Baja California were relocated, and the wall was constructed around it; to keep the rest of the world from having to remember that we exist. We have been quarantined, segregated, persecuted, locked in isolated “safety zones”, and ripped away from our families and loved ones, to be locked away and forgotten inside what is now referred to as the Grey Zone. This is the story of our survival, the story of our kind, the Cineraceans, or as we refer to ourselves, the Greys.",
