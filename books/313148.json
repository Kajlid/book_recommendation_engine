  "title": "One Woman, Two Lives: Part -1",
  "description": "One Woman, Two Lives is an Award Winning multigenerational saga set in late 18th Century Southern India. It follows the struggles of the women in one family as they fight to deal with the oppression of the caste system imposed on them, both by society at large as well as from within their own family. When a tragic betrayal results in the death of her sister, suicide of her mother and financial ruin of her father, young Bhavani will have to rise above the expectations and traditional role imposed upon her in order to take revenge and restore honor to her family’s name. Nalinavilasom Bhavaniamma, Ajay’s great-grandmother, inspired the creation of Bhavani in One Woman, Two Lives. Growing up hearing stories from Nalinavilasom Bhavaniamma about the “untouchable era” days sparked empathy in Ajay toward what earlier generations had experienced, as well as opened his eyes to what women were still fighting. Ajay, himself, witnessed many times where low-caste women and men were treated differently and he never understood why. The weight of Nalinavilasom Bhavaniamma’s stories stayed with him as he grew older, and he knew he needed to share this story. Everything from Bhavani’s fighting instinct to her deep love for family was inspired by Nalinavilasom Bhavaniamma.",
