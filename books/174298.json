  "description": "As a new school year begins, Summer is certain heading back to classes will be like every other year. But, as she quickly learns, she missed a lot while she was gone during the break. Not only are her friends attending parties Summer never thought she would go to, they have new friends Summer has no interest in getting to know. Sitting at the top of the list of people Summer doesn't care to spend time with, is none other than Nick. But, after a chance encounter at a party, Summer soon learns that Nick is trying to make a big change. Hearing him talk about trying to study more, avoid partying, and even ignoring the constant rumors about his recent breakup with yet another popular cheerleader, has Summer conflicted. It sounds like Nick is trying to make a new name for himself, but is it really that simple? Can he really turn over a new leaf and show Summer heâ€™s someone worth spending time with? Is Summer willing to risk it all to find out if Nick has really changed?",
