  "description": "The wildest heart can’t outrun love. Wolf Town After years of hiding from other mind controllers, loneliness drives Scott to break his own rule and allow himself to fall asleep in a stranger’s arms. Rory’s been keeping an eye on Scott for his pack alpha. Seduction wasn’t part of the plan, but now maintaining distance isn’t an option. No matter how far or fast Scott runs… Push Pull For Rory, life is all about connections. But for Scott, connections spell danger—for himself and everyone he cares about. The bottom line is, Scott has only a small window of time to treasure every moment with his lover. Yet when a shadow from the past inevitably appears, he discovers he can’t just cut and run. Moon Run Wolf Town never quite felt like home to Iain—until he bonds with Teo. Yet the scars of his past mangle his declaration of love. The young wolf’s fumbling explanation for his attraction only serves to remind Teo why it’s a bad idea to date within the pack. Teo’s apparent rejection not only breaks Iain’s heart, it triggers a deep-seated desperation that pushes him to take a terrible chance to show Teo their shared link is no illusion. Warning: Contains explicit m/m sex, a relationship that starts out on the wrong paw, bone-cracking violence and howling-hot, full-body-contact wolf lovin’.",
