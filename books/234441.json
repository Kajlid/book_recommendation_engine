  "description": "​Bradley Fitch has it all. A suave job, a gigantic trust fund, and an accent that makes panties drop faster than the speed of light. His new life in New York City is fast-paced and furious, but it's nothing a little getaway can't cure.  What says party and unwind like Las Vegas? Nothing. Plus, whatever happens there has to stay there.  When his best friend bails, he finds himself sitting on the plane next to his best friend's sister.  She’s off-limits—proverbial caution tape wrapped around her body. Of course, she’s also totally ball busting gorgeous.  Lexi Quinn fell in love with Bradley at eight years old and then vowed to kill him at eight and a half. What was supposed to be a romantic week away is turning into a nightmare. Her ex is actually married, her luggage is lost, and her reservation is cancelled. And she's sitting next to the man she swore to hate forever  One week. No strings attached. What is the worst that could happen?  It's all fun and games till this British bad boy gives new meaning to BBC and becomes a little bit too cheeky.",
