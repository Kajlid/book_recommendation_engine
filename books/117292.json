  "description": "LOVE'S COURAGEChelsea Brown had never had much luck with men until she bumped heads with Griffin Campbell--a Highlander who set her head spinning and her heart racing. Visiting the wilds of Scotland, the Texan scientist had expected a different breed of man, but Griffin proved to be in a category all his own. First he kissed her senseless, then he destroyed the television, gallantly vowing to protect her from the miniature barbarians in the box.Breathless with confusion--or was it desire?--Chelsea found herself wrapped not only in his arms, but in the past. Transported to a place where the Scottish warrior's very life depended on her, the once shy Chelsea knew she would face any challenge to rescue the powerful clan leader. For it was his desire that transformed her timidity to bravery, his passion that convinced her their romance was no Highland fling, but a timeless love.",
