  "title": "Titanic Style: Dress and Fashion on the Voyage",
  "description": "Titanic Style explores the world of fashion and dress at the time of RMS Titanic ’s famous voyage. With stunning images and enlightening historical analysis, this book takes us through the wardrobes of passengers and crew of all classes and ages, from the most intimate undergarments to the warm overcoats needed on that last fearful, cold night.The ship was a microcosm of post-Edwardian society, in which everyone belonged to a particular class and dressed accordingly. The luxurious attire of the ladies in first class, the cream of European and American society, was changed several times a day, while the more sober and conservative clothes of the men of all ranks subtly conveyed their status, and children were dressed to enhance their social standing.We also visit the families below deck, dressed in second-hand or homemade clothes, heading for a new life in a country free of repressive class distinction. Stories and records of individual passengers and crew members are woven into the narrative to give an engaging account of what life was really like onboard the world’s most famous ocean liner.Whether you are a Titanic enthusiast, a fashion lover, or both, this book will delight you with exquisite garments and the absorbing cultural history behind them.",
