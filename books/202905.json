Back up that hill path to the site of his terror, to live with the parent who caused it.The boy tries to escape. He flees to a gang of local children but they can't help him. The town refuses to see his danger. He is alone.Then a stranger arrives. A stranger who claims his job is to ask questions, seek truth. Who can, perhaps, offer safety. Or whose offer may be something altogether different, something safety is no part of.In This Census-Taker , multiple award-winning writer China Miéville offers a story made of secrets and subtle reveals, of tragedy and bravery, of mysteries that shift when they appear to be known. It is a stunning work, full of strangeness and power.",
