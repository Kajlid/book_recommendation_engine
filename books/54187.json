  "description": "Harold Harper is slowly losing his grip. Day by day, he loses ground in a battle with dementia, a hard fact his wife, Aileen, can neither ignore nor control. But then Alex Porter enters their lives. Just two years out of college and trapped in an unfulfilling job, young Alex is an unlikely ally. He's also blessed with a rare, almost supernatural talent and may just be the Harpers' last hope. Harold, Aileen and the magnetic Alex come together with an scatter-shot team of small-town neighbors, all bent on stalling Harold's decline and keeping the couple from losing it all. In the midst of their singular journey, the newfound friends laugh, hope, hurt, grow and discover love in surprising ways. Misplaced Clarity is a riveting tale of heartbreak, hope and self discovery, of seven lives that collide and intertwine for better and worse.",
