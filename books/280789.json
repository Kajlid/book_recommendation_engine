Now I’m on the suspect list! Okay, so I just need to find the killer, clear my name, and pass my witches exam. Oh, didn’t I mention that? Yeah, seems the stunt I pulled on my cheating ex-fiancee cost me not only my job but my magic.My name is Harper Jones and this is not how I expected my return to my magical hometown of Whitefall Cove to go.",
