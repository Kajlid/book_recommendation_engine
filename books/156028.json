For what it truly is, is a story about two people in love, and that dear reader is exactly, what love is. Love is a feeling, one that you can’t explain, between two members of the human race. If you can explain it, it is called friendship.The story is a continuation of book three with no lapse in time.

Their excitement is slightly tempered by the recent death of Suzy’s ex-husband, and the only man that either girl ever loved.
