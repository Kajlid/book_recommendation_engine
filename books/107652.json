I thought I’d found the woman I wanted to spend my life with, you have to open your eyes to realize that it’s never gonna happen.Funny how meeting the right person can finally make you see sense.My name is Noah Taylor: kickass trauma surgeon, closet idealist, wishful thinker, and all round cocky asshole, and this is the year my life will change for the better. *Disclaimer: This book features hot sex, filthy language, misuse of on-call rooms and the overdue redemption of the fake orgasm*",
