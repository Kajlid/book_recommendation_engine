  "description": "Michael Dunlop is quite simply the greatest road racer on the planet. Brother of the terrific rider William, son of the late Robert, and nephew of the late great Joey Dunlop, racing is in his blood. Now for the first time he has agreed to talk in depth about his family story, how he got involved in \"the family business,\" and how he manages to keep getting back on his bike despite all he knows of the deadly risks he encounters every time he crosses the start line. The death of his uncle during a competition in Estonia in 2000 was followed just eight years later by the death of his father at the North West 200. But despite these tragic losses Michael was undeterred and in 2008, months after his fatherâ€™s death, he went on to compete in the Senior TT, where he recorded the fastest lap and finished 10th overall. The next year Michael returned and won the event, joining both his father and uncle in the record books. With 13 TT wins to his name, Michael is a phenomenal competitor, and in this sensational autobiography he reveals the highs and lows of racing, what it was like growing up part of a motorcycle dynasty, and how that made him the incredible racing driver he is today.",
