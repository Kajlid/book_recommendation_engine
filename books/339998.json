There are dangers looming that threaten to tear us apart, and I think, just maybe, one of them could be me.This is book 2 of Hunter and Grace's story. Book 1 - Heron Mill must be read first.This was not a planned continuation, meaning book 1 - Heron Mill can still be read and enjoyed as a standalone if you so wish.The Blackwell Brothers is a series of interconnected standalones, but each book can be read individually.*Please read with caution, this is a dark gothic horror romance, the characters in this book do not and will not conform to society's standards or normalities. This book does have a happy ever after.*",
