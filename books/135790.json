  "title": "The Consciousness Company",
  "description": "In the suburbs of near-future London, two childhood friends discuss the creation of a technology company that elevates awareness and well-being.What begins in a garage grows into a ubiquitous enterprise that changes what it means to be alive. The Consciousness Company is a funny, philosophical and prophetic story about companies without limits, and technology that can rewire minds. On the way to a New York stock market listing, the company’s founders join forces with a sceptical investor, a venture capital fund impressed by their early success, and an ethics committee buckling under its godlike responsibility. As the company’s artificial intelligence reads, analyses and inserts thoughts into its members’ minds, the lines between individuals blur, and the company's users wade through their own psyches, guided by devices that know them better than they know themselves. A question lingers—in what form will humanity survive after all this? Step into The Consciousness Company and lose yourself in the substance of existence.",
