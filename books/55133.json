  "description": "Morgan le Fay is the neglected daughter of the Duke of Cornwall and his beautiful wife Ygerne. Her childhood is tragically altered when King Uther Pendragon sets eyes on her mother. He kills her adored father. By Merlyn's magic, he enters the convent of Tintagel and tricks Ygerne into giving him a child. Morgan's upbringing, and that of her sisters, is in the hands of their nurse. Gwennol is a wise woman, who teaches them her craft. But she soon realises that Morgan will become far more powerful in magic than herself. How will Morgan react when the baby Arthur is born?",
