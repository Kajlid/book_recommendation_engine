Unfortunately that lifestyle came to an abrupt end for Marcus when his life was turned upside down by his sire. Now in a new city, a new home, he hopes to make a fresh start. Set on some big changes in her own life, Christina Prescott’s plans are sidetracked when she meets the rich and powerful Marcus. As the nurse mends the Alpha’s broken heart, he isn’t the only one who needs healing when a depraved darkness seeps into their lives. As passion burns between the two, evil works to smother the flame of love and separate the heartmates for its own gain. With his heartmate missing, Marcus fears his claim to everlasting love will be destroyed and he will be damned to a life of insanity without Christina.",
