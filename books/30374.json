  "title": "No Longer at Ease",
  "description": "In Obi Okonkwo, we meet a hero whose foreign education has separated him from his African roots and made him part of a rulig elite whose corruption he finds repugnant. The agony of choosing between traditional values and the demands of a changing world is dramatized by Achebe with unequaled clarity and poignancy. More than twenty years after its writing, Achebe's depiction of Obi Okonkwo's dilemma remains a brilliant statement of the challenge facing African society.",
