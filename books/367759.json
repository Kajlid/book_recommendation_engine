  "title": "Horseradish: Bitter Truths You Can't Avoid",
  "description": "Lemony Snicket's work is filled with bitter truths, 'It is always cruel to laugh at people, of course, although sometimes if they are wearing an ugly hat it is hard to control yourself.' 'It is very easy to say that the important thing is to try your best, but if you are in real trouble the most important thing is not trying your best, but getting to safety.' For all of life's ups and downs, its celebrations and its sorrows, here is a book to commemorate it all â€“ especially for those not fully soothed by chicken soup. Witty and irreverent, Horseradish is a book with universal appeal, a delightful vehicle to introduce Snicket's uproariously unhappy observations to a crowd not yet familiar with the Baudelaires' misadventures.",
