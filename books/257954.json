  "title": "The Captain of Betrayal",
  "description": "Once bitten, twice shy...  At the age of eight and twenty, Polly Jenkins has happily resigned herself to the life of a spinster. Many years ago, a young man broke her heart, and she has guarded it fiercely ever since. Polly's life, on the coast of Cornwall, is one of peaceful happiness--until, that is, Captain James Black arrives at her door. The young man she once knew is gone, replaced by a dashing Captain--one who is determined to marry her, and who won't take no for an answer...  Captain James Black had lived a life most men would envy as a decorated war hero with wealth and charm at his disposal. Despite all this, the illegitimate son of the Earl of Ludlow, was missing one thing; Polly Jenkins. Many years ago he betrayed her terribly and now that he had found her again, James was determined to put things right and to put a ring on Polly's finger. True, his intended bride seemed more than a little reluctant, but Captain Black was more than prepared to go to battle for her heart.   This sweet Regency Romance can be read as a stand-alone novel, or as part of a series.",
