  "description": "Being the last male standing isn’t always what it’s cracked up to be. Mikah Malloy is living proof. His mother and father were both killed during their individual attempts to assassinate the pride leader of Ariel Estates, Silas Murdoch. Now after the dust has settled on his bloodstained family’s name, Mikah must face life alone among his fellow lion shifters. But Silas and his mate, Theo, have decided a vacation in Alaska is just what the doctor ordered to help Mikah come to terms with his grief and his plans for the future. The only snag with their plan is trouble always has a way of finding Mikah, no matter where he runs.  Gideon Haven, eldest son of the Haven pack's alpha, would give his soul for a way off the ice. But when a hunter is out to eradicate his pack one by one, skinning them alive for their wolf pelts, Gideon can’t just walk away.  The predators have now become the prey, but they're determined to hunt down the poacher out to slaughter Theo and Gideon's pack. As for Mikah, he’s more than ready for the job. Putting one's life on the line isn’t a hardship when you don’t care whether you live or die. Even though the heat between Gideon and Mikah becomes nearly impossible to resist, Mikah is determined the tenacious wolf isn’t about to get close enough to break the ice around his heart.",
