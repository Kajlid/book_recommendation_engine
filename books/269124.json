  "description": "All our lives, we’ve been looking for how we can be happy and successful at work and in life, when all along the answer is just there in the attitudes that we use in our daily lives.This explains why there are people who seemed to be already up there in heaven, but because their attitudes are yet so wrong, you will see them still ever complaining.On the other hand, there are people who seemed to be already down there in the dump, but because their attitudes are yet so right, you will see them still ever smiling as if everything is alright.To be happy and successful at work and in life, what we need are “RIGHT ATTITUDES,” not a perfect environment that can only come with the perfection of the heart and mind.Be one of the ATTITUDINALISTS! —“The happiest and most successful employees in the world!”",
