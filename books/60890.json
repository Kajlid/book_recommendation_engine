  "description": "Leatherman Mason—The Fancy Man—is used to strange requests, but the one from Charles Beaumont, a masochist from the Deep South, is the strangest yet. Long troubled by the fact that his ancestors were slave owners, Charles wants Mason punish him for his family’s sins. Despite his misgivings, Mason is drawn to this young white Southern gentleman. Mason agrees to take on the challenge of exorcizing Charles' ghosts, but he soon learns that freeing a modern slave from the chains of the past isn’t so easy—nor will it leave the modern man playing his Master unchanged. (M/M)",
