  "description": "Bartholomew Trottier could not take his eyes or his thoughts away from the beautiful redhead at his fellow Brethren’s wedding. Everything in him urged him to get to know her even if it was on her terms. However, things beyond their control forced Bart to push up his timetable for allowing her to come to him on her terms. Would she accept him or would he spend the rest of his life without her? Lisa Ratcliff trusted no one. She let no one get close enough to hurt her. She said what she thought and damned the consequences if someone did not like it. When she saw the gorgeous man with blond hair and a full beard at her friend’s wedding, she was more than ready for a casual relationship. But, things were not all that they seemed. Was she ready to give her heart to someone and could she trust again?",
