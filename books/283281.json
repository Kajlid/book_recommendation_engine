  "title": "Notes on Uncommon Love: A Poetry Collection",
  "description": "This is Sylvia Beckett Davidson's first poetry collection, covering her experiences with people, love and relationships with herself over the past few years. Raw, tender and sweet pieces describing life's lessons from her rocky past, her intense and almost spiritual healing, and the joys of being a survivor who has finally gotten back control. The collection is split into three sections: Before, During and After, spanning those the climb towards her late-blooming peak, interspersed with short anecdotes and contemplations.",
