What's more, the breakdown of their marriage is a bitter truth that undermines Alejandro's every achievement.Alejandro's opportunity for justice comes when the private detective he's hired pinpoints Jemima's whereabouts…and delivers the news that she has a two-year-old son. Clearly her wanton ways have led to an illegitimate birth…. But no matter: Alejandro is determined to settle the score with his runaway wife.",
