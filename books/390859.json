  "title": "Meg and Mog",
  "description": "Meg and Mog is the first in the long-standing series about a witch (Meg) and her cat (Mog). Meg is a cute well-meaning witch who lives with Mog and her owl. In Meg and Mog, we are introduced to a witch wardrobe and a witch's breakfast. Later Meg flies off to meet her witch friends for some spell-making at a Halloween Party. Unfortunately the spell does not go exactly to plan... The illustration is simple and with very bold, deep colours. Designed specifically to appeal to very young children, Meg and Mog has short simple sentences on each page, allowing the illustration to play an important part in the storytelling.  If you enjoy the first Meg and Mog, enjoy more adventures in Meg on the Moon and Mog at the Zoo. (Ages 1 to 3 years.) --Victoria MacKenzie",
