  "description": "Deals made when you're drunk don't count, right? Wrong. At least according to mob boss Duke Toscani. Our alcohol-induced agreement is simple – He's mine and I'm his.What he doesn't realize though is I'm a package deal. My grandmother took care of me when I was orphaned, and now it's my turn to take care of her. Even if I have to work three jobs and skip a few meals and good nights' sleep to do it. She may believe in Christmas miracles, but I'll need a lot more than Santa's elves to save me from the man on the very top of the naughty list.Author’s note: Garnish with a Candy Cane is fun, funny, and completely safe, if not totally sane standalone novella. Celebrate the holiday season with a guaranteed happily ever after romance.",
