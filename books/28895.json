  "description": "When Lacey loses control of her vehicle and finds herself trapped by ice and snow, she knows there's only one person to call for help. Unfortunately, Michael may cause more turmoil than relief. She's lusted for the gorgeous Dom ever since she first laid eyes on him. Trouble is, he doesn't do vanilla and she's not a submissive…or is she?Michael's hungered for Lacey for months,so when he notices her fleeting glimpses and blush-stained cheeks as he rescues her from an altercation with a guardrail, he decides it's time to push the sultry beauty's boundaries…only to discover Lacey's not as reserved as she thinks.Physical attraction blossoms into something neither anticipates, taking Michael and Lacey beyond kink, dominance, and submission. Their newfound connection is strong until a flame from Michael's past returns, shatters the fragile trust he and Lacey have only just developed, and threatens to destroy something neither wants to surrender.",
