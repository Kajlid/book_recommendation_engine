  "description": "Dr. Arya Krish, an accomplished researcher, physician, philanthropist, father, and husband explores the outer edges of \"the ends justify the means\" in Being and Becoming .Having cultivated Beacon Medical Institute into a premier research group and medical center, he dedicates his life and resources to humanitarian projects at home and abroad. As a result, Dr. Krish finds himself entangled not only in an internal conflict of choice and action, but also the murky realm of corporate espionage, corrupt bureaucracy, philanthropy, and medical breakthrough. All the while, his family's past haunts him and ultimately drives his being and becoming.The writing has a literary thread; choice and morality are explored within plot lines and primary character development, both in context of personal justice and retribution, and in the realm of modern medicine. Arya Krish evolves in the process of negotiating the practical and moral dilemmas surrounding his philanthropic, humanitarian, and medical science/technology ventures.",
