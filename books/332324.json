  "description": "If you never fooled around with someone of the same gender, did you even go to high school?PEYTONMy whole life I’ve had the pressure of being Marcus Talon and Shane Miller’s football prodigy. I’ve been destined to follow in my NFL-playing fathers’ footsteps since the day I was born. I usually thrive under pressure, but as senior year looms, it all gets too much, and I need an outlet. The last place I thought I’d find my release is at Levi Vanderbilt’s graduation party. In his bed. With him.It’s a one-time thing. An experimentation. And while it was fun, we agree that being with guys isn’t for either of us. I’m happy to accept that until he turns up in California.I haven’t had to think about him for four years, but now I can’t get him out of my head. LEVIComing to Franklin University for grad school to follow a boy I hooked up with once is the stupidest thing I could have done.We said that high school didn’t mean anything, but the truth is, that night made me realize who I truly am, and since then, I’ve been trying to find that sense of freedom again.I’m hoping it can be with him, but everything I’ve heard around campus points to Peyton not having the same life-changing revelation I did.And if that’s the case, did I just move across the country for a straight guy?Kill me now.",
