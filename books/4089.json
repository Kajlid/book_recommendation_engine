  "description": "Maya Andreyeva is a \"camera\", a reporter with virtual reality broadcasting equipment implanted in her brain. What she sees, millions see; what she feels, millions share.And what Maya is seeing is the cover-up of a massacre. As she probes into the covert political power plays of a radically strange near-future Russia, she comes upon secrets that have been hidden from the world… and memories that AI-controlled thought police have forced her to hide from herself. Because in a world where no thought or desire is safe, the price of survival is betrayal—of your lover, your ideals, and yourself.In The Fortunate Fall, we hear a new voice so assured and so intimate it seems we must always have known it, and so electrifying we know we have never before heard its like.",
