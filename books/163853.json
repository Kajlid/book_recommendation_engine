  "description": "This Braden novella features Kat Martin, Brianna Heart's best friend from Hearts at Play (The Bradens, #6) with appearances from the hot, wealthy, and wickedly naughty Bradens you know and love. Kat Martin knows what she wants in a man—someone stable and adoring, definitely not the type of guy who sleeps around. After all, Kat rarely does the wrong thing—until she meets seductively enticing Eric James, and suddenly wrong has never felt so right. When it comes to his career, race-car driver Eric James is intense, obsessive, and passionate, but when it comes to sex, there's only one kind—daring, unbridled, and no-strings-attached. One stormy night, a delayed flight and the dangerous allure of the unknown leads Kat to throw caution to the wind, and she indulges in a rendezvous that she vows to immediately forget—but the secret tryst stirs something possessive in Eric, and forgetting is not an option.",
