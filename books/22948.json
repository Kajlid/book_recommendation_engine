  "title": "The Phallus Palace: Female to Male Transsexuals",
  "description": "The Phallus Palace is a bold approach to the subject of female to male transexuals (FTMs). Personal testaments from FTMs and contributions from a host of others place the subject of transsexualism into a historical, medical,psychological and cultural context. Captivating photographs guide the reader from the FTMs female personae, through surgical operations, to portraits of the men whose self and public identities are finally revealed as one. Dean Kotula has worked as a documentary photographer for twenty years. Dean changed his sex from female to male under the scrutinizing eyes of 2,000 predominantly male shipyard workers while working as a machinist. The ensuing ordeal prompted him to create this book A native Minnesotan, Dean now resides in Massachusetts where he co-owns an antique business.",
