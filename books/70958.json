  "description": "When we talk, we tell stories and present ideas--rarely with much anxiety. But think about writing something and panic sets in. Overcome this crippling response by learning how to \"talk\" on paper. Joel Saltzman tells it like it is--with compassion, humor, and the \"uncommon wisdom\" of famous writers, artists, and musicians. Based on his popular workshop for the UCLA Writers' Program, this is a program with proven results.",
