  "description": "AFTER THE NUCLEAR AGE CAME THE STONE AGEIn the little band that survived the Nuclear War, humanity had reverted to barbarism, and all the evils of the old society had grown worse. Sunny, a lone woman survivor, had been seized by four men who informed her that they were all her husbands, and had quickly realized that she was in the hands of a colony of male chauvinist pigs. When the survivors had organized, the men had far outnumbered the women. They createda family structure that supported male dominance without limit. By their decree women existed only to serve. Sunny was forced to conform to this murderous doctrine. She struggled--- and was beaten into passivity; ran away---and was brought back; then she found a gun---and what she did then is a story in itself.(Back Cover)tuhi",
