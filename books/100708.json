  "description": "Gwen Ryan is now in L.A., with its glorious beaches and laid back attitude. But past events have taken their toll, and she's clinging to her tough girl persona with both fingernails. The FBI is no place for weaklings, and so Gwen hides her dark, seething needs deep within her. But then she's called into a white slavery case, and her control is shattered by Tiffany, a twisted victim of cruel men. Agony and ecstasy roll over the helpless Agent Ryan as she is taken prison by the demented girl. Yet worse is to come when she finds herself imprisoned by the very slavers she is hunting, slavers determined to break her as they had Tiffany. Gwen is a lot tougher than Tiffany, but her own twisted needs might well betray her.Word Count: 39400",
