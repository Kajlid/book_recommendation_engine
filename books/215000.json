  "title": "Joan of Arc",
  "description": "Joan was an innocent French farm girl of thirteen when heavenly voices called to her and gave her the courage to fight for her king. She would leave her home, cut her hair and dress like a man, and journey far and wide to fight for her noble cause. But even after Joan was captured and about to be put to death by her enemies, she remained true to her beliefs and died holding on to a simple cross. She would later become one of the most revered of all saints and a heroine to young and old alike. This is the enthralling true story of Joan of Arc told by gifted storyteller Josephine Poole and magnificently illustrated by award-winning artist Angela Barrett in what is sure to be one of the finest, most beautiful picture books of the year. Included are end-paper maps and a chronology of events for readers to follow Joan on her quest.",
