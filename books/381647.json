  "description": "What's it really like to be addicted to heroin and crack cocaine? Tia L. Lincoln gives us an extraordinarily charged new account of drug addiction, poverty, and the struggle of survival. \"Poochie\" a bookworm and dreamer, struggles with confusion about her proper place in the world. Then one day she tries heroin and suddenly sees her path. Her journey of self discovery begins with isolation, extreme restrictions, beatings, group homes, and years of self hatred. It ends with jails, rapes, povery, and a downward spiral into drug addiction. Freebasing, shooting up, sniffing dope, Poochie has done it all. By the time she is twenty one, she is addicted to heroin and crack cocaine and the mother of four young children. When she comes blasting into a local hospital's emergency room at the age of thirty three, Poochie had destroyed most of her body, mind, and soul beyond repair. She faced a devastating choice, accept that she won't see thirty four or accept the reality of her life and take drastic action. Junkie-A True Baltimore Story is the powerful, heartbreaking, uncensored true story of how a young woman struggles with drug addiction and impossible odds. It's this generation's most honest, eye-opening approach about drug dependency and survival in the drug plagued, violent streets of Baltimore.",
