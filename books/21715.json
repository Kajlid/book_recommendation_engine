  "title": "Hachi-Ko: The Samurai Dog",
  "description": "Hachi-Ko, the samurai dog of Japan, became a celebrity in Tokyo during the turbulent 1930s. He was honored by a statue and a special celebration with thousands of guests even while he was living as a wild street dog in a drainpipe. Once the cherished pet of Professor Eizaburo Ueno, Hachi-Ko won fame among young and old for his undying loyalty to the memory of his master. He returned like clockwork to meet the commuter train at Shibuya Train Station at the same time every day for seven years, despite battles with delinquents, dogcatchers, and vicious strays who threatened him and his friends. Faithful to his death, Hachi-Ko is famous even today as the Akita samurai dog of Japan. Shizuko O. Koster, author of the award-winning non-fiction story The Day Mother Sold the Family Swords, ventures back to her mother s generation to tell the whole story of Tokyo s four-legged Hachi-Ko.",
