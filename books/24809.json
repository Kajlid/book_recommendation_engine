  "description": "Kat Kong is a funny picture book from the genius mind of Dav Pilkeyâ€”creator of laugh-out-loud kid favorites including Captain Underpants and Dog Man. When the fearsome Kat Kong wreaks havoc on the rodent citizens of Mousopolis (all played by Pilkey's own pets in mixed-media photographic illustrations) someone must halt the massive meowing menace before it's too late! But is anyone clever enough to halt this massive meowing menace? For kids not quite ready to enter the chapter book world, Kat Kong is a winner. This silly spoof of King Kong has all of the zany cat-and-mouse action you'd expect from Dav Pilkey, creator of the bestselling Dog Man and Captain Underpants series.",
