  "description": "Her mother recently deceased, Rachel sets off alone for her family’s isolated country house in order to pack up and sell off the remnants of her estate. She tells herself the process will only take a few weeks, but from the moment she steps through the front door, Rachel feels that the house contains more than she had expected. Along with the memories of her mother, there is something else in the house, a presence trying to make itself felt. As Rachel struggles to put her mother’s affairs in order, she grows ever more convinced that the house holds a message for her. Can the ghosts of the past be nudging their way into the present, or is Rachel really beginning to lose her mind?",
