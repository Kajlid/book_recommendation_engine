  "description": "New Haven police reporter Annie Seymour has a talent for running into trouble. So it should come as no surprise when her co-worker’s bachelorette party at a local club quickly turns into a crime scene. What is surprising is that the dead club manager in the parking lot happens to be Annie's ex-husband—and the bullet shells around his body match the gun she has in her car. Coming face to face with her past, Annie delves into a conspiracy involving everyone from a male stripper to a shot girl. If she wants to get the story, she’ll have to escape a killer—before she becomes the next headline.",
