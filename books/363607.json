  "description": "The stories in Whispers from the Camps are harrowing accounts from children who survived being captured and imprisoned in Nazi concentration camps. Stripped of their clothes, their possessions, and, in many cases, their families, they nevertheless held on to the hope of freedom. Despite the insurmountable odds against survival, these children lived to tell their tales in the second installment of the Whispers series.",
