  "description": "Librarian note: alternative cover edition - ISBN13 9781310175817 The Order of Constantine thrives even 300 years after it was founded, but now its entire network of power is threatened as its anchor is awakening. The dracos created by the Order are doing all they can to make sure the anchor, Ava, will remember the events that occurred in 1807, back in her first life. If Ava remembers and does not lose her control again, the Order might finally be pushed to extinction. But, with every memory unlocked from an era long gone, the need to kill becomes stronger and Ava turns into the killer she was meant to be. Jonathan, the first draco created, does not want to see another one of his plans against the Order fail. Mark, a draco created during the American Revolutionary War, still holds a grudge against his maker. And Rene, a witch descendent of Amara, saw her sister being murdered by the Order who now does not control colonies as in Amara's time, but controls oil and diamond resources",
