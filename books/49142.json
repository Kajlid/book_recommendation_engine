  "description": "Official Description: There is a rainforest in India that the wise poachers avoid. Few who venture in ever return, and those that do rarely come back all the way. The leopards in this forest have a protector who walks the worlds between leopard and man, but who calls the leopard kin and the human only enemy. When a frightened boy escapes from the latest hunting party to feel the protector's wrath, he tracks the boy down, determined to leave no survivors. But when he comes fact-to-face with the exotic, defenseless boy, he cannot bring himself to end that life. Instead, what he has reviled for years becomes his constant companion. That is, until the humans dare to set foot in his forest once more.Original Prompt: Dear Author,Hmmm, I can almost taste him on the wind now. He's so close. I've been tracking him for days, his scent is driving me wild for the last few miles. He's good, damn good â€“ but I'm better.
