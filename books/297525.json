  "description": "Blurb:Ally When it comes to absolution, there are are two things you must do to find it- facing your fears, and moving forward from your past. Honestly, it isn't for me. I'll never find it because I'm a piece of flesh who's a shell of a woman. In a sense, I'm merely a ghost.In all my life, I've only ever felt peace once.Although, I'm sure I'll never feel it again since the one who brought it into my life has his own demons. Monsters that are almost as horrific as mine. I only wonder . . . if a second chance came along . . . would it be possible for us both to find the salvation we deserve, or are we eternally damned by those who hurt us? If only time were on our side. If that was the case, I think I'd know the answer.",
