  "description": "Love is never beautiful.  It's dirty, and raw, and broken. That's what makes it perfect. It's two broken pieces forming together to make something whole, something worth fighting for.  Axel Wraithe is my other piece. He's the biker who's been hunting me for a year, yet he's the one who can so easily break me.  He wants what I have, and I want what he's got to give. Only he's fighting against himself, not willing to give it.  He's got monsters in his heart, changing who he is, changing what he believes in. I'm the only one who can help him, and I won't stop until I've got the truth.  I want to fix what's broken, but I can't do that without him.  So I'll fight for my gorgeous, broken biker. I'll fight until our pieces fit back together.",
