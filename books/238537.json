Sure, they both have so much to lose, but no one will ever know...As Dante and Cade’s taboo affair heats up off the ice and their relationship gets more and more intense, they’ll have to decide: is love worth risking their careers? Or is this romance destined to be forever benched?Catch up with Cade and Dante in their bonus novella, Wrapped Up in You.",
