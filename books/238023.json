  "description": "The world seems to be muddling along toward chaos, as usual, when the apocalypse arrives—probably by accident. Maybe. Actually, apocalypse is a pretty melodramatic term to use when only one species is near extinction, even if that’s the species that keeps score. This story is really about reconstruction, anyway. The situation is complicated by a life-extending drug that works sometimes—not very often. Do you think we could build a better world? We can’t do much worse—check the news.",
