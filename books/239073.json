Curvy Naomi Edwardson is working two jobs just to make ends meet. She has given up on her dream of being an artist - until she gets a life-changing offer for one of her paintings. There’s only one catch: the mysterious billionaire wants to meet her in person.  Gregory Drago is a dragon shifter who’s quickly running out of time. If he doesn’t find his mate soon, he’ll lose control over his dragon’s storm power - and he'll lose his mind, or worse. That's when he comes across a mysterious painting of his dragon in a gallery. And not only is the artist the most gorgeous woman he’s ever seen, but his dragon immediately recognizes her as his mate. Now surely all that's left before his happy ending is to show her his home and hope that a human can find happiness in the peaceful shifter town.  But Gregory isn't the only dragon who's taken an interest in Naomi's painting. When a powerful fire dragon kidnaps Naomi, will Gregory be strong enough to save her? And can the strength of the sizzling connection between them protect their home from their ruthless enemy?  Mated to the Storm Dragon is a sizzling hot, standalone BBW dragon shifter romance.
