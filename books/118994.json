  "description": "Mikhail Sholokhov's story of the years in which the Russia of today was created has, with justice, been compared to Tolstoy's War and Peace. Here are the Cossacks in peace, in war, and in revolution. Here are the peasants of the Don Steppes, barbarous, compassionate, unpredictable, portrayed with astounding vitality and eloquence.",
