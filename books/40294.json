  "title": "All the Dead are Here",
  "description": "17 short stories based before, during, and after the Zombie Apocalypse. They contain horror, action, comedy, and personal tragedy, exploring the breadth of human experience and emotion in this most inhuman of situations. Known for forging a path away from established Zombie stereotypes, this book contains 9 previously available works that have been professionally edited and, in some cases rewritten. Then there are an additional 8 previously unpublished works in this collection that represents all of Pete Bevan's Zombie fiction in one spine chilling tome of 85,000 words. The collection also contains all three parts of his acclaimed ‘Minister’ series.Due to the subject matter and language used this book is not recommended for the under 18’s. Not unless they’ve been really bad.You are a truly outstanding writer. As several others have posted when I see your name attached to a story I know it is going to be fantastic.Comment by Terry Schultz",
