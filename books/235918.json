  "description": "One thing stands between the djinni warlords and their dominion of Earth—spray paint.In the secret recesses of New York City, King Cage battles the djinn, a race of ageless elementals who seek to make our world slave to their desires. Only the King can stop them. Not with his brawn or his brain, but his art. Night after night, the djinn press into our world where the veil is weakest. And night after night, the King paints, capturing the essence of those who would break through in his graffiti, trapping them there for good.But when a street kid steals his cans in the middle of binding a particularly ferocious djinni, the King must race against time to take back his supplies and finish the piece. If he doesn’t, the djinni will kill thousands. Millions. Maybe everyone, everywhere.The King had better get his cans back soon.King Cage is a superhero urban fantasy series in the vein of The Dark Knight Returns, Daredevil, and Legion, fusing electrifying action sequences, realistic characters, and daring, original storytelling. Follow the King through abandoned train stations, collapsed sewers, forgotten dungeons, and ancient ruins deep below New York City, to worlds where the djinn rule and their Ashen Lord’s dominion is absolute. Can the King stop the horde before they overrun the city, the country, and the world?",
