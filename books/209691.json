  "description": "Two elderly scientists hide a dark secret. Twenty-five years earlier they were part of a UK government which legalised all recreational drugs. After only two years, the controversial law, ‘The Fairfield Act’ was repealed. The aftermath was disastrous.Now it is 2042 and no one speaks of the past. The UK is within the Northern Zone, controlled from London-Centre, a utilitarian mega-city rebuilt for the new order. Citizens in the Northern Zone live only according to the Prime Mandates. They’ve lost the ability to create. For them, pleasure is a forgotten emotion.'The Inhibited' is a futuristic diary following the life of Declan Smith and Hazel Tulse, two aggrieved students intent on uncovering the truth. Both believe the key to change lies in understanding the past, but they soon find out the greater challenge is the discovery of their souls.",
