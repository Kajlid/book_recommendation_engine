  "description": "Lotus  I had a list.  A simple list of things I learned to avoid in order meet the future Mr. Bishop.  Easy?  Sure, it sounded easy enough.Until my brother’s best friend walked into town with his arrogant words and controlling actions.He’s everything my list tells me I shouldn’t want. He’s his own sort of broken, and every fiber in my being warns me to stay away, keep my distance . . . then he gifts me with one of his rare smiles and I can’t seem to remember the reasons I should stay away. Instead, I slowly start thinking of all the reasons not to.  Beckett  Those eyes . . . my favorite shade of blue. My blue eyed girl’s all grown up, and just like when we were kids, one look and I’m completely wrapped around her sweet little pinky. She’s off limits, completely unobtainable, but with her wild curls and sassy mouth she damn near slays me with a single glance. I promised myself I would keep my distance, I’m damaged goods and everything wrong for her, but the longer I’m around, and the more she’s burrowed into me, I’ve been finding it harder to convince myself of the reasons why I need to push her away. Maybe one little taste couldn’t hurt anyway . . . right?   Due to adult situations and language, this book is recommended for readers 18+.",
