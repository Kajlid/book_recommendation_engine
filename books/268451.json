  "description": "Rhymori--meaning the Realm Under the Kingdoms--is divided into four colonies. The Colony of the Undecided (the people who don't know where they want to go when they die), The Colony of New Beginnings (the people who crave a fresh start every day), the Colony of the Free (the people who can't live with any rules or punishments), and the Colony of the Lawful (the people who cannot live without rules, and appreciate punishments for crime more than anyone else).After working well for many generations, a weakness in the system was brought to light. Including seventeen-year-old Hadley, not all people are meant to fit the molds society has to offer. These people are called Aberrants, and they are prophesied to rise up together and wipe out the government system as Rhymori knows it.As the Last Aberrant, Hadley must destroy the governor's most prized possession, and set the final stages of the Aberrant's plan in motion. But when her closest friends' lives are in jeopardy, will she have the strength to push through even if it means losing everyone she loves?",
