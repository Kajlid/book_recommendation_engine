  "description": "The wild west was a harsh and dangerous place. Where hard men were made, and the law of the land was unforgiving, meted out by either the gun or the noose. In the midst of this was a young boy named Rod McCloud. On the run from those who seek to exploit his special talents, he is rescued by a strange woman named Whisky Jill, who carries around only a surfboard and whip while wearing nothing but a hat and yellow string bikini. Together they go on a spiritual journey through the heart of the American frontier, to discover the ultimate answers to life and existence.",
