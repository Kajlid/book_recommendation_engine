  "description": "Roxana Petrofski is a thirty-five-year-old free-lance journalist for a fashion magazine who pens BDSM erotic literature in her spare time. Michael Johansen is the man she dreams about, her on-again, off-again lover. Currently off-again, Roxie uses all sorts of religious, magical thinking, and masturbatory remedies to keep her spirits positive as she dreams of the moment when they will reunite. The moment arrives in the form of Vicky Abenstance's annual Halloween party. A chance meeting with a now married Michael turns into a weekend get-away at Michael's Adirondack camp. It's not a trick, but a treat, and about to be the best Halloween date ever! Roxie is certain his devotion to her will end his problematic relationship for good and she will no longer be the other woman. Will Michael fulfill every wish for happiness Roxie has ever made, including a perverse thirst for BDSM? Will Michael turn out to be her dream man or will he return to his wife, Dr. Lisa Cockburn? Follow Roxie as she fights a Halloween horror filled battle for the man she loves, and for her happily-ever-after.",
