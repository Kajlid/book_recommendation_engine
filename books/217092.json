  "description": "A PASSIONATE JOURNEYRavyn Verdier was the communications specialist on a mission to test the habitability of Jarved Nine. Damon Brody was the commander sent to rescue her when the rest of her team was mysteriously killed. Trapped on a planet that harbored an unimaginable evil, they must depend on one another, trust each other explicitly.An abandoned city held the key to their survival, but what they found behind its ancient walls defied all their preconceived notions, threatened all they held dear, and tested the very limits of the bond that had formed between them. To succeed, they would have to cast aside their doubts and listen to their hearts. For only when they were linked body and soul --- when they realized love was their greatest weapon --- would they be able to defeat the monstrous force bent on destroying all life.",
