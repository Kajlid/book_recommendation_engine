  "title": "Cat Stories",
  "description": "Cat Stories brings together two centuries of literary homage to the fascinating feline by great writers of every stripe - from Edgar Allan Poe and Walter de la Mare to Damon Runyon and Doris Lessing.Playful kittens and ruthless predators, beloved pets and witches' familiars - cats of all kinds come alive in these pages. Maeve Brennan and Alice Adams movingly explore what cats can mean to their humans; Patricia Highsmith imagines the intriguingly alien feline point of view; Kipling celebrates the independence of cats in his timeless tale, 'The Cat That Walked by Himself'. Cats flaunt their superiority in Angela Carter's bawdy retelling of 'Puss-in-Boots' and Stephen Vincent Ben√©t's uncanny 'The King of the Cats', while humour abounds in stories by comic masters P.G. Wodehouse and Saki. The essential unknowableness of cats can inspire the most exotic flights of fancy: Italo Calvino's secret city of cats in 'The Garden of Stubborn Cats'; the disappearing animal in Ursula K. Le Guin's brain-teasing 'Schrodinger's Cat'; the cartoon rodent and his cartoon nemesis in Steven Millhauser's 'Cat 'n' Mouse'. In these and other stories, this delightful anthology offers cat lovers a many-faceted tribute to the mysterious objects of their affection.",
