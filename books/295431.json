  "description": "From award-winning author Walter Mosley, a brilliant collection of stories featuring unlikely heroes arising from African AmericaBestselling author Walter Mosley long ago proved himself a master of narrative tension, both with his extraordinary fiction and gripping writing for television. The Awkward Black Man collects seventeen of Mosley’s most accomplished short stories to showcase the full range of his remarkable talent.Mosley presents exceptional characters as they struggle to move through the world and navigate relationships, and paints a subtle, powerful portrait of each of these remarkable black people. In \"The Good News Is,\" a man’s insecurity about his weight gives way to a serious illness and the intense loneliness that accompanies it. Deeply vulnerable, he allows himself to be taken advantage of in return for a little human comfort in a raw display of true need. \"Pet Fly,\" previously published in the New Yorker, follows a man working as a mailroom clerk for a big company—a solitary job for which he is overqualified—and the unforeseen repercussions he endures when he attempts to forge a connection beyond the one he has with the fly buzzing around his apartment. And \"Almost Alyce\" chronicles failed loves, family loss, alcoholism, and a Zen approach to the art of begging that proves surprisingly effective.Touching and contemplative, each of these unexpected stories offers the best of one of our most gifted writers.",
