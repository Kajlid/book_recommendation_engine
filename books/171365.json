  "description": "Fights are breaking out between the Dolus and Rotridge packs and the two new alphas, Deek and Bailan, are putting an immediate stop to it. Keegan knows he’s supposed to be at the peace talks to show his support to his alpha and stay till the end, but he’s sure no one would miss an omega like him who acts more like a lone wolf. He sneaks off for a run in the woods only to be chased down by the two big alphas, but they’re not after him to reprimand him. Deek and Bailan are going to seal their pack merger by sharing the little white omega. But when they mark and claim him together, Keegan realizes that his two alphas will be taking more than his body before the night is over.",
