When she decided to have weight-loss surgery, she thought everything would change. But now, nine years later and ten sizes smaller, she has discovered that changing your body doesn't automatically change how you feel about it.Navel Gazing is a funny, passionate and no-holds-barred memoir of one woman's quest to accept her own body image - to feel normal.
