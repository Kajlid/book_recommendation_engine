  "description": "When the Alphan warrior Nakai captures a Xyran pirate ship, the last thing he expects is to have his heart stolen by a beaten, human male named Einian. He’s equally surprised by the ship’s other captive, a badly injured Xyran who’s apparently important to the human Nakai has rescued.  Nakai wants to court Einian and take him as his mate. But he can’t ignore the Xyran Sukh, in part because of Einian’s feelings for him … and in part for reasons Nakai doesn’t even want to admit to himself.  But when Einian’s life is in danger, Alphan and Xyran must work as one to find him, each finally willing to face the attraction between them. But have they left it too late?",
