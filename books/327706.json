  "title": "The Crucifixion of the King of Glory: The Amazing History and Sublime Mystery of the Passion",
  "description": "The Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ are central events in our salvation. Yet few Christians have a good grasp of the first-century historical and religious context in which the Crucifixion took place, nor of its true significance for the people of that timeâ€”and hence for our time as well. Biblical scholar and attorney Dr. Jeannie Constantinou puts modern readers in the center of the events of Christ's Passion, bringing the best of modern scholarship to bear while keeping her interpretation faithful in every particular to the Orthodox Tradition.",
