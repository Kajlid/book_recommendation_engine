  "description": "As the aftershocks of Kalinor’s fall radiate through the realm of Ilyar, Prince Jonas Belgi finds himself fighting a very different war. As he battles for his very soul, powerful forces are in motion to remove him from the world entirely, lest the contradictory magics burning within him engulf all of existence in a conflagration that no one, not even his beloved Hunter Aleksei Drago, could hope to survive.Even as Jonas begins the impossible task of escaping his prison, the Lord Captain is caught up in a savage civil war. As the fractured remnants of the Legion attempt to regroup, seeking refuge from the hordes of rebel soldiers dogging their every step, Aleksei is confronted by a new nemesis, a creature at once invisible and indestructible.Aleksei must be constantly vigilant for the vengeful spirit that stalks him, waiting to catch him off-guard, thus forfeiting both his and Jonas’s lives.Aleksei is torn between his need to find Jonas and commanding the last remnant of the Legion against the Zra-Uul’s rebellion, with its overwhelming numbers and scores of powerful and destructive Magi under the Demon Bael’s command.Having to choose between his heart and his homeland, Aleksei attempts to accomplish the impossible, while always listening for wind.
