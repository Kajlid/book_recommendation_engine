  "description": "Mikayla did not consider herself a feminist. She was unable to see any forms of sexism in society, but one event changes all of that. She is left with an abundance of fear and anger that she does not know what to do with as she starts to realize all of the sexism that still exists in the world. Her mind is warped with the emotional aftermath and comes to the startling conclusion that, had there not been a need for feminism in this day and age, this event would never have occurred in the first place. Mikayla devotes herself to becoming everything she now views as a \"real\" feminist, blind to the fact that these actions are destroying her relationships with the people she loves and ultimately putting her on the path to self-destruction.",
