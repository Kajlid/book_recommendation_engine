Their biracial child reaches out and builds a relationship with her white grandmother who raises her when her parents die.  In the deep South, Ted, a handsome white, upper-class boy, falls in love with Amy, a beautiful African-American girl. They are torn apart by Ted's rich father John. Ted’s mother Emily does nothing to stop the pain, grief, and violence John uses to break up the lovers.  Years later, they reunite. Ted learns that Amy is dying and they have a daughter together. Ted and Katie quickly and naturally fall into their new roles as father and daughter.  Ted's mother, Emily, doesn't want him to marry Amy and raise Katie. Amy dies and Emily won't let Ted bury her in the family plot. Mother and son break off all contact.  Katie earns Emily's respect and slowly wins her over. After she has a change of heart, Emily wants to tell Ted she is sorry, but he's killed in an accident.  Katie loses touch with reality after Ted's death. Emily sets aside her own grief to care for Katie. Emily stands up for Katie against a prejudiced preacher. Emily argues with Ted’s best friend that she is fit to raise Katie and in doing so, faces the harsh reality of her own prejudice.  Emily and Katie, an unusual pair straddling black and white cultures, become close and look after each other through the years.",
