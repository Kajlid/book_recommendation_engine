  "description": "\"Deep always calls unto deep. The results? Reckless Hate & Catastrophe.\"   Westbrook had four boys that ruled my life once.  They were hell raisers.  Cunning Athletes.  Skilled Manipulators.  Hateful Assholes.  Gorgeous gods.  Heartbreakers.  Only I never counted on them breaking my heart as savagely as they did, sending me away when I needed them the most. Making me spiral into a vicious abyss of darkness where I’m haunted by a pair of frosty blue eyes filled with hate.  But now I’m back and this time around, for a reason that makes breathing almost completely impossible.  And if they think I won’t get revenge for my brother—one of the Blue Boys—then they have another kind of hell to face.  Because I’m no longer their little Blue girl from four years ago. . .",
