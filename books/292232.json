  "description": "The adorable little shifter town of Perdition, Texas, turns into a winter wonderland every December.  Which is why minotaur shifter Mitch Wayne has carefully cultivated a Grinchy, grumpy persona for years, keeping carolers, charity solicitations, and holiday invitations at bay. He hated Christmas, and he hated how the town residents lost their ever loving minds this time of year. Every year, he hid in his log cabin mansion outside of town, safe from the merry making, and avoided going into town until after the New Year.  The only thing Mitch hated more than Christmas was having strange people in his space.  So why did he bring a woman stranded on the side of the road during a snowstorm back to his cabin? A woman with the absurd name of Petunia, who was too young, too cheerful, too Christmassy to be endured? A woman who interrupted his solitude with holiday cheer, set off his smoke detectors with her cooking, and fascinated his beast *and* his libido?  And why did he have just one thought when he looked at this annoying little woman:  MINE  Collect all eleven tales in the A Very Alpha Christmas series. Each tale is a standalone and this series does not have to be read in order.  Contains mature themes. Not intended for readers under 18.",
