  "description": "Fergus grew up believing he would never see the world beyond New Peiling... until he found the map to Tír na nÓg. But sometimes adventures don't take us to the place we want to be, but where we need to go. The Knights of Evalach have rounded up the hybrids and sent them away. Those who remain struggle to keep the towering plates of New Peiling upright. Time is short, and there are many wrongs to be righted. But what will Fergus have to give up to put things straight?",
