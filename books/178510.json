  "description": "MURDER IN JACKSON COUNTY    It was an unusually dry spring when the stranger came to Jackson County, Georgia. He called himself Deacon and with only an ingratiating smile and a duffel bag over one shoulder, he easily found his way into the hearts and home of the Sharon Collins' family, even overcoming the suspicious of the farm's resident handyman Dave 'Sparky' Moss.    To the family, he was a godsend. The children were never happier. The farm never ran smoother. Life was idyllic.    And then the murders began. Savage, inexplicable killings committed by formerly rational townspeople that Sheriff Beckett had known all of their lives. An insanity that spread like a plague throughout his beloved town and grew stronger with each passing day    No, a madness had come to 'good ol' J.C.' on the heels of this fair-haired young man. A madness that Deacon knew all too well. And before he could warn them - the new-found family and friends that embraced him - Deacon found that he would have to face his age-old nemesis one more time.    On the day the sun disappeared and Hell came to Jackson County.",
