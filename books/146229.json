  "title": "Society and the Environment: Pragmatic Solutions to Ecological Issues",
  "description": "Talking about global environmental issues need not be an exercise in gloom, doom, and individual sacrifice—as Michael Carolan ably demonstrates in this introduction to environmental sociology.Society and the Environment examines today's environmental controversies within a socio-organizational context. After outlining the contours of \"pragmatic environmentalism,\" Carolan explores the material air, water, biodiversity, and trash. He considers the pressures that exist where ecology and society collide, such as population growth and its associated increased demands for food and energy. Finally, he drills into the social/structural dynamics—including political economy and the international legal system—that create ongoing momentum for environmental ills.This interdisciplinary text features a three-part structure in each chapter that covers \"fast facts\" about the issue at hand, examines its wide-ranging implications, and offers pragmatic consideration of possible real-world solutions. Bolstering the analysis, a variety of boxes highlight relevant case studies as well as the value judgments which lurk everywhere in talk about environmental phenomena. Discussion questions and key terms enhance the text's usefulness, making Society and the Environment the perfect learning tool for courses on environmental sociology.",
