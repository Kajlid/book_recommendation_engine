  "description": "Harlow-I live everyday looking over my shoulder. I work three jobs to pay off a debt that isn’t mine, all so I can keep me and my little sister alive. When Blake crashes, literally, into my life, I know there could be something great between us. I just don’t have the time for anything to happen. Between a terrifying loan shark, an overly flirty veterinarian, and a snotty fourteen year old, I barely have time to breathe. I just wish I could find the time to be with Blake, too.Blake-I knew there was something big missing from my life but could never figure out exactly what it was, until I ran into Harlow. I found out quickly that she was everything I’ve been looking for. The problem is that she doesn’t have time for a relationship. She has so much on her plate that it’s almost impossible to be with me, but I won’t take no for an answer. Nothing will get in our way, not even an old one-night-stand telling me that she’s pregnant with my child. When our relationship finally begins we find that others aren’t as happy with it as she and I are. Secrets are kept. Lies are told. Threats have been made. We want to find our happy ending, but we have to live to get there.",
