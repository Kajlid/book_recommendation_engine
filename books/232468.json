  "description": "Babette Cole, whose work has been hailed by Parents magazine as \"outrageously zany,\" turns ageism on its ear in this hilariously fresh look at the human life cycle. Two thoroughly modern grandparents tell their life stories to their skeptical grandchildren, and along the way debunk the myth that kids have a monopoly on fun and living dangerously. From childhood on through teenage angst and college dares, to young love and parenthood, these spunky octogenarians have seen and done it all. And they're not afraid of what the future holds. Blithely suggesting the possibility of reincarnation, they joke \"we might be recycled as anything at all!\" Cole combines a spare text with wickedly funny illustrations to create an utterly novel approach to the process of growing up and growing old. An ideal book for kids and grandparents to share. Drop dead, indeed!",
