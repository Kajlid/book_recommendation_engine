  "title": "Behold Now Behemoth: Dinosaurs All Over the Bible!: Dinosaurs All Over the Bible!",
  "description": "Have dinosaurs always lived with man? The Bible clearly shows the answer is yes! God created these great creatures and gave man dominion over them. Esau domesticated them. Nehemiah rode them. Ancient armies appear to have fought from them or along side them. People used them for labor and even ate them! Behemoth, Tanniyn, Yownah, Chamowr-the pages of the Bible in its original languages finally reveals the truth about dinosaurs and man in some incredibly wonderful ways! The lying doctrines of evolution claiming \"billions of years\" and \"man never saw a dinosaur\" are shown to be what they are-lies designed to deceive men into believing the Bible is not true. Men today see the bones of these creatures in museums and wonder, \"If the Bible is true, why are there no dinosaurs found in its pages\". After many centuries of the Bible existing in English, God gets the glory for His second-most magnificent creation next to the great dinosaurs!",
