  "title": "The Manual",
  "description": "This is an unexpurgated reissue of the rare and long out-of print 'how to' book by Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond, aka The KLF, their 'Zenarchistic' step-by-step guide to having a number one single in the official UK charts. First published in 1988, this edition includes a new introduction by Jon Savage and an afterword by Bill Drummond, and explains all the steps needed to guarantee success, as pioneered by The Timelords (another alias) with 'Jamming the Tardis'. The Manual is an unparalleled expose of the reality behind the pop-music business and while names may have changed since its first issue, the mechanics of financing, producing and promoting a hit set out here remain absolutely relevant. .",
