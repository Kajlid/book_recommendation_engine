She needs to be reminded who really rules this relationship.Our feud is a joke—but in the end, I’ll be the only one laughing.This is a dark high school bully romance with mature content and themes. It contains dubious situations that some readers may find offensive. If you're looking for a white knight hero, this book is not for you.Books 1-3 are a trilogy and need to be read together.
