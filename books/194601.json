  "description": "Feb 1807 - Sep 1809 This latest of the Roger Brook stories, continues his saga through the years 1807-1809. Napoleon is at the height of his powers. By now the complete autocrat, lusting for more power, he had warred against Prussia, Austria and Hanover, struck through Poland, towards the Baltic and into Russia. The needless wars were bleeding France white. Roger Brook, still the most valuable and resourceful of secret agents, moves amongst the centres of power of Europe and beyond, and owing to mischance and intrigue is carried to Turkey, Persia, Portugal and Brazil. But, interwoven with the historical pattern, runs the thread of Roger's passionate involvement with the lovely Lisala de Pombal – a woman as licentious as she is beautiful – who plays her part in leading him from one desperate situation to another.",
