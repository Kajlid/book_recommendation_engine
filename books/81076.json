  "description": "A serious car accident leaves bad boy Nate Williams seriously injured and lucky to be alive. During his journey to learn to walk again, he meets Claire, a physiotherapist in the last year of university. He’s instantly attracted to her, but Claire is no ordinary girl. She’s resistant to his charms and good looks, which only intrigues him more. Claire is reluctant, to say the least, when Nate comes back into her life again as one of her patients for her clinical placement. A self-absorbed, tattooed, womaniser, he is the last person on earth she wanted or expected to see again. Nate may not remember her, or the kiss they once shared, but she certainly does. The next five weeks would be anything but easy. Blackbird is a story of self-discovery and the formation of an unexpected friendship between two people who learn that life and love are anything but planned.",
