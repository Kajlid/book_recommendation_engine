  "title": "Such Is My Beloved",
  "description": "One of the great novels of the 1930s, Such Is My Beloved recounts the tragic story of two down-and-out prostitutes and the young priest who aspires to redeem their lives. The novel is at once a compassionate portrait of innocence and idealism, and an emphatic condemnation of a society where the lines between good and evil are essentially blurred.Such Is My Beloved is widely considered to be Morley Callaghanâ€™s finest novel.",
