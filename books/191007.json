  "description": "Have you ever wished you could have something so bad, even though you knew it was forbidden? Jonathan Gates was just thatâ€”forbidden. He was everything I could ever want in a man: charming, a great listener, open-minded, and funny. It also didn't hurt that he was easy on the eyes.We'd been through a lot together: breakups, makeups, firsts, lasts, and anything else you can imagine. I was once told he was my soul mate, but I refused to believe that. I didn't want to love him. I didn't want to fall for him because...he was my best friend!But I did, and I fell for him hard. I was in love with my best friend, and it was time he knew how I really felt.",
