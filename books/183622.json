  "description": "As Southern California's throttle-wide-open Punk scene reaches its peak, famed writer and poet Johnny Salinger struggles to exhume the meaning of his own existence. Tortured over whether the tragic death of his fianc√©e was set into motion by happenstance or fate, he attempts to end his self-loathing spiral by setting out on a one-way road trip in search of a redemptive crossroads that may come too late. From the angst-fueled parties in Venice Beach, to the booze shacks of New Orleans, Salinger is joined by an unforgettable cast of uninhibited misfits who carry a brazenly raw and sometimes burlesque cocktail of narratives. Cursed is the Road to the American Dream is told through the gin and wine-soaked diaries of three lost souls, desperate to find their piece of the \"Great and Wonderful Everything.\" The intoxicatingly nostalgic prequel to the Kerouac prose-inspired companion novel, Nobody Special: The Death of Johnny Salinger, Cursed is the Road to the American Dream is gritty, lust-for-life storytelling.... It's Catcher in the Rye on punk rock Benzedrine. This novel includes a Forward and Afterward by Kimberly Salinger, who reveals deeper insights behind the broken icon's reluctant rise and fall from becoming one of the American underground's most enigmatic anti-heroes.",
