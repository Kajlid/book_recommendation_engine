  "description": "A day spent on the beach is a universally relaxing and joyful experience. In their 'healing' coffee table book, 2015 Da Vinci Eye Award Winner, FOLLY BEACH DANCES - THE INFINITE RHYTHMS OF A SOUTH CAROLINA SEASHORE, husband-and-wife duo Sheree K. and Russell A. Nielsen, will transport readers back to the beach to reclaim and revisit these powerful emotions. FOLLY BEACH DANCES combines the couples' love affair of Folly Beach, South Carolina along with splendid photography, literary reflections, and interpretations from five AWARD-WINNING women authors, including Sheree. Inspired by the transformative power of the ocean, and Sheree Nielsen's lymphoma diagnosis - the 'healing' coffee table book that tells the story of sandpipers, babies, dogs and even beachside structures as they move in rhythm with the changing tides and shifting sands. The mission for the book is one of serenity, healing, and relaxation. The photography and poetry offer an escape to the seashore - no matter where you are or whatever your worries. Diagnosed with lymphoma in 2012, Sheree donates 10 percent of book sales to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Dedicated to beach lovers, dreamers, the residents of Folly Beach, South Carolina, and all those living with ailments. Publisher: Ocean Spirit Photography, Missouri (Hardback, full-color photos, poetry)",
