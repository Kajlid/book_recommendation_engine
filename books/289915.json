  "description": "Family isn't always everything.I should be dead. I was pretty sure I did die—at least for a few seconds—but thanks to having the right kind of friends, I get another chance to gain my freedom back. Except now I'm in even more danger than before.Putting the risks aside, I've convinced the Fabled Four to stick around instead of running away so we can hunt down the Luccovinos before they do the same to us. With Jaxon being more protective than ever, it makes the task difficult at times, but he's also the only thing keeping me sane as we continue to grow closer.As everything comes to an end, the truth about who I am isn't easy to accept and neither is knowing who to trust. But as I face off with a family I never knew existed, there is one thing I'm convinced of.I'm going to kill every single one of them.",
