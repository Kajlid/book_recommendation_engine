  "description": "Bob is a normal guy, if by normal you mean raised by civilized Theosophists who didn't really have time for him or his younger sister. When his parents die suddenly he's left with the job of cleaning up the mess they've left and dealing with his own response to people who were never there for him until it was too late. Unfortunately, now that they're dead they won't leave him alone.Closing Arguments is a story about the family you make when the family who raised you wasn't enough. It's about love, and sacrifice, and doing the right thing because it's right instead of easy, and it's for everyone who ever felt weird or out of place being just a normal \"guy.\" Part occult mystery, part domestic comedy, \"Closing Arguments\" plants the quest for enlightenment and immortality squarely in the suburbs of the Jersey Shore.",
