  "description": "Explore the true resilience of the heart and our raw determination to find goodness in a world fraught with adversity One woman’s courage in the face of personal tragedy is at the heart of Heather A. Clark’s debut novel. Thirty-three-year-old Nicky Fowler thought her whole life was mapped out ― a rewarding career as a third grade teacher, an adoring husband, and the perfect house in the suburbs ― but complicated fertility issues lead to a devastating tragedy. Nicky’s marriage crumbles and she’s left unable to cope with her now-changed life. When Nicky accepts a volunteer teaching position at an orphanage in Kenya, she finds that life there is unlike the world she’s known. Drought has brought famine, violence is everywhere, and the jaded orphanage director takes out her hatred on the parentless children. But Nicky finds strength in Mama Bu, her host mother, who provides wisdom and perspective over cups of chai, Kenya’s signature drink. Nicky comes to realize that she must do much more than teach the orphans ― she must save them.",
