  "description": "Have you read The Initiation and want more? Considering reading The Initiation and you’re not sure? A quasi-prequel, Drayden’s Diary is a short ebook that contains the diary entries of the main character in The Initiation — sixteen-year-old math geek Drayden — in the month leading up to The Initiation. It provides a mostly-humorous glimpse of his life in New America and many of the other major players in the story. Before jumping into a new trilogy, it’s nice to know whether you like the protagonist or not. Can be downloaded for free at chrisbabu.com.",
