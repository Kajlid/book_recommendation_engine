  "description": "Norbert Zelenka has always lived life on the sidelines. It's how at seventy-three years old he finds himself broke and alone except for the company of a Chihuahua. But when Carlotta's Club--three strong-willed seniors with a flair for drama and plenty of time on their hands--decide to make Norbert their latest project, he reluctantly agrees to their scheme. With their help, he establishes himself as the town's fortune-teller, and he soon finds his life changing in unexpected ways. It turns out that years of observing other people's dramas make Norbert an excellent fortune-teller, and people from all walks of life begin seeking out his advice. As Norbert's lonesome world expands with new friendships and a newfound self-confidence, he finally finds himself in a place where he belongs. But disaster looms on the horizon. When a troubled young woman goes missing after a bad reading, Norbert must find a strength beyond the cards to bring her home safely. A heartfelt story of friendship, loneliness and coming-of-age late in life, The Reluctant Fortune-Teller is a feel-good read and a poignant reminder that we're never too old to learn new tricks.",
