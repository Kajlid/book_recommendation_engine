  "title": "But Behold, Enchantment",
  "description": "This is a journey of life. We all have to share in it. Facing obstacles outside of our control, and sometimes, obstacles that we manufacture. The ups and downs, friendships and betrayals, the loves and the losts. Whether it is by inspiration of a moment or the battles of our own demons. The roads of life takes many turns, and all of these roads we must travel. Sometimes we are forced to go alone and then there are times we have the warmth of another. And then there are times we must fight in the course of our travels. Never be afraid to fight. We all have the choice of right or wrong, good or evil, Heaven or Hell. The decision is yours.",
