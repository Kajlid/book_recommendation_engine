  "description": "No matter how hard she tries, Cassie is always second best—in school, in life, and especially in love. And lately, Sterling Carter is always one pedicured step ahead of her. Cassie is used to it. Mostly. The problem is, right now she and Sterling both want Kevin Matthews. He’s only the hottest new student ever to grace their high school halls. And for the record, Cassie saw him first. But, naturally, Sterling wants him. So Cassie might as well just give up now.Except who says Cassie can’t have an equal chance too? Just because she’s been in second place all her life doesn’t mean things can’t change. . . .",
