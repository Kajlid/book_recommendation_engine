  "description": "A  bad day can turn into a good one!  Caldecott Medalist Kevin Henkes's masterful picture book explores a single day from five different points of view.  It’s a bad day for a little yellow bird who loses his favorite tail feather, a little white dog whose leash gets tangled, a little orange fox who can’t find his mother, and a little brown squirrel who drops her nut. But then something good happens to each of them, turning a bad day into a good one.What makes a good day? What makes a bad day? And how can bad be transformed into good?This exploration of opposites and emotions was described as \"a deceptively simple picture book, expertly tuned to the emotions and imaginations of young children\" by ALA Booklist in a starred review.",
