  "description": "“Fae. They’re real. They’re walking amongst us, harnassing powers that are slowly bringing earth to its knees.” The world has been slowly dying for years, probably long before anyone realized it. Now, dark has risen only weeks after strange dreams began to plague Milana. Sickness, war, famine, and so much more flow across the earth’s surface, killing those Fae don’t deem worthy of living in the new regime. Milana and her mother fight to survive, while she learns more about herself than she ever thought possible. The Dark King of the Fae is cutthroat, rage, and power all-consuming. He’s on a mission to save the world and the realms that parallel it before extinction comes for humans and Fae. But something is haunting him, gripping his resolve like a vice and ingesting him bit by bit. In the dimmest of times, two souls will intertwine, piecing a puzzle together that’s been broken for centuries. Angsty romance meets seething rage as Anwynn and Milana try to find themselves while saving their people in a world pitted against them.",
