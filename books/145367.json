  "description": "Meet Nina Sharpe, pleasure is about to become her business…I was 35 years old before I learned that the one thing I'm phenomenally good at is sex. Don’t get me wrong, I do plenty of other things reasonably well. When it comes to foreplay, though, I'm like the Steve Jobs of blow jobs…always looking to innovate.I told myself all these things as I sat in the back of a stretch limousine. Just outside the car door was an unassuming bungalow painted yellow. I was here for work. A probationary assignment, of sorts. Once the car door opened, the rest of my life would start.A man and my future waited for me somewhere inside that house, beyond the front door painted in festive red. Scarlet. A fitting color for what he wanted. For twelve hours and $100,000 he would own every naked inch of me.Just one night for a small fortune that would change my life forever, if I had the courage to walk through that red door….This is my story. Don’t try this at home.This book is intended for mature audiences.",
