  "description": "Austin BuckleyYes, I’m a single dad who needs a nanny for the summer.But hire the stranded runaway bride who shows up on my doorstep in a wedding gown with no references, no skills, and no experience?No one is that desperate.Except within twenty-four hours, down-on-her-luck Veronica Sutton manages to charm my kids, my family, and half the population of Cherry Tree Harbor into believing she’s perfect for the job.And for me.It’s not that I can’t see the appeal–those baby blue eyes? The endless legs? That mouth made for trouble? But I’ve got enough on my plate, raising two kids on my own and keeping the family business alive. I don’t have the time or the inclination to fall for an outspoken city girl.So I should have kept my hands to myself.Holding her in my arms was a big mistake. Even worse? Spending the night together. She ignites a possessive fire in me that I’m finding hard to snuff out.But the most unforgivable? Growing attached to the sound of her laugh, the scent of her skin, and the way her body wraps around mine in the dark.At the end of the summer, she’ll be gone.And if I’m not careful, she might run away with my heart.",
