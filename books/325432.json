  "description": "Sometimes in love, the person who’s your future isn't always your destiny…I was five years old when I met the love of my life. He was my best friend’s older brother, but he was also my friend. We shared popsicles, we hunted for shark teeth on Folly Beach, and told each other secrets. But everything changed when we became teenagers. Brandon no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I was a pest. Something to ignore. I hated that he tossed away our friendship. Although he broke my heart, it still fluttered when he looked at me, was near me, and touched me. But eventually he would look away, push away, and walk away. Finally, I realized you can’t make someone love you even if they were supposed to be your forever.*This book contains sensitive subject matter.*ALL THE BOOKS IN THE PERFECT SERIES CAN BE READ AS STANDALONES.Releasing March 24, 2022Pre-order your copy today!Amazon: tinyurl.com/28bs5hemApple Books: tinyurl.com/m8ke4wf3 Nook: tinyurl.com/3z8ce4nc Kobo: tinyurl.com/mwawant5",
