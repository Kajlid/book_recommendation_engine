  "title": "Time Runs Away With Her",
  "description": "I was a young adult in 1970s. All that good music and bad pot. I'm looking forward to this read. Here is the publisher's synopsis: It's not easy being Bean. Bean Donohue lives for her guitar, but her mom threw her out of the house during a snowstorm for singing. No way she's going to get permission to go see The Grateful Dead at the Fillmore East. Zak, her almost-boyfriend, will get drafted if he doesn't get into art school, pot makes Bean paranoid, and her best friend can't stop talking about sex. 1970's not for wimps-but neither was 1885...or 1945. So why does Bean keep sliding backwards in time?",
