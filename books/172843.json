  "description": "After a recent break-up sent her into a self-imposed \"personal hiatus,\" thirty-something New York TV-promo producer Tori Miller is determined to get a life. The fastest way? A Hamptons summer share house. She ditches her old look―thanks to a last-minute makeover on a reality show pilot―and over the next three months, the new-and-improved \"Miller\" becomes the wing-woman to a glamorous new B.F.F., goes head-to-head with her house's prickly Resident Alpha Female, and is drawn into a web of secrets by a charming Brit. But soon she finds herself entangled in one too many complicated romantic situations―and the many Hamptons Unwritten Rules threaten to implode her new, carefully cultivated social standing. Now the fabulous life Tori has might not be the one she wants, and she must decide who she really is, what she wants, and what she's willing to give up to get there…all by Labor Day.",
