Lao-tzu, whose name means “the ancient child,” wrote these brief but essential verses that have both confounded and conferred blessings on humankind. Now Taoist masters Mantak Chia and Tao Huang guide readers through the origins of this philosophy, the meaning behind its 5,000 pictographs, and the way of living that generations have followed.While the text of the Tao Te Ching has been passed down in literary form for generations, the essence of the text can be understood only through heart awakening--a true integration of body and mind--made possible with the insights and exercises in this book. The authors analyze Lao-tzu's teachings, line by line, and offer meditations, interpretations, and practical illustrations that clarify the true meaning and purpose of this classic text.",
