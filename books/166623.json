With change comes resistance and those holding control and power are not ready to just hand it over without a fight.For the former D-List Supervillain, it’s time to break out the spare synthmuscle, charge the massive railgun pistol, and bring the pain.

He must deal with sanctioned hero teams and power mad bureaucrats on one side and the major supervillains of his world on the other.  As Cal and his allies ready themselves to face friend and foe, he will also have to deal with his relationship with Stacy Mitchell, also known as the Olympian, Aphrodite. Separated for over a year, they’ve only just reunited and are faced with the prospect of being on opposite sides of the coming conflict.
