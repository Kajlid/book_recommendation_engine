William Everson, Jr. is young, he's dying of terminal cancer, and he's all alone. I meet him through my mission to befriend terminal cancer patients with no visitors, but it takes me much longer to meet \"Will\" and to learn anything about his family, his friends, and why he has a DNR order in place. \"Can I come back tomorrow?\" That's always my question at the end of our visits.  When it becomes his question—“Will you come back tomorrow?”—it changes both of us forever. Will’s given up on life; I won’t let him go without a fight. But is what we share enough to make Will rethink any of his choices . . . before it’s too late? Come Back Tomorrow follows the heart-wrenching journey through illness to the very edge of life and to the critical decision that must be accept your fate or fight with everything you have. Come Back Tomorrow is the first book of the Embrace Tomorrow Duet.",
