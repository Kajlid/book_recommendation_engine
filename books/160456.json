  "description": "Gideon's Night is inhabited by thugs, murderers, and maniacs as a rule. But on this particular evening, an unusually virulent pair of psychopaths is leaving behind a grisly trail of pain, grief, and blood. First, there's the \"baby snatcher\" - kidnapping and killing a slew of helpless infants. Then there's \"the prowler,\" who's been known to unleash his special brand of brutal terror on unsuspecting young women on foggy London evenings such as this one. Add to the nightmare the threat of an explosive gang war, and you've got enough mayhem to keep any self-respecting copper busy for months. But for Commander George Gideon of Scotland Yard, it's all coming to a head on one nerve-shattering, breathless night!",
