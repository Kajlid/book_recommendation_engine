  "title": "On Some Faraway Beach: The Life and Times of Brian Eno",
  "description": "Few record collections remain untouched by Brian Eno’s aesthetic from ambient soundscapes and world-music hybrids to cut ’n’ paste vocal samples and amniotic chill-out rooms, Eno is all around us. A sonic alchemist to the stars, his address book is a veritable who’s who of rock and his credit adorns an outrageous number of albums. Tellingly, Eno’s work with Roxy Music, David Bowie, Talking Heads, Devo, U2, and Coldplay has coincided with those artists producing their most critically revered work.  On Some Faraway Beach is the first serious, critical examination of the life and times of Brian Eno. David Sheppard has interviewed key collaborators like David Byrne, Robert Wyatt, John Cale, Bryan Ferry, and Gavin Bryars. But more importantly, Sheppard has had considerable assistance and input from Brian and Anthea Eno themselves, while retaining an edge and independence in keeping with his subject.",
