  "description": "“Bad hair days” are not just for humans anymore. Poke around the animal kingdom and you’ll find countless examples of fur gone wild, feathers on the fritz, downright scary scales, and unseemly skins. In fact, we’ve done the poking for you, and now we present this rogues’ gallery of bad animal ‘dos featuring fur-matted mutts, coat-crumpled cats, bed-headed birds, loony-looking llamas, and many more. With over 75 humorous photographs-each accompanied by a pithy punchline-Bad Fur Days is a hysterical menagerie of laughs for all animal lovers (and all animals with a sense of humor).",
