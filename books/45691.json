  "description": "Augusta Goodnight, heavenly sleuth and guardian angel, is a welcome boarder with longtime resident Lucy Nan Pilgrim in the seemingly tranquil town of Stone's Throw, South Carolina. And Augusta's divine intervention is needed now more than ever. The local college is the kind of safe place where students don't even lock their doors. At least it used to be, until girls started mysteriously disappearing.             When the body of another student, D. C. Hunter, is found in a shed by the lake, Lucy and Augusta must race to figure out if her murder is connected to the deaths of two other girls. Should Augusta focus on the English professor who was having an affair with D.C.? Or on the seemingly cheerful caretaker who happened to discover two of the bodies? And what is the meaning of the \"Jabberwocky\" clues that keep turning up around campus?             It will take some heavenly help---and a little home cooking---to restore the peace of the town.",
