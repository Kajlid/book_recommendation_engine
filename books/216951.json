  "description": "King Richard has made peace with Saladin, but must run a gauntlet of enemies to get home from the Crusade. While England waits for her King, Prince John spares neither lives nor fortune to usurp his brother’s crown. Roland Inness, Declan O’Duinne and Millicent de Laval once more find themselves at the centre of a growing civil war. Each will play a crucial role in deciding who will ultimately sit on the throne of England. The Saga of Roland Inness begins with the tale of a fourteen-year-old boy who has extraordinary skill with a longbow. It is a story of courage, loyalty, honor and treachery. Most of all, it is a story of high adventure set in a time so filled with drama it has spawned legends that fascinate people to this day. It is the time of Richard the Lionheart, Robin Hood, Eleanor of Aquitaine and William Marshall, legendary figures all--some real and some fictional.The first four books in the saga—Longbow, Warbow, The Broken Realm and The Ransomed Crown tell the coming-of-age story of the young archer. A Prince of Wales, the fifth in the series, follows Roland Inness as he leads the legendary Invalid Company into Wales to help Llywelyn the Great win a throne. The sixth book in the series, Declan O'Duinne, takes Roland and Declan to Ireland, where they are plunged into a new Norman conquest.
