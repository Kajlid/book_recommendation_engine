  "title": "Revival of the West: Securing a Future for European People",
  "description": "This book deconstructs the myth of progressive liberalism. The author explores left-wing ideals of equality, diversity, social justice and open society, and exposes them as empty fiction.The fate of modern civilization rests solely on the shoulders of men and women willing to defend it. After the European colonial age, the discovery of the New World, the Industrial Revolution and the establishment of the modern West, Western man has arrived at a crisis. Has he exhausted himself like Goetheâ€™s Faust? Should he end his quest for greatness and let others take charge of the world he built? Should he dissolve his ego and hide himself in the safe comfort of anonymous masses? Or should he, at long last, unleash his suppressed potential?High on a cocktail of sugar, nicotine, caffeine, alcohol, antidepressants, penicillin and other drugs, people have fallen into a collective trance. Like the light at the end of the tunnel, the drunk masses think they are approaching eternal paradise on Earth, but in reality they are marching towards the abyss of their extinction. Only those foreseeing souls who have the courage to return their people to more traditional lifestyles, only those who are willing to break away from mass humanity, only they may jump the abyss and cheat destiny.",
