  "description": "Eryn is a college junior, working her way through college and depending upon her volleyball scholarship to keep her afloat. Wade is a former Olympian looking to break away from the West Coast scene with a coaching job in Florida. With a position open at Eryn’s school—his alma mater—fate brings them together and sparks collide.  Of course, it isn’t easy. As her coach, he isn’t allowed to date her, and their being together could risk everything the two of them hold dear.  And then there is the drama that surrounds them. Rivals both on and off the court, exs, the media—it is a lot. Could it prove to be too much to bear? Will the two of them overcome the odds and find a way to be together?",
