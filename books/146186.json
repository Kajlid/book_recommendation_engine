  "title": "The Alternates",
  "description": "Two physicists, Kerry and Leon, are working in the underground laboratory of the ALICE complex of CERN in Switzerland when part of a routine experiment goes horribly wrong. Unbeknown to them, the experiment has inadvertently opened up a black hole that has not only affected our Earth, but every conceivable alternative reality. It is not until they go up to ‘ground level’ that they see the full extent of the devastation that has occurred. Minstor, Nyre, and thousands of others from alternate realities find themselves stranded in our world. Several of these Alternates form an alliance to help the scientists combat the problems caused by the disaster and to try and find a way home. With the arrival of the UN peacekeepers under Major Horst, the small group of scientists and Alternates are torn between keeping the true nature of the disaster from the outside world, as well as the UN peacekeepers. Meanwhile a ghostly rogue Alternate with significant mental abilities plans to escape through the Alps to create the life that he wants without realising the devastation it will cause. With the help of a UN ambassador, the small group of seemingly normal Alternates and Scientists evade the watchful eye of Major Horst, the media, and the rest of the civilisation. Not knowing of where to turn, or who to trust, they try and keep our world from finding out what really happened whilst pursuing and ultimately stopping the rogue Alternate from hurting himself, and the destruction of Earth as we know it. Both a team of soldiers under the command of Major Horst and the Alternates find themselves in Turin for a final and dramatic showdown.",
