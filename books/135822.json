  "title": "The Wisdom Theory: A Prescription for Optimism",
  "description": "Does exclusive evidence lead to optimism or pessimism? It depends on what evidence is excluded. For example, excluding evidence of climate change, authoritarianism, terrorism, and unconstrained technological development leads to optimism, and excluding evidence that pessimism is a self-fulfilling prophecy leads to pessimism. Inclusive evidence leads to the wisdom theory ... and the wisdom theory leads to the idea that our grandchildren and their grandchildren will live in peace and joy.Inconclusive hypotheses are common, and confirmed theories are rare. The wisdom theory is conclusively confirmed.If a novel theory becomes a familiar theory, then it will inspire a better theory, which is why a novel theory must be shared. The wisdom theory is novel.",
