  "description": "Things are strange in the town of Kingsplot. The usually sleepy town is experiencing things it just can t explain. Plants are vandalizing the museum, buildings are being torn apart at night, and the minds of residents are growing foggy and confused. In the Pillage manor above the town, Beck s life is unraveling as well. The girl he cares for has had enough, his father is in the hospital, and the madness that has poisoned Beck s ancestors is beginning to infect his own thoughts. There s also the matter of the manor. Behind its walls and floors are more surprises, including an elevator that s been walled up for years. Furthermore, in order to save his father, Beck must plant the final dragon stone, which brings to life much more than he expected. Not just one dragon appears, but three the king and two wicked guardians. Beck s new desire to pillage is in stark contrast to the rightful task he knows he must perform a task that will put an end to the dragons once and for all. Of course, even the best-laid plans can fall apart beneath the surprise of an ambush. This final book in the Pillagy series takes Beck, Kate, and Wyatt through their most dangerous adventure ever.",
