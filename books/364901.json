  "description": "In this pioneering volume, Filipino, American, and Australian scholars explore the history of the great families who have led the Philippines during the past century - Osmena, Lopez, and Pardo de Tavera. Moving beyond Manila, the volume offers detailed accounts of how strong men such as Ramon Durano, Ali Dimaporo, and Justiniano Montano used \"guns, goons, and gold\" to become powerful provincial warlords. Illustrated with many original photographs, maps, and genealogies, this book is a valuable resource for anyone who seeks to understand the modern Philippines.",
