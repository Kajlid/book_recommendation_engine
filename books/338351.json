  "description": "A beautiful lyrical story that introduces the concept of individuality, accepting of others differences, and respect for those around us. This is a tale about conformism and individualism, as Mr. Plumbean's expression of creativity and individuality challenges his neighbor's ideas about the importance of having a “neat street.” By repainting his house to reflect his colorful dreams, Mr. Plumbean breaks away from the conformity of his street. “My house is me and I am it. My house is where I like to be and it looks like all my dreams.” ― Daniel Pinkwater",
