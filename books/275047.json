Save money on this Amazon bestselling series by purchasing this special bundle deal!  \nDeath was only the beginning.\n  I have a lot to learn after waking up in the afterlife. Never mind that my memories have been erased, but being assigned as a demon hunter, um . . . yeah, I don’t think so. Physical activity and I aren’t on speaking terms.    Making my supernatural headache worse is my infuriating trainer, Logan. Sparks fly between us immediately—the kind created by our swords and personalities as we clash in and out of the training center.    Just when I think my life—or rather, afterlife—is all punch, stab, rinse and repeat, I find myself the wielder of the most powerful sword in existence. Sure, it might be cool to ash demons with a single swipe of my weapon, but now Satan is gunning for me.    Logan is the only one I can turn to for help. But the guy has secrets. So until I figure out what they are, I might just be on my own.  My name is Audrey Lyons, and my afterlife is shaping up to be a hot mess and a half.   With over 1,100 five-star reviews on Amazon and Goodreads, why are you waiting to start the series readers have called \"captivating\", \"stunning\", and \"refreshingly beautiful\"?   Fans of The Mortal Instruments, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and Supernatural won't want to miss out on all the twists and turns in this YA Fantasy journey.",
