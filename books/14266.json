  "description": "When John and Susan meet they find in each other the alchemy and connection of friend and lover, husband and wife. As they await the birth of their second child, all seems right with their world. Then the unthinkable happens. \"Love,\" Weidener writes, \"is a long close scrutiny.\" This is a story of adversity and strength, courage and honor, of deep love and loss which asks the question . . . if you had to do it all over again knowing what would happen, would you? The sequel to this memoir is Morning at Wellington Square , the story of a single woman's faith in the day-to-day adventure of living and finding in the ordinary the extraordinary.",
