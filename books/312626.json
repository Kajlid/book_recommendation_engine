  "description": "I wear the ring they all bow to kiss, but not her. Never her.The Nucci family had a lot of sins and Muse was one of them. When my father trashed our name, she was collateral, and now I have to make sure the past doesn’t destroy us. I will do everything in my power: if she wants revenge, I’ll write it in blood for her, but if she wants my heart she’s going to be left empty handed…because I don’t have one. I didn’t go to her, she came to me. Her picture ended up in my hands and it was game over. All I knew was that she had to be mine and I didn’t care how hard she tried to fight it. A Nucci always gets what he wants. I took her from the stripping pole and made her my queen. Muse and I were inevitable, doomed to burn together. But fire turns into ash. And ash gets lost in the wind.",
