  "description": "When the townsfolk of Passmore get wind of the fact their Vicar's new verger, Wilson Rooney, is gay, a series of events spark the start of both his and the Vicar's adventures when it comes to keeping the rather interesting flock of Passmore within the fold. Not only that, they'll have to gain the approval of the parish council before Wilson can be accepted. No small task when it's headed by one of the most conservative parish council leaders ever to have walked the face of God's green earth.Can the vicar get Wilson accepted into the community? Or will his efforts result in a disaster that will divide the town they have been trying to keep together since the decline in population has hit them hard. Time will tell, but not before love blooms in the most unexpected way and the Vicar uses some rather unorthodox methods to get his parishioners to see the light about Wilson and his lifestyle choice.",
