  "description": "Wesley Greenway:   I’m a complete f*ck up. I’m now thirty, and I’ve watched all my family and friends grow up and fall in love. They have noisy houses, babies and… happiness. I hear the silence, night after night in my Minneapolis apartment. Music and tattooing are the only things that keep me sane. And love? Who needs it? I have a “lust and leave” ‘em attitude. It’s served me well… until now.  Until one night in October…  I get drunk and make a huge mistake with music’s hottest bachelor. There’s just one thing, though: I’m not gay. It’s just a mistake. A mistake that blows all my sanity to the wayside.    Miles Madison:  I’ve lived a charmed life. I’m one of the most popular rockstars in America. I’ve won awards and worked with some seriously hot acts. I’ve done whatever I’ve ever wanted without recourse… until now.  My life is shaken up with scandal, and has left me without a band and without a manager; my career is totally up in the air. For all the fame and fortune I have, I’m now alone. And love? Forget it. I can’t take the risk.  Until one night in October… I have a lapse of judgment and make one of the biggest mistakes of my life. But that mistake gives me hope that all is not lost. If only I can get Wes to admit that this mistake between us wasn’t a mistake at all.  It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to either one of us.    Be Your Mistake is a \"Bisexual Awakening\" standalone contemporary MM romance set in the same \"world\" as my MF Be Yours Trilogy, but can be read entirely separate. This story is suitable for adults only.",
