  "description": "Eighteen year old Jon Sarconi is the adopted son of rock star Amy Edwards, member of the band Our Lady of Righteous Rage. He’s always had a strained relationship with his birth parents, or his “biologicals”, as he refers to them. After years of not having any contact with them, he receives a visit from his birth parents. They tell him, they only want to spend time with him. However, Jon suspects they want something else. As he attempts to rebuild his relationship with them, he decides to remain on guard. After all, his new mother is a famous rock star, and Jon is on his way to following in her footsteps and making money of his own. Jon is about to show everyone, blood isn’t always thicker than water, and blood isn’t what makes a family a family, but love does.",
