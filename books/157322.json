  "description": "Time stood still...but not the gun clearing its holster. Rad was mesmerized as the barrel drew level with his chest while his own gun refused to come free. The distant gun exploded! Rad felt a searing shock as the bullet buried itself somewhere inside of him. The only thought that registered on his mind was, “I’ve been beat!”Defeated, ostracized and now in New York the infamous Rad Colson has become a forgotten legend in the West that he once ruled. But now a pair of emerald-green eyes are pleading for his help to escort her back to the land of his undoing and protect her so she can claim her legacy, the Vic Ranch, the largest ranch in Wyoming Territory.Rising defiantly from the bottom of his whiskey bottle, the gunfighter sets a determined eye on the country that once jeered him and seeing the mounting opposition against the young heiress, straps on his six-guns and takes over where the law left off. Wyoming will be shattered by Colson's Law!",
