  "description": "Do Animals Have Feelings?According to Kristin von Kreisler, the answer is an undeniable yes. Here, she shares dozens of absorbing, true stories of animals who've risked their lives to keep the human they love out of danger. You'll read of incredibly heroic acts—from the dog who swallows a firecracker to protect a toddler, to the horse who runs through traffic to save an injured woman. You'll come away from this profoundly moving book with a deeper appreciation for the indispensable role animals play in our daily lives.\"Remember some of the feelings you had as a child for the animals to whom you were closest . . . That is what this book is all about.\"—Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, from the foreword\"An inspiring collection of animal loyalty, love, and bravery. No one can deny the emotional impact of this anecdotal book.\"\n—Publishers Weekly\n\"An extraordinary combination of incredible research and deep feeling.\"—Cleveland Amory, author of Ranch of Dreams and The Cat Who Came for Christmas\"Through dozens of inspiring true stories, Kristin von Kreisler makes a strong case for a 'controversial premise'—that animals demonstrate genuine acts of compassion toward others every day. This book will remove the 'controversial' from the premise!\"— Paul G. Irwin, president of The Humane Society of the United States\"Ms. von Kreisler is fearless, intriguing, and herself compassionate. Highly recommended.\"— Roger A. Caras, president of the ASPCA",
