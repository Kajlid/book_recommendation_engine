  "description": "Hired killers. Vigilantes. Executioners. Paid killers or assassins working from a moral or political motivation. You’ll find them all in this thrilling anthology from Smart Rhino Publications edited by Weldon Burge. But these are not ordinary killers, not your run-of-the-mill hit men. The emphasis is on the \"uncommon\" here—unusual characters, usual situations, and especially unusual means of killing.Here are tales by some of the best suspense/thriller writers today, including F. Paul Wilson, Ken Bruen, J. Carson Black, Billie Sue Mosiman, Laura DiSilverio, and 18 others. The stories range from historical fiction to science fiction to political thriller—there’s even an alternate history story in the mix.\"Uncommon Assassins is a nicely put together anthology and there’s something to love for crime and mystery fans alike. As with any good anthology, you’ll probably discover a new author that you’ll want to add to your to–be-read list, and also some stories from some old favourites.\" -- Crime Fiction LoverStephen England - NightshadeJ.
