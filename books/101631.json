  "title": "The Count of Monte Cristo as Retold by Sherlock Holmes",
  "description": "The Count of Monte Cristo as Retold by Sherlock Holmes begins with a condensed retelling of The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, related through the voice of Sherlock Holmes. It includes exhilarating new adventures, characters, and ideas, carrying the reader through book I leading to book II and with book III promising an ever-expanding new series based on the classic. The author consulted the original French as well as the oldest English translations of The Count of Monte Cristo, but the style of the retellling, in the distinctive voice of Sherlock Holmes, constitutes a new work. Books II and III, soon to follow, are wholly original sequels although they include characters from the original classic. The author of The Count of Monte Cristo as Retold by Sherlock Holmes enjoyed the 2003 translation by Robin Buss of The Count of Monte Cristo, which helped to inspire both this work and the first sequel in this series, The Sultan of Monte Cristo. The most recent (2003) unabridged translation by Buss is indispensable to fully appreciate the original story. Those who have already had the pleasure of reading The Sultan of Monte Cristo will certainly appreciate the unique way in which the Holy Ghost Writer has expanded the original story without the help of anyone (except perhaps from the ghost of Dumas himself). While The Sultan of Monte Cristo has been enjoyed by thousands as a stand-alone work, this work is an even easier read of the original classic, as it has a condensed version of the original story, uniquely retold in the voice of Sherlock Holmes.",
