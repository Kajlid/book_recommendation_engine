  "description": "In the ancient world, when the days were short and the nights were long and moonless, one boy questions the customs of his village-a thing others would never dare to do. He is Omi, and he knows something isn't right about the place he calls home. Soon his curiosity puts him in danger, and what he learns changes everything. He flees the village, pursued by the wicked hierarchy he's challenged, its leader desperate to maintain control. Lives are lost, homes are destroyed, and Omi vows to bring justice to the culprits. But to have his revenge, he must first survive the wild.",
