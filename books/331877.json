  "description": "She's desperate for a new life, but is she willing to be a blood slave to a vampire to get there?Life seems to be playing a cruel joke on Cordelia when she receives an acceptance letter to the college of her dreams...but not the scholarship she needs to go with it. Now there's only one thing she can do that will get her enough money to go and still be able to care for her grandmother: become a feeder at The Nest.But when she's chosen by one of The Nest's elite vampire clientele, all of her problems aren't as solved as she thought they would be. In fact, things are about to get worse. Because this client is insisting her blood exclusively feeds him, and the rest of the Nest isn't too happy about that arrangement.Rook hates the idea of feeding from strangers like some kind of animal, but since he has to keep his identity a secret, he doesn't have much choice. At least at The Nest, he knows they are willing employees who have been screened.Get his feedings and go. Quickly. That's the goal. Until he tastes her sample. He definitely never expected to want to know more about a human. Now the draw he feels to her is unlike any other, but with his secret looming over him, he can't give in. Not if he wants her to survive...If you like the twists and turns of Michelle Hercules and the steam of Jaymin Eve then you'll love Vampire's Nest!",
