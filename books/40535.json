  "description": "A paranormal category romance novella from Entangled's Covet imprint...She's not immune to his charms...Paranormal detective Kiera \"Mac\" McLoughlin has a serial killer on her hands. Two women are dead-naked, and no obvious cause of death. Aidan Byrne, an investigator with the Otherworlder Enforcement Agency, confirms her suspicions. He's hot, enigmatic, and just so damned charming. Almost charming enough to distract Mac...until her female partner becomes the killer's next victim.Now Mac's off the case and sneaking behind her department's back to pursue the investigation with Aidan-and desperately trying to fight her attraction to him. Each lead is starting to form the same conclusion: incubi, who have been extinct for at least century. But Aidan has a few secrets he's hiding. And as Mac struggles to keep her libido in check, she wonders if she's falling for Aidan...or falling for a killer.Previously released on Entangled's Ever After imprint - January 2012",
