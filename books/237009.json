  "description": "He’s gonna be the love of her life… if they both survive the night.  With a single touch, Ronna Mitchell can separate truth from lies and even catch glimpses of possible futures, but the life of a human lie detector is a lonely one—until one night when she’s moonlighting as a carnival palm-reader and police officer Matt Holloway stumbles into her tent. The second she touches him she sees their entire lives laid out before her—but how do you tell a perfect stranger he’ll be the father of your unborn children?  The quirky palm-reader is unlike anyone Matt has ever met, but he’s on the trail of a mafia hit man and he doesn’t have time for carnival games. How can Ronna convince him that he’ll be her forever… provided a professional killer doesn’t get to him first?  **Previously released as A COP & A FEEL**",
