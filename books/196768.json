  "description": "Two fantastic comic fantasies - MY HERO and WHO'S AFRAID OF BEOWULF? - reissued with brilliant new cover style.This omnibus brings together two of Tom Holt's best-loved stories. In My Hero, Jane thinks writing novels is a piece of cake. Until hers starts writing back. At which point, she really should stop. The one thing she should not do is go into the book herself. After all, thatâ€™s what heroes are for. Unfortunately, the world of fiction is a far more complicated place than she ever imagined, and sheâ€™s about to land her hero right in it. In Who's Afraid of Beowulf?, Hrolf Earthstar, the last Norse King of Caithness, and his 12 champions are awakened from a centuries-long sleep when archaeologist Hildy Frederiksen finds their grave mound. Not only that, but Hrolf decides to carry on his ancient war against the powers of darkness. Starting with the Bakerloo Line.",
