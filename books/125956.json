But will the advances of another woman steal the hopes of them ever being together? Melissa Peterson serves as a strong support system and best friend to Kara. Sheâ€™s there to offer moments of encouragement as Kara faces the evils from an oppressive home life with her guardian sister, but will their friendship last when Kara uncovers a heavily guarded affair? Determined to defeat all odds stacked against her, Kara struggles to make it to the top. Will her determination prove to be enough as unrelenting trials attempt to suffocate any hope she has of leaving the projects, love for the man of her dreams, and most importantly the faith she has in God?",
