  "description": "How I Went Red is an obsessive, erotically charged study of identity in which the author confronts her own distrust of memory while reveling within and rebelling against the tortured space between darkness and light. Each poem in this haunting first collection is a sonic trip leaving the reader dizzily spent but still anxious for more.",
