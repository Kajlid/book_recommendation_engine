  "description": "Single Dead Detective Seeks ClueEver since the Big Uneasy unleashed vampires, werewolves, and other undead denizens on the world, it's been hell being a detective--especially for zombie P.I. Dan Chambeaux. Taking on the creepiest of cases in the Unnatural Quarter with a human lawyer for a partner and a ghost for a girlfriend, Chambeaux redefines \"dead on arrival.\" But just because he was murdered doesn't mean he'd leave his clients in the lurch. Besides, zombies are so good at lurching.Now he's back from the dead and back in business--with a caseload that's downright unnatural. A resurrected mummy is suing the museum that put him on display. Two witches, victims of a curse gone terribly wrong, seek restitution from a publisher for not using \"spell check\" on its magical tomes. And he's got to figure out a very personal question--Who killed him?For Dan Chambeaux, it's all in a day's work. (Still, does everybody have to call him \"Shamble\"?) Funny, fresh, and irresistible, this cadaverous caper puts the P.I. in R.I.P. . ..with a vengeance.",
