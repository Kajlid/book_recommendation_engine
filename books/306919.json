  "description": "My name is Greer Karas, and I should never be allowed near another bottle of booze again. Because when I drink, my friend and I do stupid things. Like take a page out of my older brother Creighton’s playbook and post something completely asinine on the Internet. Waking up with a giant hangover to find my humiliating personal ad has gone viral is not my finest moment.Cue my look of shock when one of the movie industry's hottest new bad boys, Cavanaugh Westman, comes knocking at my door proving he has all the criteria I asked for in my ad. What I really need from him is an explanation for why he disappeared from my life without a word three years ago. What do I do now that he’s claiming he wants me again?",
