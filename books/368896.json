  "description": "The Deepest Hunger. . . Tessa Noble is a vampire who will do anything to reach the safety of her brother in New Orleans--even if it means traveling with her nemesis, Rene Morin. A ruthless, brooding, yet startlingly sexy vampire, Rene seems to take pleasure in finding fault with Tessa's every move. As they travel, Rene feeds along the way, while Tessa struggles to resist the impulse to nourish herself. . .  Feeds The Darkest Needs. . . Once in the storm-ravaged city of his birth, Rene's defenses begin to unravel, and Tessa is drawn to his more vulnerable side. Starving and spent with need, Tessa finally allows herself to feed off of Rene's own body, deepening the sensual attraction they share. Yet neither can afford to succumb to this desire. For Tessa and Rene are being followed--and a single misstep will put them at the mercy of forces more dark and powerful than even they can fight. If they are caught, the ecstasy of their newfound love will be matched only by the agony of its loss. . . Praise for Sara Reinke's Dark Thirst. . .",
