  "description": "In collaboration with Woman and Home and Breast Cancer Care, twenty-four of our favourite women's fiction authors - from Wendy Holden, Cathy Kelly and Penny Vincenzi to Joanne Harris, Andrea Levy and Alexander McCall Smith, to name just a few - have generously donated their fiction for an unmissable collection of stories. They tell of friendship and love, passion and betrayal and the brilliant writing, warmth and humour of each of the contributions will make The Sunday Night Book Club an utterly irresistible read. Scheduled to coincide with Breast Cancer Awareness Month in October, ï¿½1 per copy will go to the charity.",
