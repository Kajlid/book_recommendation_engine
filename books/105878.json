  "description": "Britton Prescott's best friend is getting married and she's the maid of honor. What her best friend failed to mention, was the fact that her cousin Daphne was going to be a bridesmaid. The same cousin that has been Britton's nemesis since they were in high school. As if that isn't enough to deal with, Britton's sister announces she's getting married in the same month and her maid of honor is none other than her best friend Daphne, the same woman that has tormented her sister for years. Britton has to suck it up and play nice, instead of scratching her eyes out, because she and Daphne are in both weddings. Everyone is counting on Britton and Daphne to behave like adults and put the past behind them. No one expects to find them wrapped in each other's arms at the most inopportune time.",
