  "description": "Robert and Sam are back in this sequel to On Fire! Fire Chief Robert is completely unaware that Sam is having trouble with the residents of their small Canadian town. He doesn't hear any of the barbs that come Sam's way about them living together in an openly gay relationship. Much younger and not as well-loved by the whole town, Sam feels pretty much like an outsider, and things get rougher for him when Robert has an accident on the job. Sam finds out that some folks would prefer to see him gone, and some feel like he's not such a great influence on his third grade students. When Robert finds out about Sam's troubles, he sets out to put things right, working toward finding Sam the acceptance he so desperately craves, both in the community and in their own home. Can Robert make Sam understand how much he cares? Can Sam handle the new demands placed on his life by Robert's new commitment? Drew Zachary has created a wonderful pair of lovers and partners in the On Fire series, leading the reader through the everyday details of a couple who are still on fire for each other no matter what. On Fire 2: Still Burning opens a window on a life, and love, that are worth it, no matter how much Sam and Robert get burned.",
