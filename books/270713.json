  "description": "On their wedding night, Anne confesses to her new husband her desire to sexually submit to him. Edward enrolls her in a school for submission, where she undergoes strict and humiliating training. The trainers reinforce her dominant husband’s expectations for Anne, taking control over her body and supervising her behavior through a series of regimented programs designed to condition her body’s physical responses. At this special school, Anne becomes a willing pupil, tutored in lessons on how to serve Edward’s sexual needs. Soon, she is crawling for her exacting husband, intimately and regularly punished, and calling him Mr. Olliver. As her husband becomes increasingly demanding, Anne learns just how deep her submission goes.Contains strong BDSM themes, power exchange, sexual humiliation, ageplay, and explicit sexual situations.",
