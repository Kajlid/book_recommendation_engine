  "description": "Can a Playboy Prince ever be tamed? When Lola Franklin decided to study abroad she never anticipated embarking on a whirlwind weekend romance with a hot guy before classes started. And she certainly never counted on the hot guy being her new professor. Or a Prince. Or the biggest asshole she had ever met. Xavier Van Romerius is the playboy Prince of Europe and he loves his life. He doesn't do relationships, and never wants to get married. But when he see's Lola Franklin flirting with his little brother Sebastian, he realizes that maybe he needs to rethink his ideas about love before the wrong Prince gets the girl.",
