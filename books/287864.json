  "description": "Shania Simmons is a rough and tumble redhead that’s never stepped down from a challenge. When her supervisor at the local animal shelter leaves her in charge of a full house of wild beasts for a week, Shania’s completely in her element among the Pit Bulls and Rottweilers. The only wrench in her plan? An unexpected category four hurricane is throttling towards the beach. With the dogs depending on her, there’s no way she can evacuate like the rest of her friends at Coastal College.Since getting out of prison for malicious maiming, Curtis Young has been keeping his head down and directing most of his energy into custom work on motorcycles and luxury cars at his uncle’s auto shop. Since the conditions of his parole include keeping away from his friends and family members in the Silverthorn Syndicate motorcycle club, he’s become a lone wolf, doing his best not to get attached to anyone. The only person he still gives a damn about is his childhood best friend, Austin Simmons.When Austin calls in a favor and asks him to keep Shania safe from the storm, neither of them knows what it’s going to cost. The only thing that scares Curtis more than losing his life is losing his heart. Driving Forces is the second book in the Vixens In Love series. Each of the books can be read as a standalone.",
