When fate makes her meet not one, but two mates, Naomi digs her heels in and refuses to give in without a fight. Can this delicate freakn’ flower unbend her prejudices enough to recognize she needs a pair of men who can handle her thorns - and her passion?For a long time now, Mitchell’s been avoiding Francine, his bratty sister’s friend. However, the girl who tortured him in his youth is all grown up, and when he sees her in the arms of another, a need to claim her overrides all his common sense. But he’s waited too long and fate has decided that he’s going to have to share. Can he accept that claiming Francine means living in a menage, or will his jealousy get in the way of happiness?Meeting the woman of his dreams would have worked a lot better if she didn’t already belong to another man. But Chris wasn’t about to let something like ‘until death do us part’ keep him from claiming his woman. He’ll do anything to win his mate, including throwing his attractive cousin at the pesky husband.Warning: Some of the stories in this bundle contain sexual situations involving more than two people (MFM). Reader discretion is advised.",
