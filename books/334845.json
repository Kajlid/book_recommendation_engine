  "description": "\"\nThe Sacred Balance \nhas a beautiful spirit.\"--E.O. WilsonWith a new foreword from Robin Wall Kimmerer, \nNew York Times\n-bestselling author of \nBraiding Sweetgrass--\nand an afterword from Bill McKibben--this special 25th anniversary edition of a beloved bestseller invites readers to see ourselves as part of nature, not separate.The world is changing at a relentless pace. How can we slow down and act from a place of respect for all living things? The Sacred Balance shows us how.In this extensively updated new edition, David Suzuki reflects on the increasingly radical changes in science and nature--from the climate crisis to peak oil and the rise in clean energy--and examines what they mean for humankind. He also reflects on what we have learned by listening to Indigenous leaders, whose knowledge of the natural world is profound, and whose peoples are on the frontlines of protecting land and water around the world.Drawing on his own experiences and those of others who have put their beliefs into action, The Sacred Balance combines science, philosophy, spirituality, and Indigenous knowledge to offer concrete suggestions for creating an ecologically sustainable future by rediscovering and addressing humanity's basic needs.Published in Partnership with the David Suzuki Institute",
