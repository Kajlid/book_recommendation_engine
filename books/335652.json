  "description": "If there’s one thing I’ve learned this year at college, it’s that things aren’t always what they seem.I’m Logan Lewis. I’m popular, charming, athletic, and all the girls love me. Yep, I’ve really got it made.But when I find myself in danger of failing my chemistry class and losing my sports scholarship, I know the only person who can save me is the smartest science tutor on campus.Theo Reign is brilliant. He’s also cold and antisocial, moody and mean. He looks at me like he hates me, but touches me like he wants me. There’s something just beneath the surface that draws me in. His secret pain mirrors my own, and I suddenly find myself craving him. I can’t get enough of this mysterious and intriguing man, and though I know what we’re doing is weird and probably toxic, I just can’t seem to let him go.I never thought I would want another man.Until him.Until Him is a steamy M/M college romance with heart, soul, lots of laughs, and of course, cuddling.",
