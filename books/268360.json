  "description": "Welcome to Cedar Falls… I thought the sign seemed a little too welcoming, but when you get the call to move from the goddess herself, you don’t get to be picky. I just wasn’t expecting my new home to be so rustic and…down on its luck. But, when you’re a witch, life can get pretty interesting…and dangerous. Especially when someone is killing the local coven. At least the chief of police is pretty hot, when he’s not accusing me of being the murderer. Cedar Falls seems to have no shortage of hot men. With so many stunning men, why choose just one? Sorry, Chief. Let’s just hope I don’t get too distracted before I find the murderer, open my new bookstore, and help Cedar Falls become what it was meant to be… First Moon is an adult novel intended for mature audiences only. It contains graphic language and sexual situations. 18+ readers only! This is a medium burn reverse harem where the girl gets all the guys. Why Choose?",
