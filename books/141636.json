  "description": "James Jones's saga of life in the American Midwest, newly revised five decades after it was first published After the blockbuster international success of \"From Here to Eternity,\" James Jones retreated from public life, making his home at the Handy Writers' Colony in Illinois. His goal was to write something larger than a war novel, and the result, six years in the making, was \"Some Came Running,\" a stirring portrait of small-town life in the American Midwest at a time when our country and its people were striving to find their place in the new postwar world. Five decades later, it has been revised and reedited under the direction of the Jones estate to allow for a leaner, tighter read. The result is the masterpiece Jones intended: a tale whose brutal honesty is as shocking now as on the day it was first published. This ebook features an illustrated biography of James Jones including rare photos from the author's estate.",
