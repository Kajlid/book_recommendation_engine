  "description": "¿Lincoln Peirce is one of my cartooning heroes, and Big Nate ranks as a comics classic. Year in and year out, ¿Big Nate¿ is among the best comics on the funny page.¿ -- Jeff Kinney, author of Diary of a Wimpy Kid How¿d you like to be eleven years old, four-and-a-half feet tall, and the all-time record holder for detentions in school history? That distinction belongs to Nate Wright, the self-described genius, sixth grade Renaissance Man and star of his own comic strip, Big Nate. Equipped with only a #2 pencil and the unshakable belief that he is #1, Nate fights a daily battle against overzealous teachers, undercooked cafeteria food and all-around conventionality. He¿s the original rebel without a clue, alternately abrasive and endearing to classmates and teachers alike. Nate blazes an unforgettable trail through the sixth grade at P.S. 38, earning straight A¿s in laughs along the way. Big Nate appears in more than 600 newspapers worldwide and on the web at www.comics.com.",
