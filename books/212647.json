  "description": "When Trulane stepped off the bus landing smack dab in the middle of a small mountain town with no prospects or no money, she does what anyone would—finds a job and a place to sleep that won’t cost her any money. The only thing is that there is no such thing as being secretive in Estill County Kentucky—not when you’re about the only black person in the entire town. With no knowledge that she is about to cross the only person in town that doesn’t gossip about her, True hopes that Clay, the big grumpy and very sexy mountain man won’t turn out like so many others that treat her as if she is beneath them. True’s Love is a short romance from award winning author Pepper Pace and brings the readers back to the little town That Lt. Christopher Jameson aka Beast is from. If you like the stories about Estill County and its lively inhabitants than be sure to read A Wrong Turn Toward’s love and Beast.
