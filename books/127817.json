  "description": "Desperate to be turned and baffled by Lucien's continuing refusal, Peter is starting to feel that he's losing his vampire lover. Their relationship has become purely physical, with Lucien pushing Peter away at every turn. After a night watching werewolf Xander hunt, a night that sees Peter attacked, that might not be all he's losing. Fearing for his very life, and working hard to keep Lucien's increasingly uncertain temper from hurting his friends, Peter's doing all he can to prove that he belongs at Lucien's side, not just as a master, but as an equal. When Lucien disappears, Peter knows he has to call on every ally, every power he has, to get Lucien back before he's gone forever. Can Peter find a way to beat the forces working against them, or will he lose all that he holds dear?",
