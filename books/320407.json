  "description": "Devil, my beast of a man, seduces me into eloping, then kidnaps me for a honeymoon in Christmastown, Vermont. A lot of men would be furious. I simply planned revenge involving handcuffs. My annoyance doesn’t last long. Devil rents my dream cottage and manages to draw me out of my Scrooge-like ways. But I’ve been keeping a secret, and it follows me all the way to Christmastown. Can Devil and I enjoy each other, find our Christmas spirit, and keep ourselves safe from a vicious killer? This is a sequel to Devil (The Marchesi Family 3) and is best enjoyed after that story.",
