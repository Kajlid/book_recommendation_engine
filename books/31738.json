  "description": "The situation is dire. Four vast and powerful cosmic entities stand poised to destroy the Earth, while the spaceborne nano-virus called the Blight turns everyone--human and alien--into mindless zombies. With the mighty Ultraa near death and powerful Vanadium a captive of the enemy, Lyn Li and Esro Brachis have no other choice. They must lead a ragtag group of heroes and villains on a desperate mission. If they’re going out, they’re going out with a bang. It’s one last hurrah-- before the end of the world! Filled with action and adventure, STELLARAX sees our heroes through their greatest challenges ever--and no one is the same afterward. With five full-page illustrations by Chris Kohler. “Nobody - not even Abnett and Lanning - is doing cosmic superheroes as well as Van Allen Plexico is doing them. Period.” --Barry Reese, award-winning author and creator of The Rook",
