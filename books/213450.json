  "title": "Captured",
  "description": "Once a miserable sheepherder living on the coast of eighth century Northumbria, Aiden thought he’d found happiness at last when, after Viking raiders took him prisoner, he became the lover of the handsome Norse warrior Einarr and earned his freedom. But Einarr and Aiden’s still new love may be in danger already when, during a raid, Aiden is captured by an old enemy of Einarr’s— the dangerous and rugged outlaw Grímr. Aiden fights to escape and return to the man he loves, but as Grímr races to escape Einarr’s pursuit, Aiden finds his feelings for the desperate outlaw growing. Soon, an even greater threat will endanger all of them, and Aiden will have to decide where his heart lies— with the man who loves him, or the man who needs him.  \"Captured\" is a standalone sequel to \"Raider\". It can be enjoyed as a standalone story (you do not have to read \"Raider\" first, though reading \"Raider\" would likely enhance your enjoyment).  Please Note: This book contains Adult Language & Steamy Adult Activities, it is intended for 18+ Adults Only. Novella, approx. 50,000+ words in length. HEA (happy ever after ending). Does not end with a \"cliffhanger\". Contains M/M & M/M/M scenes. History purists be warned, some creative historical license has been taken with this work of fiction.",
