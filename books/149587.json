Handsome, heterosexual Tom Blake is a typical, Mid-Western, unfaithful husband until the day he receives an email, instructing him to show up at a gay bar -- or else! What starts as a simple bit of blackmail by his co-worker Aaron soon becomes more complicated as Tom finds himself struggling with feelings he's never experienced before. Will Tom resist his unexpected, burgeoning passion for Aaron? Or will Tom find himself ... Turned Gay?  Dear Reader: This is a complete story, not the first few chapters, not a cliffhanger.
