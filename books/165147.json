  "description": "Howard Frank Mosher is one of America's most acclaimed writers. His fiction set in the world of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom chronicles the intertwining family histories of the natives, wanderers, outcasts, and fugitives--white, Native American, escaped slaves fleeing north, French Canadians, and others--who settled in this remote and beautiful place.Set in the 1950s, God's Kingdom reveals the Kinneson family through the coming of age of the heir to its rich and complicated history, Jim. Earnest and innocent, Jim is a bright student, a loving son and brother, but also curious about the unspoken \"trouble in the family\" that haunts his father and grandfather. Layer by layer, tale by tale, sorting out fact from deliberately-obscure legend, Jim explores the Kinnesons' long relationship with others in the Kingdom, culminating in a discovery that forever changes his life and place in that world.",
