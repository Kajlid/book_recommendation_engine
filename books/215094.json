  "description": "Winter Rise of the Pride, Book 2 Winter Blue, Guardian of the Shaw Pride, has sworn to protect the beautiful and stubborn Nova Raines. His panther knows that she is his mate, but Winter’s refusal to touch her causes him to almost destroy their fragile relationship when she is attacked by a human male and left for dead behind the bar that she owns. The wolves are still on the loose, and when a rogue panther comes forward with information, the pride soon realizes that the male who assaulted Nova is a wolf and will stop at nothing until he kills her. The panthers assemble with a plan, ensuring that the pack of wolves are destroyed so that the pride can live in peace. When Nova’s ability to protect herself is questioned, Winter has to make the decision to change her into what he is to save her life or leave her vulnerable to his enemies. His reasoning for keeping her human could also be the one thing that takes her life for good when the last remaining wolf returns to finish off the job.",
