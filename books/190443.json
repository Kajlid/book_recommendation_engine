  "description": "The pain is unbearable. The voices are worse. I know it’s affecting her, I can see it in her eyes every time I look at her. We’ve been on this journey for weeks with no relief in sight. We haven’t had a real conversation since before that first strike of lightning, and I constantly miss what we could have become. There’s only one thing I can do to make it all go away. To ensure that I can once again be the man that she needs, the man that she loves. I have to fall.The apocalypse wasn’t what I thought it would be. The earth hasn’t turned to lava, and ungodly creatures haven’t risen from the depths of hell. The angels are fighting the Fallen, and more and more humans are slain every day. Both sides are multiplying, and there’s only one side we can choose to be on. The Fallen are evil, but more and more I’m realizing so are the angels. No one can be trusted, and no one is safe.",
