  "description": "Ok...So they say everything happens for a reason. But try telling that to a young woman with a newly broken heart. It doesn't help. What possible purpose could a jerk of an ex-boyfriend serve in the grand scheme of things? After writing a ton of poetry chronicling her entire relationship (including some poems riddled with humor, and others filled to the brim with the highest levels of passivity), the whole reflection culminated in an unexpected life lesson that surfaced on 9/11. So it seems that even crappy ex-boyfriends are good for something after all.",
