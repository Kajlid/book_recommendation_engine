  "description": "It should have been a one-night stand.I never intended to seduce Taushen, but things happened. I don't dwell on the past and while it was great, I'm not looking for a relationship. Of course, try telling that to Taushen. The big blue alien's in love after one night, and it's making things darn awkward. We've got bigger problems than whether or not I'm his woman, like the ‘cargo’ of the space ship that landed here.But Taushen's not giving up. He thinks I'm his mate.And he'll do anything to keep me.",
