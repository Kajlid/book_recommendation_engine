  "description": "Life in suburban Long Island is simple and content for Aurora Marx. She has a comfortable home with doting parents and a pesky but loving older brother. She spends her days with a devoted group of close friends as they wait out the summer days before starting seventh grade, doing all the normal stuff like hanging out at each other’s houses and going to the food court and movies at the local mall. Why would she want to change a thing? She definitely wouldn’t rock the boat by applying to boarding school, yet somehow she finds an acceptance letter on her bed from Mystic Academy of the Arts. Immediately intrigued, Aurora feels inexplicably drawn to the school, and when her parents let her enroll, it seems like the opportunity of a lifetime. Mystic is no ordinary school, not even for practicing magic, so Aurora finds herself rubbing elbows with witches, vampires, werewolves, demons, sprites, even ancient gods—and she’s one of them! Despite the excitement and joys of her new life at Mystic, though, someone or something is after her, and the evil her enemies threaten to unleash might destroy everything and everyone Aurora loves.",
