  "description": "\"Of course I worry.What if the cops witness a cat opening a skylight andmasterminding a robbery?The tabloids will love it.\"There's a new pair of thieves in Molena Point, California, a renegade yellow-eyed tomcat with a cold disdain for the law,and a scruffy human partner who is no better. The two, clever and silent at their work, are bad news indeed to crime-solving cats Joe Grey and Dulcie. But when Joe learns the pair's connection to a good friend, and then an innocent couple turns up dead in the library garden, Joe and Dulcie must engage in some fancy paw work to unmask the deceptions and route the real killer -- before his brazen criminal crime spree careens madly toward them.",
