  "description": "Film Cognition to Interpretation explores the dynamic counterpoint between a film’s soundtrack, its visuals and narrative, and the audience’s perception and construction of meaning. Adopting a holistic approach covering both the humanities and the sciences―blending cognitive psychology, musical analysis, behavioral neuroscience, semiotics, linguistics, and other related fields―the author examines the perceptual and cognitive processes that elicit musical meaning in film and breathe life into our cinematic experiences. A clear and engaging writing style distils complex concepts, theories, and analytical methodologies into explanations accessible to readers from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, making it an indispensable companion for scholars and students of music, film studies, and cognition. Across ten chapters, extensive appendices, and hundreds of film references, Film Cognition to Interpretation offers a new mode of analysis, inviting readers to unlock a deeper understanding of the expressive power of film music.",
