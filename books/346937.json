  "title": "A Scottish Ferry Tale",
  "description": "Once upon a time, a young woman had her heart broken. She was cynical enough to close the door on love, but idealistic enough not to lock it. Instead, she escaped to an island off Scotland's west coast, where she met someone who might change her life, if she would only allow it. Does she? And who is this life-changing person, anyway? Are there any dragons? Fairy godmothers? Chocolate cake? And is there a happily ever after? Hey....is this a *kissing* book?!",
