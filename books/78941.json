  "description": "This work is dedicated to my Ulisi (Maw-Maw). She raised me until I was ten years old. At that point, she was ninety-three and went to be with the Great Spirit. The foundation, that I needed, was instilled within me in that short period of time. My Cherokee heritage has been a guiding light. It is also a tribute to all indigenous people that suffered the atrocities that many still deny. They are my brothers and sisters. The Great Spirit says, \"We are all related\" and that is indeed the truth. I can tell you that all pieces contained within, are spiritual in nature and meant to see the truth. There are many pieces that apply to all. Hope, serenity and contemplation, it's all right here in this work. Modern society doesn't leave you with many alternatives. I hope that you can find a lighthouse \"within the storm\". It is imperative that we make our way back to the true meaning. I wish you peace and blessings.",
