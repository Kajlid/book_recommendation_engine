  "description": "After university, Cassie Fielding is destined to move back home to the farm and marry local boy, Doug Spivey. Doug is reliable, hard working, and uninteresting, in bed and out. But Cassie's father is in poor health, and she can't run the farm alone. The future feels like a prison sentence until she meets her father's new hired hand. The mysterious Simon Dennis is a city boy with a high finance past, who knows a thing or two about farming--and lovemaking. When Cassie discovers that Doug's plan for their future includes plowing up her beloved woodlands in order to make the farm more profitable, she turns to Simon for help and lets nature take its course.",
