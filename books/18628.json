  "title": "I Like You",
  "description": "This classic and funny hardcover picture book is the perfect way to say I like you. A deeply affectionate celebration of all the reasons we like each other, here is the book that Romeo would have given Juliet, Charlie Brown would have given Snoopy, and you can give to some very special friend. This book expresses the true meaning of friendship in a long list of ways with charming accompanying illustrations by Jacqueline Chwast. For example: I like you because you know where I'm ticklish, and you don't tickle me there except just a little tiny bit sometimes! Whether for Mother's Day, Valentine's Day, Teacher Appreciation Day, graduation, or any day, and for adults or kids, you can't go wrong with I Like You. As Maria Popova comments in The Marginalian: \"Love—that sweetest, most knotless and untroubled kind—is what radiates from these simple, surprisingly profound verse-like meditations on friendship, illustrated with the kindred sensibility of Chwast’s simple yet richly expressive black-and-white line drawings.\"",
