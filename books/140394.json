  "description": "Written in the spirit of Ovid (43 B.C–A.D. 17/18), this lively and erudite book traces the art derived from Ovid’s Metamorphoses from the Renaissance up to the present day. The Metamorphoses has been more widely illustrated than any other book except the Bible; for centuries, great artists have drawn, painted, and sculpted its stories, the artists often responding not only to Ovid’s work but to one another’s in their depictions.  Paul Barolsky, a specialist in Italian Renaissance art and literature, explores Ovid’s unparalleled influence on the visual arts, discussing works by many of the most famous artists of the past six centuries.  Broadly interdisciplinary, the new understanding of the themes of the Metamorphoses revealed here will appeal to those in the fields of Renaissance art, humanism, literature, history, and classics, among others.  At once witty, entertaining, and profound, Ovid and the Metamorphoses of Modern Art from Botticelli to Picasso is a meditation on what words can achieve that images cannot, and conversely what images can show that words cannot tell.",
