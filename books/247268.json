  "description": "Ato was never one to shy away from adventure. She traveled her small world with her friend Reed to discover lands that others could only dream about. However, unlike Reed who sought to unravel the mysteries of the world, Ato had a different reason for her adventures - her art. It was her deepest desire to share her art with others and show them the entire world, but that was before she met Iro. The tiny dragon opens the door that leads Ato into her art and into a world of her own creation.",
