  "description": "An action-packed allegory that captures our growth from non-believers to mature ChristiansThrough the mysterious Bloodstone, which symbolizes God’s great love for mankind, three children are whisked into strange and wondrous worlds. Soon they are visiting places like the Sea of Mirrors where they are nearly crushed by the weight of their sins, or the Menagerie whose prisoners are doomed to live in pure selfishness, or Biiq where one doubting child is allowed to experience the same deep and unfathomable love that Jesus Christ has for us.With the help of intriguing characters like Aristophenix—the world’s worst poet, Listro Q—a tall, purple dude with dyslectic speech, and Weaver —who weaves God’s plans into each of our Life Tapestries, the children learn the powers and secrets of living as citizens in the Kingdom of God.",
