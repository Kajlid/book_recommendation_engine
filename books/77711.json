NEVER BEFORE PUBLISHED For Christmas, Kirkland Fleming, Earl of Copeland, promises his guests a fortnight of eating, drinking, and hunting ghosts at Broomhill Hall. Though he fears his ill health may soon turn him into a ghost himself, he hopes to find a pleasurable diversion in holiday cheer. But icy roads prevent his guests from arriving--all but the one he did not invite... Though the beautiful Miss Belinda Walcott has arrived for her own mysterious purpose, the magic of the season soon casts a spell on them both...one that may even be strong enough to revive Kirkland's flagging Christmas spirit.",
