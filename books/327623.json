And my darkest desire.Konstantin Reznikov's war buried me in darkness.Four years later, he's the one dragging me screaming from my coma.The viciously domineering, brutal, terrifyingly gorgeous tyrant who haunts the shattered fragments of my memories. The man with dark gray eyes as cold as his dark gray soul.I remember almost nothing from my past. But he does. Now, he owns my present, and my future.Because Konstantin didn’t wake me up for free. He brought me out of my darkness to engulf me in his.To own me. To trap me in a maze of twisted games and jagged thorns.Now I’m bound to the broken god of wrath and ruin who might hold the key to my past.Or maybe, to my unraveling.Broken God is book 1 in a duet and not a standalone book.
