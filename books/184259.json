  "description": "It was just business. And then she got pregnant… Anna Langford is ready to be CEO of the family business, but her brother won't give up control. When she sees the opportunity for a major deal, she goes for it, even though it means working with Jacob Lin, her brother's former best friend, the guy she's never quite gotten over—the man her brother now despises. A successful venture capitalist, Jacob makes ruthless moves. And Anna has given him the perfect chance to take revenge on her brother… What starts as business turns into romance—until Anna learns of Jacob's motives. And an unplanned pregnancy presents them both with the greatest challenge they've ever faced.",
