  "title": "So Now You Know",
  "description": "A deeply moving, rawly honest, and true account of one girl's internal battle to overcome her eating disorders. Darah Echevarria was a mere child of nine when her whole life became a blinkered obsession about one food - eating too much, not eating at all. Do you have any idea what it is like to live with just one thought dominating over everything you do? When food becomes your entire life? A life of figures. Calories, kilograms, hours, minutes. Counting, always counting. And the lies, the endless promises, the deadlines, the disappointment, the self-deprecation. 'So Now You Know' is a necessary breath of fresh air among a host of scientific, academic explanations, excuses, justifications, legitimisations - it is emotional, sincere, demystifying. A confession.",
