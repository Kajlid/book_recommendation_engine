  "description": "Dewey Fairchild isn't just good with parents, he's great with them. He's so good at handling parents that he's built a thriving business out of it. He even has a secretary, Clara--a great alibi and an even better baker. Dewey settles the most troublesome of cases, from an overprotective mom who won't let her child go to class on her own, to a dad who can't stop picking his nose any chance he gets! Dewey has no problem handling other people's parents, but when he overhears his parents talking one day, he faces a challenge he never expected. Dewey can solve any problem parents may cause, but what will he do when the parents who are causing problems are his own?",
