  "description": "Lucius had been patient long enough. Now he wanted his woman, his mate, and nothing and no one was going to stand between them ever again, not even her.Tonya had never been what most would consider to be lucky. She hadn’t been lucky enough to have been born with a great metabolism or great looks. She hadn’t been lucky enough to keep her landscaping job in the city or her dream home from being foreclosed on, and she hadn’t been lucky enough to meet the right guy and fall in love. But, as luck would have it, she had no idea that the right man was about to land right in her lap, literally. Only she didn’t recognize him as the man of her dreams when she first met him. How could she when all she saw was a wild wolf that chased her into her house right before it passed out on her?",
