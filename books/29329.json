  "description": "THE DEAD WALK!!! We've read the headline a thousand times. An apocalypse in full swing greets us and we witness the fall of society, the end of life as we know it. Yet, so often, the questions remains Where did it all begin? How did it start? Who was the first person infected? ZERO is a septuplet of tales that does not drop you into the middle of the outbreak. This opens the door to the first case of infection and allows a glimpse at how humanity will fall victim to the unstoppable wave of horror that is The Walking Dead.",
