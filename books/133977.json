  "description": "Otto Hollen has always protected his younger brothers. Three of them have been chosen to be guardians for the next Great Ward, and Otto’s determined to avoid the final position. Yes, being chosen is a great honor, but Otto’s convinced it will force Owen, his youngest brother, to sacrifice himself for the greater good. Otto would rather die himself than let that happen – even if he has to fight the Earth itself.Thalion Eisenwald should be celebrating. His father, the unicorn alpha, named Thalion to be his heir. It’s what he’s wanted his entire life. So why does the arrival of two Hollen brothers make him uneasy? He’s heard rumors of new guardians being chosen, but those are stories. Besides, Thalion plans to be the next alpha of the herd, not a guardian for the world.When the Earth chooses Otto as Thalion's mate, Otto shockingly rejects the bond. Thalion is furious, hurt, and grudgingly impressed. But their brothers' capture changes everything. To save them, Otto will need to accept the bond with Thalion. Faced with an impossible choice, they desperately search for search for a third option. One that doesn’t result in those they love ending up dead.",
