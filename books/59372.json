  "description": "Will buried secrets ruin season two of the Dragonfate Games —or will the truth set fated mates free? After a whirlwind of controversy ten years ago, Matteo was done in the spotlight—or so he thought. He dropped his stage name, iconic costume, and celebrity status to live out a humble life as a golden eagle omega. But a second chance at the Dragonfate Games makes him yearn for his fated mate... and threatens to unearth a past he abandoned long ago. Thystle's been prickly since his favorite band broke up a decade ago. As a dragon who hoards music—and an alpha who crushed hard on the lead omega vocalist—the fallout left him devastated. He's never quite gotten over TalonStorm's dissolution, but could being the \"prize\" of a reality TV dating show lure his celebrity crush out of hiding? When Matteo arrives on the island again, the amethyst dragon bachelor makes his heart skip a beat. But he's not alone. The other omegas competing for Thystle's love are fiercer this time around. Matteo has to fight talon and wing to come out on top... all while keeping his past under wraps. Because if the truth comes out, he may lose his chance with Thystle forever. Alpha Dragon's Eagle is a fun, sweet mpreg novel with low angst and high stakes! Reading the series in order is recommended. No cheating, and fluffy HEA guaranteed.",
