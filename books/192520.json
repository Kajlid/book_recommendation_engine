  "title": "Men of Mayhem",
  "description": "Sometimes the line between good and bad simply depends which side you’re on…  Good guys can have unsavory secrets, while so-called criminals can live by a code of ethics rivaling that of any law enforcement agency. Bending the law for money, power, or revenge is one thing, but what if you’re bending it for your family—for love?  Who would choose to become involved with a man who walks on the dark side…  Some men will go to any lengths, legal or not, and make no apologies to protect their way of life and all they hold dear. But you don’t always choose who you love, and sometimes you just have to decide if you’re bold enough to risk it all and go along for the ride.  Thirteen masterful authors come together to present Men of Mayhem.  Compelling stories of loyalty and passion, love and lust, in which the moral and ethical lines are blurred, and call into question the notions of right and wrong.  What could be more exciting than taking a leap of faith…and landing in the arms of the last man you’d expect—but the only one who truly makes you feel alive?  What if your road to happiness leads to…  Men of Mayhem",
