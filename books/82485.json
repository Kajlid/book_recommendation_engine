  "description": "The Unshorn Thread, part one of the Tales Misforgotten trilogy, is a tale of Merlin and his charge Arthur, the boy who would be king. Though their tale may seem familiar, The Unshorn Thread guides us quickly down unmarked paths and into new surroundings. This is a world in which gods and mortals meet. It is a place in which Faerie Stories and Tall Tales are true. It is a place where every god ever prayed to spoke back, and every demon ever feared stalked through the darkness, creeping ever closer to their unwitting victims. Even Arthur, as he drifts off to sleep, can feel the swirling, black eyes of something sinister looking back at him from the darkness of his bedchamber.Through the lens of Merlin and Arthur, we are told stories which span millennia â€” from Ancient Greece to the Steampunk future of American Reconstruction in the 1870s. Though separated by vast amounts of time, these tales nonetheless feel connected, as if they are trying to speak to one another across the years. Merlin and Arthur begin to listen to these hints and whispers, even going so far as to act upon the knowledge they have gleaned. But will this discovered knowledge help them as they live out their own tale, or will it bring even the legend of King Arthur crashing down?",
