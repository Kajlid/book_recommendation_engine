  "description": "Beautiful and curvaceous beyond compare, Ahrahyah lives in gilded bondage as the favorite concubine of the Sultan of Fahrahshan. Having provoked the ire of the Sultan's wife after years of indulging his lust, Ahrahyah seeks out the Sultan's oldest son, Prince Faydeddin. Through seduction, she hopes to gain his protection, acting purely on desire regardless of consequence. Ahrahyah soon discovers that the handsome prince knows more of her origins than even she was aware. The stunning Ahrahyah is the half-blood daughter of the Djinn, demonic and powerful entities born from the lusty dreams of mortals. Bound to the will of Faydeddin by an arcane form of slavery, Ahrahyah journeys to seek a long-lost treasure for the prince. She must recover the crown of Shahvirahz-the most fearsome wizard-king in the history of Fahrahshan-before she can claim the destiny that awaits her.",
