  "description": "No memory, no resources, no secret lair, and no time to find her feet; this is the story of a self-made villain, and her fall into strife. Fleeing from unknown enemies and an early death, she emerges into a city gone dark in the aftermath of a complete systems failure. Hounded by heroes, menaced by gangs, and helped by the most unlikely of allies, she claws her way up from weakness to strength and works to build a better future for those who deserve it. To survive, she'll need strength to stand toe-to-toe against secretly supernatural foes, compassion to work with the dregs and outcasts of a broken society, and cunning to outwit intelligences beyond human ken. The challenge is great... but she is Dire. And Icon City will never be the same again. This is the first novel from the \"Tales from the Teslaverse\" project.",
