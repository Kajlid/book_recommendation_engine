  "description": "An inspiring work that offers direction and wise counsel for increasing awareness of self, one's motivations, and the importance of each person's unique contribution to society. First published in 1926 as The Science of Living, Alfred Adler's Understanding Life provides a straightforward and common-sense system for learning more about ourselves, the reasons for our behavior, and ways to change for the better. Adler provides guidelines for discovering how our beliefs--our \"private logic\"--hold us back, as well as useful tools for breaking free of this negative thinking. Stressing individual uniqueness and creative ability as well as the importance of common sense, Adler shows us how to work toward our goals without worrying about the outcome. \"Self-worth depends not on ultimate success,\" he writes, \"but on doing one's best. What's important is not the abilities and advantages we have, but what we do with what we are given.\" Acknowledging that service to others is a key component in individual healing and growth, Adler further emphasizes our responsibility to contribute to the common good. Understanding Life offers both an ideal vision for humankind's future and the guidelines for personal growth and social responsibility that will help us contribute to that future's realization. \"We are all goal-directed,\" he writes, \"attracted by a future which we ourselves create.\" About the A contemporary of Carl Jung and Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler was born in a Vienna suburb to a Jewish grain merchant.
