  "description": "He proposed.She has her doubts.She said yes.Now what?Everyone tells Sarah Giles how lucky she is to be engaged to Paul O'Brian, a handsome hotshot who's financially secure, knows how to throw the perfect dinner party . . . and taught Sarah how to, uh, take care of herself. Everyone thinks he's great. Except for Sarah. But she has too much on her plate trying to become career woman of the year and hiding the fact that her seemingly blissful relationship is all but celibate (those lessons he gave her should come in handy) to figure out what's wrong with Mr. Right, let alone qualify for the role of perfect fiancee.Meanwhile, what started as an innocent office flirtation with a man named John Wayne (really), has now moved beyond illicit lunches and harmless text messaging, and is fast turning into erotic obsession. Sarah can't get John out of her head and she's plunging deeper into a double life. But which life is the lie?Torn between two men, and trying not to lose sight of her own dreams, Sarah writes a scandalously honest diary of one life-changing year, and faces the challenge of writing her own happy ending . . .",
