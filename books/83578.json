  "description": "Lacey Jordan was a woman who knew what she wanted…and she wanted nothing to do with the new doctor in town. He had the perfect smile, perfectly tan muscles, and a way with people—her people. This was her town, her family, and her life. He’d come into town and shaken everything up including her heart.Aaron was running away from a hard breakup where more then just his heart had been broken. At this point all he wanted to do was take over his grandfather’s medical practice, work on his new house, and turn it into the first place he could call his home. He liked the town of Pride; in fact, he had spent the only good parts of his childhood here. What he hadn’t expected was to bump into a fairy goddess, bumping hard enough to get a concussion and have his heart mended at the same time.Then, the town gets a visit that will change their lives forever, if they can survive.",
