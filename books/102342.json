  "description": "His name when he was human was Kern.  Now he is the most feared of a werewolf.  When the change first came upon him, his parents drove him away with silver daggers.  Later, he sought human companionship, but he could not hide the truth for long.  And so he kept running until he ran headlong into the deadliest pursuer of all-a harper bent on stealing his life away.  By chance Kern was able to find refuge at the Inn of the Yellow Tinker, and the woman he was destined to love.  But can he risk both human and harper vengeance to keep her?",
