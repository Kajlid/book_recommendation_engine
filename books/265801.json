  "description": "This Russian’s obsession is unlike anything I’ve ever seen.  His eyes lock on me the first time he sees me, and when he hears some rude Russians speaking about me in their native tongue, he goes primal, showing me a possessive, jealous rage like none I’ve ever seen.  His intense obsession with me and the violence he carries out is frightening, sending me running… and surprising me when I think of what my first time would be like with this inked alpha male.  Will I ever see this obsessed Russian again, or will this younger woman only have the memory of her possessive Russian protector?  And even if this older man in Moscow was so obsessed that he did track me down, what would I do, and what would my family back home think?  Only a completely obsessed man who knows what he wants and will stop at nothing to get it would keep looking for me... as I'm about to find out.  *Russian's Obsession is an insta-everything standalone instalove romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
