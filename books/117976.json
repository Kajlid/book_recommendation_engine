  "description": "Yoga Love is a 45,000-word novella.  Twenty-five-year-old Lila Hayes is living a Zen-like existence with her boyfriend, Joey, in the foothills of Colorado’s Rocky Mountains, as a yoga instructor. Sure, her income is paltry, but who needs money when you have love?  Apparently, Lila does, because her one true love has been cheating on her and she’s had to kick him out. With wit and creativity, she plans a new life, vowing never to forgo her dreams for a guy again. Things become complicated when she meets an utterly un-Zen-like, handsome, oil entrepreneur, who is determined to make Lila his next acquisition.",
