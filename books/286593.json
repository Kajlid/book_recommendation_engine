  "description": "David \"Gnat\" Royce has survived 47 trips over Nazi-occupied Europe, as an air gunner on an RCAF bomber. The closer he gets to the end of his tour, the less sure he is that he's going to make it. Throw in a volatile new pilot, a mysterious tail gunner, and Luftwaffe jet fighters, and his chances just got a lot worse. It's a game of odds and luck, under a Bomber's Moon.",
