  "description": "Ashlee Nichols fell in love with her brother’s best friend, Beau Jacobsen, when she was twelve-years-old. She knew he was the one, her very own Prince Charming, and that one day they’d marry and live happily ever after. When she confessed her feelings to Beau, he’d laughed, patted her on the head and told her he was flattered. Though she was crushed, she held onto her feelings, waiting until she wasn't a little girl. Just when she turns eighteen, Beau joins the Army and is deployed to Afghanistan. Now, six years later, Beau is back in Mitchel Creek, Georgia for a few weeks. He’s hotter than ever … and still ten years older. Ashlee's never seen the age difference as a problem but Beau has a hard time getting past it. She doesn't mind helping him out a little and soon his perspective changes, bringing up a whole new set of problems as her older brother's best friend becomes something much more.",
