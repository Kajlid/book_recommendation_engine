  "description": "Alex seems to have it all: a great penthouse apartment, a lovely girlfriend, and a prestigious Wall Street job. But below the surface he is sure of nothing but his angst-ridden doubts. And when he realizes that his doorman may be God, or sent by God, he will question things like never before.  This novelette is a story of New York doormen, tormented love, empty office life, and the theological questions that arise in response to the horrors of evil.",
