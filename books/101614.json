  "title": "Unlock the Key: Inspired Writings of a Procrastinating Journalist",
  "description": "My experiences so far have inspired me to take what I know and present it in a way that this time last year I never imagined would ever have been possible. Unlock the Key is a collection of stories (told through poetry and each with their own unique introduction) inspired by actual events, pictures, ideas, feelings, and people that were, are, and always will be a very special part of my heart. It is my sincerest hope that at least one person will benefit from the work that I have spent the past ten years creating. I've laid my heart out on the line, So that others may try and find, Some inspiration of their own, And know that they are not alone.",
