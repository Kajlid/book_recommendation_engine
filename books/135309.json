She had the skill, timing, and sheer guts it took to guide a Thoroughbred through grueling cross-country endurance events. For Raine, the Olympics was the culmination of a lifetime of competition.For Cord Elliot, the Olympics was a dangerous assignment--to guard against terrorist attack. And Raine, the woman of softness and surprising steel who beguiled him from the first, was the prime target.A core of the same wild courage drew them together. But danger swirled around them, and it would take all their fierce will to protect their love.This book was rewritten and published under the title Remember Summer in 1999.",
