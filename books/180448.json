  "description": "At 29 I got married to live the life of the perfect wife with the gorgeous children. I did that for ten years, the last four of which I was completely celibate. Then I went online and everything changed. After an online love affair with a man 3,000 miles away, Suzanne Portnoy—mother of two and a top executive in the entertainment industry—begins her sexual reawakening. Embarking on a sensational and prolific series of liaisons, Suzanne beds a top London chef who cooks her a five star meal on the day her husband moves out. An affair with a famous men’s magazine editor quickly ensues, followed by a top cameraman who takes pictures of Suzanne naked. But this is just the beginning. Insatiable, Suzanne dives into the swinging scene and works her way through an entire spectrum of sexual experience, including exhibitionism, group sex, fetish clubs, and a predilection for picking up men in her lunch hour. Suzanne's journey of self-discovery is anything but typical; her attitude towards sex and relationships even more unusual in this story that is shocking and heartwarming in equal measure. Freed from the restraints of marriage and monogamy, Suzanne takes pleasure without commitment and tells her story without a trace of shame. She's not looking for Prince Charming anymore, just for fun—and she finds it.",
