  "description": "Jade begins her summer confused. Yes, there's that whole \"will this be a leg-day or a tail-day\" kind of confusion, but Jade's got even bigger problems: it's been three weeks since Mom returned to the ocean with no news of her whereabouts. Plus, it's been twenty-one days since Jade first kissed her mer-boy Luke and now-nothing.Will Mom find the enchanted tidal pool that will allow her to become human? And why is Luke acting so weird? The SEAquel to Helene Boudreau's critically acclaimed Real Mermaids Don't Wear Toe Rings is as energetic and fresh as a salty sea breeze.",
