  "title": "Pretty Shameless",
  "description": "The second I ran into Gunner Wilson and his outrageously cocky attitude at my cousin’s shooting range, I considered us a team. Then he played dumb about a duffel bag full of money, my cousin’s whereabouts, and the freaking case he’d been working. Now, I’d bet my britches (and everything else I’m wearing) that my sexy, hot-assed Texas Ranger is lying about my cousin’s real involvement in the local gun smuggling ring. I know just how damned distracting Gunner can be. Trust me. The pure, unadulterated want between us has never been stronger—and it seems Gunner is pulling all the punches to drive me crazy. He’s good, I’ll hand him that. But as they say—“You can’t pick your family”—and I’ll be damned if I’m going to let one of them take heat for a crime they didn’t commit. This case means war.",
