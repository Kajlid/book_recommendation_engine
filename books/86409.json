  "description": "It's going to be a hard job finding a partner for a mom so unusual, but this little girl is determined to try What makes a dad ideal? Is he strong as a superhero or handsome as a movie star? Is he intelligent or sporty? Or is he just good at jigsaw puzzles and has lots of hair? One little girl is about to find out in this funny, charming, and ultimately moving story of her search for a dad who can measure up to the mom she loves. Together, she and mom draw up a list of all the things they want in a dad and place a notice in the paper—only to discover dozens of candidates lining up outside the house the very next day! In the end, the successful candidate is a long distance from what they thought they wanted, but he's special too—in his own way. This immensely positive and entertaining book, told from a child's point of view in memorable rhythmic language, is for any child reflecting on what makes their dad so great. With the lightest of touches, and without any loss of entertainment value, it also tells the story of a quirky single-parent family’s happy transition into a blended family.",
