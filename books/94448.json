  "description": "When the new goth girl in town Maggie befriends town misfit Lily, they discover more in common than their taste in alternative music: a disdain for the \"popular\" and \"normal\", psychic abilities, and the same dark secret.United in their struggle against society’s rules, Lily frequently wishes for death while Maggie wants a better kind of existence — and revenge.When a dark spell performed in teenage despair is invoked years later, they are plunged into the demon world, a world that has its own rules, family bonds, and mortal enemies they never even knew existed.Suddenly the darkness within, the victim’s desire for power over aggressors, and blood lust become literal matters of life and death. Lily and Maggie are forced to question what they really value — including each other.",
