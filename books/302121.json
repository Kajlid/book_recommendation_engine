  "description": "Coming in 2021.One hundred years ago the Empire of the Red Vine fell, but not before it propelled its last princess into deep space, where she and the seed of the vine would wait, safe in stasis. Now, Ruby is awake. The vine is hers, but she can't help feeling there's been some sort of cosmic mistake. She was never meant for the invisible crown, and the princes the universe delivered to her aren't at all what the lore foretold.",
