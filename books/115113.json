  "description": "Amazon bestselling series in contemporary fantasy and paranormal romance“I loathed myself for wishing a death of that nature on anyone, and even more so because I still wanted it to happen. My moral fiber was unraveling quickly, and I wondered how long my humanity could withstand the unending trial of values my life had become. With every choice I made, I felt it slipping away.And further down the rabbit hole I fell.”After a three-month reprieve, drama once again lands on Ruby's doorstep. Death has returned to Portsmouth, and the murdering of innocent women is back in full swing, signaling the return of a madman―the Rev. But he's getting uncharacteristically sloppy, and that could cause even bigger problems for Ruby, the PC, and werewolves in general. Complicating things even further is the return of another question mark in her life; one that could be equally problematic.As if that weren't enough to deal with, Ruby also finds herself endlessly running interference between the men in her life. Tensions run high as deceit, mistakes, and lies pile up around her, burying her in the inevitability that she can no longer be everything to them both. She is forced to choose one at the risk of losing the other―a necessary evil, which may just prove deadly.",
