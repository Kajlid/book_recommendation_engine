  "title": "Ancient Destiny",
  "description": "This is a science fiction novel set in todays time. The novel promotes women as intelligent and capable of almost anything that a man can do and sometimes better. Most of the women in this novel are elevated into a team of women saving the world in the next novel, \"Ancient Destiny - Escape from Earth.\" Craig is the captain, but more of a figurehead while the women are the experts on his team. It is something that could be happening now, but it could be the end of Earth in a few years or months. We know that Earth has been impacted by intersteller objects that either caused major changes to life on Earth and we know that one killed off the dinosaurs. We have had a number of near misses by smaller asteroids that the astronomers did not see coming. What if they spotted a very large one on course to impact Earth and too large to stop. The people of Atlantis came here from Mars to avoid being killed when the intersteller object hit Mars destroying most of its atmosphere. Some of them escaped Atlantis by leaving our solar system. The ones staying behind lost their technology when Atlantis was destroyed. A spaceship was left in orbit to educate the survivors in science and math to once again create the technology to escape Earth. Aristotle, Tesla, and others were trained by this ship, but the existing technology did not allow them to do what they knew was possible. Now the object that destroyed Mars is coming to Earth in only a few years and the ship has chosen a college student as the next Aristotle to advance science many years in a very short time in order for some small set of humans to escape into space.",
