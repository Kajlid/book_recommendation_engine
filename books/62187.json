  "description": "In this prequel to the Tarizon Trilogy the lives of three important leaders are chronicled, Rupra Bruda as the father of the Purist Party, Ramel Garcia as the champion of the Supreme Mandate, and Threebeard, the leader of the millions of mutants living outside the domed cities of Tarizon. Interwoven in the story of these influential leaders is the rise of the rhutz, Nanomites and Seafolken as sentient life-forms on Tarizon and the clash between the Purist, who want to enslave them all, and the Loyalist, who believe they are protected by the Supreme Mandate.While all this is happening Tarizon is rocked by a series of super-volcanic eruptions that kill millions and enshroud the planet in a blanket of toxic haze. While most on Tarizon are just struggling for survival, the Purist see this horrific event as an opportunity to seize control of the government, revoke the Supreme Mandate and rid the planet of all inferior life-forms. As the volcanoes finally fall silent and the population begins to dig itself out of thick layer of volcanic ash that covered everything on Tarizon, they enlist the help of the Nanomites to begin rebuilding thousands of structures that have collapsed as a result of nearly two thousand tremors associated with the volcanic eruptions. Unfortunately, the intentional fumigation of thousands of swarms of Nanomites and Central Authorities unwillingness to appropriately punish the human responsible, sets off an unconventional war between the humans and nanomites that throws the planet back into chaos.",
