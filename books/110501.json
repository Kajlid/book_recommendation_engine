  "description": "Living on the edge is nothing out of the ordinary for Bucky James. The hardened ex-marine has seen his share of action and knows what it is to stare danger in the face. Civilian life has pushed him to the edge of suicide. After pulling himself back from the brink, he canâ€™t resist the covert job offer when he finds a mysterious note on the windshield of his car. The money is good, but will he lose his soul to the devil -- or will his sense of morality win out?",
