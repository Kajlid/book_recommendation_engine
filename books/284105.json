  "description": "In the military and law enforcement, the line between right and wrong is clear. Who you trust absolutely has never been questioned…until now. Air Force Security Forces Master Sergeant Alex Thomas just got back from a rough deployment and already has a new assignment—to train a new team in everything she knows. Much to her dismay, her new team is not military but members of the Boston Police Department. When she finally meets them, she realizes why the military and local law enforcement don’t team up. Officer Jen Miceli doesn’t play by the rules and is all too willing to take risks. The two women are locked in a battle of the wills, but when the team comes across a large stash of weapons and drugs, their world is turned upside down by who it implicates. As members of the Boston PD are ambushed and friends are fighting for their lives, Alex must find a way to complete the mission and keep her team alive. What do you do when the lines that you have always counted on become blurred? When you don’t know who to trust?",
