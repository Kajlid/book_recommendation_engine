  "description": "'It's an emergency, George. You remember Vladimir? George, are you awake? You remember the old General?' The phone call that dragged George Smiley, acting Chief of the Circus, from his bed was a plea to return to active service. But only to bury the case, not to solve it. 'An old acquaintance shot dead on Hampstead Heath, an old woman in Paris promised the return of a daughter she'll never see, a photograph taken in a Hamburg brothel - and George Smiley is called out of retirement ...SMILEY'S PEOPLE has all the le Carre touches' Sunday Telegraph",
