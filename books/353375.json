When their relationship progresses and Casey is presented with Jared’s collar, she runs scared.Jared has had enough of Casey’s evasion of him and their relationship. He sets a plan in motion to show Casey there is no weakness in being submissive, in being owned by him. He not only overwhelms her with his presence, throwing them together whenever possible, but he also shows Casey how others in the BDSM lifestyle live so she understands there is no one right way. Jared plans not only to win Casey back but to capture her, heart, body and soul, and he’ll use whatever means necessary to see the job done.",
