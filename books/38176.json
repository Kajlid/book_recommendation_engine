  "title": "Anne Frank: Anne Frank",
  "description": "In 1933, at the age of four, Anne Frank and her family fled from the Nazis in Germany and sought safe haven in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. In 1940, when the Germans invaded the Netherlands, the Frank family once again feared for their lives. Like tens of thousands of Dutch Jews, the Franks went into hiding. They lived in several hidden rooms -- known as the \"Secret Annex\" -- above Mr. Frank's office building. It was there that Anne wrote her now-famous diary.The Franks lived in hiding for two years before they were discovered and sent to Auschwitz, the most well-known and feared concentration camp. Anne Frank gave a human face to the victims of the Holocaust and a courageous voice to all those who were silenced.Though Anne Frank only lived to the age of fifteen, her inspirational childhood is perhaps the best known in history.",
