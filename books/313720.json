  "description": "With the death of the New World Order Dark Cabal, and its Draconian severities and murder, The New Age of Aquarius and its Luciferian Great White Brotherhood of White Magick, will rise to power. The Great White Brotherhood, in belief systems akin to Theosophy and New Age, are said to be perfected beings of great power who spread spiritual teachings through selected humans. The members of the Brotherhood may be known as the Masters of the Ancient Wisdom, the Ascended Masters, the Church Invisible, or simply as The Hierarchy. The first person to talk about them in the West was Helena Petrovna Blavatsky (Theosophy), after she and other people claimed to have received messages from them. These included Helena Roerich, Aleister Crowley, Alice A. Bailey, Guy Ballard, Geraldine Innocente (The Bridge to Freedom), Elizabeth Clare Prophet, Bob Sanders, and Benjamin Creme. This transition to reveal the Great White Brotherhood and the secrets to occult White Transformative Magick marks The Externalization of the Hierarchy that Alice Bailey wrote about. The Left Handed path of Dark Evil Magick will be downplayed as The New Age takes full power over The Earth.",
