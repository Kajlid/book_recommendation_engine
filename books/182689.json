  "description": "A NEW NOVEL FROM CRITICALLY ACCLAIMED  FANTASY AUTHOR DAVE FREER. Teenager  Tim Ryan comes into his own as he  faces danger on a remote Australia island where magic lurks in land and sea. Tim Ryan can't shake the feeling that he is different from other teens, and not in a good way.  For one thing, he seems to have his own personal poltergeist that causes fires and sets him up to be arrested for shoplifting. As a result Tim has been sent to live on a rundown farm on a remote island off the coast of Australia with his crazy grandmother, a woman who seems to talk to the local spirits, and who refuses to cushion Tim from facing his difficulties. To make matters worse, Tim is expected to milk cows, chase sheep, and hunt fish with a spear. But he's been exiled to an island alive with ancient magic—land magic that Tim can feel in his bones, and sea magic that runs in his blood. If Tim can face down drug-runners, sea storms, and worse, he may be able to claim the mysterious changeling heritage that is his birthright, and take hold of a legacy of power beyond any he has ever imagined.About A Mankind Witch, by Dave Freer: “Good characterization, ripsnorting action and an ingenious plot make this a feast. . .” —Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)About Dave Freer: \"Dave Freer's stories are always well-plotted, fast-paced and—most of all—a lot of fun to read.\"—Eric Flint, New York Times best-selling creator of the Ring of Fire series  “Dave Freer always delivers compelling, fast-moving and addictive fantasy adventures.”–Garth Nix, New York Times best-selling author of The Keys to the Kingdom series",
