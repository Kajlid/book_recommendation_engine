  "description": "Drunk Knights. Dehydrated fish people. The floor of the local tavern after closing: as an apprentice physician at the twenty-four-hour infirmary near the edge of a wartime bivouac, Kilco Escamilla has pretty much seen it all. That is until a red-eyed assassin arrives in the midst of the annual once-in-a-lifetime windstorm, setting off a chain of events with apocalyptic potential. Soon, Kilco finds herself entangled in an ancient conspiracy involving demons, magical sociopaths, doomsday cultists, and… squirrels?Armed with nothing but her wits, paranoia, and an alarming amount of pie, can Kilco stay alive long enough to endure another morning shift? Or will she, too, fall victim to the otherworldly forces infesting the colossal tree growing in the middle of camp?Only one thing’s for certain, she’s not getting paid enough for this.",
