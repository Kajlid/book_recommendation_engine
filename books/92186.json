  "description": "Varg is a renowned bounty hunter, an expert survivalist, and among other things, a half-breed. After accepting what seems like another routine job, he meets a half-elf huntress named Milea who has been framed for murder. Upon proving her innocence, he unwittingly becomes a wanted criminal himself. Varg and Milea join forces and set out to clear their names, all the while avoiding deadly assassins trying to kill them at every turn. With every twist and turn, they soon discover that the murder victim was involved in a dangerous crime ring led by an entity known only as the Serpent. Varg must summon every ounce of courage he has in order to find the will to keep fighting, but his haunting memories of the past could prove to be the worst enemy of all . . .",
