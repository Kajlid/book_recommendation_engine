  "description": "Originally published in 1908. The classic and evocative tale of an Irish Wolfhound. The beautifully illustrated contents tell of his life and adventures from puppy days in Yorkshire through to thrilling exploits in the bush of early Australia. Many of the earliest dog books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce and increasingly expensive. Home Farm Books are republishing many of these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork.",
