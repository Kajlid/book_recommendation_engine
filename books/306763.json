  "description": "The spring that Trumpet was born, there were so many new foals in the pasture that almost no one notices there was a sassy little colt who didn't belong to any of the mares....  Fab Five phenom Carson Kressley brings us the story of a one-of-a-kind pony who learns that it's our differences that make us super. Whimsical black-and-white illustrations from renowned equine artist Jared Lee corral both humor and charm in this warm tale of a unicorn struggling to find his identity and place in the world.",
