Jones, has been keeping kids laughing—and reading—for more than twenty-five years. Over 65 million copies sold! Meet the World’s Funniest Kindergartner—Junie B. Jones! There’s going to be a pet day at school, only guess what? No dogs allowed! And that’s the only kind of pet Junie B. has! If Mother and Daddy won’t buy her a new pet, Junie B. will just have to find one on her own. Like maybe a jar of ants. Or a wiggly worm. Or—could it be—something even better? USA Today :“Junie B. is the darling of the young-reader set.” Publishers Weekly :“Park convinces beginning readers that Junie B.—and reading—are lots of fun.” Kirkus Reviews :“Junie’s swarms of young fans will continue to delight in her unique take on the world. . . .
