  "description": "Cathead Crazy: The Mathis family’s coined phrase for having less than a brain. When Hannah was young, every Sunday Ma-Mae baked Southern biscuits made with lard, big as a cat’s head. Hannah’s brother would spin and giggle and act like he’d lost his last marble until they came from the oven, piping hot and ready for butter and honey. Now in middle-age, Hannah feels as if she’s the one losing her mind while juggling roles as wife, mother, coworker, and caretaker. Sometimes she daydreams of escaping, of driving one-way out of town.Hannah belongs to the sandwich generation, one of many women wedged between nurturing children and caring for aging parents. Hannah’s elderly mother Mae can be profound and funny, or bullish and ill-tempered. Cathead Crazy is the poignant story of one woman’s determined journey through love, loss, and the surprises of mid-life.",
