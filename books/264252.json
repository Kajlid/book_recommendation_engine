  "description": "I would kill for her.   Harper    The night Arsen killed my father was the first time I realized the lengths he’d go to keep me safe. He might have done it to protect me, but he was still convicted and locked away for seven years. And for that entire time, I waited for him, knowing that once he was released, things needed to be said, the truth needed to be spoken. And that day was today. I loved him, but the look he gave me, the possessiveness and pent-up arousal reflected in his eyes … had me realizing one thing. Now more than ever, he wouldn’t let me go.  Arsen  I went to prison for Harper, and I’d do it all over again to make sure she was safe. She was all I thought about the entire time I was behind bars, and it was her weekly visits that got me through the years, even if I tried pushing her away. But after seven years of being locked up, I was finally released … and I was going to make her mine.  Warning: This is a short, dirty story about a hero who will go to any lengths to make sure the woman he loves is safe. With darker undertones and graphic scenes, there may be material some readers find offensive.  Reader note: All of the books in the “Cards of Love” series are standalone. They are not connected in any way. The only thing they all have in common is a tarot card theme. That means you can read and enjoy any of them in any order! :)",
