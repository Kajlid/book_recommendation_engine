  "description": "When Michael Williams helps stranded motorist Ashley Fallow, little does he know Ash will make him question everything he’s been taught about what a man should want. Michael’s a married man, though - not the greatest partner for a man like Ash who just wants to settle down. The chemistry between them is undeniable and leads to a one-night-stand, which soon blossoms into a full blown love-affair. Michael struggles to keep his family afloat while seeing Ash on the side. Ash brings some baggage of his own to the relationship; secrets that could draw them closer or drive Michael away.Torn between his family and the man he loves, Michael must choose between them or risk losing everything. But it’s not so easy to just leave his stormy marriage when his seven-year-old daughter Taryn smiles up at him. His wife Michelle may be selfish at times, but she genuinely loves Michael despite their problems. Ash is ready to leave for California if Michael can’t commit. Michael knows somebody will get hurt, but it’s too late to walk away. He knows he must face up to his feelings and the consequences if he’s to achieve any real happiness, but that’s easier said than done in small-town America.",
