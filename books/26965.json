  "description": "A CalPac Crew Novel Between his job as a Realtor and his home renovation business, Drew St. Charles is in over his head. What he really needs is a licensed contractor to oversee his projects, and Drew knows just the man for the job: Brad Sundstrom. The Sundstrom family has been in construction for years, so Brad knows his way around a toolbox, and he desperately wants out from under his sneering father’s thumb. The close contact and the excitement of a career-making renovation fan the sparks between Brad and Drew into an inferno. Before long, the phrase “working hard together” takes on a new meaning. It looks as if Drew’s dreams are coming true, although Brad is far from out and proud. But then Drew is savagely attacked in a hate crime, and Brad panics. Suddenly everything is in jeopardy. When arson strikes Drew’s dream project, Brad faces a crucial test: he’ll need to overcome his fears, save their work, and take his place at Drew’s side or retreat to the stifling familiarity of the closet. ~**~",
