  "description": "Pete Andersen was hooked from the moment he read the ad: “Learn survival skills in the majestic peaks of British Columbia’s Eaglenest Mountains … Not for the faint hearted ... \"Three months later, Pete and eleven others are dropped off in one of the most remote areas in North America, with no way out. As Pete learns primitive survival skills at the feet of their charismatic leader, Jake Christianson, he believes he’s found paradise. But when his companions begin to turn up dead, apparently mauled to death by a rogue grizzly, paradise turns to hell. Pete suspects it may not be a grizzly – the group has been splintering into factions, and Jake is unraveling before his eyes.Pete is forced to lead the killer on an epic chase across the continental divide and through the boreal forests of British Columbia to save the others. It is a race against a pursuer possessed with seemingly supernatural endurance; a race that will push him to the limits of human capacity and beyond, but it is a race he cannot allow himself to lose. Because the survival of all that he loves depends upon him winning.",
