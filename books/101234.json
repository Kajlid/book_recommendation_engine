  "title": "Just Thinking: Thoughts on Spirituality, Loss, Love & One Day at a Time",
  "description": "“In reading Jim's thoughts and realizations, I find that not only can I be inspired, but my own intuitive process is beautifully stimulated.....For me, one of the most important aspects of this book is a gentle, loving encouragement to rise up and keep pushing forward in moments when I might feel weak or defeated.... As you read through this collection of thoughts, you'll no doubt notice that Jim muses on a variety of subjects - the 12 Steps, loss, human interaction, love, faith, a Higher Power. His words also encourage flexibility in life, and clearly show us the futility of worry.”",
