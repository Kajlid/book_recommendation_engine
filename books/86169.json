  "description": "Every time we look into the mirror we see a reflection of ourselves. Some days the reflection is more pleasing than others. This delightful, motivational book uses a beloved, well-known story to help you cast reflections on your inner qualities – qualities that may not be readily apparent in the mirror. It illustrates valuable insights into examining your reflection of yourself as you are playing in the game of life. We are all players in this game. Some of us play more like the tortoise; some of us play more like the hare. Each and every one of us has a measure of tenacity. Do you have the will and the desire to persist over the long haul? This book will help you examine your tenacity; it will take you on a journey to explore the influences that impact upon your way of relating to the people in your world. Relationships can be kindled or extinguished based on external cues. Our external personal branding starts on the inside. It can change as life experience gives way to wisdom. It can change as goals and outcomes change. Aesop's Fable about the Tortoise and the Hare sheds light on some of the more ordinary, yet fundamental, influences in our day-to-day lives.Whatever your goal, you’re in a race from the very day you decide to pursue the goal. You may have a game plan or you may be making it up as you go along. Regardless of your strategy – fast or slow, tenacious or sporadic – you will reach a “finish line” at some point. It is up to you to take the best parts of both the Tortoise and the Hare and make them part of you. Use these concepts when creating your own winning game plan to market yourself or your business.",
