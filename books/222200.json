  "description": "\"LeVoit's work exists at the center of a glowing nexus where fever dream punk rock poetry collides with raw emotion and vertiginous talent.\" --Jeremy Robert Johnson, author of Skullcrack CitySet in and around Hollywood Forever Cemetery, this tense and mind-bending noir is Violet LeVoit at her finest: an unnerving, unpredictable and comic journey through deep trauma and glitzy nostalgic insanity.\"I Miss The World is a gut-punch, throat-punch, heart- punch of a novel. LeVoit knows how to seduce you with a lullaby when she's going for blood.\" --Danger Slater, author of Puppet Skin\"It is masterful, it is beautiful and awful, it is sweepingly and breathtakingly artistic, the impact of seeing some great natural wonder or work of art for the first time.\" --The Horror Fiction Review\"Revelatory, gut-punching, brilliantly anarchic perfection.\" --J David Osborne, author of Black Gum",
