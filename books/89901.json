  "description": "Katherine (Katie) Calder is happy, or is she? Married to a patient, loving and handsome lawyer who has been her life for 6 years â€“ Chris. He wants nothing more than a 'normal' happy family life - will being with Katie ever give him that? Katie does not know how to love him or anyone but she knows she could not be without him. She has detached from life, from love, from any true emotion yet Chris continues to love her unconditionally wishing for the day she will declare her love and even cry for the first time since he has known her. Katie's mother - Jill Williams is desperately trying to rebuild a relationship with her daughter who has been missing from her life for six years for reasons she has never understood. Bringing Gerry back into Katie's life was not the answer. Gerry brought back the horror of her 'missing years' causing her distress, misery and even blackouts. Why, what had Gerry done? What had happened in those two years when she had been missing that could cause this pain and anguish and if they found out would they feel the same about her? Katie didn't think so, she had to protect them against the truth and she had to face her past - but at what cost? Disconnected is an intense, emotional journey that will have you smiling one minute and then feeling hurt and pain the next. You want it to work out, you want the happy ending - but then life is never that straightforward, this book will leave you with a void, this book will leave you disconnected!",
