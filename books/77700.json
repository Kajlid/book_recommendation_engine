  "description": "A photographic tribute to Mexico's rich and diverse cultures. For the wandering photographer perhaps no country, over photography's century-and-a-half history, has had the consistent allure and been the site of so many artistic breakthroughs as Mexico.From Henri Cartier-Bresson, who flowered as a masterful surrealist in Mexico in the 1930s, to the American Paul Strand's \"Mexican Portfolio\"-the spiritual jewel of his life's work-to Edward Steichen and into recent years, photographers have found in Mexico's people, its culture, and its light much of their defining inspiration.Here are fresh views of the land and people of Mexico, its powerful histories constantly enriching its present.",
