Keidai Saeki is a high school student who remembers his past life in Pompeii, living as the Italian warrior Sirix... His friends around him are all also reincarnated--although they don't quite remember things the way he does. And Keidai's wife from the past? She's now a middle school boy--while his best male friend is now a cute girl?! Throw in a case of love at first site, and you have a new look at romance--manga-style!",
