  "description": "Ten-year-old Sevilla Ray has a secret: whenever she gets really scared by some larger-than-life menace, such as a not-so-dead Ghost Moth or the Angry Woman of Kits Beach, she shrinks to eighteen inches tall. When one day she shrinks and rides off on her Irish Setter, Raven, her life will never be the same. Itâ€™s bad enough that her friends think she is involved in black magic, but she is not the only one with magic. The unthinkable has happened: her magic has followed her back to her safe mountain town. She discovers a menacing clan of canyon dwelling children -- and the witch who is hunting them. Before she can learn to control either her mount or her magic, the witch lures her away from her family, her friends, and her dogs. With only Raven to help her Sevilla Ray must resist the witch to save the Feral Children, and herself.Performed by award winning actress Meg Roe.For the preteen inside us all, the one we wish we were.",
