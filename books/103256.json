  "description": "He watches me. Watches as my husband makes me submit, makes me do things that, even in their depravity, bring me pleasure. He knows what I like, and how I like it. But while Nathan dominates my body, Drew is interested more in my soul. I can only bend so far before I break. Drew is my crack, my weak point around which everything else splinters. Even as more secrets are unveiled and all of the signs point to danger, I roll farther into this world. Into this high-brow life, into both of their beds. But to what end? At this point, I don’t know what’s in more danger: my heart or my life. For these men, these two men who I am pushed and pulled between? They seem to be much more interested in my death than they ever were my life.\nTill Death is a novella, approximately 55 pages, and is book 3 of a 4-part series.",
