  "description": "It is 1953 in colonial Kenya, and eight-year-old Vikram Lall witnesses the celebration of Queen Elizabeth's coronation, even as the Mau Mau guerrilla war challenges British rule. Vic and his sister Deepa must find their lace in this uncertain world of violent upheaval, confusing loyalties and conflicting ideologies. And among their newly acquired playmates, the brother and sister, who are of Indian origin, find themselves in between the British Bill and Annie, and the African Njoroge. These friendships will haunt them the rest of their lives.We follow Vic from t he changing Africa of the fifties, to the sixtiesâ€”a time that holds immense promise. But when that hope is betrayed by the corruption, fear and repression of the seventies and eighties, Vic finds himself drawn into the official orbit of graft and power-brokering. Njoroge, on the other hand, can abandon neither the idealism of his youth nor his love for Deepa. Neither the cynicism of the one nor the idealism of the other can avert the tragedies that await.Acute and bittersweet, vividly portrayed and finely nuanced, The In-Between World of Vikram Lall is told in the voice of the exiled Vic from the shores of Lake ONtario, as he contemplates the historical events that have shaped him and the choices he has made.",
