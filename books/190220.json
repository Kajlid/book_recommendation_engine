  "description": "Somewhere along the line where human nature meets human imagination, myths are created. Somewhere in that space lives the spirit that created and sustains Shehaios, the Fair Land. One man embodies the gifts of the spirit. A man all too susceptible to the human flaws that lie beneath the cloak of magic. The journey of self-discovery for Kierce, heir to the Lord High Magician, and Caras, heir to the chief of Oreath, is inextricably bound up with the history of their land. The survival of their self-sufficient agrarian culture is threatened by the might of the sophisticated Empire of the Sacred Union, and neither Kierce's cunning nor Caras's courage may be enough to save the Fair Land. A story that will take you on a wonderful trip into a fantasy world and maybe reveal aspects of the real one.",
