  "description": "Tom Renfield, janitor-cum-taxi driver, has always had some weird abilities - seeing ghosts, perceiving other 'currents' of energy... but he's always tried to ignore them. Running from himself seems to be a large part of how he ended up in the tiny town of Arcadia. However, when he picks up a beautiful model from the big city in his taxi and sets off to take her to her brother's wedding at an obscure house in the woods, little does he know what he's in for. Laura's extended family are an ancient clan of witches(?) who make a habit of terrorizing and enslaving the townspeople. However, that doesn't stop Tom from instantly falling in love with her. With the help of a ghost, things are about to get shaken up in the town of Arcadia...",
