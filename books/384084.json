He's been cursed after discovering an ancient stone tablet that dooms any woman foolish enough to marry him.

Yet from the moment she meets the mysterious viscount, Meredith finds herself falling for a man she should not love. With an ominous curse over their heads, risking her life for passion would be madness indeed...",
