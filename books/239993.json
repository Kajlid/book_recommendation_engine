  "description": "WARNING: This eBook contains mature language and content intended for 18+ readers only!  Love can come from anywhere, even when we least expect it. Many of us find it after trying to be with the person we're crushing on. Some of us find it after a long while with someone we never thought we'd be with. And still, for others, it never seems to come at all till it smacks us right in the face.  For Jason Jones, and Brandon Hamilton though, Love seems to come when neither of them expects to find it. Jason Jones, a popular rising star in the NHL circuit, is the last person that Brandon Hamilton expected to fall in with. An equipment manager with feelings of bitterness from growing up, they bump into each other after an NHL game cool down session and decide to go out for drinks.  But the question then becomes; Can Brandon overcome some of his own insecurities, and can Jason realize that sometimes being up front is better than being coy? Hopefully, they discover that they can, together, find love through the Ice.  A standalone short story ending Happily Ever After PLUS bonus gay M/M romance stories inside!",
