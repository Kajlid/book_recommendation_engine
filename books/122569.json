  "description": "A celebration of non-traditional milestones and a book for all the single women in their thirties who have wondered where their gift registry is, Degrees of Engagement Â is a smart and witty read. When Bianca Dimitriou's family and friends don't show up to celebrate her PhD, after years of her attending their bridal showers, bachelorette weekends, destination weddings and post-divorce benders, she knows it's because it's not a milestone they value. Angry, sad and a little more than drunk, she gets her revenge by getting fake engaged to Xavier Byrne, a brooding archaeologist turned librarian whose passion is returning artifacts to their native lands. But the longer it goes, the more it becomes clear that the tension that's been building between them has given way to very real feelings. Which would be fine, except Bianca's post-doc work is keeping her close to home while Xavier's is about to take him halfway around the world. She can't ask him to stay and he'd never ask her to give up her dreams. Can their love go the distance?",
