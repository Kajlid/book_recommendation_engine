But a mistake in his past binds him, possibly for good, and he must risk everything to free himself or lose Ryu forever. Four months ago on assignment to protect Ryu from a psychopathic gangster, ex-boxing champion-turned-cop Nat Phoenix fell in love with his sexy charge. Four months later, Nat's feelings have only deepened and all he wants to do is exchange vows with Ryu, the White Tiger who has completely captured his heart, body and soul.

Could he be facing prison and what could be a permanent separation from Ryu? He won't let Ryu come to his aid which would mean giving up his boxing career and fading chances at glory. And Ryu would give those all up in a heartbeat to help Nat, but for another emergency that keeps him in Tokyo. Forced to stay behind, Ryu must confront the demons that threaten his and Nat's bond and fight for the love he's waited for his whole life...",
