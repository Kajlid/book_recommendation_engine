  "title": "The Father",
  "description": "Many experiences in the personal life of dramatist August Strindberg involved duels between the sexes, with ruthless, aggressive women usurping the supposedly male prerogatives of decision-making and leadership. Strindberg explores this theme in depth in The Father â€• a highly emotional study of marital upheaval and a no-holds-barred struggle between man and woman. One of Strindberg's best works, the stage play remains one of the most gripping psychological dramas of modern theater. Biographical Note.",
