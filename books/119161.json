  "description": "Emma's life changed in a moment. She was engaged, she had a good job, her future was all set—and then her fiancé shattered everything. \"This isn't working,\" he said. When she heard those 3 little words, Emma began to question everything and she fled her perfect little life to regroup with her sister in California. But Becca wasn't there, and Emma was left sitting on the beach wondering what to do next. At that moment she saw a group of gorgeous guys, who thoughtfully offered to take her in and help her through her grief. Emma knew it wasn't a good idea to go off with a bunch of guys she barely knew, but life was supposed to be an adventure, right? Maybe it was time for her to start living it like one! With her new friends, Emma discovers a sensuality she never knew was inside her and finds that the limits of her old life were meaningless. After a week with these guys, Emma will never be the same!",
