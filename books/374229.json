  "description": "The completely revised and updated New Edition of this definitive text―now in full color! Long known as the source to consult for guidance on diagnosis, prognosis, plan management, and genetic counseling, this easy-to-use reference focuses on the patterns of human defects caused by inborn errors in morphogenesis as opposed to defects caused by mechanical problems. It provides a wealth of information on normal and abnormal morphogenesis * minor anomalies and their relevance * clinical approaches to specific diagnoses * and normal standards of measurement for the entire spectrum of disorders. Each chapter includes a description of the specific abnormality―including occasional associated abnormalities―natural history, etiology, and references. On opposing pages are several descriptive photographs and line drawings of either an individual with the abnormality or specific features of the abnormality.",
