  "title": "Grey Matters",
  "description": "\"Narrated with spunk and humor by a zombie who still has sex appeal, Grey Matters is a fresh take on the undead meme where the enemy comes from within, literally. One of the most original and shocking takes on zombie literature I've ever seen. Grey Matters is humorous, acutely terrifying, and thoroughly gripping from the first page to the last.\"--Katherine Boyle, Veritas LiteraryThey bash our heads and chain us up because we're different. Well, maybe knowing we would happily throw on a bib, rip out their guts, and devour them like hotdogs on a stick, without the stick--or the bib for that matter--probably has something to do with it. No one really wants to hang out with a girl whose idea of a Slurpee is grey matter and blood splashed in the snow, hold the straw.Evelyn Cross has everything: shampoo commercial hair, a letterman jacket, a tiara, a 3.98 GPA, and now the Z-Virus that is infecting teenage couples in the small town of Eli. As usual though, Evelyn is a cut above her peers. The virus has made her look like a ZV and crave human flesh like a ZV, but instead of slowly consuming her organs and brain, it has transformed her into a super predator, fighting both sides of a looming conflict. On one side, armed Z-V Institute Snatchers hunt down unwilling, infected test subjects. On the other, pale white ZVs with body parts stuck in their teeth invade people's homes and devour their families. Evelyn is the grey in the middle. And she's not the only one of her kind--there's also Greyson Childs, the vicious pack-hunting player that dumped her best friend when they all got infected.When the war really heats up, Evelyn has to take a good look at herself and decide if she can embrace what she is and make it work.",
