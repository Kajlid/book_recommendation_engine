  "description": "Tristan Holloway is in desperate need of a roommate. When Kash Alexander comes into her life, she doesn’t expect to have a roomie that towers over everyone else, is covered in tattoos and pierced, and has perpetual scuffed-up knuckles. But there is something dark and deadly that lurks below the surface that makes up Kash, and she is drawn to him.When she stumbles upon an underground cage fight, the last person she expects to see is Kash, especially within the cage. The way he fights, dirty and raw, should have Tristan running the other way, but instead she finds herself enthralled.As if that one night sets into motion everything else, Tristan finds herself involved with Kash in every way possible. The only problem? Kash isn’t interested in a relationship. With a battered past that haunts him, and a future that threatens Tristan’s life, the only way they can overcome it all is together.",
