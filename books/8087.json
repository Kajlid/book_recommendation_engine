  "description": "The island of Caroni was once serene and beautiful. Under the reign of James and Mara, leaders of the Ansheniu, their nation was bountifully favored. When an evil swept through the land, James found himself battling his brother for the welfare of his family and his people. Many had to flee Caroni, including James and a pregnant Mara, for their own safety with the promise of returning one day when proper order could be restored. Amelia and Jade were brought up close as sisters in Mt. Echos. When they were finally about to come in to their own, their world as they once knew it turned out to be nothing but an illusion. Hidden from dangers unknown to them, they get separated. Not only do they leave to find their way back to each other, they also have to find their way back home, their true home.",
