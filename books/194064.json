  "description": "“Touching and intelligent, The Sale of Woodhouse Glass isn't your ordinary romance. Kali Woodhouse is a widowed mother-of-two who spends her days running her deceased husband's business, Woodhouse Glass, and flirting with the town police officer, who is exactly right for her in every way. He's certainly a better choice than the bad-boy, screw-up she's known since childhood, and who just so happens to need a job and has the necessary skills for Woodhouse Glass.  “No, this isn't the generic storyline you've seen before with flat characters who play their roles according to the formula. Watters eschews cliche and instead tells a touching story about love, loss, family, and finding happiness again after tragedy.”  -Author of \"Someone Else's Fairytale\" E.M. Tippetts",
