  "title": "Starving the Artist: How the Internet Culture of Free Threatens to Exterminate the Creative Class, And What Can Be Done to Save It",
  "description": "For a lot of people, creation is their livelihood. For others, it's where their livelihood ought to be. As Richard Florida wrote in his 2004 book, The Rise of the Creative Class, \"Stimulating and glamorous as it may sometimes be, creativity is in fact work...The creative ethos is built on discipline and focus, sweat and blood.\" All music, art, movies, writings and games were brought into being by their creators - and for these creators to have created them, there was some underlying motivation to do so. Without their creators and their motivations, creative works simply would not be. Why then, in today's Internet culture, is all creative work expected to be free? Why is it that some individuals feel it is their right to take things that do not belong to them, without receiving any permission to do so? Why, in the Internet culture of \"free,\" are those creations we enjoy and value most the ones that we are most likely to simply take? This is not a book about copyright, nor is it a book about the evils of free. This is a book about right and wrong. This is a book about respect. This is a book about the value of creative work. This is a book for the creators. May you keep on creating.",
