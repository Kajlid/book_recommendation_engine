  "description": "A salesman who drives the state of Florida strives to learn the cause of his frequent panic attacks whenever he crosses bridges. Discovering he's the mortal embodiment of a mythical figure was the last thing he expected. Now, crossing stranded souls across bridges is his new vocation. Hardly what he signed up for, but neither was falling in love with a 900 year old Japanese-Jewish trans girlfriend or drinking with the rude spirit of Ernest Hemingway. These days, one can't be picky about employment. Death - it's a living.",
