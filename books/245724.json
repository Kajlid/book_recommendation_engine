I might have enjoyed my ability...if I hadn't discovered humanity is on the brink of a genetically-engineered apocalypse.Bodies rotting in the streets. Wilderness eating away at my hometown.Monstrous creatures hunting down the few survivors.No one can save the world... except me.Because for me, it hasn't even happened yet.For me, it might never happen. All I need to do is kill the man who will destroy the world. The father of my high-school crush. The only problem is, the more time I spend in that dystopian wasteland, the less I want to erase it.To save the future, I'll need to sacrifice the one person I can't bear to lose.

Let yourself be captured by this zombie-infested time travel adventure based on Greek mythology. ***UPDATED IN 2017 - Part one of this book was published earlier, it's been revised to include part two and is a complete novel.
