  "description": "“Live all you can; it’s a mistake not to.”This is the maxim of celebrated author Henry James and one which his typist Frieda Wroth tries to live up to. Admiring of the great author, she nevertheless feels marginalized and undervalued in her role. But when the dashing Morton Fullerton comes to visit, Frieda finds herself at the center of an intrigue every bit as engrossing as the novels she types, bringing her into conflict with the flamboyant Edith Wharton, and compromising her loyalty to James.The Typewriter’s Tale by Michiel Heyns is a thought-provoking novel on love, art and life fully lived.",
