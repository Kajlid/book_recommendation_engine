  "description": "A woman made for love...She thought she was dreaming, melting in her imaginary lover's arms.  Yet when Theodora Lovelace awoke, it was in the fiery embrace of the most dangerous and desirable man she'd ever met....A man made for war...He rode at dark, swathed in black, a privateer and patriot hero--until some called him spy.  No one suspected that Miles Winchester was the Night Hawk.  And only Miles now knew that an imposter rode as well, besmirching his reputation and threatening his secret life.  His only aim was to find the blackguard.  Until he met the stranger in his bed, Theodora, a raven-haired, violet-eyed temptress, in a night of abandon that sealed his fate....A passion made for legend...Within days Theodora was married to Miles Winchester, impressed into wedlock by her uncle, the admiral, to save face.  She vowed no man would ever know her duplicitous, perilous masquerade, her secret rides in the dark of night.  But she hadn't reckoned on passionate obsession, and a marriage of untamed desire and deceit....",
