  "description": "A new case won't solve Parker's old problems...Parker Ferro needs a vacation. His boyfriend is MIA on a high profile murder investigation, the fae courts have him on call at all hours, and he’s still cleaning up the mess from his last big case. Of course that’s nothing compared to the demands of the debt he owes the spirit of San Amaro. So when a wealthy new client contacts him to locate a stolen a fae artifact, Parker’s hoping for a simple job. That the artifact in question looks eerily similar to the one that got him involved with a notorious criminal and almost ruined his life last year has no bearing on the decision, right? Not to mention the thief’s ability to enter high security areas without a trace and a few very suspicious deaths. As his life continues to spiral out of control, Parker has to juggle what’s most important to him: his relationship, his need for revenge or his life. Then again, no one said becoming the new Windrose would be easy.",
