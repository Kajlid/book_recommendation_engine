  "description": "At seventeen, most girls begin the journey of finding themselves. Not Annie Green, she has to find Scarlett Maxwell. Scarlett is Annie's assumed identity while she is in the witness protection program. Unlike Annie, Scarlett is bold, beautiful, and boobatious! Annie struggles with balancing her own problems and living Scarlett's materialistic life. As if this isn't enough stress on a teen girl; add a crazy-stalker-lady, a sister with an obligation to get into trouble, and a new roommate with an agenda. However, none of that even compares to the struggles she faces with her crush. Annie found herself in this mess in the first place after witnessing a woman kill her aunt and uncle. To make matters even worse, the woman is looking for Annie. She seems to have a connection with Annie that is much deeper than any ordinary kidnapping. She will stop at nothing to find her. Is changing Annie's name, appearance, address, family and attitude enough to stay safe?",
