  "description": "What if the struggles you were having simply melted away? What if the fears and limiting beliefs that stop you from having the life, career, and relationships you dream of just weren’t there anymore? What if it became easier to take inspired action, make money, and relate to people you love (and to those who challenge you)? If you’re on a path of spiritual and personal growth, you know that implementing the powerful ideas, tools, and techniques that are shared by the great teachers isn’t always as easy as you want it to be. A few years ago, Jack Canfield, co-author of the \"Chicken Soup for the Soul\" series, wrote \"The Success Principles,\" one of the most powerful guidebooks for successful living ever written. Living according to the success principles has brought happiness, health, and wealth to people the world over. But many still struggle to implement these ideas, along with other great teachings. Now a new, cutting-edge technique has emerged to make achieving success easier than ever before. Meridian Tapping, sometimes known as Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), is a revolutionary tool to remove the fears, doubts, and upsets that keep you from living according to your values and ideals. This enhanced e-book gives you a step-by-step guide to overcoming any obstacle that is keeping you from success. If you’re familiar with tapping, you’ll love the fresh, transformative methods in this e-book. If you’re not yet familiar with these techniques that hundreds of thousands of individuals are using to transform their lives, you’ll love the ease and simplicity of these methods. With \"Tapping Into Ultimate Success,\" the rewards you’ve been looking for are literally at your fingertips.",
