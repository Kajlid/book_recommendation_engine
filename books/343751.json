  "description": "Chamberlain Ski Resort and Spa Welcome to the 10th Annual Snow Queen competition! I can't believe I got roped into this. Snow Princesses must attend all pageant rehearsals, with appropriate outfits. Well, no matter what it takes, I'm going to wipe that smirk off Layla Chamberlain's face. Our rehearsal space can be booked to practice your talent. Um, does \"looking dumb in a dress\" count as a talent? See Grayson Chamberlain, the assistant director, with any questions. If you insist! First How can someone so sweet (and hot!) be a Chamberlain? Good luck! One of you will soon be our new Snow Queen! Oh joy. Unless Grayson comes with the tiara . . .",
