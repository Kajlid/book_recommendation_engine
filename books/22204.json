  "description": "An untimely end to a long, stable relationship leaves Amelia Grant at a crossroads. Should she try to reassemble her life much as it had been for the past 20 years or try something completely new? As the Internet becomes her lifeline to the outside world, she finds herself exploring lifestyles she never knew existed.Dirk Gregory has been a successful Sub/Slave trainer and BDSM club owner for nearly his entire adult life. Immersing himself in his work, he has completely denied himself any chance of a romantic relationship. He can’t even bring himself to take a vacation, so when his friend Bella asks him to take on a complete novice and introduce her to the BDSM lifestyle during a break in his schedule, he obliges.The immediate attraction between these two is undeniable to the point of distraction. As they each struggle to stay on task through the training program Dirk has crafted, they fall helplessly deeper into a relationship: A bond that is based on a rich understanding of one another, trust and mutual respect. But that doesn’t improve their situation. They can’t change who they are, and finally, they have to face reality and forge ahead in pursuit of the common goal: Find Amelia a suitable Dom.Publisher’s Note: This book contains explicit sexual content, graphic language and situations that some readers may find objectionable: Anal play/intercourse, mild BDSM theme and elements.",
