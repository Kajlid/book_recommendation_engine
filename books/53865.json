The Palma family, ancestral owners of the Hacienda, proudly feel that they have restored the family's importance to the level it had since the times of the earliest Colonial Spanish Viceroys in Mexico. The four friends have separated; Juanita Reyes and Leora Hunter have just finished their first year of High School; Juanita in Morelia, Michoac√°n and Leora in Virginia. Rafael Palma and Pedro Hernandez are graduating from different High Schools in Mexico City. The horses are thriving and El Dorado, Juanita's favorite, has grown from the tiny foal she found into a magnificent Spanish stallion,",
