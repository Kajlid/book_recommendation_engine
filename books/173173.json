  "title": "Nanny and Me",
  "description": "Florence Ann Romano believes that having a nanny is more commonplace than ever, and – to that end – socially acceptable. There are a multitude of books that educate parents on “how to” hire the right nanny; what to look for; what not to do; etc. But, she wanted to write something for the most important person in this equation: the child. Being cared for by your parents to being cared for by a virtual stranger can be a very unnerving experience for young children. Florence Ann wanted to write a book that helped the child understand this transition – show them that someone, other than their parents can love them; care for them; be invested in their future; keep them safe and provide glorious memories and fun.She always had the book written on her heart, so the words and storyline came very easily to her. Florence Ann simply searched her memory for the most treasured moments she shared with all of “her kids.” She wanted those moments to be fun, educational, sweet and loving. Not only does your nanny take care of you, but she educates you; helps cultivate your personality; teaches you life lessons; etc.",
