Alyson was the perfect test subject for a new treatment for PTSD that deliberately creates multiple personalities. Placed under hypnosis, her memories were stored in the minds of The Sleeping Dogs, nine alter egos designed to help her triumph over the memories of her past so she could finally lead a normal life.The method was brilliant, but when things heat up between Alyson and Dr. Greene, new \"unauthorized\" personalities start taking over, and Alyson's mind goes into a tailspin of confusion and obsession that can only lead to one thing.Murder.Now, it’s up to forensic psychologist, Dr. Roni Price, to hunt Alyson down before she kills again, but with no leads and a witness who refuses to talk, it’s anyone’s guess as to how, or even if, Alyson will ever get caught. A mind-blowing thriller, with twist after twist, Where Sleeping Dogs Lie is a journey into the psychotic wonderland of a killer whose innocence somehow remains intact.",
