When she and recently widowed vet, Sully, rescue a super intelligent Collie, Chase finally finds herself part of the loving family unit she has always craved, but every display of Bandit’s special skills brings them one step closer to the mercenary billionaire who created him… and he wants his expensive experiment back.  With the enemy's personal SWAT team out for blood, a devastating turn of events finds them running for their lives as they fight to save one of their own.",
