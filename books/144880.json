  "title": "Evolution of Angels",
  "description": "After finding characteristics of the \"angelic\" genetic code hidden throughout the human population, a secret agency decides to recreate angels of their own. The agency's \"Double-Helix project\" manipulates the gene sequences in certain humans, creating soldiers who can wield the armor and weapons of angels known as the \"Aurascales\": a sentient armor that forms a symbiotic relationship with its host. In the pursuit of genetic perfection, and the hopes of helping his wife conceive a child, William Sanderson splices the DNA of an angelic donor with that of an unborn child, potentially making a warrior far superior to anything they've seen before. When the boy's abilities can't be controlled, his memory is erased, his powers locked behind a mental wall, and his mother takes him on the run, leaving Sanderson and everyone else to believe them dead. One day, to battle a desperate force from another realm, the boy is unwittingly recruited by the agency, and Sanderson fears the mental wall may be broken.",
