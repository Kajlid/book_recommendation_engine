  "title": "Fanny Hill: Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure",
  "description": "Fanny Hill, also known as Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure, has been a notorious novel since it first appeared in London in 1748-9. Banned for its \"obscene\" content, this fictional account of a young woman's unconventional route to middle-class respectability is a lively and engaging tale of a heroine who falls into prostitution, passes through the boudoirs and brothels of England, and eventually rises to respectability.  Fanny Hill's story offers modern readers sensuality and substance, as well as an unusually frank depiction of love and sex in the eighteenth century.",
