  "description": "During his younger years, David was a professional swimmer and fashion model. Now thirty-eight, he has filled out with a belly and a few gray hairs, and worse, he feels aimless and romantically lonely in life while battling with his mental health. Granted, he's still doable enough to please many men, top and bottom, especially twinks. But he wants more from a guy, someone more special than he's ever had. He's never experienced the happily-ever-after kind of love, after all.David's latest hookup is a never-been-kissed virgin twink who insists on having sex in the dark to conceal his identity, claiming he's in the closet. Despite his warm and wonderful mouth being put to great use, the twink already seems different from all the others. David can't put his finger on why there's something special about him, but soon, a shocking phone call unexpectedly changes his life and puts his fatherhood to the test.A fatherhood he didn't even know about until now.",
