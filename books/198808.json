She’s wild about dancing, and can’t understand or accept her father’s strictness in forbidding it.

But fear and obligation have him trapped. When a twist of circumstances throws Dorothy and Marshall together one night, it may offer them both a chance at escaping the tangled web of fear and deceit each has woven…if only they are brave enough to take it.Novella, approximately 26,000 words.",
