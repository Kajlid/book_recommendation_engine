  "description": "Jordan  Lacey was the one person I could never have. She was off limits in every sense of the word. I went to my families lake house and found her in the guest house. Little did I know she asked my father if she could spend her last free summer in the one place she adored.  That summer the devil tempted me, putting forbidden fruit right in front of my very eyes. I did such a good job at keeping my distance until the night of her eighteenth birthday. She was officially a woman and there wasn't another reason to keep my desires at bay. That was years ago. I've watched her graduate from college, gain an internship at Steele Enterprises and blossom into a sinfully, divine business-oriented siren.  What we did that summer could've turned into something more. Now that I've seen everyone else in my family find their own happiness I can't help but wonder what if? I'm just uncertain if Lacey will accept me for my darker tastes. It has been years after all, and with time comes new desires.",
