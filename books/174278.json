  "description": "Decompisia is the underworld’s most stressed Princess—she has plenty of her own work to do but always seems to find herself doing her layabout father’s job, as well. To help in the understaffed kitchens, Princess Decomposia has hired Count Spatula, the vampire chef with a sweet tooth. He’s a charming go-getter of a blood-sucker, and pretty soon the two young ghouls become friends. Together, can they keep the kingdom running smoothly?Tor.com is pleased to present The Fantôme Ball, an original comic set in the world of Andi Watson’s Princess Decomposia and Count Spatula, a sweet and mildly spooky tale of friendship, family, and management training for the undead!",
