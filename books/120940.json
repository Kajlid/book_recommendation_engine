  "title": "Art in the Dark and Other Tales",
  "description": "Art in the Dark presents a collection of short stories that come together in a journey that is by turns whimsical, ironic, frightening, and absurd. Much like the passage of life itself, these stories are mysterious and unpredictable. Through analogy and metaphor, author Robert Eichelberg addresses a number of difficult topics-such as love, death, alienation, materialism, war, and politics-from unique new angles, bringing to light aspects of each that may otherwise be difficult to consider. From the opening salvo of \"The Only Rule,\" with its shocking subject and frightening twist, to the gruesome and heartrending tale of Blue in \"The Bad Dog,\" each tale is imbued with at least a hint of the surreal. They remind us that our journey though life is short and that we must embrace every moment-even as we must ultimately let go. These stories transcend the conventional and challenge your perceptions and expectations, leaving you always in awe of the wonders that remain ahead.",
