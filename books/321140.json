  "description": "Brace yourself, Scotland. Hollywood’s coming…Hot Earl Rory MacGinley and feisty redhead Zoe Maxwell are in love, but true love can’t save Rory’s ancestral home from falling down. When a Hollywood superstar lands on their doorstep wanting to film Braveheart 2 at Kinloch Castle, it sounds like a dream solution to all their problems. But it’s about to turn into an absolute nightmare.A bonkers script that rewrites Scottish history, celebrities who believe in pixies and past lives, and a mystical holy man with nefarious plans. It’s not just the castle that's coming under siege.With tensions running high and more drama behind the camera than in front of it, it’s up to Rory and Zoe to rewrite the script, save the castle’s future, and secure their happy ending.When Hollywood meets the Highlands, things will never be the same again…Hollywood Games is a laugh-out-loud, super-steamy, small-town romantic comedy with a guaranteed happily ever after and no cheating or cliffhanger. It can be read as a standalone but is best enjoyed after the multi-award-winning romcom, Highland Games.",
