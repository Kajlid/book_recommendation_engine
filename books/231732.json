  "title": "Planet of the Hairless Beach Apes: The Eleventh Sherman's Lagoon Collection",
  "description": "This 11th collection of Sherman's Lagoon brings the shark faithful even more underwater antics, as great white Sherman and the Lagoonies enjoy life under the sea. In an imaginary lagoon near the island of Kapupu in the South Pacific lives a group of nutty but sophisticated underwater creatures-complete with neuroses that rival those of humans (also known as \"hairless beach apes\"). Somehow their wet world is oddly yet hilariously similar to our own. Sherman, a great white shark, is a typical guy (well, except for that pesky dorsal fin), and Megan is his ruthless but nurturing wife. Rounding out the aquatic crew are Fillmore the turtle, geeky fish Ernest, and macho hermit crab Hawthorne. Salty old Captain Quigley, who lost his leg to Sherman years ago, is determined to exact his revenge. Sherman and friends effectively reflect human behavior and occasionally must confront humans' encroachment on their unspoiled habitat. Environmental groups have applauded this comic strip with a social conscience for promoting marine conservation. Sherman's Lagoon has been syndicated since 1991, currently by King Features, and has a circulation of more than 200 daily newspapers on five continents.",
