  "title": "Pacific Fury: How Australia and Her Allies Defeated the Japanese",
  "description": "Peter Thompson presents, for the first time, an account of the conflict that places Australian voices and action at the heart of the struggle. Based on exclusive interviews with eyewitnesses and written with all the pace and verve you would expect of a master storyteller, Pacific Fury brings the people and the battles of the Second World War to life in a sensational history not to be bettered in a generation. After a conflict that took an unimaginable number of lives and ended with the unleashing of the most powerful weapon the world had ever seen, the Allies emerged victorious. Australia, however, was criticized by Churchill and his generals for showing cowardice in the face of the enemy and for not caring about the fate of other nations. The endorsement of these claims by several military historians today shows that the smear has not gone away. Until now.",
