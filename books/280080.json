  "description": "Open up Cobra's file cabinet and read one of the most criminal and destructive reports with shreds of evidence about the life of a masterful crime boss. The report goes deep inside the life of a man who sacrificed everything, from his freedom to his soul. He imagined that it was his duty to make sure that his family, circle of friends, and five tough, beautiful women—Cobra’s Angels—lived well, ate, and slept comfortably despite the costs. He learns quickly that the police think that he has made a huge mistake.\"They say the truth is so precious that it's usually protected by a bodyguard of lies. This true story has been fictionalized, but will show you that love never fails; it heals. But lust constantly fails, and it will always kill. Enjoy the rise and fall of Cobra.”—From Amir Brown",
