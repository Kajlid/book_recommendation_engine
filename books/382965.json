  "description": "PASSION REVISITEDAdele Bishop stares in disbelief as the tall, imposing figure of Reno Gold steps off the train. Her mail-order husband is no stranger, but the man who gave her a delicious taster of his wild streak years ago- when she was too young to know how to handle him. Now he's here, foiling her plain to turn the tables on the men of Whistle Stop, who order their brides as if they were commodities. Adele has no though of following through on marriage, and every intention of sending the devilishly irritating Reno on his drifting way.LOVE RECLAIMEDBut Reno demands that his fiercely independent bride keep their bargain. It will take more than Adele's sharp words and righteous anger to make him give up the woman whose warm heart reached deep into his soul and never let go. But instead of tasting the sweet ecstasy he knows waits in her arms, he finds himself locked in a battle of wills fueled by pride and false assumptions. And only when their loyalties are tested do they reclaim the passionate promise of love that was always theirs.",
