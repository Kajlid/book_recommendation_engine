  "description": "A special holiday novella for the USA Today Bestselling Darkness Series   With his friends matched up and kids running around, Jameson expects this holiday season to be like the last couple: uneventful, fraught with parties he’ll have to attend as the only single guy, and above all, quiet.  That is, until a strange entity is suspected to be creeping around the shifter compound. Suddenly, it looks like the humans researching shifters are back, and the only person who can keep them safe is one of Jameson’s kind.  Teamed with the new beta of Tim’s pack, a fiery shifter who has fought her way to the top, suddenly Jameson’s lifelong aversion to shifters is tested. He must face his mistrust, the enemy, and above all, the holiday mirth he’s tried so desperately to avoid.",
