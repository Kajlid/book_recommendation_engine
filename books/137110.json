  "description": "For many of us, love is the wildest adventure we will ever encounter. For most of us, love is the only significant reason. If her step-dad and mother did not decide to move to Ireland just when Elizabeth felt as if her life started to fall into place, she would not have met Jared. They would never have met at all. Then fate forced her to make a decision which led her on a different path. However, if her life did not change direction, she would never have met Joshua. My Recycled Soul was chosen as one of the top 250 entries from 5,000 entries in the Amazon Breakthrough Novel Awards 2010 (Young Adult Category)",
