  "description": "To save her sister, she must beat a goblin at his own game... Freya knows the sound of goblin bells. She knows to move to the side of the road and let them pass. Never buy any of their wares. And above all else, never make a deal with the monstrous beasts. But when her sister takes a necklace and is kidnapped, Freya knows there is no other choice. She must journey to the realm of the fae where the Goblin King himself has stolen her sister. Once there, she must perform four tasks to save the only family she has left. The Goblin King won't make this easy, however. He always seems one step ahead of her. To defeat him, she'll have to put everything on the line. Even her heart. Fan of Sarah J. Maas and Ursula K. Le Guin will be left guessing at every turn!",
