  "description": "Dear Reader, you probably know the party game \"Chinese Whispers\" but if you don't here's what happens. A group of your friends and family get together, someone starts off with a sentence, in this case \"Piglets in pyjamas danced on tiptoes round a tree\". Then they whisper to the next person who whispers what they heard to the next and so on and so onâ€¦You'll find it changes every time because people don't hear properly what's been said. Oh, and by the way, you'll be the last person to hear the message so listen very carefully while you're reading this book because without you there won't be a final page.Yours sincerely, Andrew BirtlesP.S. You may be unfamiliar with some of the words used, so brief descriptions have been included to enhance your enjoyment.",
