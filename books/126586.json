  "title": "The Many Tubs of Tom",
  "description": "In hopes of finding a simpler life, a Nobel prize winning physicist named Thomas C. Waterlee decides to get into his bathtub and never leave it. His psychiatrist, whom he calls Sally although her name is really Sandra, decides to come to his help and get him out of his tub. But, there was more trouble then Sandra expected. For 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, Sandra sits in a chair adjacent to his tub as he explains his \"Tubs\". In a three month journey, the whole world changes for a famous physicist and his psychiatrist. In a series of short stories about Tom and introductions of the chapter with conversations with Sandra, this story will teach that even when we can`t even GUESS what other people have been through, we should always know that not only YOU have a lot on your plate and you should reach out to those who don't even SEEM like they do. You don't know what kind of impact you will make.",
