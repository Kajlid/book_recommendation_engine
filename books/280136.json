  "title": "A Zoo",
  "description": "“A Zoo” is a collection of poems, including the runner-up of the Emily Stauffer prize, ostensibly about animals. But the poems are much more than that, exploring loss, love, memory, depression, and why sadness is like whale vomit. Ordered alphabetically by animal, Wolnisty takes the reader on a journey of the strange and sad. She asks us to consider the animals, how their lives are quiet and devoted to gathering fuel. Beginning with the alligator, Wolnisty explores what it means to tell the truth and reaches a place where lies and truths become blurred. And indeed, the “Zoo” must be imagined, including animals that are dead, microscopic, or soft toys. But through this imagination, the poet shows us what it means to survive. Far from sunny optimism, however, Wolnisty has this to say about surviving: “And, yet, reader, here we are.” Given trauma and cruelty, sometimes just being here is enough.",
