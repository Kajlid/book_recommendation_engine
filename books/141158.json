What she found was that her body was hiding a secret—one that changed the way she shopped, ate, and interacted with food and products for the rest of her life.Amy is a member of the newest generation of consumers—hidden consumers—people with allergies, sensitivities, or other health-related concerns that influence their buying decisions. They seek products that are not only effective but safe, clean, and aligned with their lifestyle choices. Understanding this rapidly growing and influential demographic is crucial for any brand looking to succeed in today's marketplace. Recognizing the role of health concerns in relation to purchasing power and decision making is a valuable tool for all consumers who may not realize they are part of this “hidden” community.Using her own consumer health journey as a catalyst for change, Amy began a journey of activism and advocacy for other hidden consumers that has taken her across the country to speak on behalf of anyone who must pay extra attention to what they buy. The Hidden Consumer is a comprehensive guide to identifying, understanding, and meeting the needs of this unique segment of the buying market. This book delves deep into the profiles of these health-savvy consumers, offering valuable insights into their motivations and behaviors as well as the challenges they face as they navigate the world.",
