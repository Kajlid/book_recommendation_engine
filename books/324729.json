  "description": "Who is the master and who is the slave? In Rick R. Reed's tortuously sexy short story, you might not always know. Fugue takes the brave reader into the dungeon playroom of a master and his boy. It's the kind of place where \"darkness skitters into corners, hiding in shadows where the walls disappear.\" A boy is chained to the pipes along the ceiling. Hooded, he can only experience the sensations his master delivers with his whips, fingers, tongue... But in the boy's mind, a dream state takes him places even the master could not imagine...places where the established pecking order is turned upside down. As he's being deliciously whipped, tantalized, and tortured, the boy takes a mental journey on a late-night train where his adventures are even more raw and erotic than what goes on in this very dungeon. Come along for the Fugue...and answer for yourself the question: who is the master and who is the slave? Genres: Gay / Contemporary / BDSM / Voyeurism / Exhibitionism / Public Places",
