  "title": "Ruba'Iyat of Omar Khayyam",
  "description": "This is a new selection from the Ruba'iyat of Omar Khayyam, the famed poet of Iran. It differs from other selections in that the entries here are chosen with emphasis on authenticity and translations are made with emphasis on accuracy. Furthermore, all historical, religious and mystical allusions, hard to understand, are fully annotated. The translator renders faithfully and beautifully the selections from the Ruba'iyat into English quatrains that not only reflect the sense, but also the sound and the style of the original work, noted for simplicity, spontaneity and poetic beauty.",
