  "description": "Poetry. Poetics. This book is a reprint of the popular 1993 Tsunami title by the author of DEBBIE: AN EPIC. Part manifesto, part dramatic dialogue, part epistolary prose, XEclogue jams the categories of Woman and Nature, inventing necessary fantasies of history and place. [Robertson] slams open the shutters of these poems ... This is young, fresh work, full of startling assertions ... She's a brave and eloquent composer. -- Billy Little, Boo Magazine. I want to tell you about the hegemony of my supple extensions. My pliant starlets float like symptoms. They float in the indicative case, flinging accusations, insults, blasphemies and curses. They're cerebral and illegal . . . (Ecologue Five, Phantasie . . . Four p.m.)",
