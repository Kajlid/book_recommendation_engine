  "description": "Nonie Broussard is a mediumâ€”a closet medium. After losing her job at a local T-shirt factory, Nonie has to find a way to make ends meet. Not easy in a small town like Clay Point, LA. Two opportunities come her way, however, neither of them easy for someone with her abilities. Throw that medium into a funeral home and paranormal investigations with a gaggle of misfits, all because she has to pay the rent, and watch the fireworks fly!",
