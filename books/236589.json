  "description": "Fight Back or Face Extinction!When an army of unknown invaders attack, the United States– and perhaps even the whole world– finds itself woefully unprepared. The deadliest part of the planet-wide assault is not how swift and ruthless the attackers are, but rather the fear that these people aren’t quite human. A decade later, a small group of survivors in rural Montana are fighting for their lives on behalf of humanity as a whole. This resistance, made up of military leaders, lost civilians, and whoever else managed to hide from the invading forces, might be humankind’s last holdout. They must fight back or face extinction.",
