When she's kidnapped by a fierce and intensely handsome man who needs her help, however, all of those rules seem pointless.

With his sister's life and freedom in jeopardy, Antonio isn't taking any chances. But once Rebecca and Antonio are in Cuba, they're immersed in a world of corruption, deceit, and betrayal. It's a deadly game…and there are no rules.",
