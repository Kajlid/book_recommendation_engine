  "description": "Paul Eversole spearheaded his campaign for governor with his promise to reform K-12 education or die trying. To keep his promise Governor-elect Eversole must overcome the Kentucky General Assembly, which has a reputation for amending such promises down to status quo. Lobbyists with deep pockets and related professional organizations have also expressed opposition to his reforms.If Governor Eversole is successful, his reforms will scrap the Kentucky Education Reform Act (KERA), and they will rebuild K-12 education on a solid foundation of courses known to the \"Greatest Generation\" as the Three R's. His reforms also limit instructional practices in the classroom to the ancient principles of teaching and learning.James Ed Hoskins initiates the first of many battles that the gubernatorial reforms will encounter in the legislative process. At a staff meeting, he questions his supervisor. Her summary of the information that her staff had collected from focus groups in school districts across Kentucky did not include the meritorious suggestions. She gives him a curt non-answer. He reminds her that Governor Eversole is a businessman, and he urges her to assist him in every way possible with the K-12 experience on her staff. \"With our help,\" James Ed concludes, \"we can at least give him a fighting chance to keep his promise.",
