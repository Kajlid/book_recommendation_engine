  "description": "Melding personal, familial, and colonial history, this evocative novel explores the importance of love, family, and self-discovery. A few trinkets found in a sea chest and the fragmented memories of her grandfather's tall tales are all Essie Lewis has left of her family history. After her grandfather's death, Essie returns to Bruny Island, Tasmania, and to the lighthouse where her great-great-grandfather kept watch for nearly 40 years. Beneath the lighthouse, she begins to write the stories of her ancestors. But the island is also home to Pete Shelverton, a sculptor who hunts feral cats to make his own peace with the past. As Essie writes, she finds that Pete is a part of the history she can never escape.",
