  "description": "PAST LIVES is a medical thriller which explores the nightmare of multiple personality disorder uncovered by American neurosurgeon John Macandrew in one of his patients after brain surgery. His patient’s agony and the dreadful revenge taken by her husband, who wrongly blames Macandrew for his wife’s condition, brings him across the Atlantic in search of answers. His quest takes him from the windswept ramparts of Culzean Castle in Scotland to a research laboratory at Edinburgh University and from there to a remote Benedictine monastery; from Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris to Marseilles and across the Mediterranean to Corsica and Malta. Someone knows the secret of multiple personality disorder and they’d like it to stay that way. But the sinister biblical scholar, Dom Ignatius has already found it out and plans to use the knowledge for his own selfish ends – the uncovering of an eye witness to the events of two thousand years ago. PAST LIVES was first published in the UK by Allison & Busby Ltd. in 2006. Ken McClure is the internationally bestselling author of over twenty medical thrillers such as The Lazarus Strain, The Gulf Conspiracy, White Death and Dust to Dust.
