  "description": "A ten-year commemorative edition of the first interracial rock star romance. This multi-award winning bestseller makes frequent appearances on Favorites lists and continues to stand the test of time. Callie Lawson is a small-town business owner with few plans that don’t involve a spreadsheet, a clipboard and a PowerPoint presentation. When Bryan Spencer, renegade rock star leader of the legendary band Storm Crow shows up in her store those plans are rapidly derailed. Bryan, reeling from the drug overdose death of his best friend and band mate has been exiled to the Alabama town before he succumbs to guilt and his self-destructive tendencies. LA sin and southern comfort collide in an explosive conflagration that neither is prepared for but are unable to resist. A passion this intense will not be denied, even when Bryan’s own personal Gollum steals away his newfound love. He’s prepared to do what it takes to get her back, even if it means taking on their worst the one within.",
