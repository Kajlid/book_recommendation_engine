The third time they met was the charm. The dominating seducer designed a passion play with her in mind that left her handcuffed and helpless, but if she dances to his tunes she will be Broadway bound. Whoever Cassie chooses to act as, Davis Majors vows to show her other sides of herself she never dreamed of. By the time she signs the binding contracts she knows she made a deal with the devil. But the devil may care.",
