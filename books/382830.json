Life is not perfect for Bradford, either, as he discovers new feelings for his sub Nikki. Can Tobias help his friend, manage his job teaching the other Doms, and his relationships with Noah and Phan, or will the house that he's built for himself fall down around their ears?The Deviations series Deviations Submission, Deviations Domination, Deviations Discipline and Deviations Bondage.",
