  "description": "Pearl Zhang was born in Sichuan Province in China, and grew up during the Cultural Revolution. She was raised in a typically Chinese manner, went to school, got a job and got married, and her whole life path had been mapped out, or so it seemed. She then seized the opportunity to study in the United Kingdom – and stayed. How did Pearl adjust to the Western way of life, and what did she have to do to overcome the barriers? Would she find happiness and fulfillment with her English suitor in Scotland, or would her heartache continue? She was in a new world, both foreign and exciting – albeit under the Same Moon.This book, the first of Junying Kirk’s “Journey to the West” Trilogy, will take you on a journey full of surprises and discoveries, history and culture - from the East to the West - and from the Middle Kingdom to the United Kingdom. “What a book, what a life!” Mira Kolar-Brown, Author (UK)“This is a real gem in the modern literature world and will definitely be one proudly displayed on my bookshelf if it ever becomes a paperback.” A.Tran, Reader (UK)“Let this wonderful novel fall into your hands, enter your heart, and enrich your life and after you have finished it, thank Junying for taking you to a truly unforgettable journey through time and space.” Bin Yuan, Reader (China)",
