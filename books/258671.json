  "title": "A Prophecy for Two",
  "description": "In every legend of Fairyland, the fairies have their own reasons for crossing the border… Oliver has spent his life as the crown prince, preparing to rule but in no hurry to do so, enjoying life and taverns with Tirian, his fairy-companion and best friend. But when the traditional Vision Quest calls— and a dragon appears—Oliver finds himself facing difficult questions about heroism, sacrifice… and the emotions he’s discovering he has toward Tirian. But Tirian has secrets of his own, about his purpose, his magic, his feelings for Oliver, and a prophecy that will change the fates of two kingdoms forever.",
