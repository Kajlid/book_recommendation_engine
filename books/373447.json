She’s settled into her small camp in the Valley of Hoof and Horn, she’s earned the trust (and perhaps more) of the Cerosan lord who rules it, she’s been adopted by the mystical Morathi of kraal-Rucombe, and best of all, she’s made friends with the lonely magus who lives by the lake nearby…but her new friend is not what he seems. The mysterious man who has such an eerie, unshakeable grip on her thoughts is no man at all, but a merciless and ancient evil that hungers for her mind and lusts for her flesh. THE WIZARD IN THE WOODS is the second exciting chapter of R. Lee Smith’s ground-breaking erotic series, Lords of Arcadia. Enter a dark world of fantasy and desire in a compelling story of good and evil as told by a master erotic storyteller.And look for Lords of Arcadia: Book IIITHE ROADS OF TARYN MACTAVISH",
