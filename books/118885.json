  "description": "Sixty-seven-year-old Walter Kendal isn't your typical homeless man. He wears London Fog and is accompanied by a pet homing pigeon named Jackie. After fleeing devastating personal events, Walter is accused of a crime he did not commit. Now a fugitive on the run, Walter sleeps under the stars at night but during the day enters a young widow's home for shelter while she is at work and changes not only her life but every life he touches. Multiple characters with shattered lives come together and find hope through faith and redemption. Walter is a suspenseful, meaningful Christian novel built around a dynamic person. Walter will become more than a fictional character; he will become a dear friend.",
