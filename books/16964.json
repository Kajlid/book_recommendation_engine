  "description": "An original collection of the most influential documents in American history, from the bestselling author of A Patriot's History of the United States .Since 2005, A Patriot's History of the United States has become a modern classic for its defense of America as a unique country founded on principles of justice, equality, and freedom for all.The Patriot's History Reader continues this tradition by going back to the original sources-the documents, speeches, and legal decisions that shaped our country into what it is today.The authors explore both oft-cited documents-the Declaration of Independence, Emancipation Proclamation, and Roe v. Wade --as well as those that are less famous. Among these are George Washington's letter to Alexander Hamilton, which essentially outline America's military strategy for the next 150 years, and Herbert Hoover's speech on business ethics, which examines the government's role in regulating private enterprise.By helping readers explore history at its source, this book sheds new light on the principles and personalities that have made America great.",
