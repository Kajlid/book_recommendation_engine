  "description": "A new girl at school. A secret society. A gray zone between human and beast. When 16-year-old Bianca arrives at her new boarding school, she is startled to hear that its history includes rumors of witchcraft and torture. The building itself rests on the foundation of a medieval convent with a troubled past. There is also a secret society, whose members begin to harass her. Then one night she stumbles over the body of a dead woman. With the help of her friend Nicholas, Bianca begins to piece together the story of the mysterious woman and the convent's disturbing history. But Bianca can't shake the feeling she is being followed. She soon realizes she can't trust anyone -- not even Nicholas. Using elements of the thriller and gothic novel, as well as hints of fantastic and historical fiction, Nina Blazon brings something new to the crime genre. Set in the present but summoning the dark and disturbing atmosphere of medieval times, the book's crisp language, unexpected plot twists and cast of untrustworthy players result in a spellbinding, unforgettable reading adventure.",
