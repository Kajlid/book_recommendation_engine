  "description": "Many Kings and Queens of England suffered extraordinary deaths. Handsome and virile in his youth, a rare medical condition turned Henry VIII into a bloated and grotesque old man. The Dashing and glamourous Henry V probably died of cancer of the rectum, a fate that also befell Edward I. Charles I was beheaded. Henry VI was the victim of a grisly murder. Edward II, attacked with a red hot poker died in agony from traumatic perforation of the rectum. George II died in ignominy enthroned on the lavatory.This book will enthrall and appall.Distinguished surgeon Clifford Brewer T.D F.R.C.S. has made the death of kings the study of a life time, examining every act of violence and each unpleasant disease with a razor sharp eye for detail.",
