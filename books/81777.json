  "description": "Ever since her mother’s death, Victoria feels numb. She used to dread the empty feelings, but now she depends on them -- being invisible is better than having to answer the questions, better than having to deal with the pain. She’s so numb that she doesn’t even care that her relationship with her father is now nonexistent, or that she only has one real friend left in the world. She has a system, one that works, and one that keeps her emotionally shut off. But the appearance of Nathan Daley threatens to ruin Victoria’s carefully constructed world.Nathan is arrogant, and a know-it-all, and so smart it makes Victoria sick. Not to mention he’s absolutely beautiful. But the worst part? He’s her new stepbrother. A stepbrother she doesn’t want, who came with a stepmother she doesn’t want. But before Victoria realizes it, she’s playing a dangerous game with Nathan. One that’s sexy, addicting, and forbidden -- but most of all, one that makes her feel alive again. Can Victoria come out of Nathan’s game a better person? Or will it destroy her once and for all? Find out in Against All Odds by Kels Barnholdt. **Against All Odds is for a mature YA audience due to sexual language and situations.**",
