  "description": "Comedy / 4m, 2f / Int. Paul and Corie Bratter are newlyweds in every sense of the word. He's a straight-as-an-arrow lawyer and she's a free spirit always looking for the latest kick. Their new apartment is her most recent find-too expensive with bad plumbing and in need of a paint job. After a six day honeymoon, they get a surprise visit from Corie's loopy mother and decide to play matchmaker during a dinner with their neighbor-in-the-attic Velasco, where everything that can go wrong, does. Paul just doesn't understand Corie, as she sees it. He's too staid, too boring and she just wants him to be a little more spontaneous, running \"barefoot in the park\" would be a start... \"A bubbling, rib-tickling comedy.\" - The New York Times \"Critic weeps joyfully...I don't think anybody stopped laughing while the curtain was up last evening.\" - New York Daily News",
