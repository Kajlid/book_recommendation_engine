He just wanted to be like the people whose lives he followed in gossip magazines...Instead he found a world more seedy than anything he could have imagined, a world of whores and deceit, snuff shows, incest, drugs-and despair. After his wife, Karen, a hooker, is murdered and disemboweled, he meets Bella, a beautiful woman of immense wealth. In her he sees a chance to make his dreams come true. As it turn out, though, his nightmare is only beginning. ..\".An elaborately drawn, surgically accurate Hollywood dystopia...\"-Ellen Miller. \"Stokoe proves himself a worthy heir to the great tradition of California noir\"-Henry Flesh.",
