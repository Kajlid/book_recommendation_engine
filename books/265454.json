  "description": "Once upon a time there was a very good girl, who followed all the rules. That girl is dead. I am no longer Wren Frame, the bird with the broken wing. I am Wren Wander, a rare shapeshifter determined to take back everything the cult stole from me-my health, my hope, and most importantly, my family. My sister is still out there somewhere. Alive. And with the help of the four brave, formidable, sexy-as-hell alphas destined to be my mates, I intend to keep her that way. All I have to do is gain control of my unpredictable new powers, learn hand-to-hand combat, avoid capture by a mad scientist out to rid the world of shifters, and stay ten steps ahead of a Big Bad Evil hungry for my blood. And that's not the worst of it. In order to fully control my powers, I have to form bonds with all four of my mates. But for a woman who's been betrayed by every person she's ever loved, trust doesn't come easy, no matter how much I'm coming to adore, and desire, these men. Can I win this battle of the heart in time? Or will our enemies end our fight for the future before it gets started? UNTAMED is part two of the Dark Moon Shifters series, a red-hot reverse harem paranormal and urban fantasy romance. Expect pulse-pounding action, suspense, swoon-worthy romance, and four sexy shifter men who will make you wish you had a bear, wolf, lynx, and griffin of your own.",
