  "description": "BeccaMy life was filled with colors, patterns, and beautiful soul-stirring songs.Then he barged into my life and swept me along with him.Don’t ask me.Yes, I resisted him right from the beginning.But truthfully, I’m not that immune to him.Besides, who doesn’t want a perfect life?That’s why I’m on the verge of saying yes to his proposal, which I know he’s about to make soon.And he did.Shockingly, he hasn’t knelt in front of me on one knee with a breathtaking, picturesque background, but with the heart-stopping truth staring me in the eye.Now I could no longer see the burst of colors, only thick clouds hovering above me, the gray scales coupled with haunting music.But, God, help me!I cannot say no to this world-class renowned photographer. And I also cannot stop him from chasing what he’s been chasing his entire career.I just wish that there is no Aiden Silver in the first place.Am I stupid to say that?No. You will wish the same once you know my story with the husband-to-be.Oh, only he doesn’t know that I bleed the same way as he does.",
