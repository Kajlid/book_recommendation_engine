  "description": "The very happy conclusion to the Goddess of Ivy trilogy:Serena’s ex-boyfriend Sam asked her to become a very exclusive call-girl to help him pay his way through an Ivy League degree and she decided to do it because she had nothing better to do, she needed the sex, and she wanted the money. After three years with six rich, steady customers, she’s already earned a small fortune despite serious complications from her evolving relationship with Sam. Now the end of the grand plan is within sight, bringing with it the greatest complications yet.At the beginning of Sam’s senior year, he begs Serena for forgiveness, but despite loving him, she can’t forgive him. Her firm rejection pushes him past his breaking point, and he severs all contact with her, and soon after, she learns he’s disappeared completely.Serena and Sam have struggled to survive painful failures, both together and apart, and one thing Serena’s learned as a result is that she’s not cut out to live alone. She must choose a husband from among her customers, take a chance on finding someone new, somehow and someday, or risk her heart on Sam again… if she can find him.",
