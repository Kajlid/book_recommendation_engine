  "description": "Once in a Blue Moon, fame and fortune actually take a backseat to friendship and love.Jeanne Madison has earned her PhD at 26 and secured funding to find and excavate a treasure-laden 18th century caravel off the Yucatan coast. Between her mentor and a handful of graduate students, years of study, and all the government cooperation a marine archaeologist could want, she'll find the \"Luna Azul\"--or Blue Moon--by hook or by crook. When a tight budget forces her to hire Captain Gabriel Avery and his rust-bucket, \"Fallen Angel,\" the comely PhD's not sure it won't be the latter. The incorrigible skipper has the swarthy good looks of a Hollywood pirate and pushes every last one of Jeanne's buttons--even some she didn't know she had. His history of brawls, bullion, and well, romantic escapades may well sink the whole expedition. As the race for the \"Luna Azul\" treasure with an unscrupulous competitor gets heated, more than the fajitas start to sizzle. Soon Jeanne, the captain, and her crew must take a gigantic leap of faith, one that may salvage more than gold--perhaps even a hardened heart.",
