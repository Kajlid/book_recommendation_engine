  "description": "Imagine a doctor who sleeps with his cat on the window sill - or a handyman who has no van and walks everywhere with his tools attached to his bicycle! These are just two of the many eccentric characters who feature in this hilarious, sarcastic and sometimes irreverent story of a boy growing up in Dublin in the 1950s. But it's not all fun and games. There are abundant footnotes about places mentioned in the story, together with other snippets, from mathematics to music, that the author wishes to share with you.",
