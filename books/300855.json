  "description": "Those in the US who get turned on by watching a predator eat a person outnumber the entire population of Massachusetts, a random American is about as likely to be turned on by parent-child roleplay as they are to be Black, and more Americans are turned on by feces than have a PhD. What the heck is going on here? Why do strange, often-inconvenient things activate a system that presumably evolved to compel humans to reproduce? Why do some things arouse some while repulsing others?Have you • Been aroused by something . . . unexpected?• Stumbled upon bizarre porn and wondered how it could possibly turn people on?• Wondered why something that turns on many of your friends is super gross to you?Have we got a book for you! The Pragmatist’s Guide to Sexuality takes a deep dive into research surrounding human sexuality while also presenting one of the most comprehensive studies into what arouses people, using this data to explore everything from the social structures of early hominids to the future of dating.As with all Pragmatist Foundation books, the proceeds generated from the sale of this work go to nonprofits.",
