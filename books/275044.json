  "title": "Love, Bourbon Street: Reflection of New Orleans",
  "description": "The people of New Orleans have always enjoyed a love affair with their city, and only when they came close to totally losing it—in the wake of Hurricane Katrina—did they truly give voice to their love.Now, two noted editors have called upon their friends from the Big Easy’s literary establishment to pen this remarkable book—a “love letter” that takes us into this crazy and wonderful patchwork quilt of a city. With contributions from Poppy Z. Brite, JM Redmann, Victoria Brownworth, and many others, this is a book not just to be read, but to be treasured.",
