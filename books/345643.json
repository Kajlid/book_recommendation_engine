  "title": "Dancing With The Devil",
  "description": "This gritty, guilty pleasure read is destined to become a cult classic. Five interconnected tales introducing the character known by one nefarious name - Danté - and delving into his numerous dances with his own dark side - obsession, addiction, lust, all those human motivations that make us do unexpected things with no regrets. EDITORIAL Dancing With The Devil is a work of dark brilliance - an emotional experience that can leave the reader with the hollow emptiness that follows intense passion and explosive lust for a lover who will take you to ecstatic heights, then destroy you. It is that kind of writing - a journey into the lower depths of the soul with the path illuminated by flashes of hot lightning. And when it is all over, the emptiness slowly fills with the awareness of having survived and of having experienced the brutal edge of life at its most dangerous and most exhilarating. One thing can be guaranteed; you will not forget having read this book. It will excite you, haunt you and finally, it will cast you aside and leave you wanting more. ~ Toby Grace, Editor, Out IN Jersey magazine",
