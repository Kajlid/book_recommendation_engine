  "description": "Alt cover for ISBN 1481923064/9781481923064Set against the backdrop of a city under quarantine, Gospel for the Damned is an episodic and introspective novel that follows young journalist Aaron Garrett on his three day assignment within sequestered San Francisco. His assignment: Interview The Elliots, family of the missing minister suspected of releasing the deadly Omega virus.What he finds is a fractured community and a myriad of ways of facing hopelessness: clinging to normalcy in banal routines; thrill seeking in dangerous truth-or-dare games; mercy killing and federally sanctioned euthanasia; embracing sorrow through macabre celebrations; and searching for God where faith has been abandoned.Together with The Elliot Family, Aaron embarks on a mission to save someone, anyone, from a doomed existence.This is Gordon Gravleyâ€™s first literary work, and its philosophical leanings may very well provoke questions of your own about the world we live in, and the future we face.",
