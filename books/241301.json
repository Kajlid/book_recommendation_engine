  "title": "Re-Humanize",
  "description": "Re-Humanize is a movement offering heart-softening remembrance of what it means to be human, built upon liberating expectations of connection and love. With healing words born from the depths of the author’s pain, this vulnerable narrative offers a window into sexual assault and the messy path of survival.With poems that began forming just hours after being raped, Marlee shares her journey alongside facilitated discussion questions that inspire personal and collective healing. Throughout her process, the writing expands to touch on various connecting issues, which speak to objectification and general feelings of “not enough-ness”.Re-Humanize will take all readers on a journey, gently challenging individuals to deconstruct sources of suffering, combat shame, and challenge silence around painful life experience. Each page serves as a reminder that your resilience alone makes you a warrior, that together we can find healing in solidarity, and that all beings are worthy of transformative reclamation.",
