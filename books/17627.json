  "description": "Former military intelligence operative, James \"Beck\" Becker and his CIA code-cracking wife, Beth, have retired to Beck's hometown of Red Wing, Minnesota. Their retirement has already proven more exhilarating than they'd expected. But they could never have anticipated the new source of crime and intrigue in their small community. A Mexican drug cartel has set up shop a few miles down the road. And they're not just selling. The new meth production facility is the largest north of the Rio Grande. To complicate matters further, Terry \"Bull\" Red Feather's former comrade-in-arms has come to visit. And he's on a mission. His decades-long assault on the cartels is coming to a head. His plan is to blow up the drug plant . . . if he can find it. He wants Bull to help. The Beckers' challenge? To dismantle cartel operations before a full-blown drug war breaks out in Red Wing. THE COVERT ELEMENT has the characters you love, battling the cartels you'll learn to despise.",
