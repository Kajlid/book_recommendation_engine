  "description": "This is Xarissa Silverstone writing to you. Hanlowa and I have decided that I should be the one to write the summaries on the back of the books from now on. We had a nasty incident with the publishers involving shadow beasts and pie. That is a story for another day. The story you are about to read is where I get put into a coma by a demonic poison. Now my mind is trapped in the Dream Sphere, and even if I wake up, my dream powers will change forever. Meanwhile in Centerville we have Wiccans running for office, people playing with Ouija boards, a visit from the Angel of Death, and the true story of Genesis is told. On top of everything else Hanlowa has a question for me. If she actually gets around to asking it, the answer I give could change not only Centerville, but the entire world as well.",
