  "description": "\"Everyone - be they male or female - dreams of being so fortunate as having the chance to pleasure ME. And once they have, they shall never experience pleasure such as that with another.\"When her beautiful imported French mother could not cope with life in the harem, Zahrah-- the stunning daughter of the most affluent sultan in Morocco-- grows up cynical, vehemently refusing to follow in her footsteps. Nonetheless, Zahrah is nothing like her weak mother. In fact, she has every intention of doing whatever it takes to escape the palace altogether. She will take charge of her destiny. And it will not be to surrender herself to the will of a man. And yet, for the time being, while she is there, Zahrah manages to have anyone she wants wrapped around her finger-- men and women alike. Her thirst for carnal pleasure and manipulation seems to know no bounds. After all, what sultan in their right mind would want a ruined female as an addition to their harem? She hopes her plan will spare her, at least from being traded away to another harem. But then, an enigmatic fair haired stranger with icy eyes visits her father's palace from a faraway land. Zahrah thinks she has surely found the method of escape she has so desperately sought. Still, she just may have met her match. Especially when he informs her that the only way out is to trade her soul into a world of darkness.",
