You deserve to read it.\" --Dr. Phil McGraw, host of CBS's nationally syndicated show \"Dr. Phil\"Joani Gammill, an average suburban mom on the outside, was secretly addicted to multiple forms of opiates and amphetamine for years, and almost died as a result. Through the life-changing intervention staged by Dr. Phil on his show, Gammill not only committed to getting help for her addiction, but she also went on to become a professional interventionist, helping thousands of others in distress.In The Interventionist , she intertwines her experiences with depictions of her often harrowing and always inspiring interventions of the addicts and families she's worked with over the years.
