Surrounded by fresh salt air and the ocean waves lapping in the background, she now mixes drinks better than any other bartender at the Grand Escape. It’s the perfect situation for a commitment-phobic woman, who wants to be nothing like the family she was born into. Each week, guests check in, spend time at her bar, and then go home. Until the day some heartsick jerk who checked in under just his initial and last name sits down at her bar.With sad eyes and a gritty voice, A. Stern is more than Rylan bargained for, so it’s a good thing she no longer gets tangled up with men. But this lawyer by day, alpha by night, keeps pushing his way through the barricade she’s built around her heart. Thinking she knows why he’s heartbroken, she’s determined not to be his next victim, but he continues to shatter all her misconceptions. With only a week until his vacation ends, can she avoid falling for the guy at the end of her bar? And can he manage to capture the heart of the only woman who has made him want to try again?",
