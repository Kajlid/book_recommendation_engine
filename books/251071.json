  "description": "Have you ever really wanted to be a super hero? Dave Lizewski has - and he's not willing to let it stop with simple daydreams. Designing a suit for himself and taking the name \"Kick-Ass,\" Dave decides to make his dreary existence more exciting - and maybe even help some people in the process. But with no special powers and outmatched by New York City's most hardened criminals, Kick-Ass might be in for a little more than he bargained for. With his super-hero secret identity gaining fans due to a popular viral video, and other masked vigilantes beginning to make their presence felt in the city, Dave knows that his extracurricular activity is dangerous, maybe even stupid - but he's got the itch, and it ain't going away.COLLECTING: Kick-Ass 1-8",
