  "description": "Ginny figured being a 21st century woman, stuck in the past, playing other people's lives would be fun. It turns out, it's just work. Her new persona, Bethany, is a society daughter whose only purpose is to make an excellent marriage, while playing by a long list of rules. When her parents bring her to a house party so she can meet eligible bachelors, Bethany has her hands full. Will she choose the staunch earl, who has no wish to marry yet? Or will it be the future duke who has a reputation with the ladies? Or the kind, country doctor instead? Even Ginny can't figure out who she is supposed to \"fall in love with.\" All she knows is that she needs to marry someone if she ever hopes to return to own body, in her own time.",
