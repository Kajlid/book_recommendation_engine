  "description": "Eighteen-year-old Jordi Hemphill had a dream. It was much bigger than she was ever encouraged to have because it was much bigger than those around her thought she deserved. These perceived limitations were all directly tied to her double-digit figure. When she finally realizes she has reached a dead end in her small Iowa hometown, Jordi makes a break for the bright lights of Hollywood. And that's where the fun begins. Her audition tape fortuitously lands in front of media mogul Graham Baxter. Jordi is cast on a new reality show called \"Fierce.\" As a show billed to find talent outside of the picture-perfect pop idol machine, Jordi joins a cast of irregulars and nonconformists to vie for her opportunity to win over America and become the newest singing sensation.It is the first of many instances where Jordi gets exactly what she thinks she wants, only to find it was nothing at all like she could have ever expected. Instead she finds herself on a two year saga to make all her big dreams a reality, fighting unexpected antagonists all along the way. Her true antagonist, however, is herself. The only thing bigger than Jordi's dream is her sneaking suspicion that everyone else is right... that she doesn't deserve to be happy, to be successful... to be loved. It takes a cast of colorful characters to show Jordi that ultimately the only key to success is self-acceptance, whoever you are, whatever you have and whomever you love.\nFierce: The Complete Trilogy\n is a spin-off of the best-selling Groupie trilogy by Ginger Voight. Many characters come back to help Jordi tell her story against the backdrop of fame, celebrity and a life that dares to be bigger than anyone could ever dream.",
