Definitely.Neither of us liked to lose.But the intense chemistry?That’s new.The hatred in his eyes?That’s new, too.I should let it go.There’s too much bad blood between our families. Between us.But I can’t.I don’t think he can, either.Now we’re gunning for the same internship.If he thinks I’ll back down, he’s dead wrong.Once upon a time, I lost everything.I won’t let it happen again.Go ahead. Try me.From the author of Want Me comes the second new adult college romance in the Extracurricular Activities series.
