For an occupied city throws together loyalist and patriot, soldier and civilian, man and woman; divides families and breeds treachery. Here ruthless Captain Kit Vane and beautiful Martha Crowl, passionate patriot Caroline and her idealist young lover Jonathon, unscrupulous Ezra Woollard and the brutal Sergeant Scammell, forge and break shifting allegiances that drive them to dangerous lengths. And caught between them Private Sam Gilpin, seduced into war by a dare and a red coat, must learn the bitter lessons of love, loss and the real meaning of loyalty.",
