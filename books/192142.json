  "title": "Becoming a Medical Mom",
  "description": "A “Medical Mom” is a mother of a child with medical difficulties. Typically these mothers have been through one or more hospital admissions. Their child may or may not have a diagnosis. At first they’re frazzled and unsure, but over time they become staunch advocators for their children and their medical needs. My goal is to reach the frazzled and unsure beginners and expedite their development into the advocates their children need them to be. Everyone has to start somewhere. The journey to becoming a fully-fledged medical mama is no exception. Whether you have some medical knowledge already, or don’t have a clue what any of the words the doctor is using mean, you’re in the right place. I’m going to make sure you know the basics. By the time you’re through, you’ll know how to survive admission, whether it’s a day or a month. You can do this. I know it’s overwhelming. The things the doctors say may not even be making sense right now. If you’ve already received a diagnosis, your head is still spinning trying to figure out what that means for you and your child. If you haven’t, but your child is obviously struggling and no one knows why, you’re not alone. There is a ton of women out there, just like you, which have no idea what’s wrong with their child. If you’re a medical dad, let me apologize in advance. Most of the medical parents I know are mothers. Many fathers help, but the mothers frequently provide the majority of medical care to the child. If you are your child’s primary medical caregiver, you’re just as awesome as us moms! Please don’t feel intimidated by the fact I refer to mothers throughout the text. It applies to dads too.",
