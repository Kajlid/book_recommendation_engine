  "description": "A new Christmas classic based on Raymond Briggs’s holiday favorite The Snowman. In this holiday picture book, a companion to Raymond Briggs’s The Snowman, a little boy builds a snow puppy next to his snowman—in hopes of getting a real puppy for Christmas. That night the Snowman comes to life and takes the boy and the Snowdog on an adventure to the world of Snow People. But the best is yet to come on Christmas morning, when a real, live puppy is waiting under the tree. Based on the original classic by Raymond Briggs, which has sold over 8.5 million copies and is available in fifteen languages, the story and illustrations are by the creators of the animated special by the same name.",
