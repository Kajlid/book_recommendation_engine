  "description": "Love hurts and not always in a good way! For two years Rhys has had a casual D/s relationship with Draven. It was never supposed to be anything more than an arrangement; a way for Rhys to occasionally indulge his submissive side. Draven made it very clear at the outset that he was not looking for forever, and Rhys was happy to accept this. But somewhere along the line he fell in love. Now he is forced to keep his real feelings for Draven a secret. Will the truth drive Draven away? Reader Advisory: This story was released as part of the Bound Brits Anthology by Total-E-Bound\"",
