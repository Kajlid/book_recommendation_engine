  "description": "Continuing her story from the wildly popular award-winning Overlay: A Tale Of One Girl's Life In 1970s Las Vegas, Marlayna details her remarkable journey in City of Angeles, revealing the underside of a life lived in 1980s Los Angeles.This searing, often bizarre tale of Marlayna's teens and twenties reveals the author's flight from glitzy Las Vegas to the formidable world of self re-invention among the angels and demons populating 1980s Los Angeles. The author unflinchingly begets a self from the unlikeliest beginnings, and now delivers a sequel illustrating both heaven and hell on her continuing flight for self discovery.\"An amazing story of a young girl who comes of age with only snippets of guidance from the adults around her. This is a well written book with explicit prose of Marlayna's continued journey looking for love and acceptance. She tells this very personal story vividly. There were moments I had to stop reading to absorb the \"life shattering\" events Marlayna experienced that would have crushed many and other moments in the book that I laughed out loud.\" - Eileen Cahill Moalli",
