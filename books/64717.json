But like it or not, in a town like Valentine, love happens . . .Adam Desantis is back—bruised, battle-weary and sexier than ever! Not that Brooke Thalberg is in the market.

But from the moment she finds herself in Adam's arms, she's shocked to discover she may just want more.Adam knows it's crazy to tangle with Brooke, especially with the memories that still haunt him, and the warm welcome her family has given him. But he finds himself in a fix, because tender-loving Brooke is so much more woman than he ever imagined. Can a soldier battling demons give her the love she clearly deserves?Just about everybody in Valentine thinks so!",
