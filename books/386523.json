  "description": "A river cruise through ancient desert lands will be an adventure in itself, think Philip, Dinah, Lucy-Ann, and Jack. An adventure it certainly is, especially when Bill disappears and the children, along with Kiki the parrot, are trapped beneath a forgotten temple where no one has set foot for 7,000 years.",
