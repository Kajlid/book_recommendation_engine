  "description": "A collection of four related stories, centered on the largest of human the liver. In a dusty London drinking club and an efficient euthanasia clinic, a glossy ad agency and a junky's windowless flat, Self's characters are slowly losing their liversâ€•to cirrhosis, to cancer, to a hungry griffon vulture. Through the organic woes of these afflicted individuals, Self considers appetites and addictions, disease and decay, in a way that is at once demented, funny, and moving.",
