  "description": "(Note: This book is not the sequel to Jungle. It is not Young Adult and may be best suited for readers over 18.)Sheltered and over-protected her whole life, Rhees has always been the type who can be in a crowded room and still feel lonely. After losing both parents within a short time, she really is all alone in the world—time to grow up! The fastest way to do that? Face her worst fears, the ocean topping the list. Paul has traveled the world, running from his past, a past he’s not proud of and refuses to talk about. When he reaches the small, Caribbean island on the dive bum circuit, he’s found home. He buys one of the local dive shops and finds solace running a top-notch scuba operation, diving by day and by night, allowing the never-ending supply of hovering women to seduce him. Rhees isn’t Paul’s type, so why does she drive him so crazy, pressing his already foul temper to its limits? She’s the biggest baby he’s ever known, scared of her own shadow, and no one can really be that good at heart. He has too much fun goading her to drop the act and stop trying to make everyone believe she’s a saint, but each time he breaks down a piece of that reserved facade of hers, he’s amazed at how tough she really is. Paul never expected Rhees to break him down as well.",
