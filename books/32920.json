  "title": "The Gospel According to Maggie",
  "description": "There’s no such thing as miracles. Maggie’s mother taught her that. But now it’s 1985 and her mother’s gone, and Maggie just wants to get through high school with her head down, hiding behind her journal, focused on her dream of becoming a writer. That is, until Christian gives her a reason to look up. Christian is a strange boy who spends hours atop a water tower and knows uncanny details about the people around them. He also has a miraculous gift for connecting with others... something that scares Maggie to her core. Almost as much as her fear of heights. And of Dani, the school bully. When Christian’s knack for helping people lands him in the hospital, Maggie has a decision to make. Will she give in to Dani’s temptation and turn on her new friends? Or can she find the strength to write a new chapter in her own story - one in which friendship and love conquers all?",
