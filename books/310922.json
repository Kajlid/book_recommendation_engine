  "description": "Thinking of self-publishing? Struggling to get sales? Everything you need to know is here. Save time and money. Get more sales. Earn a profit. From award winning, bestselling author T N Traynor, comes a no-frills reference guide, to help turn you from a writer into an authorpreneur! Want to self-publish professionally for as little cost as possible? Then this is the book for you. Whether you’ve written for fun or profit, in this how-to manual you will discover the cheapest way to publish your book. Inside these pages are guidelines on publishing your book, and how much it should cost you. There are lots of 'how to' pages ranging from putting your book on Amazon, advertising and promoting and how to get those all-important reviews. Plus a chapter on getting your book on Audible. At the end of chapters are blank pages for you to reflect, make notes but most importantly for you to record your dreams and ambitions. Ebooks are great, but Don’t Go For Broke would be best utilized in a paperback version so you can write your notes in it, bend page corners, insert book marks and generally use it as a reference guide that you can dip into every now and again when you move on to the next stage of your journey.",
