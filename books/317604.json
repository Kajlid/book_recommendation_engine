  "description": "Kyle Hyam has been doing his best to get by, trying to support his brother and mother, after his father had a horrific accident that left him in a wheelchair. But his father’s accident had changed him from a loving wolf-shifting provider into a paranoid and angry man and Kyle wore the bruises – often. Being saved, in the middle of an attack, by a huge man with a bald head, and a star tattoo under his left eye had never been part of Kyle’s fantasies, but he could see the appeal.Sean, one of only four assassins, never expected to find his mate when he followed up on a message from Cam about helping the new owner of the local construction company. He didn’t expect to save his sweet mate from his own father either. Taking his mate back to the Alpha’s mansion, Sean knew it was important to give Kyle time to trust him. He wasn’t taking jobs anymore, so they’d have plenty of time.Or not. The council still weren’t happy all four assassins were in the same territory but their move, when it came, threatened Sean’s mated life before it had even started. Will Sean and Kyle get their HEA, or will Kyle be forced to go back to living with his father?The trigger warnings for this book can be found in the “Author’s Note” that you can see by using the “Look Inside” function before purchase.
