  "description": "King Williams has seen the other side of hell, his tortured solitude hiding pain behind the cut of his marble jaw. Stubborn fortitude has gotten him this far, but one night with Piper at a club party is all it takes to unravel the walls he's built. Now he can't get her out of his head. His obsessive need rages before he pulls her in so deep both of their lives land on the line. The only thing that matters might be the only thing he can't protect. When Piper Parish spots King, high-ranking member of the Sinister Knights MC, nearly naked late one night, it isn't the first time heâ€™s caught her eye. It is, however, the first time she's set eyes on the cobblestoned abs and chiseled lines etched into this bad boy's body. Like a flash of lightning in the darkness, Piper finds herself thrown into a whirlwind ride with the brooding biker...a ride he will never let her forget. Warning: King is one broody, moody Harley ridin' bad boy. Heathcliff meets Gray, he's Piper's idea of devilishly dark, dangerous, and so off-limits. Until now. He'll stop at nothing to make her his, but is she ready to buckle in for the ride of a lifetime?",
