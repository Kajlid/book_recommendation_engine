  "description": "Twenty-two, and I haven't felt more than a spark of magic. Which is more than a little awkward considering I'm leaving for The Academy of Magic in forty-eight hours. I'm a monster, or at least my fathers reassure me that I am. Though I'm not very monster-like if you believe the stereotypes. I spend most of my days curled up in my room with my nose buried in a good book. Despite preferring to hide away, my best friend Lexi is constantly encouraging me to step out of my comfort zone, but I'm okay the way I am. My life is going decently—if I do say so myself—until I step into my headmaster's office and into a whirlwind of trouble. Not to mention the sweet troll who is insistent on being my friend, my mountain man of a runes partner and my shy new tutor, who have me questioning whether my lady bits are on the fritz. When my past and present collide, I can't help but wonder if I'm going to make it through the term, let alone the next two years. I guess I'll just have to roll with the crazy or go insane. Either way, at least I'll have some eye candy along for the ride. Monster Girl is the first book in a new series and is set in the shared Supernatural Realm that Willow and her men are part of. This book is a slow burn; why choose romance (which means the MFC will not have to choose between her love interests at the end of the book). Though there may be some bumps in the road, this series will end in a HEA (Happy Ever After). Sexual themes are suitable for +18.",
