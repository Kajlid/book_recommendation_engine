Zoe Lake has been through everything: Chatty ghosts, murderous sphinxes, crazy covens – and even a broken heart. Somehow, though, she’s survived. Senior year is finally here, and Zoe is ready to move forward. She and her werewolf boyfriend Aric are back on solid ground, and Zoe is ready to finish what she started – both academically and personally. The Academy is still in operation, but their leadership is listless and Zoe is steering clear. She has new roommates, and new drama, but all Zoe is focused on is getting out of Covenant College alive. When a human tableau of bodies appears on campus, and Zoe becomes a suspect, things shift. Again. Aric is working hard to keep her safe, and roommates Kelsey and Paris are (as always) along for the ride. All the usual suspects are in play … but the stakes are higher than ever. When the final showdown comes, everyone has to pick a side. The ultimate battle for Covenant College is about to begin – and neither army is looking to take prisoners. When the end comes, who will be left standing?  This is the fifth and final book in the Covenant College young adult series.",
