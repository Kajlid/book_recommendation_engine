  "title": "The List of Dead Smiths",
  "description": "The Uber-Rich Smiths of Port Royal are dropping like flies, and in the most bizarre fashion. When Cousin Sheldon suffers death by heavy-set Asian hookers, and Cousin Lura Lee falls prey to death by pterodactyl, Sydney Smith gets the feeling she might be next on the list. She hires private investigator Tate Pendergast to solve the mystery. Tate believes the Seven Deadly Sins are somehow tied to the Smith deaths, if only he could find the elusive Pedro (a dead-ringer for the Mexican actor Cantinflas). Pedro, a man of mystery, seems to be nearby each time a Smith dies, but finding Pedro is harder than finding an honest politician. Could Ernie be involved in the killings or was he just in the wrong place at the wrong time? Can Tate solve the riddle and save Sydney’s life, or is he just driving Sydney’s Aston Martin around Naples, Florida, waiting for the last shoe (or the last Smith) to drop?  Product Details",
