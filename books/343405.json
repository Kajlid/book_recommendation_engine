  "title": "Response",
  "description": "Response is a gathering of five works which together bring into play some of the very elements which allow us to utilize poetry's powers - open-endedness (option) and specificity, mindfulness and provocation, intelligence and an invitation to invention. It is possible to read the 'response' of the title in reference to the poems and to take them as answers to calls and queries from the world. But it is equally and simultaneously possible to regard the works as themselves incitements to response. Reading these edgy, beautiful, and smart works is not passive nor summary but 'in answer,' and that, in turn, means that one reads them 'in excitement.'",
