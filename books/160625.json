The problem is that one fan is having some serious trouble with respecting boundaries – and has crossed over the line in to stalker territory. When his obscene and frightening texts escalate and he ends up standing in her living room, Olivia turns to Dallas for protection.  Dallas Foreman is a large, muscular, tattooed ex-sniper who now runs his own bodyguard service. Olivia asks for his help and he doesn’t hesitate for even an instant; he has had a thing for her for years, after all. Although he’d love to take her to his bed and make love to her until she forgets her fear, his priority is to keep her safe. So Dallas resolves to keep his hands off Olivia… at least until the stalker is caught.  When Dallas starts to suspect that the person threatening Olivia is far closer to her than anyone originally thought, he races against time to figure out who among her trusted circle wishes her harm. But when the stalker hurts the woman that he loves, will Dallas be able to save her without losing the most human part of himself? And if she comes out of this alive, will Olivia be able to trust in anyone ever again – including Dallas?",
