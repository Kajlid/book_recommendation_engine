  "description": "Nineteen-year-old MaryJane Thomson seemed to have it all. Intelligent, creative, and beautiful, she was destined for a bright future. But a nightmare of delusions and hallucinations was unfolding. She dropped out of university, turned to drugs, and spent years in and out of psych wards, police cells, drug hangouts, and on the streets. In this heartbreaking but ultimately hopeful memoir, she shares her struggles with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and vividly describes what it is like to hear voices, lose one's freedom, and despair over ever being well again.",
