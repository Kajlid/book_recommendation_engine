  "description": "Max the firm and fit muscle-god doesn't fit Randy's mental picture of an antiques dealer. In fact, he's so smoking-hot, Randy can hardly breathe as Max appraises his shoebox full of vintage toys. The huge amount of money Max offers takes his breath away yet again. All Randy wants is to buy his supportive mom a really great Christmas gift, and this windfall will sure do it. There's only one snag--but it's a huge one--and despite how friendly Max is, Randy's afraid it will be a deal-breaker.",
