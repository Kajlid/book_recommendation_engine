  "description": "The Life of Ely is Jason L. McWhirter's first non-fantasy story that was originally written as a screenplay. His many years as an educator has inspired this moving fictional story of a young abused boy who finds hope, strength, and salvation from a caring teacher and wrestling coach who teaches him about life and growing up, and who believed in him when no one else did. The life of Ely is a life that you wouldn’t wish on your enemy. A young abused boy growing up in a poor broken home, who was told every day that he was worthless, befriends a caring teacher and coach who fans a spark of hope within him. The classroom and the wrestling mat become Ely’s weapons to battle his demons and to find the confidence that he needs to survive. It’s an emotional story about a boy who comes of age that will leave you crying, laughing, and cheering as he faces the overwhelming odds against him.",
