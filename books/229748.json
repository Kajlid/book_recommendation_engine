  "description": "Clarke Gannon and Naelen Spencer prepare for the final showdown with Ronan Cunningham, the vampire intent on assembling nine powerful objects to harness their malevolent power. But first they’ve got to find the bastard. Which would be easier if Naelen’s presence wasn’t making Clarke physically ill. After finding out Naelen is mated to another dragon, Clarke is destroyed and jealous. Naelen claims he can fight the mating bond and only wants Clarke. That’s all well and good, except for the fact that no one fights the bond. But hunting Cunningham is as good a distraction as any. They track him to the mysterious Order of Rasmossen and Wolffe, only to get themselves locked in a dungeon. Up side? They’ve found Cunningham. He’s a prisoner too, and he wants to team up. He says that if they work together, they can get free of the Order, and he’ll help them use the magical objects to break the mating bond. Clarke knows they can’t trust Cunningham. The mating bond can’t be broken. But how can she and Naelen resist trying?",
