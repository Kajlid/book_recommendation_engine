  "description": "Teenage polio survivor Rowan Collier is caught in the crossfire of a secret war against \"the unfit.\" It's 1922, and eugenics―the movement dedicated to racial purity and good breeding―has taken hold in America. State laws allow institutions to sterilize minorities, the \"feeble-minded,\" and the poor, while local eugenics councils set up exhibits at county fairs with \"fitter family\" contests and propaganda. After years of being confined to hospitals, Rowan is recruited at sixteen to play a born cripple in a county fair eugenics exhibit. But gutsy, outspoken Dorchy befriends Rowan and helps her realize her own inner strength and bravery. The two escape the fair and end up at a summer camp on a desolate island run by the New England Eugenics Council. There they discover something is happening to the children. Rowan must find a way to stop the horrors on the island…if she can escape them herself.",
