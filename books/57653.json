  "description": "Liberals in the U.S. government have erected a new colour bar against blacks and Hispanics. The examples are shocking and innumerable. Williams gets liberal, selfprofessed minority leaders on the record, exposing that their chief interest isn't helping minority Americans, but rather helping the Democratic Party by keeping a liberal stranglehold on minority groups and how they vote.",
