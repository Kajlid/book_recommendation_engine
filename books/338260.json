  "description": "Being kidnapped by orcs was not how the day was supposed to start.It was just a regular morning for Ivy Molina. Fighting with her brother at breakfast about how to save the family business after the most recent attack. Then, it all went south.Now, she’s sitting in the bottom of a pit looking up at the biggest orc she’s ever seen. He’s her captor, her keeper and she should hate everything about him.But, she doesn’t.She pretends to.Until, she can’t.The angry, hulking orc has been charged with watching her until her fate is decided. Only, there’s far more going on here. His mating fever flames when the captive he’s supposed to guard is the human female he’s been stalking for months.They are on opposite sides of a war. Can this rage filled orc unlock his heart for his one true mate? Or will duty and loyalty cost him a life he never thought he could have?Author’s Note: These should-be enemies end up chained together in more ways than one. It’s opposites attract and zero to five spicy peppers in a Stockholm heartbeat. It’s safe, no cheating, fated mates and all the possessive, protective orc-ness you expect!This is the third in the Al-pha Horde series of interconnected stand alones about four orc brothers! Ivy and Oran are both hot headed and hard hearted until they combust and burn up the pages!",
