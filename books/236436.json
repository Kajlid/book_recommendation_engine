  "description": "Getting stuck in an elevator with her sexy, bad-boy co-worker she’s been lusting after is not how Victoria Collins planned her Friday evening. And you can bet that the mind-blowing sex with a virtual stranger was also not on her agenda. Despite the danger, Victoria soon falls under Joe’s spell and releases Vicki, her inner-sex vixen.  Joe Bradshaw is a man used to getting what he wants, both in life and in business. But the one thing he can’t find is a woman strong enough and open enough to touch his heart. When he starts his next freelance contract and meets Victoria, he senses the sexual powder keg behind the drab clothes that cannot even begin to mask her fire and beauty.  Can Vicki forge past scars, and present danger, to allow her to open her heart and free her passionate desire for Joe?",
