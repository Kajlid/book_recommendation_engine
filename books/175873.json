  "description": "One month. One hundred thousand dollars. A dream gig.Hard-working, competent, and fearless in the face of crankiness—Anna Fisher is more than qualified to help a rich old man type up his memoir.With a ruined hand, Ian Youngblood can’t play the guitar … and can’t type. He’s also not old—though he’s managed to pack a lot of sex, drugs, and rock and roll into his years as lead singer, guitarist and all-around Lothario of Escape.Ian and Anna’s attraction to each other is blistering, but Ian needs things Anna’s never heard of. And after a sheltered childhood in the Amish community, Anna needs the one thing Ian knows he can’t give her.",
