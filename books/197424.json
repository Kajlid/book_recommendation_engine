  "description": "The mission was supposed to be simple. Infiltrate an enemy's stronghold outside Rome and eliminate its leader. For a Breed warrior as lethal as Ettore Selvaggio, AKA \"Savage\", stealth assassinations are only one of his many cold-hearted specialties. But the last thing Savage expects to find behind enemy lines—in his target's bed—is a woman he once adored.It's been years since Savage last saw beautiful Arabella Genova. Years he's strived to banish to his past, along with the fierce desire he once felt toward Bella . . . and the irresistible calling of her blood that stirs in him even now, despite the fact that she belongs to another male.But when fate throws Savage and Bella together again in a race for their lives, will his long-lost love prove to be the one woman he can't live without, or the perfect weapon to destroy him?",
