  "description": "Fairy Godmothers can’t visit humans… …much less fall in love with them. Mila has broken both fairy rules, but for Lincoln, she’d do anything.  For twenty years, Mila has secretly used her birthday wish to travel to the forbidden human world to visit her best friend—and the boy who saved her life. Now, he's no longer a boy, but a man that makes her stomach flutter and her heart pound. Using her last magical birthday wish, she confesses her feelings towards him, only to discover he's getting married. How can he love someone else?  Lincoln has adored Mila since he was eight years old, but their relationship is the ultimate in impossible love. Now that he's twenty-five, he found the perfect human woman.
