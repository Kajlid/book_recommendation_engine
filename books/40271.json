  "description": "When Ravid Veilyn received word of his mother's illness, he scoured the empire for the rare and powerful reagents needed for her cure. The last, the coveted xevrothen, could only be found in the treacherous Gairtax Mountains, from which few returned.There, he met a madman who sought dominion over death and used the lives of innocents to fuel his twisted paradise. Ravid was to be his next victim.But when Ravid called upon a childhood story figure, in the hopes of praying on the man's superstitions, he got more than he bargained for when the Veiled Rider answered his call.Now bound to an ancient demon without hope of salvation, Ravid begins to learn the world is not all it's painted to be.Quotes- I didn’t say ‘attacked by demons.’ Attacked implies rubble, survivors, and captives to torture and rescue. I believe my word of choice was smear. That means ash, blood, and a pit in the ground so deep you can glimpse the fires at Gaia’s heart.- You’re a merchant talking to a professional crook. I once sold a block of ice to a desert caravan dying of thirst in the middle of a snow storm for three pieces of silver. What did I tell them? That it would turn to water if they put it near fire.",
