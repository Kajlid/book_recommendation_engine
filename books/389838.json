  "title": "Meets Girl: A Novel",
  "description": "\"It’s romance and fairy tales. But it’s magic and whimsy too. It’s a writer’s lament and a coming-of-age tale (for lack of a better cliché.) It’s experimentation and taking chances. It’s poetry and music. It’s love and art.\" -LL Book Review\"Silly and poignant and real . . . This isn't a love letter to Veronica as much as a love letter to the process of falling in love, and to that of writing a novel. . . delightfully hyper-aware of its own storytelling.\" -Books I Done Read\"A great read indeed . . . Entrekin has really shown himself to be a first rate novelist with Meets Girl. The story crackles with energy as it progresses toward a satisfying conclusion.\" -The Outer View ---\"Once upon a time, I fell in love with a girl who didn't love me in return.\"New York City, circa 2006. A young man lucking into any temp job he can while following his dream to be a writer. A dream girl and a bad case of unrequited love (is there any other kind?).If the story ended there, it wouldn't be extraordinary. It would be just another tale from the big, bad, glorious city; just another romance that never was; just another friendship that never got the chance to be anything more. But the story doesn't end there.Angus Silver won't let it. Angus Silver knows what people love and whom, and he offers that young writer who fell in love with that girl who didn't love him in return a simple choice. The choice is easy. Making it is not. Making it will break someone's heart.",
