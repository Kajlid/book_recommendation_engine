  "description": "Within these pages is the reality of the attack mounted by Satan against ministries, nations and people. The subtleties are exposed and the reasons for the successful resulting destruction are identified. It is a book about a war few recognize we are in, even as it relates to only one particular battle. The tactics of the enemy take on new approaches but at the core they remain unchanged.",
