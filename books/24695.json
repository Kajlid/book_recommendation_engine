  "title": "The Spire Chronicle",
  "description": "After 150 years, one man's story can finally be told...... Summer 1861 in Salisbury, England; Writing under the alias of Ralph Chatterforth, a narrator presents his story as a journey from innocent childhood through the key milestones that shaped his wretched character to ultimately confess the sins for which he undoubtedly suffered until his dying day. The Spire Chronicle is the tale of a man haunted by his recent past as he tries to make sense of a scandalous life. A melancholic and emotional reflection brought to life through the original Victorian prose. At times humorous, but in essence an honest confession of a seemingly immoral lifetime.",
