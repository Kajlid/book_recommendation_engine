  "title": "The FEAR-19 Pandemic: How lies, damn lies, and fake statistics created a pandemic of fear that spread faster and created more damage than COVID-19 ever could have by itself.",
  "description": "We have nothing to fear but fear itself.FDRIn this book, author Tommy Madison takes a down to earth look at how the fear of COVID-19 spread faster than the virus itself.Madison explains how the unfortunate convergence of green journalism, hatred of Donald Trump, and an unprecedented moment in time sparked a pandemic of fear, hysteria, and panic that will have long-lasting and far-reaching consequences.He takes us through how the science was manipulated and unmasks the people who spread the misinformation. Lies, damn lies, and fake statistics created a mythical COVID boogie man that was much more dangerous than COVID itself.Instead of “flattening the curve,” we began an epic battle with this mythical monster that led to devastating and unnecessary consequences. The book contains evidence that the lockdowns were not only ineffective but hampered the real effort of reducing COVID’s ability to spread to its most vulnerable populations.And finally, Madison provides insight on how we can all begin to move forward and recover, so hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes and are not doomed to repeat them.I am a firm believer in the people. If given the truth, they can be depended upon to meet any national crisis. The great point is to bring them real facts.Abraham Lincoln",
