Hughie finds out when he meets the teenage adventurers known as SUPERDUPER... but unknown to the little Scotsman, Butcher has finally learned his secret. A dire scheme is set in motion, and at the vast superhero evangelist festival of BELIEVE, Hughie's relationship with Annie January - aka Starlight of the Seven - reaches its terrible conclusion. And soon The Boys themselves risk being torn asunder. The Boys, Vol. 7: The Innocents reprints issues 39-47 of the New York Times Best-Selling series by Garth Ennis, Darick Robertson, Russ Braun and John McCrea, and features all of the covers by Robertson!",
