  "title": "My Father Had a Daughter: Judith Shakespeare's Tale",
  "description": "William Shakespeare was father to three children: Susanna, his oldest, and twins Judith and Hamnet. This is Judith's tale... In this wonderfully inventive novel, Grace Tiffany weaves fact with fiction to bring Judith Shakespeare to vibrant life. After a family tragedy, Judith discovers a copy of her father's new play, which seems to make light of her grief. Furious, she follows him to London, intent on sabotaging the performance--but instead, she discovers that she and her father have more in common than she imagined... Through Judith's eyes, we glimpse the world of her famous playwright father--his work, his family, and his inspiration--in a richly atmospheric tale from a bright new literary star.",
