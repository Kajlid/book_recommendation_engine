And an extraordinary love that dares to transcend the boundaries of time.Arma’ros is one of the very first ‘fallen ones’. Tormented by his separation from Divine grace, his fierce, unsanctioned love for a human woman has him determined to somehow right the damage he and his Grigori brothers have wrought upon the Earth, to protect the innocents affected by their actions - even defying lethal Divine edict to do so. Zoe possesses a ‘gift’ no other being on Earth has - the ability to track down the feared and little understood Nephilim, the offspring and descendants of the Watchers. Her unique talent has made her an unknowing target in this life and in the past, attracting the unwelcome, deadly attention of Dark Celestials.Their agonizing past must be revisited to expose startling revelations – unimaginable prophecies, secret motives and twisted agendas of Celestials and humans that have been concealed since the beginning of time. Together, Zoe, Arma’ros must locate both the Nephilim offspring and the last Enochian Key to prevent them from falling into the enemy’s grasp, the Key that will either unlock the Song of limitless Divine potential – or unleash the complete destruction of our Earth.",
