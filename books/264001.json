  "description": "It's been over thirty years since the bombs dropped that almost decimated the planet. The fallout changed not only the animals and the landscape, but the people too. Freaks they called them; outcasts of society and hunted for their powers. The Circus has the only people to openly flaunt them, offering a haven for the lost and the damned.  Rhea works for a powerful man in the male-dominated world and she is treated no better than a slave.  Until one day she saves a stranger and it changes her life forever.  Will Rhea find her place within the freaks, or will this be her final show?",
