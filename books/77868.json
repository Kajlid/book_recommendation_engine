  "title": "Hart Coursing: Hounding Anne Boleyn",
  "description": "When Henry VIII realizes he’s trapped in a lengthy, failing marriage, to a drunken,depressed and aging wife, Catherine of Aragon, without a viable heir to the throne, he’s demoralized. He fights to win her favor back, showering her with affection, but to no avail. He must summon the inner strength to search for happiness with a new and honest woman that will love him for himself, and not his throne, fulfilling his greatest desires. But that can only happen if he can find a way to justify sinning in this fashion. Before he can even begin to do that, he must first overcome one of his greatest obstacles—his adviser and friend, Cardinal Wolsey, whose solitary goal is to try and secure his own place as the foremost authority of the Church of Rome in England, through convincing Henry to gain a male heir by taking on a mistress of his choosing, Bessie Blount. After some struggle, Henry falls for her, thinking her in love with him, but finds she is only infatuated with his power to give her security and some wealth. How long can Henry continue to argue the scriptures and manage this battle of wills with this man, constantly discounting Henry’s worries for his own immortal soul? It will require Henry engage in a daring hunt for an enduring love—one he eventually finds with the charismatic, honest and outspoken, Anne Boleyn—the woman that sets his heart free, giving him the inspiration and confidence to stand up to the Church of Rome, and therefore Wolsey, along with his passive-aggressive wife, ending his lifetime of being a victim and doing only what duty dictates. What will this reborn King do to find peace in the name of love, and to attain atonement for his transgressions?",
