  "description": "Callie Evans would rather hide out in her DJ sound booth than face the fact that she's in love with her best friend, notorious campus hottie Tayber King. Tayber turns hooking up into an art form--no drama, no commitment, no lies, and nobody gets hurt. Nobody but Callie, that is. When she sees an opportunity to explore his sexier side using a fake online profile, she grabs it. Now her uninhibited alter-ego 'Sasha' is steaming up the screen, and Callie is breaking all of Tayberâ€™s rules. As Callie and Tayber get closer, online and off, she knows she has to confess. And risk losing him forever.**For mature readers, contains strong language and adult situations.**",
