  "description": "This whimsical, funny memoir takes on the challenges of new parenthood and exotic travel all at once. Sarah Bringhurst set off with her husband for a summer roughing it across the Philippines--taking along their two-month-old baby. In a rollicking journey across air, sea, and land, they encountered unearthly scenery, met fascinating people, and fell into one hilarious misadventure after another. Along the way, they learned that plans will go awry, life will go on, and the journey will be beautiful. From chocolate hills to desert islands, from swimming with sharks to battling cockroaches, the path from here to adventure never did run smooth! (Areas covered: Manila, Vigan, Baguio, Sagada, Banaue, Batad, Anilao, Cebu, Bohol, Panglao, and Malapascua--not to mention Hong Kong)",
