  "description": "Silver Winner, Nautilus Book Award When the Soul Awakens is a groundbreaking book about the evolution of consciousness and the birth of a real new age. Written for contemporary seekers, it illumines the eternal quest for spiritual truth in the context of our timeâ€”a time of crisis and paradox. Even as threats to human civilization intensify, a new wave of universal spirituality is quietly breaking upon the shores of our planet. Based on modern esoteric teachings known as the Ageless Wisdom, the book describes the spiritual awakening now occurring as a turning-point in human evolution. It presents the path ahead as a collective passage to a higher stage of consciousness, involving stages of spiritual growth that flower into soul awareness. From this higher awareness, a new civilization will arise. The book reveals the nature of the soul through the insights of sages, poets, and philosophers across the ages. Through the wisdom teachings, it describes the origin and destiny of the human family and offers a glimpse of the extraordinary future that awaits us as the soul awakens and a new era dawns.",
