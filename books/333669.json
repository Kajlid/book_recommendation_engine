  "description": "Discover the amazing world of couch surfing with this hugely entertaining story about one man's quest to travel the world without paying a penny for accommodation. This title features dedicated mailing and e-mail campaign to targeted travel related media & organisations. What sort of person offers up their couch to a complete stranger from the other side of the world? And how can said stranger be sure that the owner of the couch is not a weirdo? Intrigued by this fast-growing phenomenon, inveterate traveller and author Brian Thacker sets out on a couch surfing tour of the globe to discover how and why kipping on someone's floor has become the latest, hippest way to travel. So grab your passport, strap yourself in, and join Brian as he travels through the Americas, Africa, India, Iceland and everywhere in between, sleeping on floors and sofas, under drum kits and in wardrobes, and hangs out with some of the most charming, entertaining, and off-the-wall people you could hope - or perhaps hope not - to ever meet.",
