  "title": "In God We Trust: Morally Responsible Investing",
  "description": "This book is both timely and timeless.In God We Trust  delves deeply into current economic and market developments and reflects on how U.S. prosperity has returned in 2018, as capitalism has again been unleashed. The author says, \"What a relief after eight years of economic stagna­tion and government over-regulation.\" Oddly, as the U.S. economy has benefited from pro-growth policies, like tax rate cuts and deregulation, there exists a rising tide of sympathy for socialism among leftist politicians and young people.This timeless divide between capitalism and socialism is explored within the context of the economic and moral ramifications for society in general and long-term investors, specifically.Readers with historical perspective will appreciate the logic of what should be obvious, i.e. that socialism has never worked anywhere on earth. Or aptly put by President Ronald Reagan, \"Socialism can only work in two places, heaven where they don't need it, and hell where they already have it.\"This book is about participating in the capital markets while avoiding morally objectionable businesses. As a lover of the free enterprise system and a portfolio manager,  George Schwartz chronicles how Morally Responsible Investing is helping long-term investors put their money to work in accordance with their moral beliefs. His firm manages Ave Maria Mutual Funds, which were founded in 2001. These pro-life and pro-family mutual funds have attracted over 100,000 shareholders, who have invested more than $2.2 billion in five separate award-winning mutual funds.",
