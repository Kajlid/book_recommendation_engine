  "description": "“If you’re a woman and you want to write, you must be prepared to endure.”Writing is already an endurance test. Add to that the conditioning women internalize as part of growing up in society that propagates double standards and works to marginalize women writers, and the result is an entire class of writers who fight internal battles of self-worth as they struggle through their creative processes, often feeling quite alone in the process. In Write On, Sisters! Brooke Warner tackles this issue in two parts—first drawing upon research, anecdotes, and her personal experiences from twenty years in the book publishing industry to show how women’s writing is discounted or less valued than men’s writing, and then discussing how to overcome these challenges. In explaining how we got here and why the culture and the industry continue to erode women’s efforts for equal treatment as writers, Warner hopes to give women writers a sanity baseline: if you know what you face, you can work to overcome it. She dedicates the second half of the book, meanwhile, to encouragement grounded in real-world suggestions for how women can thrive as creatives despite these barriers. Inspiring and empowering, Write On, Sisters! is for every woman interested in championing other women writers, cultivating community, and refusing to accept imposed limitations.",
