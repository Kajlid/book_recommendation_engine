  "description": "“Brilliant. A chilling erotic suspense that will send shivers down your spine. A sensuous, gripping tale of murder through the ages.” —Kat Martin, New York Times best-selling author with over 11 million books in print The past calls out to Ann Yang with a voice she cannot ignore. Is a killer chasing her through time? Yang, a bright, tough medical examiner, investigates a murder scene in a Philadelphia suburb that appears to be the work of a serial killer, whose calling card is American Civil War coat buttons placed beneath victims' tongues. While her Victorian home is being renovated, Yang finds an old diary that belonged to a former occupant that may be the key to a 100-year-old mystery. Gun shy of relationships, Yang begins to have feelings for Mark, the carpenter working on her home, but is hesitant to give in to them because of her recent bitter divorce and the daily trauma involved with being a medical examiner. Desperate to rub out the disturbing memory of a failed marriage and find her new place in life, she begins hypnosis and past-life regressions. Soon Yang is convinced that the killer, the diary, and her past are somehow connected...in ways she could never imagine...",
