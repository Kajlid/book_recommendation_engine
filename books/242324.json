The necessary details of these future events are buried in the cryptic riddles, and the lives of many hinge on Jack’s ability to decipher them and stop the devastation before it occurs. Aided by his crush, Abby, and Larry, the old man who runs the bar, Jack takes on the impossible task. Jack is forced to question his own sanity whilst striving to save as many people as possible, even as the riddles become progressively more lethal and drag him further and further down the rabbit hole.In a shocking twist, Jack must reckon with the most perilous threat yet, and is forced to confront an evil that hits closer to home than ever before. He must race against time to prevent losing everything, because when the future whispers your name, you only get One Shot.",
