  "description": "Have you ever been in love?So in love that you believed all the lies, again and again?Because I did...Did you manage to escape from the hurt, the heartbreak, and the tears that came with being in love?Did you even have time to pick up the broken pieces of your heart before they shattered it all over again?Because I didn't...\nI gave Evan my heart, my trust, my everything, and in return all he gave me was pain.Stumbling around in a new city, picking up the pieces I had lost, I found myself in a stranger's arms. Cradling me against his chest, protecting me, seeing me, promising me everything I was afraid to ask for myself again.I'm not naive enough to mistake lust for love. Love never comes that easily; it always rips you apart before it finally gives you what each and every one of us longs for. But Noah knew what he was after, and now I know that nothing could have stopped him from taking what he wanted from me.He became the one who gave me hope again, day after day, simply by being there.He became the one who made me whimper in bed, while he whispered dirty words in my ear, night after night.And then he became the one who took it all away again.This is my story, maybe a simple one for some, yet still completely mine.",
