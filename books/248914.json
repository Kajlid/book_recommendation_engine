He immediately calmed, nuzzling his massive head against her arm. Awed at what he had just seen, Hatch walked over to the now calm Shufly and rubbed his muzzle.\"Just out of curiosity, what did you whisper in his ear?\"Nealy tilted her head to the side. \"I simply told him if he didn't behave himself, I wouldn't take him out to the track. I told him he had to behave like a gentleman.\"Hatch grimaced. \"And you're telling me he understood what you said?\"Nealy laughed. \"He calmed down, didn't he?\" Hatch's eyes narrowed with disbelief. Was she putting him on? She certainly looked serious. Something in him clicked. Suddenly he had the overwhelming desire to know everything there was to know about Nealy Clay. He smiled. Nealy smiled back.She's in her element, Hatch thought. This is her life, her love. He was beginning to understand why Hunt had been so in love with her and why her children were so in awe of her.
