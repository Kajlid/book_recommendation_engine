  "description": "My name is Rune, and I’m not a coward—it’s just not everyone is meant to be a hero.My fire abilities provide great power, but they also mean I’m a danger to those close to me and to the world. For me, hard-won battles have always been accompanied by dire consequences.The supernatural war has broken out of the underworld and into broad daylight. Fire-wielding terrorists dominate the news, a specialized police force is imprisoning supernaturals without trial, and the kidnapping of the mayor has brought the entire city to boiling point.But sometimes the only way to win is not to play. To avoid, once more, doing the wrong thing and making everything worse, I must flee. Surely I can do that right, at least.I just need to ensure my friends are safe first.Fire Soldiers is the third book in The Sentinels, a thrilling new urban fantasy series. Mixing mystery, magic, humor, and heart-pounding action, it's sure to delight fans of The Dresden Files and The Iron Druid Chronicles who may just find a new favorite hero in Rune Russell.",
