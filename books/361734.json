  "description": "Katie Snow is content worshipping her object of lust from afar. After all, Jack isn't merely a crush, he's also her boss. And office romances are trouble. When Katie accompanies Jack to a weeklong conference in Rio, she's sure she can control her libido--until she discovers her boss's dominant nature extends beyond the boardroom. What's a good submissive girl to do? Embarking on an intense affair, Katie falls deeper into the pleasure of Jack's demands--deeper into the man himself. His will is her command, every correct move rewarded with praise that she comes to crave. But suddenly Katie is caught in a vortex of conflicting emotions and doubt when a flash from Jack's past enters the picture--in the form of a dramatically gorgeous ex. How can Katie compete? How could she have allowed a short, sultry affair to turn into love? Out of her depth, Katie's heart is suddenly in more danger than her spankable behind. Something tells her the Big Book of Submission won't help her this time.",
