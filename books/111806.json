  "description": "The final volume of The Heart Rate of a Mouse trilogy.In November 1978, over a year has passed since music icon Ryan Ross announced his retirement from the public eye. He is far from being forgotten, however, as his musical influence can be heard whenever Brendon Roscoe starts singing on the radio. As the frontman of the upcoming band His Side, Brendon was famously discovered by Ross. But even as His Side are touring state after state and selling records so fast, Ryan hasn't been seen. And Ryan prefers that, really. It's what he wants: to forget and be forgotten. Until, one day, someone starts digging up his past, forcing him to come face to face with everything he's trying to run away from.",
