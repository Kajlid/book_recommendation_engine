And why does this one woman's blood set his thirst on fire. Can Trinity save Lady Beth from the monster that hunts her? Can he even protect her from his own wicked urges, wanting to devour her? Lady Beth Winslow never stays home in the evenings. She fears her despicable stepbrother. Then a monster stalks her in the dark woods and she cannot tell beast from savior.
