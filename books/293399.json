  "description": "Chris - People say I’m a cocky, loud, foul-mouthed, sarcastic asshole of a man whore. And well...they’d be right. But there’s more to me than that; more than anyone knows. Pain from my past has made me uninterested in any connection with a man beyond a night of fun. That is, until Lyle Watson comes onto the scene. The secret and mystery behind the sweet little redhead’s eyes drive me to distraction wondering what his story is. I long to crack open his shell and get a glimpse into his true personality. When I get that glimpse, I become insatiable. But I quickly discover I’m not the only one with a hard story. Can I break through the walls Lyle has surrounded himself with? Can I let go of my past and change my ways? Is it possible to believe in things like love and forever again? Lyle - I can’t get the hunky cop off my mind. He’s absolutely gorgeous, from his buff body, his scruffy blond hair and those warm brown eyes that dance with mischief. Even the way he carries himself screams confidence and strength. He is everything I should know to leave alone by now, but everything I can’t resist. I can only push him away so long before I end up in his arms. He’s the first man in years to make me think of things like relationships and love again. But what happens when the past comes back to haunt me? *This M/M romance is for readers 18 and up! It contains a sexy, ornery cop, his guarded, wounded sweetie, and their hilariously feisty best friends. It has no cheating or cliffhangers, and a very happy HEA. **Trigger warning: This book contains mention/description of domestic violence. Author’s note: Thank you for your interest in my book! My stories tend to be low angst because it hurts my heart; I like getting to the good stuff and live for fluff. If “instalove” isn’t your thing, my books may not be for you. I want my readers to finish my books with a smile on their face and a fierce case of the warm and fuzzies. Laughter is guaranteed, and each read delivers its own type of drama. Thanks again for taking a look and happy reading!",
