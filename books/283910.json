  "title": "Ject: The Philosophy of Michael J. Buckner M.A.",
  "description": "Michael J. Buckner's \"Ject\" is a collection of fascinating philosophical essays written over a four year epoch (2015-2019). Ject is a unique work of psychological archaeology. It begins with a live vivisection of space-time, aging, and immortality; using the sharp scalpels of today. The author is critical of religious efforts to slow science and technology. He says that philosophy is the key to the development of a natural-artificial-ethics. In a compelling and fascinating style, Buckner upgrades the reader's perspective of themselves and the world. Unapologetic, Buckner evidences the creative power of humans to create Gods and artificial intelligence. He prescribes an overdose of evolution, creative exercise, and free will. He encourages the reader to hone awareness, logic and self-control. He encourages us to look in the mirror and at the fossil record and accept our common ancestry with all other lifeforms on Earth. Life is too short to spend it under the thumb of religious carnies. Ject is about the reader unearthing their own subconscious to discover the underlying framework of the universe. A bold and penetrating compendium; Ject forges the frontier of 21st century intellectualism. It aims true and strikes its target across enemy lines. Discover Ject!",
