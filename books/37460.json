At an international conference in Prague, Lt. Col. Jon Smith, an Army research doctor specializing in infectious diseases―and secretly an agent attached to Covert-One―is contacted by one of his Russian colleagues. Dr. Valentine Petrenko is concerned about some unexplained deaths in Moscow, and the government's refusal to go public with any information about the outbreak. When the two meet, they are attacked by a group of mysterious men. Petrenko is killed, and his notes and medical samples are lost. Smith barely escapes with his life.Meanwhile, a series of government officials around the world are coming down with a fast-acting virus with a 100% fatality rate. These deaths are somehow related to the increasing militarism from the new Russian government, headed by the autocratic and ambitious President Victor Dudarev. With few clues and precious little time, Smith and Covert-One must unravel this vicious plot and find who―or what―is at the center of it all. Before it's too late… This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.",
