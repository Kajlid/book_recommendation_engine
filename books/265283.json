  "description": "The pulse-pounding conclusion to The Queen’s Consorts series is here!  Until now, my Graces and my guardians have been enough to get me through every trial I’ve faced—but not this time. This time is different. The Mad King is coming with an army to claim my throne, and he won’t stop until I’m dead.  To save my males and my court, I’ll need to forge new alliances—but will they answer my call for aid? Or are they just as likely to put my head on a pike as he is?  At least I’m not alone. Alaric, Finn, Kade, and Tiernan will stand at my side no matter what I decide to do. But as they teach me more about my Graces and how to wield them, I’m beginning to understand… unlocking the amount of power I’ll need to destroy the Mad King might just kill me.    SEDUCED BY POWER is the third and final installment in this medium-burn reverse harem fantasy romance. Read the series fans are calling ‘fast-paced & sexy as hell!’. Filled with irresistible Fae warriors, ancient magic, and non-stop action that’ll have you up all night turning the pages.  *Series now complete!   #WhyChoose",
