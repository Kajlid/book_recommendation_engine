  "title": "Defining Moments: American Indian Removal and the Trail to Wounded Knee",
  "description": "Providing a detailed overview of the 1890 massacre of more than 250 Native American men, women, and children by the United States Cavalry at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, this account analyzes the conditions that led to this horrific event and its effect on the country’s political, cultural, and social landscape—then and now. The research presented here is arranged in three distinct sections: narrative overview; biographies, which includes background information on principal figures involved in the massacre; and primary sources. This unique and comprehensive volume also includes a glossary of important people, places, and terms, as well as a chronology of events, a subject index, and an annotated list of sources for further study.",
