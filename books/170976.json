  "title": "Shadows of Carcosa: Tales of Cosmic Horror by Lovecraft, Chambers, Machen, Poe, and Other Masters of the Weird",
  "description": "From the chilling land of Carcosa—an inspiration for the hit TV series, True Detective—to H. P. Lovecraft’s accursed New England hills, this collection features some of the most harrowing creations in the cosmic horror genre and includes such classic works as Arthur Machen's \"The White People,\" Algernon Blackwood's \"The Willows,\" and Lovecraft's own weird and hideous \"The Colour Out of Space.\"This volume also includes: Bram Stoker, “The Squaw”; Ambrose Bierce, “Moxon’s Master” and \"The Damned Thing”; R. W. Chambers, “The Repairer of Reputations”; M. P. Shiel, “The House of Sounds”; Henry James, “The Jolly Corner”; Walter de la Mare, “Seaton’s Aunt”; Ambrose Bierce’s “An Inhabitant of Carcosa,” and a Note on the selection by D. Thin.\"The true weird tale has something more than a secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains. An atmosphere of breathless and unexplainable dread of outer, unknown forces must be present; a hint of that most terrible conception of the human brain—a malign and particular suspension or defeat of those fixed laws of Nature which are our only safeguard against the assaults of chaos and the daemons of unplumbed space.\" —H. P. Lovecraft",
