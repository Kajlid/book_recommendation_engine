  "description": "Mom, when are you going to add two more stars to the banner in our window?\" LaRue asked.\"You obviously haven't looked. I sewed them on this morning.\" All around Salt Lake City-and across the nation — the banners were showing up now. Each star represented a member of the household who was serving in the military. And already, gold stars — for those who had died in action — were beginning to replace some of the blue ones.Picking up where the bestseller Rumors of War left off, Since You Went Away continues with Wally Thomas's struggle to survive as a prisoner of war on the Bataan Peninsula while his family begin to disperse due to the war. Bobbi and Alex Thomas are leaving for military duty at the infant stages of World War II — Bobbi as a naval nurse at Pearl Harbor and Alex in army basic training. A gripping novel filled with memorable characters, Since You Went Away will draw you into a past charged with danger, action, romance, and the importance of family and faith.http://deseretbook.com/item/4931241/C...",
