  "title": "Deliverance from Evil",
  "description": "Deliverance from Evil brings to life the Salem witch trials, one of the most uncanny times in our nation's history. Young girls in trances pointed out neighbors, leaders, relatives--over 150 people were arrested, with many hanged for their supposed sins. Frances Hill, author of A Delusion of Satan, brings her deep historical and political understanding together with her honed skills as a novelist to produce a picture of the trials both realistic and emotional. She has written an extraordinary and gripping novel of hysteria, power plays, and love in colonial America.",
