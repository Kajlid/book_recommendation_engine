  "description": "Christina Dodds's popular Distinguished Academy of Governesses trilogy (Rules of Surrender, Rules of Engagement, and Rules of Attraction) may be completed, but the romantic adventures of one young woman trained there have just begun.Having received glowing references upon leaving her post in Paris in a diplomatic household, Celeste Milford is delighted to accept a position at Blythe Hall, where her mother was the cook, her father the gardener, and Ellery Throckmorton, the younger son of the family, her idol. She's been hired to teach Penelope (the daughter of Garrick, Ellery's widowed older brother), and Kiki, a mysterious wild child under the family's protection.Before long, Celeste has her two young charges well in hand. But she's also encountered several impediments to pursuing her long-unrequited love for Ellery -- and discovered a most unexpectedly passionate attraction to Garrick that her new employer returns with interest. If all goes well, Celeste's next post may be a lifelong position, with extraordinary benefits for all concerned.",
