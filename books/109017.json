  "description": "Tomboy. Potty mouth. Cyber geek. That’s who 24-year-old photo blogger Georgina “George” McCartney really is. But because her father’s death suddenly makes her a “ward” of her odious step-aunt, George’s world is turned upside down as she’s forced into leading a life of respectability in the kingdom of Chalys, where ladies dazzle in corsets and petticoats, gentlemen go a-courting with carriage rides and grand balls, and anything electrical or digital is forbidden. Kidnapped. Hunted. Seduced. All George wants is a stolen adventure after dark, but instead she finds herself drugged – or at least she thinks she is. How else can she explain the way she finds her beautiful, sexy, and powerful captor, Silviu, absolutely irresistible? Plus, he’s crazy. He kisses George like he owns her, tells George creatures from Hell are after them, and he believes his demon half will gain a soul by making her his heartkeeper. Say what? Does he mean ‘housekeeper’?",
