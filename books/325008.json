  "description": "I shouldn’t be here. Let me rephrase that…I never wanted to be here. I didn’t ask for any of this.  Not the society I was born into. Definitely not the academy I’m supposed to attend. And sure as hell not the group I’m forced to play nice with.  Unfortunately, one too many school suspensions has catapulted me into the world I swore I’d never live in. Boulder Cove Academy: Where The Lawless reign and those beneath them are ash between their fingertips. The three leaders of this place—Crew, Jagger, and Neo—have always been an aching thorn in my side. When things get ugly, I have no choice but to turn to the boys I loathe.  Acceptance means I become a slave to their darkest desires. Bones to rattle.A mind to shake. In the thick of it all, I begin to see the truth. They never intended to help me. They only want to destroy me. One game at a time.",
