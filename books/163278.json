  "description": "A sweet Romance, Short Story  It's hard having a boy for a best friend. Especially for a girl like me. I can't talk to him about girl stuff. Forget going shopping together. Plus, I don't think Charlie has ever giggled in his life. Belly laughed until he peed his pants yes, giggle no.  Of course there are tons of benefits to having Charlie for a best friend. I get to see inside the working mind of a teenage male. Believe me it can get scary in there. I get to learn everything I will ever want to know about football, star wars, and the unique specialness of the internal combustion engine.  Most of all I get to hang out with the greatest guy ever. The type of person you know has your back no matter what. We'd been through too much together to let anything come between us. Or at least that is what I used to believe.  All of it was going to disappear if Cindy Jenkins got her claws into him.  This short story also includes the first three chapters of \"Certain Rules\"",
