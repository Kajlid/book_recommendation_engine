  "description": "Felicia Walker loves her job as an illustrator at Fever Hitch Comics. During this year's annual Earth Con, she will not only draw caricatures, but she'll also be decked out in body paint to represent the F'ldae -- an alien species from the comics. As she starts off a night exploring the off-limits, alien side of the convention, Felicia is unprepared for the spiraling events that will make her behave like a true F'ldae... in full mating heat.Agent Slate Reese, along with his best friend Agent Ryker Seals, are Metons who want to settle down, but they're having a difficult time finding the female to complete their mating trio. With the vast assortment of alien species converging on this area, surely there's one female who wouldn't mind spending a night with both of them.",
