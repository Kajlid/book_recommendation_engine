As it turns out, they lied about the job for which I was applying.Had we not been so untruthful with each other, there might have been fewer night terrors stalking the inhabitants of the City.Fewer unexplained disappearances.Fewer deaths.Now, nobody is safe from the creeping horrors we've unleashed.With no time to spare, we face an impossible task: we must discover the mysteries in metal in order to right this wrong.But is it already too late?",
