  "description": "Héloïse was the niece of the canon of Notre Dame, Fulbert, who entrusted her to Pierre Abélard, a peripatetic teacher, for instruction. They were married secretly, and after the revelation of this marriage by Fulbert, he sent his men to castrate Abélard. Consequently, Héloïse entered the convent of Argenteuil. Abélard was a pre-eminent Medieval (12th century) French philosopher and theologian. This work tells their tale.",
