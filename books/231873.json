  "description": "After a tragedy at sea in the summer of 1891, a once-bold scientist lingers on - only a fragment of his former self. Rather than return to his demanding work, he spends his time stringing wires and bringing electricity to the masses of Boston. What he doesn't know is that his life and words have provided great inspiration to a woman he's never met. Amanda Grant, who is on the run from an unfair attempted murder charge, finds herself strangely drawn to union organizer Jeb Thomas, but his presence only turns her life upside down. First, a strange box that she salvaged from the sea is stolen from her, then she is kicked out of the house where she found temporary sanctuary.With few other options she boards a train heading for Chicago and beyond. She's never left New England before, but she knows this escape will either bring her closer to Jeb, or she will escape yet again, maybe to find a distant home in the West.Those Who Wander takes a tour through private luxury train cars and seedy back alleys. Even the sparks created by a \"War of the Currents\" can't fully illuminate their path",
