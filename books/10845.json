  "description": "Meet Luna - hard hitting thief in the Old Norse world of Midgaard - and follow her on an action-packed adventure.The Books of Luna form a trilogy of independently concluded full-length novels which also form a continued story about the same main character, the cat burglar Luna.Luna gets mixed up in several deadly games, including power struggles, magic, lust and possibly even love. A story of knives and sorcery rather than swords and sorcery, it is also a story about a late coming of age ... and taken as a whole the Luna-trilogy also has elements of high fantasy.The novels have previously been published in Denmark, Scandinavia, where they garnered an enthusiastic and loyal audience amongst adult fantasy readers and young adults alike.",
