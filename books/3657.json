When identical twins Alexei and Stefano Morozov propose a night of sensuous pleasure, free-spirited Sam jumps at the chance to experience something new, even though she knows it has to be just a passing fling. She's very close to her family, and she knows there is no way they would accept this unconventional relationship. But one night isn't enough for the Morozov brothers. They've found the one woman who can complete them, and they're not willing to give her up. For her, they'll have to pretend to be one man. Samantha isn't comfortable with this arrangement. It feels too much like a betrayal. Can she find the courage to stand up for what she wants and honor the two men who love her? ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
