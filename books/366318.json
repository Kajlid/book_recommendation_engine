  "title": "Survival City: Adventures Among the Ruins of Atomic America",
  "description": "On the road to Survival City , Tom Vanderbilt maps the visible and invisible legacies of the cold war, exhuming the blueprints for the apocalypse we once envisioned and chronicling a time when we all lived at ground zero. In this road trip among ruined missile silos, atomic storage bunkers, and secret test sites, a lost battleground emerges amid the architecture of the 1950s, accompanied by Walter Cotten’s stunning photographs. Survival City looks deep into the national soul, unearthing the dreams and fears that drove us during the latter half of the twentieth century.“A crucial and dazzling book, masterful, and for me at least, intoxicating.”—Dave Eggers“A genuinely engaging book, perhaps because [Vanderbilt] is skillful at conveying his own sense of engagement to the reader.”— Los Angeles Ti mes“A retracing of Dr. Strangelove as ordinary life.”—Greil Marcus, Bookforum",
