  "title": "Flight of Icarus",
  "description": "Mankind has spread throughout the galaxy thanks to the development of Slip Stream tech. These large gateways are shortcuts through space time which create the illusion of faster than light travel. Following the last great war, ImperiuM Space is a place of order and predictability, at least for the majority. To deal with those on the fringes, the Human Empire uses licensed couriers. Itâ€™s a benign title for anything ranging from assassin to bounty hunter. Ex-soldier Jubal takes on one final contract as a favor to an old friend. In doing so he must confront his past, which may or may not be his thanks to implanted memories. Unable to protect those closest to him, Jubal teams up with rival Zamera. The two quickly become the hunted as they flee to parts of the galaxy most human never knew existed.  This is the first book in the Icarus Risen series and includes a preview of book 2: Gift of Prometheus.",
