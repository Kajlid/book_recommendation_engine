  "title": "The Labbitt Halsey Protocol",
  "description": "What choice did she really have? With the perfection of Labbitt Halsey Genomics' groundbreaking XEN protocol, no conscientious parent could deny the tantalizing possibilities. At least that's what Ann Franklin's husband convinced her of at the time they chose to conceive. Her son was to be one of the children of the future, whose unprecedented genius would propel mankind into a bright, shining tomorrow. But sixteen years later, sobered by the pitiless law of unintended consequences, Ann finds herself drawn into Jeremy's horrifying world, one of nihilism and suicide, while struggling against the loss of her high-powered consulting career, her son, and possibly her own life.From the pressure-packed government-corporate culture of Washington, D.C. to the XEN underworld in the back streets of New Orleans, The Labbitt Halsey Protocol explores the depths of a mother's love in the face of genetic manipulation gone tragically awry.",
