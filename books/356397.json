  "description": "Gabrielle Ivory was once a society beauty of such exquisite arrogance that she stared down a queen. But now, nearing 90, she’s largely disregarded by the younger members of the clan, who like to imagine granny as a bedridden relic of a dead era. That’s a mistake, and it’s not their only one. A series of malicious attacks is threatening the family business – one of the most prestigious art galleries in the world. Robert Madrigal and his high-strung wife, frantic to preserve the status-quo, want to chalk it all up to practical jokes gone wrong. But Gabrielle is not inclined to collude in this delusion. “It’s a ridiculous modern affectation,” she sniffs, “to pretend to disregard money.”",
