  "description": "On the surface Ari seems like a normal 18-year-old. It is her ability to sense the emotions of others that sets her apart. She just wants to be normal and that’s what she’s doing in her final year of high school. That is until a Seether stumbles across her. He soon realises he can use her ability to destroy our world and he will do anything to force her. Ari must find a way to stop the Seether, but his strength, speed and inhumanity make it near impossible. She finds an ally in Nate, a Sentinel who has been hunting the Seether for centuries. As they become closer, he is one more person she will have to leave behind when she is forced to decide the fate of this world.",
