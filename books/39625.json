  "description": "After realizing he has been drugged, Colin O'Kelly attempts to transport home to escape his enemy. When he awakes he is in a strange location with no powers, or the memory that he ever had them. Kate has been hiding deep in the Florida Keys for twenty-five years when a stranger drops into her protected haven. Can she overcome the fear she carries for her own people, the Tuatha DÃ© Danann, or will she run once she finds out Colin's true nature. Frantic to find Colin, Megan and Seamus discover that Mallaidh has sent two hurricanes on a collision course for the Keys in order to either flush Colin out or finish him in a watery grave. Can Megan and Seamus stop the hurricanes before they hit, or this just a distraction?",
