With killer style, A-list day jobs, and an envious marriage, the Mandevilles have captured the hearts of the people and the affections of the press. Their lives couldn't be more picture perfect--that is, until Jack turns forty and his world turns upside down when a stunning, and strikingly intelligent, redhead named Imogen interviews the couple for a high-profile magazine. Like a bolt of lightning, Jack is hit with a midlife crisis of epic proportions, bursting Jack and Cass's proverbial bubble. This drastic turn of events sends their entire family, friends, local community, and fans around the country, into a tailspin. Cass can only hope Jack will snap out of it soon, but it's too late already--nothing will ever be the same again . . . New York Times and USA Today bestseller Jill Mansell delivers laugh-out-loud antics and a perfect ending!",
