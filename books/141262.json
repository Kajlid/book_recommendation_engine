  "description": "Fun and safety go hand in hand as a little girl and a dragon spend a hot summer day at the beach. The two friends build castles in the sand, splash and swim, and race a boatload of pirates to a hidden treasure. As they play, the girl teaches her irrepressible friend to be water smart. The winning combination of adventure and safety information --- including The Dragon's Water Safety Rhyme and the checklist of rules at the end of the book --- provide the perfect starting point for safety discussions.",
