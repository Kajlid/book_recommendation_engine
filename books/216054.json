  "description": "The old world has gone. All that remains is the community - a harsh, brutal, primitive regime that governs through control and fear. Gaia is one of the young, trapped on an island off the coast of Northumberland. Gaia longs to escape before ‘becoming’ - the time when she is forced to serve the society she despises. Time is running out but hope arrives with Aran. He offers escape, freedom, a new life. This is Gaia’s last chance. Can she find her own destiny? Who will she become?",
