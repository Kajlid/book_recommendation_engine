  "title": "A Hallowe'en Anthology: Literary and Historical Writers over the Centuries",
  "description": "This unique anthology gathers together some of the most intriguing and useful works on the history of Halloween. Ranging from pre??????Christian Celtic myths to early 20th century articles, the book's 27 entries include poems, short stories, sections from 19th and 20th century folklore books, a one-act play, Irish and Scottish folk tales, and the first book on the holiday ever published. Noted works contained in the anthology include William Wells Newell's 1904 study of the history of Jack-o'-lantern legends in \"The Ignis Fatuus\" and Alexander Montgomerie's oft-quoted 1584 poem \"Flyting Against Polwart.\" Organized chronologically, most works are presented in their entirety and many include extensive annotations designed to make the original source materials more meaningful for modern readers. The book also includes 34 vintage photographs and illustrations.",
