Tall and tenacious, seventeen-year-old Kelsey Denner can run faster, kick further and jump higher than anyone else at her Australian high school.Why then, if she’s such a winner, does she feel like anything but?With her friends acting weird and her father dating, Kelsey thought she had troubles, until a sparkling light mysteriously sends her to the strange world of Aracron. Suddenly lost in a forest of giant, gnarled trees submerged in a blanket of suffocating silence and heavy green mist, Kelsey’s troubles just got real.Here, strange customs rule, wild beasts roam, people with special abilities wear tattoos on their faces, and societies are united by a deep reverence for Ara-rima, the soul of the land. Kelsey’s arrival uncovers dangerous secrets, and the terrifying myth of ancient invaders re-emerges. Now she must believe the inhabitants can help her return home and trust that Kamen, Protector of Pardok, can teach her the skills she needs. But lowering her guard might also mean surrendering her heart.There is one hope - the Ostiron gem. It opens a portal to other worlds once every thirty-three years and is due to activate. With time running out, Kelsey embarks on a high stakes journey across the land to make it to the Ostiron Altar in time.Failure will mean she is stuck here forever, but success could destroy her and, if the prophecy is true… the whole of Aracron.",
