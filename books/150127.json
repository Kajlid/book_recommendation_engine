  "title": "Other Selves: A Journey of Gender, Fiction, Discovery, and Hope",
  "description": "The universe is full of possibilities, they say. From technological advances to human evolution, there are as many possible outcomes to our endeavors as there are stars in the sky. We are small specks of matter in the cosmos, but the scope of our dreams and hopes could easily touch the furthest reaches of space. This collection of speculative fiction examines and explores the human experience as it collides with technology. When people have the chance to create their own identities based on their needs and wants, and the ability to create their own ideal body is a possibility, the world begins to change. From exploring high fantasy landscapes with swords and magic, to the dark edges of outer space, we learn that the gender that we are born with is not limited and our biological destiny is not finite. These are the stories of our Other Selves.",
