  "title": "The Unlounging: From a Belly Full of Beer to a Craw Full of Time",
  "description": "Mid-twenties, out of shape and lazy, Selraybob spends his days on his worn out lounger, drinking quarts of Busch and talking to his buddy Herm on the phone. Productivity is a forgotten dream. Until, right in the middle of his wife’s long-overdue goodbye speech, Selraybob has an epiphany. It’s about Time. Time, he determines, is a count. It’s only a count. Einstein was wrong. And with that, life begins to turn.  With warm wit and a complete lack of pretense, Selraybob shares his journey from a slovenly man stuck in his lounger to a verified, and often vilified, time-theory iconoclast.",
