  "description": "Being rich is great until you become the saint of Arcadia.Gentleman.Charmer.All-star.They call me a saint, but if they knew the lies, the fallacies,and what truths I hide, I’d be labeled a proclaimed sinner.I lie, do all the bad deeds, especially if it does right by her.She’s the darkness but also the light.He’s my downfall but also my redemption.Two opposites, but somehow everything I’ve fought for.Earning her, saving him, it’s all I can think of.Saint or sinner, I’ll win her.Death or life, I’ll protect him.Truth or lie, I’ll save them.Arcadia isn’t prepared for the war its wrought.Good thing I’m a fighter.No one said I’d bow down to an unworthy king.",
