The Sioux are leaving their barren reservations in hordes. Armed bands of Apaches have been seen \"east\" of the Mississippi!Lemuel Rowland, formerly \"Poyeshao, \" has spent his life learning the white man's ways. Now he must choose between his career as a Washington bureaucrat and the ancient dreams of his people.

What if they had struck eastward at a weakened America, still reeling from the devastation of the Civil War?What if they had won?",
