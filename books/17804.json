  "description": "One werewolf can save us all, but only if the vampires can teach him how to be human. The struggle for the book continues. The original manuscript has been found. However, there's evidence that at least a partial copy of the book is out there. While the family of vampires that Arthur and Jennings fought in Salamanca has been all but destroyed, the fact remains that they were answering to someone, somewhere. Arthur relocates the book and himself to a quiet suburb of Philadelphia. It is here they will teach Iago--originally born a wolf without any idea of his true nature--how to be a human. As long as they can get the werewolf educated and keep his existence hidden, he will provide their single greatest advantage over those who would use the secrets in the Book to change the course of human history. Terry returns home to Boston, with no memory of the events that took place in Salamanca. Jennings keeps close tabs on her, and when she's in a serious car accident, he must decide whether to Make her or let her die. After a few years of training with Arthur and Jennings, Iago decides to go rogue, spending a few years among the humans he's learned to emulate. When Arthur calls, however, the choice is clear--because if Arthur loses this fight, humans will become nothing more than food for a new, powerful breed of vampires.",
