  "description": "I’m hard on my students.  All semester, Melody has been sitting quietly in the back of my class - a straight-A student with a perfect 4.0 GPA. A nice, polite, well-behaved, good girl.  The kind of good girl I want to see on her knees in front of me, those big wide eyes begging me.  Touching her could get me fired and barred from teaching ever again. But when she asks me to be her thesis advisor, I say yes, and soon sweet, almost-innocent Melody is in my office, her ripe curves and pouty lips practically begging me to take her.  Dominate her. Claim her. Make this good girl my dirty girl.  It’s just an innocent crush…  I know it’s a total cliche to have a crush on your professor, but I can’t help it - he’s ruggedly handsome, incredibly smart, totally in control…  …and even from the back row I can see the monster in his pants.  I know these are dangerous games I’m playing with him. I know if we get caught, the consequences would be total disaster — but every time he growls my name, I practically lose my mind.  Take me, professor. Make me yours.  School Me Dirty is a very dirty standalone romance about a college sophomore and her naughty professor - but it’s complete with a super-sweet Happily Ever After ending and, of course, no cheating!",
