  "description": "Lacey Luzzi just wants a s’more.  After her grandfather gifts her a relaxing weekend at his luxury cabin, Lacey packs her best friend Meg into the Lumina and together they take off, dreaming of a girls’ weekend filled with bonfires, boat rides, and work-free days.  However, when three unexpected visitors show up on the doorstep of the Luzzi cabin, her plans of peace and quiet are foiled. It only gets worse after Lacey finds a dead body in her trunk – with no explanation as to how, or why, he’d landed face down in her leftover Taco Bell!  Suddenly, Lacey’s trip is no longer a weekend getaway, but a top secret assignment full of kidnappings, karaoke bars, and a suspiciously meddlesome grandmother. She recruits the help of new boyfriend Anthony, as well as computer-whiz cousin Clay, and together they must find the murderer, or else they will be planning a very different kind of getaway.  ** **  \nLacey Luzzi: S'mored, is a full-length, humorous cozy mystery with a strong female protagonist in the spirit of Janet Evanovich’s Stephanie Plum, albeit one working for the wrong side of the law…\n  Note: This book can be read as a standalone, though it is part of a larger series. It is rated a strong PG-13 for sarcasm and mild language. No graphic gore or sex.\n Tony Soprano, meet Stephanie Plum.  \nOver 50,000 Lacey Luzzi books are now in the hands of mystery readers!\n#1 Amazon Bestselling mystery series in Humor & Cozy Mystery categories  To try a Lacey Luzzi book for free, please sign up for my newsletter at www.ginalamanna.com",
