  "description": "One magical holiday. Some assembly required...  Police Chief Delaney Reed loves the holidays in Ordinary, Oregon, the beach town where gods vacation and monsters reside. But this year, she has a lot on her plate. It isn’t just the creature who follows her home, or the terrible storm barreling toward town. It isn't that Mrs. Yates’s penguin has been stolen. Again.  It’s that her boyfriend, Ryder Bailey, has been gone for two months and is growing more distant. She's beginning to think she knows why.  But when a demon, a dragon, and a god bearing unusual gifts get thrown on top of her to-do list, Delaney decides to roll up her sleeves and make this holiday unforgettable. One disaster at a time.",
