  "description": "While vacationing in South America with her father, young Renee Gorman soon realizes that her dyslexic qualities are the key to deciphering the clues in an old manuscript unlocking the powers of a mystical amulet. The symmetrical number or symbol \"512\" follows her everywhere, beckoning to be understood. Consequently, she attracts the attention of several unscrupulous characters who, hoping to profit from her discovery, chase her through a series of unnaturally carved tunnels that stretch from the ancient ruins of Tiahuanaco to the majestic peaks of Machu Picchu and eventually lead her to the legendary kingdom of Akakor, buried deep in the Amazon Rainforest. Along the way, she befriends a few travelers who help her evade capture and meets an Indian prince who might just be her true soul mate. Together, they unravel the secrets of a hidden world older than civilization itself, where the laws of quantum physics seem to transcend the boundaries we know here on earth. Document 512 delivers a combination of suspense, deceit, adventure, and intrigue that enlightens as it entertains, while making you question who we really are and where it is we come from. \"Document 512\" is a work of fiction. Many historical facts and descriptions of places were embellished upon or modified to fit in with the storyline. For more information, visit www.Document512.com.",
