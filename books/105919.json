The only problem in Lily's life is that she always dates lame, boring, passionless men. No one has ever brought her any adventure. No one gives her excitement, and after being cheated on by her last boyfriend, Lily is ready for a change.  A change is exactly what she finds when she meets Kelvin Carter Jr. Kelvin is everything Lily wants in a man: sexy, passionate, spontaneous, attractive, powerful, and the best sex she has ever had. He is perfect. But perfection comes with a price. Kelvin may be exactly what Lily is looking for, but he is also a branch on a Chicago mob's family tree and the son of a notorious mob boss. When the couple commences a heart-pounding, overwhelmingly sensual relationship, Lily must decide what she desires more; love and satisfaction, or her own safety.Erotic/Suspense/Romance. This book is intended for mature audiences.",
