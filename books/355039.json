  "title": "Precarious: Stories of Love, Sex, and Misunderstanding",
  "description": "The stories in PRECARIOUS are about doing the right thing and regretting it. About men who are still boys. About making bets and dancing naked.They play out in rain-soaked Seattle and drought-stricken California. In the front seat of Mom's Malibu and a vacation cabin on Cape Cod. On a tiny island and in a desert filled with light and heat and sand that slips through your fingers like friendships you once had.In these fifteen stories you will meet a boy trying to make it through that summer between the end of high school and the start of something else. A girl so alive you can feel her heartbeat from half a mile away. A woman attracted to a man with muscles, because it makes her feel safe ... until it doesn't.  A man who can only imagine what it's like to sleep with many different women, but that's OK -- he has a good imagination.In prose that is by turns spare and lyrical, the stories of  Precarious  capture the feeling of late summer. A never-ending game of Kick the Can. All sense of time lost among the stars.",
