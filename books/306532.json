  "description": "Killed in a traffic collision, the last thing Lana expected was to wake up under the gaze of two very confused aliens. They were expecting a tribute for the upcoming challenges and instead they got her. Refusing to be one female down, they stick Lana into the line-up, but when the challenges are over and the Warriors choose their females, she’s left unchosen. She understands why. All the other females have stars on their cheeks, emphasizing their blood purity. She’s unmarked, and in this world, it means her blood is weak, useless.Lana hopes she might be able to go home somehow—deceased status notwithstanding—seeing as no one wanted her, but Warrior Vall Ridian charges in late. He’s not impressed to be left with a starless female, but as the Administrator running the challenges informs him, shit blood’s better than no blood. It only takes one sip of Lana’s blood for Vall to realize that she’s not a starless female. In fact, her blood is the strongest he’s ever tasted.Lana is the key to unlocking the Warriors’ most sacred—and most sorely lost—treasure. With her, they will be able to transform into fully fledged dragons. It’s an incredible gift, but also a dangerous one, as Vall and the pack discover when Lana is stolen from them by a rival pack who have discovered who she is and what she can do. They’ll have to fight to get her back and then to keep her safe.",
