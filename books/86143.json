  "description": "The struggle between God and man, magic and indefinable evil is without recourse.Roedanth wants Peetra back, it doesn’t matter the boy is dead; he can’t stop wishing. Tainted by dark magic, tragedy and pain follows Roedanth from Crows Nest to Coowic where the Magi live.Tarkeenia is awash with life - man and beast live side by side. Monsters hunt the shadows looking for a bite to eat. The tip of balance between dark and light, good and evil is tenuous, even on a good day. Flesh eating Specks turn the living into dust, and the world is no longer safe. Murrdocks are a myth, and their King has been murdered. Prince Pec must turn myth into reality.Strangers become friends, uneasy alliances are tainted by betrayal and self-gain, and unlikely heroes emerge to salvage what they can from a world on the brink of chaos.All strive to make do in a world bubbling with wild magic, as the lives of man and monster hang in the balance. Can Tarkeenia survive the tug and pull of the very spoilt, and the very wicked? Can those lost to the dark find a way back to the light? Is it possible to forget, or to forgive and begin again? All these questions and more are answered as the reader walks Tarkeenia’s many paths.",
