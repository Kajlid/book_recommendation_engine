It explores a future history of Earth and pacifistic ideals in its depictions of violence, colonialism and resistance.A world of peaceful aliens conquered by bloodthirsty yumens, their existence is irrevocably altered. Forced into servitude, the Athsheans find themselves at the mercy of their brutal masters.Desperation causes the Athsheans to retaliate against their captors, abandoning their strictures against violence. In defending their lives, they endanger the very foundations of their society. Every blow against the invaders is a blow to the core of Athsheans' culture.And once the killing starts, there is no turning back.'A simple story that, like most things Le Guin wrote, packs a powerful emotional and critical punch' — Tordotcom'Deeply moving and shocking by turns' — Suzanne Reid'Le Guin writes in quiet, straightforward sentences about people who feel they are being torn apart by massive forces in society . . . and who fight courageously to remain whole' — The New York Times Book Review",
