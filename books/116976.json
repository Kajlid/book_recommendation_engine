  "description": "\"She killed me. Stabbed me, I think. I can't remember. I remember very little about the night I died.\"Lorenzo Lett is a Poltergeist, angry and brooding, trapped in a turn-of-the-century mansion called Brimfield with the ghost of his mother, who may or may not have killed him. That is until quirky maid, Mahoney Miller, has a catastrophic fall on the spiral staircase and becomes a ghost, too. An immediate connection sparks and the two embark on an afterlife neither expected, rarely paying attention to the living until the Kotilla family purchases the estate. When the two young daughters, Samara and Eleni, can see and hear them, their trajectory changes and the ghosts leave the shadows of their caskets to straddle the divide between the living and the dead.Eight years later, Samara becomes a teenage mother to a son with cystic fibrosis. Traumatized by his own death and unwilling to watch the people he loves suffer, Lorenzo must find Enoda, the spirit of an old witch who dwells in the woods, and beg her assistance, taking the ultimate leap of faith.But when souls unite to alter the will of Fate, there are complications and unforeseen consequences. The road forward is long and the path is dark. Can both the living and the dead, find their way forward with only sparks of light to guide them?",
