  "description": "Benson Bexley has always had a heart of stone.Apparently nothing has changed.When he returns home after a decade gone, I recognize him right away.How could I forget him?He’s the same cocky flirt who slid dirty poetry to me in art class.With the same stone-cold stare that shielded his soul from the world.And that same sharp-edged jaw that cut straight through my heart like a dagger.Fortunately, this time I see right through his arrogant charm.Even better, he doesn’t remember who I am.I have no intention of reminding him.After all, it’s only a matter of time until his nomadic lifestyle takes him away again.When his poetic charm strikes once more, I play along.Maybe it's time he got a taste of his own medicine.Revenge.It’s not in my nature.But Benson Bexley deserves nothing less.It’s time for that heart of stone to shatter.",
