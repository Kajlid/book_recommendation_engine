  "title": "Wulfe's Woman",
  "description": "Cat Kincade has vowed never to come within a light year of her husband again. Until a dying world's plea to the Corps for help places her on the same team captained by Wulfe Kincade, her estranged mate, the man who has done his utmost to destroy her. Wulfe Kincade can't believe Cat has the audacity to show up on his ship. He'd make a deal with the devil himself to be rid of the traitorous wench. A killer--perhaps more than one--stalks the corridors of the huge starcruiser. Each death brings the killer closer to Cat, and Cat closer to the horrifying truth. Only the re-ignited flame of their love and a perilous journey to find trust and the truth can save Cat, Wulfe, those they love, and the world they've pledged to save.",
