  "title": "Reaching for the Moon",
  "description": "Perfect for the 50th anniversary of the Moon landing in summer 2019! It’s been fifty years since Buzz Aldrin walked on the Moon. But the journey didn’t begin when he stepped on board Apollo 11 that fateful day in July 1969. It began the day he was born. This picture book is Buzz Aldrin's story, in his words. Wendell Minor's gorgeous paintings evoke the wonder of space exploration for young readers. Becoming an astronaut took more than education, discipline, and physical strength. It took years of determination and believing that any goal was possible—from riding a bike alone across the George Washington Bridge at age ten to making a footprint on the moon. We all have our own dreams. This is the story of how Buzz’s came true.",
