  "description": "A one-night stand with a single, widowed dad can change everything.  “What the f*ck have I done?” aren’t the first words you want to hear after a one-night stand. Yet that’s what he gave me.  Dallas Barnes is tall, dark, and handsome. He’s also scarred, rough, and broken down by burdens. A single dad. A widower. A lost soul.  We found each other in the back of a dark pub. He brought the whiskey. I brought the bad decisions. He called it a mistake. I vowed never to speak to him again.  That vow is broken with one test. Two pink lines have turned my life upside down. One night can change everything.",
