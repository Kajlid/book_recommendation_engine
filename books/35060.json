  "description": "I’m in Heaven is about a man who doesn't believe in God who dies and goes to heaven. Heaven is far from being most people’s vision of heaven - all sweetness and light and lazing about on a white cloud with angels playing harps - but something far, far different. Oh, and the Beatles are there. All of them, not just John and George. And Sir Michael Caine too. And Robert de Niro. And Jehovah's Witnesses don't like it at all.If you enjoyed reading I'm in Heaven I would really appreciate it if you were to recommended it to any of your friends who you think might like it.Terry Ravenscroft",
