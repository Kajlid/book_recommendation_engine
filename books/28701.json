  "description": "Most people in Aleksey Rider-Mikkelsen’s life would probably assert that at fifty honest living and sobriety were long overdue. But recovering in bed from the lingering after-effects of his leg injury, bored, in pain, and feeling entirely irrelevant, Aleksey doesn’t much care what Benjamin Rider-Mikkelsen thinks. He doesn’t appreciate the close monitoring either. Fortunately for Aleksey, therefore, the devil reliably makes mischief for idle hands with too much money. No one said he wasn’t allowed to buy an island, did they? Of course, he’s not planning to do anything nefarious in his new kingdom, but equally, Aleksey doesn’t expect such a thoughtless purchase to plunge them both into a nightmare of old allegiances that puts all his new promises to Ben to the ultimate test.",
