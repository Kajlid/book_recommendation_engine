  "description": "Detective Pete Gonzalvez knew from the start that the dead woman he and his partner, Tolya Kurchenko, discovered in a Manhattan apartment did not commit suicide. Pete knew her better than that. Mariela Comacho was the love of his life. The road to the truth winds through the slums of the Dominican Republic, the cold streets of Soviet Moscow, the hot sands of the Judean Hills, and into the dark clubs of New York City's underworld. They learn that Mariela was not merely murdered, but was the most recent victim of an international serial killer--a phantom from Tolya's past--and Karin Kurchenko, nine months pregnant, could be in his cold-blooded crosshairs. Forgiving Mariela Comacho, the second book in the Forgiving series, is AJ Sidransky at his best. A fast-paced thriller with witty, gritty dialogue and thoughtful perspective, its pages are rich with the engaging elements that continue to draw readers to Sidransky's unique prose.",
