  "description": "Book three in the popular Men of the Saddle series by beloved author Lori Copeland. Six years ago, Susanne McCord tricked Cass Claxton into marrying her in a shotgun wedding. They haven't seen each other since that day, but when they cross paths again, everything has changed. Susanne has mended her ways—at least some of them—and she needs Cass to help her transport nine orphans cross-country in a covered wagon. They drive each other crazy as they encounter challenges along the trail, but through it all they find themselves falling in love as well. Who would've thought that a maverick like Cass could actually succeed in winning Susanne's stubborn heart?",
