  "description": "The brothers were quite aware of the tale's magic attraction for children but they suspicioned something in them of a far deeper value. To Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm they were a strong and vital narrative of the Anglo-Saxon half-forgotten past. They wanted to rescue this their racial heritage. To recover these precious gems and restore them for posterity became their sacred task . . . To add even more to the book's appeal he has included sketches in pen-and-ink of several famous landmarks of the area as he made forays into the Land of Once Upon a Time and visited the places in Hesse associated with the stories beginning in 1956. His sketches illustrate effectively the quaintness and beauty of the old Post-and-Beam structures along what is now called The Fairy Tale Street that have undergone a splendid program of preservation to the great delight of the areas visitors. The author has combined Scripture Church history and secular history to unveil the hidden message so cleverly concealed within each of the stories he has chosen for this presentation which SNOW WHITE SLEEPING BEAUTY CINDERELLA HANSEL & GRETHEL JACK & THE BEANSTALK LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD SNOW WHITE & ROSE RED THE TWELVE BROTHERS THE ENCHANTED STAG THE FROG KING THE SEVEN RAVENS This book will give you a whole new concept of the fairy tales of your childhood.",
