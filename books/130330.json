  "title": "A Good Death",
  "description": "'A good death is better than a bad conscience,' said Sophie. 1983 – Georgie, Theo, Sophie and Helena – four disparate young Cambridge undergraduates, set out to scale Ausangate, one of the highest and most sacred peaks in the Andes. Seduced into employing the handsome and enigmatic Wamani as their guide, the four friends are initiated into the mystical but dangerous side of Peru travelling from Cuzco to the mountain, a journey that will shape their lives forever. 2013 – The secrets and betrayals of Ausangate still chafe at the bonds of friendship. A girls' weekend at a remote Fenland farmhouse is thrown into chaos by the arrival of Theo's new toyboy - an unwitting catalyst for pent-up rage, petty jealousies, and bitter recriminations. It's only a matter of time before the truth of Ausangate explodes, setting the women on a new and dangerous path. Sharply observant and darkly comic, HL Davis' debut novel is an elegant tale of murder, seduction, vengeance and the value of true friendship",
