So along with my only friend, I ran.Running away turned out to be the best thing that ever happened to me.  I finally found where I belong and a family I didn’t know existed. But they found me, and now they want to take that from me too. They'll learn soon enough exactly how protective a phoenix really is of who they love. DarrenI don't know what I expected to find when I set off searching for Sophia, but tethered in a cage was not it. They want to use me to get Sophia back but if these mages think that my family will trade one member for another they’re in for a big surprise. We don't give up on each other.  I'm probably going to die in this cage, but it's better than her.. right?",
