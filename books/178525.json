  "description": "Anybody could buy a Rolex or a Cadillac. The real bling of the day was privately chartered airplanes. Kimber C. Turner pulls back the curtain on a thirty year career in aviation with his unique style of humor and story telling. Captain Turner’s tales of adventurous travel to exotic locales and encounters with celebrities prompted one reader to quote, “He’s been everywhere, met everyone and done everything. He’s like the Forrest Gump of aviation.” Kimber C. Turner is a retired airline pilot with over 18,000 hours of flight time and a former radio talk show host. Now he is out of the sky and off of the air. In his retirement, Captain Turner does some voice over work and an occasional guest spot on the radio. He also writes a book now and then.",
