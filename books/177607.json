  "description": "Bryant wasn't trying to trick his best friend. He really wasn't. If Cade had somehow gotten the impression that the Fated Date Agency had put him in touch with a beautiful female shifter, it wasn't Bryant's fault. On the other hand, Bryan definitely wasn't going to tell him the truth.  Honesty was not an option when Cade was this straight. Cade would never feel the magnetic attraction between them. And because he'd never feel the same as Bryant felt, he couldn't find out they were supposed to be together. All Bryant could do was try to drive Cade away - even if that meant driving him into the arms of a willing woman.  Before he let Cade go, though, Bryant was determined to have just one night with his fated mate.  Omega's Struggle is a steamy 60-page paranormal gay romance story and the second part of the Fated Dates trilogy.",
