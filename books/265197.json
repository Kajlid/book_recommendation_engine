  "description": "She thinks she knows this player…  Why does my future depend on Dan McMullen, of all people? I’ve been working my butt off at the clinic, with the ultimate goal of making partner. Now it seems that goal depends on this one assignment. Yes, our relationship happened ten years ago, but my heart still winces when I think about him. He was my first love after all. But I’m older and wiser now, and I won’t let anything stand in the way of snagging my promotion. Not even one sexy player who thinks we’re going to kiss and make up.  …but he’s full of surprises.  Back in college, I loved two things… Sabrina Kelly and baseball. The baseball has worked out great. Sabrina, not so much. I know I broke her heart, but I’m not that guy anymore. I’ve wanted to reach out to her for years, but it was never the right time. Busting my knee may keep me off the field this season, but it’s also given me the chance to get her back into my life. Sure it’s just as my physical therapist, but that’s a start. Now that she's here, I just have to convince her to give me another chance.  On the Mend is the first book in a steamy new baseball series. If you like hot athletes, sizzling romance, and second chances you’ll love the first installment of the Carolina Waves series.",
