  "title": "Elizabite: Adventures of a Carnivorous Plant [with Audio Cassette]",
  "description": "Elizabite is a carnivorous plant who eats insects as appetizers and enjoys hot dogs for snacks. Whether it walks, talks, flies, or barks, Elizabite is ready to make a meal of it. In an effort to control her diet and her temper, the unpredictable plant is chained and muzzled! Only when her unique appetite prevents a crime does Elizabite win the respect she deserves. H. A. Rey (1898–1977) claimed never to have seen as spirited and hungry a plant as Elizabite, but he believed that a carnivorous plant of Elizabite’s type and temper might be encountered somewhere, someday . . . H. A. Rey and his wife, Margret, created the beloved Curious George. Another original and unforgettable H. A. Rey story is now packaged and recorded for a new generation of readers. The professionally narrated audio production includes lively sound effects and original music. Side one includes page-turn signals; side two features an uninterrupted reading.",
