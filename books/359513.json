  "description": "A thief who becomes a dragon rider…After surviving two years in the castle dungeons for a crime she didn’t exactly commit, a stroke of luck allows Corrine Darrow a second chance at freedom. During the Bonding Celebrations—the one time each year when wild dragons find their riders—Rin is given the opportunity to petition her case. But her hopes are quickly dashed when she is brought before the queen’s ruthless spymaster—the very dragon rider who captured her in the first place. When Rake’s intense gaze locks on her once more, Rin is sure he will send her back to her cell. But before her future can be decided, fate intercedes. Now, Rin must train to become a dragon rider, one of the fierce warriors who protect her world. That won’t be easy with Rin’s thieving reputation, the fellow trainees that mistrust her, and the fiery attraction she feels towards a man she should despise.",
