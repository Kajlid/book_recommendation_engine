  "description": "Alexandra's family kept a huge secret from her for 21 years. A secret that is now opening her eyes to a weird reality and flipping her life upside down. Not that her life was looking that bright to begin with, but if she had known, she would have been prepared when actual trolls start trying to abduct her so the ancient vampire Master can use her to take control of the human world. Now, even with a whole army of fae hunters at her back, plus a certain sword-wielding, aggravatingly gorgeous, fae at her side, she will have to fight her own demons, old and new, if she wants to save what little family she has left plus, you know, all the rest of the human race. No pressure though.Contains course language and violence.Librarian's note: See alternate cover edition of ASIN B07B4QMF28 here.",
