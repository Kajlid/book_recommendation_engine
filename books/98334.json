  "title": "The Deserter of Alamut",
  "description": "The character of a man is influenced more strongly by the manner of his upbringing than the formal education he receives later in life. Just as there are exceptions to every general belief, so too there are exceptionally audacious men who constantly re-examine their beliefs and broaden their outlook on life. All such exceptional men deserve to be extolled for their audacity in dislodging the props from their conventional dogma, yet not all should be held in equal esteem. Those who could have been easily absolved of not exhibiting exceptional traits, despite their intrinsic inclination, on account of having understandable emotional burden should be held in the highest esteem. Such men deserve to have their stories told.Set in the 12th century Iran, when assassins of Alamut are the most feared secret militia fighting the ruling Seljuqs and the caliph in Baghdad, The Deserter of Alamut tells the story of such a man.",
