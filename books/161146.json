  "title": "Blood Moon Over Africa",
  "description": "A gripping novel set in Africa, a place where superstition and witchcraft runs deep, a place of beauty, but where death can lurk in the shadows.A land shrouded in mystery, with ancient beliefs simmering beneath the surface set on a collision course with modern western ideas.Blood Moon deals with how an innocent act unleashes a horror that walks the African night, under the full moon, and nothing and nobody is safe.Something that is set in motion by the utterance of a single curse, something that should not even walk in your worst nightmares, walks in these pages, and is waiting to greet you under the Blood Moon.",
