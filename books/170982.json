  "description": "Opposites ignite… Champion stock car driver Brody Palmer's bad-boy reputation has forced him into early retirement. What no one knows is that his \"retirement\" is actually a publicity stunt. All Brody has to do is clean up his act and settle down. Unfortunately, every single woman with a pulse is now gunning to become the new Mrs. Palmer. Hannah Morgan needs to shake things up, and Brody is the best way to do just that. So they strike a deal-a fake relationship…with all of the sexy strings included! Brody gets his improved image, and Hannah gets a whole lot more of Brody's unpredictable wildness. Hot days, hotter nights-it's the perfect plan! Provided, of course, they don't do something to wreck it, like fall for each other…",
