  "description": "Salvador Resendez--Salva to his friends--seems to have it all. He's Student Body president, captain of the football team, and has a near-perfect GPA. Everyone thinks that he could have any girl, and go to any college, that he wants. But how could he ever leave his family? After the death of this mother, his father and younger sisters need him more than ever. Then the most unlikely girl in school--shy, quiet Beth--catches his eye, and with her help, Salva starts to see things differently. And when a tragic accident strikes, Salva is forced to accept that life is too short not to pursue your dreams. Thoughtful and romantic, this is a beautifully written story about following your heart and fulfilling your potential.",
