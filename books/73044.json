  "description": "When London gets a work transfer to San Francisco, he suspects that this city will be just like any other. He'll live and breathe for his job, and heaven help who gets in his way. But when London gets introduced to the band Crushing Abram, his world gets flipped upside down. He never expects that he'll lose his head over the lead singer, Gabriel, who makes it clear that he has no interest in men since day one.",
