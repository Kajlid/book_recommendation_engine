  "description": "When an injured boy with unusual markings on his face appears in a blast of fire, Kila, a 16 year old outcast due to her cat ears, and her best friend, Talrod, save the stranger’s life. Could Stratus’ arrival be the opportunity Kila has been hoping for to improve her life? Or will leaving with him risk what little security she has? After the promise that Kila will be reunited with her father during the journey, she and Talrod agree to help Stratus, who hasn’t been totally honest in his motives. Kila’s future is now linked to a lost queen, a blind assassin, dragons, and the stars that watch over them all.",
