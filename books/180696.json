  "description": "He was sure those golden eyes would be the last thing he'd see.  Paranormal writer Dakota Brooks can't stop fantasizing about the man he desires most – his sexy and mysterious older stepbrother, Dalton. Ever since his mother married Dalton's father when Dakota was a geeky teen, Dakota has been yearning to get close to him. He never pursued the hunky Dalton for fear of what it would do to the huge extended family he now has, but beneath the glow of the full moon, sparks begin to fly.  Dalton Summers can't trust himself around Dakota. He always thought his younger stepbrother was gorgeous and smart, the whole package, but he's strictly off-limits. Not only is Dakota his stepbrother – and he stubbornly ignores the fact that they barely know each other – but Dakota's human. He's always kept his distance to hide his feelings, but finally, fate intervenes at a family reunion.  When Dakota lands himself in trouble in the deep Maine woods, Dalton saves him and is forced to reveal what he truly is. One night of discovery isn't enough for either of them, but Dalton knows he still isn't free to pursue Dakota. Older and stronger forces are at work, upheaving their lives as they realize that being stepbrothers is the least of their problems.  Stepbrother Wolf is the first steamy paranormal gay romance novel in the ongoing \"Stepmates\" series.",
