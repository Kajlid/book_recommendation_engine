  "title": "Queer (In)Justice: The Criminalization of LGBT People in the United States",
  "description": "A groundbreaking work that turns a “queer eye” on the criminal legal system, and winner of the 2011 PASS (Prevention for a Safer Society) Award from the National Council on Crime and Delinquency Drawing on years of research, activism, and legal advocacy, Queer (In)Justice is a searing examination of queer experiences--as \"suspects,\" defendants, prisoners, and survivors of crime. The authors unpack queer criminal archetypes--like \"gleeful gay killers,\" \"lethal lesbians,\" \"disease spreaders,\" and \"deceptive gender benders\"--to illustrate the punishment of queer expression, regardless of whether a crime was ever committed. Tracing stories from the streets to the bench to behind prison bars, the authors prove that the policing of sex and gender both bolsters and reinforces racial and gender inequalities. A groundbreaking work that turns a \"queer eye\" on the criminal legal system, Queer (In)Justice illuminates and challenges the many ways in which queer lives are criminalized, policed, and punished.",
