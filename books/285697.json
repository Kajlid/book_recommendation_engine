As a casting director, my job is to find the most talented players for every part, so I choose dreamy, edgy, sexy, sarcastic Reeve.And I sign him up for one week in the role of mine.It's not as if I'll fall for him in five nights even if we get a little cozy one night at theater. It's not as if I'll want more even after a scorching afternoon in the stacks of the New York Public Library.  I can't let myself fall because on Friday at midnight the curtain drops on our fake romance . . . The Pretending Plot is a reimagining of the 2013 story Pretending He's Mine (no longer available for sale).
