Her parents force her to marry another cousin, twice her age, a selfish, abusive criminal involved in arms’ sales and gang rapes. Ten years later, Hana’s life changes dramatically when Farook opens a clinic next door. “Against a backdrop of things unimaginable by the Western mind, the author takes us on a journey of intrigue, passion and danger. Death lurks in every corner, in every whisper, in every kiss.” — Sherrill Wark, crowecreations.ca “When you begin to read this novel, you will not stop for one moment, enticed by the versatility of the writer in crafting its plot with tact and skill. As a woman of Yemeni origin, I wish to thank Dr. Qais Ghanem for his courage in exposing the reality of Yemen in this and his two other Final Flight from Sanaa and Two Boys from Aden College.” — Tahani Shihab",
