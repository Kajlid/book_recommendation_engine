  "description": "THE WARRIOR MAIDS OF RIVENLOCH…Damsels in shining armor…riding to the rescue!Deirdre, Helena, and Miriel, three kick-arse Scots wenches, aren’t about to become any man’s chattel, until they meet heroes who are strong enough to tame their wild ways and worthy enough to win their wayward hearts.Miriel of Rivenloch may not have the killer instincts of her older sisters, but she’s keeping a dangerous secret. She knows more than she’s letting on about the mysterious Shadow, the forest outlaw who robs from the rich and gives to the poor. And when devil-may-care mercenary Sir Rand la Nuit, hot on the trail of The Shadow, claims to be in love with Miriel, she knows he’s hiding something, too. It’s a battle of wits as they race to uncover each other’s secrets before their make-believe romance takes on a life of its own.",
