  "title": "Glass House",
  "description": "We live in a large bio-dome with limited resources, a finite capacity for abuse and neglect and just enough room for a certain number of creatures. Essentially, Earth is one big glass house. As any gardener knows, glass houses are fragile and take a lot of work to look after. You need the right balance of warmth and water, just the right amount of fertilizer and soil and a whole lot of time and care. If we are all gardeners, and Earth is our glass house, then we have certainly neglected her. This Earth is our home and the people and animals and plants on it are our collective responsibility. For the most part we have failed to be responsible, not only to the planet and the creatures living on it, but to each other. Through wars, greed and an insatiable appetite for fossil fuels, we have all but destroyed much of what was beautiful and unique. We are on the brink of what may prove to be the most broadly felt catastrophe in history and it is all our own doing. This is not a lecture, but rather an examination of what has gone wrong and the reality of the world we now live in, as told in verse and in story. It is my sincere believe and hope that you will read these words and understand the heart, the very soul of the matter.",
