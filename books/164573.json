  "description": "Mila Laut, a young librarian, feels empty. Even her constant unnerving confrontations with her ex-boyfriend Alex can’t ignite the spark anymore. She thirsts for more, for passion, for… magic. She thirsts for someone to remind her she’s worthy. And then she meets Adam Tichy.Sad eyes, chiseled body, wet, tousled hair, the most striking sight of a man one could ever imagine. The moment Mila lays eyes on him she feels a mysterious need to be with him, to do anything to please him, to risk and sacrifice everything just to feel the electric, sparkling sensation of their touch again.They begin a passionate love relationship but Mila is well aware that something dark is haunting Adam. Their peculiar first encounter at a funeral, the strange sparkling touch of his skin, the endless pouring rain that hasn’t stopped ever since they met—he has secrets and he doesn’t deny that or the fact he’s not prepared to reveal much. He believes he’s not good enough for her and even declares he’s dangerous for her. But by that time Mila is in too deep. She ignores her inner voice and the alarming bubbly feeling she rediscovers with her ex-boyfriend/new friend, and surrenders to whatever may come.In the end, the secret that is clouding their relationship is revealed and Mila, who has by now learned to take the shocking bits of truth, is determined she can deal with it. But, can she really?",
