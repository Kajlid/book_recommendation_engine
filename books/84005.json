  "description": "This book is an most unusual and extraordinary anthology of mystical, sci-fi, and spiritual lyrics, songs and poetry which Michelina has originated over years of writing and performing. Most of the poems/lyrics contained herein have musical arrangements which were sung and played by Michelina, when she performed on stage as The Forecaster. The eloquent and insightful lyrics and poetry invite the reader/listener to step beyond their everyday awareness through a portal of infinity wherein dwells other realms and dimensions of timeless time and the deep voids of space. It is in this interval of time and eternity one meets oneself for the final and the first time, Heart to heart and mind to mind we meld... come join the song.",
