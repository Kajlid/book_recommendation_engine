  "title": "Forty-Something Phoenix: A Travel Memoir",
  "description": "Following her wildly popular memoir trilogy, Marlayna now shares lessons learned in six months traveling through fourteen countries. Readers will find hope in this true story that teaches the wisdom of creating and receiving miracles on a journey of self-discovery by saying “Yes.”Marlayna had been a single parent for fifteen years when she felt she had nothing left of herself to give. Drained and empty, she writes, \"I'd reached a point in my life where something had to give, and it could no longer be me.\" In Forty-Something Phoenix, she discovers how passion can arise unexpectedly from the ashes of one life to craft another. This memoir redefines the love story; illustrating how self-acceptance and self-love can be renewed when exploring the disparities, similarities, histories, loves and losses in other cultures.“Reading a Marlayna Glynn Brown memoir is like watching a high speed train picking up speed, as it careens towards a collision with an oncoming train. In this case, the heroine (Marlayna) jumps to safety seconds before the inevitable collision. It's nearly impossible to stop watching. Marlayna's personality is a fascinating mixture of vulnerability, sincerity, optimism, self reflection, sexiness, and humbleness. She is the ultimate underdog. She picks herself up and dusts herself off after another of a series of failed romances and friendships.I would highly recommend reading her prior memoirs. It will assist in putting her latest in the proper perspective.” John L.",
