  "description": "Andi Kelly is looking forward to a weekend of uninhibited sex and turning over control to a dominant man for just two days. She's headed to what patrons refer to as \"The Bondage Club,\" an exclusive resort catering to those who live the lifestyle of, or wish to experience, BDSM. What she never expects is to meet the man of her dreams-who just happens to be her fellow Vice President of the investment firm she works for, Derrick Macintyre. Derrick has had his eye on Andi for as long as she's worked at the investment firm. When he learns she's planning a weekend at his favorite club, he ensures that she ends up as his sub-and he intends to make her his, for always.",
