  "description": "I’m Denny Smith.  I moved away to my Nan’s house after my parents happily kicked me out.  Why, you ask? Because I ruined my future, so they say.  If you ask me, I was a naive seventeen year-old girl who chose to sleep with the boy she had loved from afar for years, only for him to want nothing to do with me in return.  So here I am, back at the one place I had hoped to never return, where I’ll attend court as a witness.  Now I have to face him...Mason.  There’s no other way around it.  He can’t know my secret...but he will.  When I returned, I expected him to have moved on with at least a million and one other girls, to have forgotten the naive school girl with a crush that followed him around like a lost puppy, but I was wrong.  What I got when I arrived was five brothers, a Granddad, a pushy Grandma, and a best friend who would stop at nothing to make me stay.  But only one of them has the power to make me stay...Mason.  After everything, can I truly trust him again or will he continue to break my heart?  If you mess with one Carter brother, you mess with them all    Malik (Carter Brother series #1) should be read before reading Mason.",
