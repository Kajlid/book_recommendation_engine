  "title": "Psychological DNA: A Cold Case Analysis of Who Killed Robert F. Kennedy",
  "description": "It has been more than fifty years since presidential hopeful Robert F. Kennedy, RFK, was murdered at the fashionable Ambassador Hotel in L.A. only five years after his brother John F. Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas. The alleged shooter who gunned down RFK, the man with an odd name, Sirhan Bishara Sirhan, (Sirhan) a twenty-four-year old Palestinian was apprehended at the scene of the crime with the smoking gun still in his hand leading to the conclusion that this seemingly was an open and shut case, or was it? Subsequently, Sirhan was tried and convicted of first-degree murder though his appointed defense team stitched together a poorly formed, modified insanity defense complicated by many unforced errors made by attorneys and expert psychologists and internationally known psychiatrist, Dr. Bernard Diamond. In PSYCH DNA, Dr. Brady who was immersed in the case from the beginning using modern criminological methods and new psychological assessment tools not available five decades ago has reassessed Sirhan' s mental state arriving at five current mental conditions that, in his opinion, if presented at trial could have changed the jury' s verdict and spared Sirhan a trip to San Quentin' s death row. What follows is Dr. Brady chronicling an amazing journey into the darkest recesses of Sirhan' s unconscious, altered mind where homicidal thoughts had percolated for years. At long last, Sirhan' s criminal mystery wrapped in a psychological enigma is unraveled helping us understand the psychodynamics of a would-be assassin.",
