  "title": "The DNA of Democracy",
  "description": "Discerning the future of democracy begins with understanding its past. In this historical and telling guide, Richard C. Lyons documents the rise and fall of political power across time and place. Chronicling a wide range of governments and rulers, he outlines past democracies, tyrants, and kings while providing a comprehensive look at their successes and failures. Warfare and corruption mark democracy as a historical work in progress, but never a hopeless one. Just as DNA is woven into every aspect of the human body, countries, city-states, and rulers are the DNA that have shaped democracy today. From Israel’s Ten Commandments and Greece’s city-states to Italy’s Twelve Tables and the crowns of the British Isles, Lyons traces democracy from its historical roots to modern day, constructing a blueprint for successful government and leadership in The DNA of Democracy.",
