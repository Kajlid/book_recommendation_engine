  "description": "The Big Sugarbush is a lesbian romantic comedy, set in a drug rehab center in Vermont. Ten wealthy lesbians have thirty days to get their lives on track and their careers re-rolling. Sugarbush, a gay rehab center for LGBT women, seems just the place, quiet and therapeutic, until the dykes arrive, and the drama begins. The Big Sugarbush is a feel good romantic romp that chronicles the hilariously intertwined love lives and romantic interludes of an ensemble cast of high-achieving women, including a British Pop Music diva, a writer of bodice-ripping best-selling romance novels for heterosexual housewives, a stud muffin pair of Olympic snowboarding twins (one of whom is on the fast train to Trannytown), a femme plastic surgeon, a LGBTQ political activist who is a pain-in-the-ass to today’s fun loving queers, a Wall Street bond maven, a gun-toting CNN war correspondent, a spoiled Senator’s daughter, and a tomboy installation artist whose signature sculptures include such provocative works as a giant-sized “Big Pink Pussy”, modeled on her own genitalia. Love and humor abound as the women of Sugarbush struggle to stay away from drugs, alcohol, and intoxicating late night booty calls. Getting sober has never been so much fun.",
