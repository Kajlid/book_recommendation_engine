  "description": "Ben Templesmith (30 Days of Night, Singularity 7, Fell) creates an all-eerie and humorous new series. Things are awakening in the city. Things that have a nasty habit of leaving mutilated bodies in their wake and it all reeks of demons and dark gods up to no good. Owing a favor to his lazy ghost cop buddy Trotsky, Wormwood, the gentleman corpse and his oddball entourage are brought in to investigate the case (or at least hopefully not stuff it up too much.) This collection compiles the first miniseries (issues #1-4), the original \"Taster\" issue, and covers, sketches, pin-ups and other cocktail napkin scribblings from Templesmith.",
