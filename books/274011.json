  "description": "All of her life, Skye Carmichael has wondered about the parents that abandoned her at a hospital in New York. With nothing to go on but an odd birthmark on her wrist, she's almost thirty-five and no closer to knowing who they might have been until one fateful encounter leads her to a tiny town in the middle of Montana. The answers she finds are definitely not the ones she was expecting and will change her life in ways that she couldn't have imagined.  Rory Abbot, and his small pack of wolf shifters have been trying to figure out a life after their exile. For the last sixty years, he's been working law enforcement in the tiny town of Belcrest, Montana; a small town that's almost entirely comprised of supernatural residents.

Rory and his packmates have no idea, but Skye is about to change their world; forever.
