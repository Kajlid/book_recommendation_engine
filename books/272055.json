  "description": "Sheriff Caradac has found his man. As he sighted his rifle muzzle over the broad, muscular body of his unsupecting victim, he realized there was no other man in the west like him, and for a moment he hesitated. Then, almost automatically, he lifted his gun and shifted his left foot a big forward. As he fired he felt a stone turn beneath him, and even before his finger fell away from the trigger, he knew he had missed. From that miss there grew one of the most extraordinary relationships those green, snow-capped mountains had ever seen. Sheriff and bad man, a strange friendship, yet one which took them both on a trail of high adventure, a trail which led at least through a hidden hole in the mountain to an amazing discovery and a certain rancher's daughter.",
