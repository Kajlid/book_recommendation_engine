  "description": "The book was developed after working with over 500 cancer patients and organizing 3 international symposiums on the subject. The information contained in BCN is both scientifically backed with references and clinically proven in the hospital with patients. This information helps cancer patients to improve quality and quantity of life. BCN had been translated into Japanese and Chinese and is being translated into Korean. BCN had become a home study continuing education course for registered nurses. BCN 2001 version will contain a 72-minute audio CD version in response to the requests from tired cancer patients who said they needed and audio version of the book to get started. BCN had sold 110,000 copies in 7 years in print, which is impressive for small publishers.",
