  "description": "The kingdom of Mesanda is embroiled in civil war... High Lord Shorid of Malktown has risen against his brother King Marnol, conquering the entire south in less than a year. With armies growing stronger every day, he has now set his sights north, ever closer to Caposia—Mesanda's capital and the king's home city. For now, Marnol can breathe relief after his army manages to defeat an enemy force in the northwest. Danio, a soldier in the king's army, has survived the battle and is now returning home: to Caposia, to his wife and daughter. However, a fate worse than falling in battle awaits him within the safety of the capital, as he inadvertently stumbles upon a treasonous plan leading to deceit, danger, tragedy, and—ultimately—a quest for vengeance.",
