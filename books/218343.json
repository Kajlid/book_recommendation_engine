  "description": "How do you breathe when you are drowning in the dark?  Charlie:  I had my life planned out... the perfect plan. The one that was supposed to bring me success and happiness, except that never happened. I never got the chance to follow it before my world was turned inside out and my bright shining future was drenched in a seemingly endless darkness that threatened to consume the girl I once was.  Andrew:  Ten years ago I made a mistake. One that follows me around and torments me; the guilt eating away at me bit by bit. I was living in the dark, constantly drowning in regret and loss, and I couldn't breathe... until her. She showed me that I can smile again, that my mistakes don't have to dictate the person I become, but can two broken people make each other whole?  This is book 1 of 2 in the Fading to light duet, but it can be read as a complete STANDALONE with a Happily Ever After. Book two in the series, \"From the Dark\" is coming soon! DUE TO STRONG LANGUAGE AND SEXUAL CONTENT, THIS BOOK IS INTENDED FOR MATURE READERS ONLY.",
