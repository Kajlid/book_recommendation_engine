Me.I had one goal, just one teensy-weensy simple goal—to figure out what happened to my dad. All I had to do was head out to his cabin in the woods, look for clues, and figure out how and why he died then go home to the city where I belong.Except I’m a kindergarten teacher, not a detective. Of course everything goes wrong, and my first night there I end up with Liam, Christian, Athos, and Nix refusing to leave my side. They think I might be in danger, but they won’t tell me why. Their eyes hold the secrets of the wild, and who am I to deny their need to keep me safe? Especially when their touch eases something foreign inside of me.Then I discover my dad was murdered, but no one can figure out why.Not to mention those hotties? Yeah, they grow fur and want me to Surrender to them.",
