  "description": "\"Fuck.\" I slam my fist into the desk before me and feel nothing but rage. I need to go after her. I need to explain. \"But isn't this what you wanted?\" The voice inside my head whispers. \"Isn't this a nice easy way out?\"Everything Max has done has always been at a cost to others around him. He wasn't about to make that mistake again. No longer will his selfish ways punish those close to him. Sometimes it's better to have had and lost than to never have had at all. Finally after what felt like forever, Jess was getting a glimpse of control over her life again and allowed her defences to come crashing down, only to have what it guarded to be crushed once again. Now, on the other side of the world away from her friends, she doesn't know what to do. Should she stay or should she go? Is it too late or have they both fallen too far into something that is completely out of their depths?",
