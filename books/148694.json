Jadyn St. James hopes that the two-week quiet period in Mudbug means things in the small bayou town are back to normal…whatever that is. But when a fisherman finds a sunken shrimp boat, and the boat captain is missing, Jadyn wonders if the damage to the boat was caused by a storm, or if something far more nefarious happened. Colt Bertrand has been fighting his attraction to the sexy game warden since he first laid eyes on her.
