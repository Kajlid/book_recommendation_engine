  "description": "Shoggoth Apocalypse presents Lovecraftian tales of the grotesque, teeming with eldritch monstrosities from beyond the far-flung boundaries of time and space. The title tale reveals the ultimate destiny of the shoggoths, protoplasmic creatures with an insatiable hunger for raw flesh. In \"The Curse Of The Tillinghasts,\" a sequel to Lovecraft's \"From Beyond,\" a high-tech corporation strives to revive the accursed invention of Crawford Tillinghast. \"In The Chapel Of Ghattambah\" unveils a web of treachery, spun by the disciples of a ghastly insect-god. \"This Pulsing Mass That Serves As My Heart\" tells of an office romance that turns into a ghoulish encounter with an ancient horror. In the days of the Pharaohs, mummified worshippers of Azathoth go on a savage rampage against the living in \"The Colossus In The Catacombs.\"",
