  "description": "He’s going to give her the Christmas gift of her dreams…in triplicate.When Justin Garrett accidentally views Amy Parker’s private online journal, he sees the cold corporate exec in a brand new light. It seems the icy, unapproachable Amy has fantasies. Fantasies that both appall and intrigue her.No one knows the real Amy Parker, and she’s satisfied to keep it that way. A woman with kinky tastes wouldn’t cut it in the straight-laced law firm where she’s fought her way to partnership. And she certainly refuses to let an underling use her to advance in the firm. Justin Garrett might be brilliant, gorgeous, and sexy as hell, but he’s firmly restricted to her fantasies and that’s where he’ll stay.While working together on a corporate acquisition in Hawaii over the Christmas holidays, Justin sets out to make Amy’s secret fantasy come true—a night of passion with two men who adore her. And he knows the ideal other man to help Amy unwrap the perfect Christmas gift.But first he has to melt her heart and convince her he sees her as a woman, not a rung to climb on the career ladder. In fact, by giving Amy exactly what she’s always wished for, Justin hopes to climb right into her heart.Warning:This title contains the following: explicit sex, graphic language, menage a trois, a trip to Hawaii and maybe a glimpse of Santa on a surfboard.\"",
