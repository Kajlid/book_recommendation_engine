  "description": "Steven Porter's successes are as rugged and powerful as he is. He owns Hollywood, but no woman has ever owned him. During a business trip to Las Vegas, he becomes lost in Moira's siren eyes. Moira Viterra is a matriarch of the sea. Working with ship captains and gnarly mariners, she won't let any man command her. But she can't control the forces that keep her a recluse. It's going to take Steven an ocean full of seduction to lure Poseidon's daughter. When synchronicity and irony join hands to box him into a corner, Steven has to hide his identity from Moira. When he finds out Moira's coveting her own secret, Steven's faced with a decision that endangers his life, not just his heart.",
