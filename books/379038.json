  "description": "The setting is Hong Kong, 1963. The action spans scarcely more than a week, but these are the days of high adventure: from kidnapping and murder to financial double-dealing and natural catastrophes  fire, flood, and landslide. Yet they are days filled as well with all the mystery and romance of Hong Kong  the heart of Asia  rich in every trade... money, flesh, opium, power.",
