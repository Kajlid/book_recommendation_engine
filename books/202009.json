  "description": "Listening Length - 16 hours and 56 minutes'When it’s a question of money, everybody is of the same religion.'The trajectories of Arvind and Arbaaz, both ‘businessmen’ of a kind whose lives are unwillingly intertwined, ricochet off one another while they play out their sinister and murderous plots of personal and professional one-upmanship, all the while breaking every rule in the book.Both are unaware that what they seek and fight over is the very obstacle in realising an ancient secret that dates back to a time long forgotten.And yet, at the heart of it all, there lies tenderness... and pathos... and blood... and rare moments of almost exalted happiness. So, can it be that a man is both sinner and saint, victor and victim, black and white?Ashwin Sanghi, master storyteller, and spinner of yarns weave together threads of the past and present, fact and fiction, history and mythology, business and politics, love and hatred while dangling you ceaselessly over the cliff with this chilling multi-layered narrative, keeping you guessing till a totally unguessable end.And you’re left wondering whether it's a matter of faith... or fate?",
