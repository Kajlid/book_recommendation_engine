  "description": "Robin Bailey has recently turned eighteen, but instead of applying to university, finding a summer job or hanging out with her best friend Aaron, she’s been kidnapped. She’s not alone; all of the women over the age of eighteen have been kidnapped and forced into the breeding program that has taken over North America. Disgusted by the program and its practices, Robin is determined to hate everything about it, from her fancy hotel room to Cameron, the young man who is supposed to get her pregnant. Hating Cameron isn’t easy, though, and soon she finds herself falling for him. Even with Cameron by her side, Robin cannot ignore the harsh truths of the program. Her friend is being abused. Her other friend is forced to part with her newborn baby. Worst of all, one of the founders of the program has set his sights on Robin and is determined to make her his. She knows she needs to escape, but the idea seems impossible. After all, where is a girl to hide in a world that’s run by men?",
