  "title": "The Clocksmith (Brigardine)",
  "description": "Peter Barrow was a Clocksmith, and as such, most people viewed him with a superstitious wariness, for the power of the clocks, though forbidden to common folk, was well-known to all. That was exactly as he wanted it, though; the less people in his life, the better. However, this solitude was not destined to last. His troubles started with the suspicious disappearance of his father. All that was left behind was a mountain of unpaid debts and a mysterious pocket watch. The former of the two was taken care of quickly, though not without pain; Peter sold his house to Rebecca Tin, the mildly obsessive daughter of the famous inventor George Tin, and moved into little more than a shack. The watch, on the other hand, proved to be much more of an issue. Unlike all other clocks, there was no way to invoke it, and its power was unknown. When Peter crossed paths with an ex-soldier by the name of Nolan Levinson, he was whisked away to the capital on the promise that he would discover his father’s fate. But while there, he was pulled unwillingly into a web of intrigue. His father’s disappearance proved to be even more unusual than he had suspected, and the Paragons, the rulers of the Clocksmiths, were determined to take the pocket watch from him, regardless of what the cost may be.",
