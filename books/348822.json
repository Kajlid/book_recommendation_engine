  "description": "Hee-So’s devotion to Won-Jun is so major that she’s willing to go to great lengths to make him happy. This time, she decides to go against the tide of popular (female) opinion at school by siding with Sae-Bom against the girls who hate her. Doing this even alienates her from her best friend, Nam-Joo, but while Hee-So is many things, she’s no quitter, and she has no intention of giving up on either Sae-Bom or Nam-Joo! However, when the dirty tricks reach fever pitch, will Hee-So’s determination be enough to get her out of a potentially fatal situation? Or will she need a little magic on her side?!",
