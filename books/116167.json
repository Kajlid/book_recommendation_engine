  "description": "Cenora Rose O'Neill knows her father somehow arranged the trap for Dallas, but she agrees to wed the handsome stranger. She'd do anything to protect her family, and she wants to save herself from the bully Tom Williams. A fine settled man like Dallas will rid himself of her soon enough, but at least she and her family will be safely away from Tom Williams. Texas rancher Dallas McClintock has no plans to wed for several years. Right now, he's trying to establish himself as a successful horse breeder. Severely wounded rescuing Cenora from kidnappers, Dallas is taken to her family's wagon to be tended. He is trapped into marrying Cenora, but he is not a man who goes back on his word. Ah, but what is he to do with a wife and her wild Irish family?",
