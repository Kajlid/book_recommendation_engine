  "description": "Ghost hunter Lisa McGarrity can't understand what's gotten into the undead recently. Ectoplasm-flinging spirits and ghouls with grudges seem to be coming out of the woodwork, and she's been run ragged trying to calm the unusually outraged spirits. Tired of dealing with the disgruntled dead, Lisa is determined to take a break from all things metaphysical. So when the mysterious and sexy Trevarr appears on her doorstep requesting her assistance in an urgent matter, Lisa is less than thrilled. Who is this man, and why is he so interested in her \"kooky\" hobby? What does he have to gain by visiting paranormal hot spots with her? Whatever he wants, Lisa can't help being drawn to Trevarr, and as they start working together they stumble upon a house filled to the brim with ghosts driven to the edge of madness. Now Lisa and Trevarr must figure out what's behind this ghost population explosion, before their mutual attraction causes explosions of its own.",
