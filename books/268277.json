  "description": "Exiled from the Shadow Fae, I'm left out on London's streets. The Knights of the Institute are dying of the plague, and they're sure I'm to blame.  Desperate to speak to Ruadan, I invade the Institue. Then, things take a turn for the worse. Like, \"tortured in a tiny prison cell\" worse. Seems like Ruadan has completely betrayed me. But when I finally reunite with my dark demigod, it turns out I'd totally misunderstood his actions.  Once I'm out of jail, Ruadan and I have to fix this mess, and we're thrown together once again. That means finding my father, and killing Baleros before the monster gets what he's after: the skin off Ruadan's corpse. If Baleros gets what he wants, then he'll control the world, and I'll lose Ruadan forever.  This is the final book in a four-book series  Court of Shadows Court of Darkness Court of Night Court of Dreams  This book is from the Demons of Fire and Night world.",
