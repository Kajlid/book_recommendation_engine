  "description": "*** Author Fredrik Nath was 'highly commended' in the Yeovil Literary Prize for his novel \"Galdir: A Slave's Tale\". *** Nazi-occupied Aquitaine, 1943: Fran√ßois Dufy, alcoholic and alone, is dragged into the war effort when he rescues a young Jewish girl from the Nazi Security Police. She breathes life into his world and gives him a reason to go on. Dufy begins a path of revenge on the occupying Germans. A sniper in the Great War, he uses his skills to devastating effect, always posing as the town drunk. Then the British drop supplies and a beautiful SOE agent whom Dufy falls in love with. But as the invaders hunt down the partisans in the deep, crisp woodland, nothing works out as Dufy had hoped. 'Farewell Bergerac' is an unforgettable wartime tale of fragile love, loss and redemption.",
