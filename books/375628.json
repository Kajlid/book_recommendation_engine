  "description": "An historical saga set during the English Civil War and telling the story of two star-crossed lovers.This is the first of Pamela's civil war series. Pamela did extensive research into her writings to give an accurate portrayal of life in 17th century England during the civil war. Her fictional family, the Herons, live in Suffolk England in 'Goldhayes' manor. The family is caught up in the war, and they fight for the King, against Parliament. The book richly describes the battles in which the Herons are involved. Many of the characters that interact with the family are real, as are the events in which the family takes part in. There is a romance between two of the main characters, Thomazine and Francis Heron, who are cousins. Thomazine, however, was betrothed to another cousin, Dominic Drakelon, when she was 10, and the resulting conflict gives this story much suspense, and appeal.",
