  "description": "Devan Windsom has a problem. Someone's trying to scare her into selling her coffee shop, Artist's Grind, only weeks before Christmas. But Devan doesn't scare easily. The shop is her life, and she's proud of her coffee and the locally-made baubles she sells. Mac Fergerson leads a solitary life - the only one he wants after being maimed on his last tour of duty. Unwilling to get close to anyone, he can't help his interest when he walks by Artist's Grind and sees the curvy, irreverent brunette cleaning graffiti from her shop window. When the sparks start flying, will Mac turn tail and run? Or will he stop hiding from the world and take a chance at something special this Christmas?",
