  "description": "After experiencing rapture at the command of her mentor's voice, Meghan's education continues. Still in shock from the intensity of her own debased desires, Meghan goes to her first formal session of submissive training. Deprived of her senses while secured in a device used by the Puritans to punish \"unclean thoughts\", she submits to a severe... yet blissful... indoctrination into discipline. But Meghan's world soon begins to unravel. Questioning her newfound heights of deviant ecstasy, she seeks answers from her best friend, her dad, and a therapist. Then a visitor from her past unexpectedly shows up, forcing her to confront her past and who she is becoming.",
