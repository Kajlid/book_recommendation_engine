  "description": "Bianca has three loves: her job, her cat, and Bloody Marys. Not necessarily in that order. Life is good, the best, until Drew sabotages Bianca's black and white world and forces her to see the gray in it. Which is really annoying, as it disrupts her Bloody Mary drinking time.  Drew Montgomery left his old life to start a new one, but still the past continues to haunt him. Bianca Fisher makes him forget, gives him hope, and confounds him, all at once, and from just one encounter. Drew tells himself to run, to run away and fast, but his feet won't listen. Neither does his heart.",
