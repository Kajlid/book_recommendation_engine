  "title": "PCB Diagnostics",
  "description": "Printed circuit boards can be found in almost everything that runs on electricity in our modern world today. From simple to complex, single-sided to multi-layered, commercial to military, stand-alone to whole system, these electronic circuit boards perform myriads of functions they are designed for, 24/7 daily or once in a while when required. In time, however, these PCBs will fail—whether it's due to design deficiency, limited operational lifespan or reasons attributed to human negligence and errors.Everyday, countless engineers and technicians engage in the practice of diagnosing PCB failures, either in-house during the manufacturing process, on-site as part of customer support, or in a workshop that provides repair services. Diagnostic methods vary depending on the availability of resources—equipment setup, test specifications and procedures, and more importantly, PCB documentation. But what if we lack these to carry out fault diagnosis? That's where innovation and experience distinguishes the pro from the amateur.PCB diagnostics is a skill that is developed and refined over time. Nothing can replace the knowledge and know-how of troubleshooting different types of PCBs. It requires not only hands-on experience but in-depth exposure to a wide variety of faults to understand the dynamics involved in this challenging yet rewarding endeavor. This book is a culmination of the author's 30 years of experience in PCB repair, both in the military setting and the commercial sector.Just as every culture has its own unique culinary recipes, each genre of PCB requires specific approach when it comes to identifying failure or determining the cause of its malfunction. Thankfully, there are common tools of the trade to rely on, as well as an arsenal of powerful test equipment that can deliver faster, more reliable and consistent results. Hopefully, this book will expand your horizon and open up new possibilities on what PCB diagnostics entails.",
