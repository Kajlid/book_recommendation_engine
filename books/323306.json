  "description": "When it comes to love, there are only two types of people in this world: Those who believe it exists and the rest of us—the realists.All that lovey-dovey crap you feel sometimes … it’s in your brain. That’s right. Hormones.For the past five years, I’ve been dishing out advice to anyone who’ll listen. I tell it like it is. If you write to Ask Adelaide expecting syrupy words or fairytale musings, you’ll be sorely disappointed. I prefer to slap you with a dose of cold, hard truth, minus the sugar. You can thank me later.Not to be a hypocrite, of course, I follow all the rules I preach: No second dates, no sleepovers, no exceptions. One red flag and I will ding-dong ditch you faster than you can blink.No one has better control of their heart than me.At least I did until I met Nash.All books in the Naked in New York Series can be read in any order. Happily ever after, guaranteed.",
