  "description": "What if time-travel was different than anybody ever suspected? In this novelette, prisoners are used as lab rats in a ruthless series of temporal experiments. The physicists learn that itâ€™s possible to pillage and plunder the past without affecting the present. . . or so it seems. It SEEMS as though there are no consequences to time travel. But one prisoner sees the fallacy of this, because nobody understands consequences like a con.  Unfortunately, nobody listens to the lab rats, and so prisoner Daniel \"Steak Knife\" Hayes must gather a crew, commandeer a time capsule, and launch a desperate mission to save past, present and future, as well as his own sanity. This is not your ordinary time-travel story, but a tale of brutality, courage, unlikely friendship, and ultimate redemption.  Seth Chambers spent much of his formative years happily engrossed in the works of Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, Arthur C. Clarke, Theodore Sturgeon, Alfred Bester, and numerous other science fiction masters. Seth is the author of What Rough Beasts, Little Bird, and Beautiful Machines. His novella, \"In Her Eyes,\" was a nominee for the Sturgeon award and an honoree of the James Tiptree award. Seth lives in Florida and can be contacted directly at NotoriousAuthorSeth@gmail.com",
