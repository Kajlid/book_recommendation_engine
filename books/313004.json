  "description": "An enemies-to-lovers / sports / grumpy-sunshine / neighbor romanceI, Tillie Jean Rock, am not in love with my brother’s teammate. Sure, he might have those biceps and that “I am the grouchiest of grouchy bears” smolder, and he might shovel snow off his driveway next door wearing nothing but boxer shorts and rubber boots, and he might be running a side business feeding all the stray goats in town, but studliness is only skin-deep.And I might flirt with him every chance I get, but I swear it’s only to annoy my brother.And him.Because Max Cole?Under all of those glorious muscles and chiseled cheekbones and searing glares beats the heart of a heartless devil.I could no sooner fall in love with a guy who treats me like a kid, and judges me at every opportunity, and sets an army of garden gnomes loose on my yard, than I could fall in love with my grandfather’s pet parrot.But I can definitely annoy him. I can one hundred percent get on board with annoying him.That’s what you do when you don’t like your neighbor, right?But you know what they say about love and hate…It’s a very thin line.Especially when the real reason I’m not in love with Max Cole—that he’s incapable of love—might not be true at all.The Grumpy Player Next door is a fun-filled enemies-to-lovers romcom featuring a ray of sunshine on a mission, an athlete who’s only grouchy around her, and an epic prank gone wrong. It stands alone and comes complete with small-town shenanigans, a goat who’s not nearly as wise as his name suggests, and proof that sometimes, love is the best kind of vengeance.",
