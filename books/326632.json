  "description": "Never make a deal with the devil–especially if that deal entails holy matrimony.There’s only one rule my mother passed down to me before she died: Never venture into the east side of Edinburgh.I never questioned it.There are creatures in this world that could hurt us, she’d said.So, I stay away—until my life hits rock bottom, and I find myself curious about the forbidden side of the ancient city.It doesn’t seem all that different here–bars, clubs, restaurants. Just like the human side.One too many drinks later, he finds me.A silly poem and a whispered wish are all it takes for him to rip through the mirror between realms and pin me against a wall.Cruel, inhuman, cunning. A demon—an actual prince from hell. With horns. What could he possibly want from me?Marriage, apparently.Because as it turns out, Bloody Marius is dead serious about upholding his end of the deal.Blood & Vows is a dark retelling of the legend of Bloody Mary. It is a paranormal romance novella that will leave your kindle sizzling. Please note that this book has dark themes such as forced marriage, kidnapping, dubious consent, violence, and explicit language, which may be triggering for some.",
