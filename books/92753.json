  "description": "Elizabeth Burr made a lonely journey from the wind-whipped highlands of Scotland to the rocky hills of a New England settlement to begin building a bridge between two worlds. Elizabeth's dour father could not countenance her clandestine meetings with her British soldier. He declared that his daughter was \"dead\" as far as he was concerned. Elizabeth's rebirth took place across an ocean on the brink of a turbulent, dangerous new frontier, where hardships and unexpected violence became the fabric of her life...and where an astonishing turn of events forced her to make an agonizing romantic choice.",
