  "description": "Homicide detective Lt. Kristina (Kristy) Maxwell investigates the murder of an influential, well-liked local businessman. Howard Kirlian Berne, a prominent builder, was being groomed to replace Edward Carey, one of Garry's two representatives in Washington State's bicameral government. A charismatic man with a chequered family history, he is found lying dead in his garage by his wife, Cara, whose behaviour after the discovery immediately makes her the prime suspect for the initial responding officer, the sexist, homophobe Sgt. Bryan Johnson. Kristy must unearth the truth about Berne's murder, overcome the negative reactions of several fellow officers, and fight for her own life when she comes too close to the truth other people's liking.",
