  "description": "Syndelle Coronado. For Brann O'Ciardha, she is a prize beyond measure, a vampire myth made reality. He knows there will be those who will want to kill her when they learn of the old magic carried within her. But the moment Brann tastes Syndelle's blood and feels her hidden power as his companion Rafael mates with her, he resolves to claim her, to possess her. He's waited centuries to find a female such as Syndelle, and he won't let her escape him. She will be his for all time, bound to him and Rafael by her own nature and the laws that govern both vampire and Angelini alike.While Rafael is the human mate Syndelle has always dreamed of, Brann is the vampire bogeyman of her nightmares. There's no denying the Angelini magic that has chosen them as her mates, and once claimed, they will crave her as desperately as she will crave them. But Syndelle intends to have more from Rafe and Brann than just their lust, she wants their love, and she intends to be viewed as their equal.",
