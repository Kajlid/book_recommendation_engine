  "description": "For Ages 10 and up  \"They are known as Warlock and Witch... Although you would use that term fairly loosely ... they don't ride broomsticks and pitchforks ... But they all bring lots of deathly magic ... !\"  The Operatives have a new recruit – Calan Taylor, a thirteen year old budding basketball champion from Middington. The Igniters - dark warlocks of the Severed Plane, also have their own Middington recruit – Steven Sabre the damaged loner. The Igniters should have sensed Calan first – as he is a ‘pure’ Igniter, only the third ever of his kind. A mistake has been made and the balance must be restored. Standing in their way are the Operatives. A 14th corridor to another world has opened and the town of Middington is under secret attack from the warlocks and witches of the Severed Plane. The Operatives, a crack team of agents from all over Earth have been formed to defend the Wystic’s of the Western Quarter against the immortal evils of the North, South and East. Using the Severed Plane’s magical corridors, the Operatives travel to countries all over the world in a bid to save as much of humankind as is possible from the dark Quarter’s possessing and kidnapping ways … and catching the immortal is a hard thing to do!  Calan Taylor is about to become the Operatives most valuable weapon.  The first book in a mind blowing new fantasy series by Australian author S.B. Norton filled with action, horror and humour.",
