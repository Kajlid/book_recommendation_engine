A life that saw a marriage, the birth of my daughter, and then a divorce. Co-parenting isn’t easy, but not much in life is, right? I have a job I love as a high school math teacher and football coach, and raising Chloe keeps me plenty busy. Life is good. I’m content. Settled. Predictable.Until one day, I look up and come face to face with the one that got away. Haven Decker.Haven You always remember the day you break your own heart. You also never forget the man you left behind.I was young and thought I needed more than life in the small town I grew up in.

It turns out the grass isn’t always greener on the other side. When an injury and a cheating boyfriend bring my world to a halt, one phone call has me packing up and heading back to the one place I never thought I would return to.I knew I would run into him, but I don’t know if I’m ready to face him.
