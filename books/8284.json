  "title": "Latter Days: An Insider's Guide to Mormonism, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints",
  "description": "This is the story of the Latter-day Saints, the story of when God came back to earth and started things over - in person. It may be the most confident message of God in centuries. Free of proselytory pretense, yet written with the non-Latter-day Saint reader firmly in mind, Latter Days goes right to the mind and heart of this religion, exploring an utterly unique catalog of Christian doctrine on the purpose of human existence and destiny. It presents the Mormon story of the creation of this world and lays out what Mormons believe is the divine plan for mankind, from Adam, Noah, and Christ to Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. It relates the astonishing story of the great Mormon Exodus, explaining how they were driven from the supposedly civilized United States to the wilderness of the Salt Lake - a truly remarkable story that few of us learned in our high school history classes.",
