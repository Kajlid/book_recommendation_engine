He’s a hard working DEA agent but he has a secret that he’s been keeping his whole life — he can jump to a parallel universe. It’s on one of these jumps that he faces an impossible dilemma. Will he make it in time to save his half sister from the wrath of a mad man? Will Graham be able to deal with the consequences of his actions?
