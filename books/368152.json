  "title": "Zothique",
  "description": "Zothique is the name of a continent. A mythical world of spells, wonders, incongruities, curses and countless terrors. In this universe, love and death have the colors of illusion, and hallucinations are always less frightening than reality. In towns and villages, in forests and countryside, the dead, mummies and skeletons leave the living no respite and constantly attack and pursue them. If the tales in this collection are completely disorienting, they nonetheless remain the exact expression of our deepest terrors.Zothique depicts the destinies of the inhabitants of the last continent of the Earth, when it is in its agony... and stages one of the most captivating and splendid fantasy that literature has produced.",
