  "description": "“An extraordinary panorama of women’s lives today.”— The New York Times Book ReviewIn detailed, revealing portraits of women from their teens through their sixties, Maggie Scarf explores the core experiences of women’s lives and discovers what can happen when the days and years scurry by, leaving unfinished the tasks that transform us from child to girl to woman.Praise for Unfinished Business“Real-life problems are thoughtfully and sympathetically analyzed in Unfinished Business . . . . Love and loss, deprivation and fulfillment, the pangs of growing up and, worse, the plight of those who never do—these are Scarf’s subjects, and she gives them the attention and respect rightly due such integral threads in the fabric of our lives.” — Cosmopolitan“No woman or man will be untouhed by Maggie Scarf’s brilliant research. There is a gift for all of us in these pages—that freeing, exhilarating thank God I read this book—I thought I was the only one.” —Nancy Friday",
