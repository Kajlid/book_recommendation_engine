  "description": "Explore a valley of wonder, mystery, and peril...As a mountain man and cavalry scout, Heck Martin handled every challenge on the Western frontier.Now, however, he must care not only for himself but also his beloved Hope, her family, and his adopted brother, Seeker, in a remote wilderness populated by hostile Indians, bandits, and predators.Most men would crumble under these circumstances, but Heck has enough love and courage to forge a new destiny in this mighty land. Filled with tough optimism and pioneering spirit, he vows to master the wilderness.There is much to do.Timber to cut. Cabins to build. Game to hunt. Land to plow and plant. A claim to stake. Caves to explore. A trading post to build. And hopefully, a happy wedding to share with the young woman he loves.But Indians are moving through the land, and a gigantic grizzly is on the prowl. Meanwhile, 1850 brings record numbers of emigrants across the Oregon Trail. Not all are prepared, and as travel season comes to an end, a group of straggling emigrants limps into the valley, seeking sanctuary.Heck and Hope agree to help, but not everyone should be trustedâ€¦",
