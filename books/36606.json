  "description": "Lauren Hunt has just committed the ultimate crime in the eyes of her mother. She has betrayed her family. As part of her punishment she is now sentenced to write in this diary for the next two months of her life.A typical teenager, Lauren is busy with pep band, swimming, and friends; but unlike her friends, Lauren is a freak, and it is all thanks to her family. Lauren is the sixteenth in a long line of twenty-five kids. And if that weren’t enough, a good majority of her siblings, that have been collected from around the country, are both physically and mentally challenged. She blames her lack of a social life on the fact that she has been linked up with this band of misfits.Diary of a Freak is an entertaining, 60,000 word, YA novel that will make you smile and groan through your teen years again. The witty look into Lauren’s crazy life will resonate with anyone who has ever felt like a freak as they battled their way through high school. It will appeal to the fans of Dork Diaries who have grown out of their middles school antics, the fans of Sarah Dessen novels that enjoy a good coming of age novel, and to the general public who wouldn’t pass up the chance to peek into someone else’s diary.This is a semi-autobiographical novel. I drew from my own life experiences and deep vein of sarcasm to weave Diary of a Freak into the novel that I wish had been around when I was suffering through the mortifications of growing up in an odd family.",
