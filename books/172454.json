  "description": "Jason Born’s ill-fated hero, Halldorr, returns in this fifth stunning installment of The Norseman Chronicles. Halldorr finds himself in the renowned Norse city of Dyflin, defending a king long past his prime. Loyalties divide. Chaos mounts. The year is 989 A.D., two years after Halldorr and his fellow Greenlanders limped away from the massacre at Dunadd. They remain banished from the icy fjords of home and so must serve wherever a sword is needed. The timber walls of King Kvaran’s prosperous city appear promising at first. The truth hidden beneath the politics of Ireland is more sinister. Everyone, Norse and Irish alike, desires to have a hand in running their own kingdom and the crumbling House of Kvaran. The half-brother princes, Iron Knee and Silkbeard, each have something to prove. Ireland’s High King Sechnaill gambles for power. A queen and lady spar over thrones. And just when Halldorr begins to curse it all, a dirty sea king arrives on the scene and inspires him and a city to greatness. Norseman’s Oath is a magnificent tale, immersing the reader in a world of thrilling battle, vivid characters, Viking wit, and grand adventure. Oath sworn men, golden Valkyries, and a grinding siege all have roles to play in deciding the fate of a kingdom.",
