  "description": "A mother's worst nightmare - can her son be guilty of murder?  Sarah Newby, who left school at 15, and was living as a teenage single parent on an inner-city estate, has worked her way up to begin a career as a criminal barrister. But what should she do when her own son, Simon, is arrested and charged with a series of brutal rapes and murders?  Has Sarah, in her single-minded determination to create a career for herself, neglected her son so much that she no longer knows him? He has often lied to her in the past, so how can she trust him when he says he is innocent this time?   When she herself finds evidence of his guilt, how can she defend him?   'A top class British legal thriller which puts the author up there with his American counterparts, John Grisham, Scott Turow and Michael Connolly.' Tim Kevan, barrister.  'A brilliant British crime thriller that you really should read. Sarah Burns, Kindle Book Review.   'One of the ABSOLUTE BEST legal mystery books I've ever read.' Amazon reader review.
