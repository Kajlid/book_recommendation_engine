  "title": "Metamorphosis and Other Stories",
  "description": "In the bizarre world of Franz Kafka, salesmen turn into giant bugs, apes give lectures at college academies, and nightmares probe the mysteries of modern humanity’s unhappiness. More than any other modern writer in world literature, Kafka captures the loneliness and misery that fill the lives of 20th-century humanity. The Metamorphosis and Other Stories reveals the author’s extraordinary talent in a variety of forms—prose poems, short stories, sketches, allegories, and novelettes—and showcases the straight–faced humor, startling psychological insight, and haunting imagination for which he is revered as a modern master. This collection of new translations brings together the small proportion of Kafka's works that he thought worthy of publication. It includes \"Metamorphosis\", his most famous work, an exploration of horrific transformation and alienation; \"Meditation\", a collection of his earlier studies; \"The Judgement\", written in a single night of frenzied creativity; \"The Stoker\", the first chapter of a novel set in America and a fascinating occasional piece, and \"The Aeroplanes at Brescia\", Kafka's eyewitness account of an air display in 1909. Together, these stories reveal the breadth of Kafka's literary vision and the extraordinary imaginative depth of his thought.",
