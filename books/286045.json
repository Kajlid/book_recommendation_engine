  "description": "The man Arun loves is kin to the wolf; but Arun is kin to darkness itself. Arun is in training to be a priest of the Fire God when he is abruptly plucked from his peaceful studies, bespelled and staked out as bait to capture a monster-a wolfkin. But the wolfkin isn-t quite what Arun expected. He has a name, Trae, and he's more man than beast. And from their first touch, they are far more than predator and prey to each other. Instead of killing Arun, Trae spirits him away to the distant city of Shireen. There, on a family plot of land, they should have a good life together. But the spell that a witch cast on Arun is growing stronger, taking over-and it still wants to destroy the wolfkin. Torn between the power of the spell and his love for Trae, Arun must face the darkness within him-or it will kill them both. Warning: This title contains some tie-me-down M/M content, spellbinding love and a quest to face down the darkness within.",
