  "description": "Too HARD to resist...   Zach “HARD” Harden was a perfectly sinful one-night stand—a gorgeous, bad boy Navy SEAL totally deserving of his nickname. He wasn’t a bad decision at the time, but I’ve never made a good mistake…even a toe-curling one.  He didn’t tell me who he was. He didn’t tell me why he found me. And he sure as hell didn’t tell me he was my step-brother in town to divvy up my estranged father’s will—an inheritance that includes a fabulous mansion.  But I can’t hide my feelings for him, even in a giant estate. I make Zach a deal. He can stay at the mansion with me until he deploys, then I use my trust fund to buy out his half. One wave of the checkbook and the arrogant player is out of my life forever.  Except Zach is the one man who makes the forbidden seem forgivable. He’s sexy. He’s charming.  And he’s just too HARD to resist.  HARD is a standalone, super flirty, temptingly steamy adult romance with a guaranteed happily-ever-after!",
