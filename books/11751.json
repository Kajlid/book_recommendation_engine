  "description": "Please note that the content of this book primarily consists of articles available from Wikipedia or other free sources online. Henry and June: From the Unexpurgated Diary of Ana?'s Nin (full title Henry and June: From A Journal of Love: the Unexpurgated Diary of Ana?'s Nin (1931-1932)) is a 1986 book that is based upon material excerpted from the unpublished diaries of Anais Nin. It corresponds temporally to the first volume of Ana?'s Nin's published diaries, written between October 1931 and October 1932, yet is radically different, in that that book begins with a description of the landscape of and around her home and never mentions her husband, whereas \"Henry and June\" begins with discussion of Nin's sex life and is full of her struggles and passionate relationship with husband Hugo, and then, as the novel/memoir progresses, other lovers. This, the first of currently four volumes of unexpurgated diaries, concentrates on her passionate involvement with the writer Henry Miller and his wife June Miller.",
