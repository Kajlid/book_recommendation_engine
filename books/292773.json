  "description": "I was minding my own business at my new job as a child life specialist when the sexiest doctor in the hospital fell into my lap... literally. He was every woman’s fantasy, the Adonis in a white coat was charming, not to mention brilliant.Dr. Andrew “Drew” Montgomery was quite the catch, not the usual type of guy who I’d expect to fall for a woman like me. The first man who saw past my wheelchair, Drew was also the first man I could see myself settling down with. We started dating, and everything seemed fine, but something was holding him back, Drew was married to his job and he carried the weight of his namesake. A name I wasn’t sure I could live up to. I meant to keep my guard up, but it was no use. I was in over my head the moment his gorgeous blue eyes thoroughly examined me. I knew my body was in good hands, but could I trust my heart with the cocky doctor?",
