  "description": "There is always a flicker in the night, but who is brave enough to stand amidst the flames?  The blackness of night consumed her, but she always thought it would lift. Time does not heal all wounds. Freedom is not hers to claim. And as the months pass, she realizes she no longer wants the light at all.  The keys to her future have been seized from Lucian’s hands. The power is hers now, and it is clear that she might be the only person who can bring Veodue out of ruin. In a battle against her own flesh and blood, innocent lives weigh in the balance of her choices.  Was the Pool’s prophecy true? Will she be able to rise above the person she has become to accept what might be her only fate?  This story of betrayal, love and redemption continues in the next chapter of Raenah’s journey.",
