Perhaps she'd married a man with whom it might just be worth building a life. Her mother had worried that he was scarred, but the lines on his face did nothing to lessen his raw masculine appeal. If anything, they gave him an even more dangerous male air, enticing the feminine core of her to thoughts that shocked her.What did a man's face matter anyway? She had no use for handsome men.But for a man with a heart?For such a manâ€¦she might risk everything.",
