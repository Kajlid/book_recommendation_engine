  "description": "This possessive Russian isn’t just my dad’s best friend…he’s an inked alpha male.  And the first time I see him is the first time I’ve ever seen someone carry out such violence right in front of my very eyes.  I should get on the next plane out of here immediately, but why does this inked alpha male’s violence have me thinking it’s time for another kind of first time with this older man who is very apparently my new possessive Russian protector?  As an inked introvert and younger woman I always felt misunderstood, but suddenly I’m the one who doesn’t understand why I’m falling for my dad’s best friend…the older man with all the answers to questions I didn’t even realize I had.  But what happens when I have a question of my own and his answer challenges me to question everything I thought I knew to be true?  Will our feelings continue to blossom like flowers in May, or will my heart turn as cold as December in Russia?  *Possessive Russian is an insta-everything standalone instalove romance with an HEA, no cheating, and no cliffhanger.",
