  "title": "Captured by a Cowboy",
  "description": "Was it impulse, instinct, or intuition that made Raquel surrender to a total stranger? By morning she was no longer a waitress at a Chicago truck stop but a woman on her way to an isolated Wyoming ranch with Holt Tyler, the man who knew all her secrets. His touch had made her suddenly wanton. His kisses drove her wild. Was he kidnapping her or saving her from herself? Did he want to protect her or ravish her again and again? Had she fled her wealthy, powerful, overprotective father only to fall into the arms of another passionate tyrant? And did she want to escape...or had her heart been captured by a cowboy?",
