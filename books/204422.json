  "description": "My name is Ace and I'm the Ace of Spades. I'm not nice and I misbehave. I will be your nightmare. I will be your dream. I will have you begging for more of me with each scream. The truth is in my lyrics. Uncontrollably controlled. I bleed many things one being Rock & Roll. I don't date or make love; I make being with me hard. Did you know the ace of spades is considered the death card? Love doesn't exist in my world, it never did. Love won't exist in my world, it's something I forbid. My name is Ace and I'm the ace of spades. Proceed with caution, because I'm sharp like a blade. The Band of Brothers novels are full length stand alones and will follow each brother in the band. They can be read together or separately.",
