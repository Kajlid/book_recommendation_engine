  "description": "Janelle knew no one would ever love her. After all she'd been through, who could? Behind the façade of her of her seemingly ordinary life lurked the wreckage of unspeakable trauma. Then one day, while hawking hot dogs at an afternoon carnival, she took a chance on a man who seemed different. Maybe, she thought, Just maybe. But then, she didn't know him. Who was this man? Charles was a successful salesman with a beautiful wife, two kids he adored, friends, and a solid reputation--until a vile, false accusation was plastered all over the papers. Suddenly, his wife lost faith in him, his customers disappeared, friends shunned him, and his world collapsed. When he meets Janelle, he rallies from years of depression and despair to reach for love. Soon, their blooming love generates turmoil as they start peeling away the layers of their protective shells. Each is forced to face the secrets they’ve worked so hard to hide, and each has to learn how to be open, and to trust, and to love. Naked Truths explores the makings of love, the nature of sexuality, and the discovery of self. As Charles and Janelle struggle forward, they learn to face their pasts and embrace all they are. Frank and sensitive, Naked Truths is a love story for insightful adults and will resonate with anyone who has yearned for an authentic connection.",
