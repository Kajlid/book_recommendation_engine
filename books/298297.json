  "description": "From Sharon and Tom Curtis, one of the most celebrated writing duos in romance, comes a sizzling story of unexpected attraction—as sparks fly between a shy librarian and a sexy dancer.Philip Brooks is a man with a passion for biology, wildlife, and restoring his old family home—all of which add up to a pile of bills that require attention. Moonlighting as the Cougar Club's hottest dancer is a job, nothing more, nothing less—until lovely Jennifer Hamilton nearly faints during one of his shows. Her sweet innocence tugs at his heart and makes him painfully aware of his longing for the kind of love a woman as perfect and real as Jennifer can offer.Watching her most secret fantasy come to life on the dance floor is almost more than Jennifer can bear. Now, the sexiest man she's ever met is near enough to hold. For a shy, bookish lady with little experience in the romance department, life feels as if it's spinning out of control—and not in the direction, or with the kind of man, she ever imagined. Can she believe in the passion Philip ignites and take a chance on a dance that could last a lifetime?",
