  "description": "The Angel of Innisfree\n, a Victorian-era historical romance, weaves a story of love overcoming every obstacle during one of the most tumultuous periods in history. It's 1848, the Irish Potato Famine has claimed more lives than anyone can count, and English landlords are evicting their tenants with a ruthless lack of compassion. Revolutions in Europe are transforming the basic foundations of society while inventions such as the telegraph are changing the way the world works. Young Brian O'Rourke, an ingenious, Catholic, violin prodigy in a family of outlawed Ribbonmen peasants meets Elizabeth Reilly, a talented Protestant pianist from London, while she's visiting her father in a nearby castle. After secretly promising themselves to each other at the age of sixteen, Elizabeth returns to London to study piano with Chopin while Brian immigrates to New York on a famine ship. Brian joins the nascent telegraph industry, where he uses his expertise to help slaves escape on the Underground Railroad, travels to California to work on the Transcontinental Telegraph, and to Washington to help President Lincoln during the Civil War. Meanwhile, Elizabeth launches a successful career as a concert pianist in Europe while impatiently searching for Brian to find out if he's even alive.This enduring romance captures the passionate spirits of two people determined to find each other regardless of the forces conspiring to keep them apart.",
