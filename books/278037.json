  "description": "Doug Boyd has spent ten years sacrificing his social life and dignity to his accounting job, for little reward. So when his boss pressures him to ignore some suspicious numbers on a high-profile audit, he refuses to bend the rules. Ignoring his boss's veiled threats, he goes on a weekend camping trip with three old college buddies-and narrowly escapes a hit man.Now Doug and his three friends-an FBI agent on the edge, a college economics instructor and conspiracy theorist, and a slick real estate broker-are caught in a tangled conspiracy that spawned the creation of the Federal Reserve Bank. A shadowy collective of representatives from the nation's most powerful financial companies and government agencies is colluding to erase the massive economic mistakes that caused the credit crunch and collapse of the recent housing bubble. Doug and his friends must fight to gather the evidence and blow the cover on the conspiracy before it ruins what's left of their careers and their lives.",
