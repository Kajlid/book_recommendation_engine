  "description": "Charged with a crime they didn't commit, the MacKinnon brothers faced a death sentence until they agreed to serve the British Crown in the colonies and take up arms against the French. Allied with the Indian tribes who lived beside them in the wilderness, the Scottish Highland warriors forged a new breed of soldier...MacKinnon's RangersThough forced to fight for the hated English, Morgan MacKinnon would no more betray the men he leads than slit his own throatâ€”not even when captured by the French and threatened with an agonizing death by fire at the hands of their Abenaki allies. Only the look of innocent longing in the eyes of Amalie, a convent-bred French lass, could make him question his vow to escape and return to the Rangers. And soon the sweet passion he awakens in Amalie has him cursing the war that forced him to choose between upholding his honor and pledging himself to the woman he loves.",
