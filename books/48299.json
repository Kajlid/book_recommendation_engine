  "description": "Set in the mysterious wilderness of the Middle Eastern desert, lone traveller Aref, a nomadic man living a relatively simple life, comes into contact with a member of the invading army – a distressed, mistreated female soldier. Over the course of several months, as they try to navigate the empty desert together, their hopes of regaining their freedom, their fear of the changes taking place and their understanding of one another evolves considerably. Against the backdrop of a fictional yet plausible conflict, Broken Shells considers one possible outcome for several individuals in a situation that is global in its effect, yet also deeply personal to millions.Brave, relevant and topical, Broken Shells aims to show what it’s like to be drawn into the unrecognisable, exploring the effect a single mistake can have on faraway lives and looking at how some individuals manage to retain their values, hope and dignity even when they are pushed to the limit.",
