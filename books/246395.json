Now, however, her parents have left detailed instructions for Bronte in their will.

She travels the kingdoms, perfectly alone, delivering gifts to ten other a farmer aunt who owns an orange orchard, a veterinarian aunt who specializes in dragon care, a pair of aunts who captain a cruise ship, and a former rock star aunt who is now the reigning monarch of a small kingdom.But as she travels from aunt to aunt, Bronte suspects there might be more to this journey than the simple delivery of treasure.",
