  "description": "Haven Drew is about to blow the whistle on a genetically damaging by-product of the Dahkhar Mining Corporation when she is thrust from her safe white-collar life into the mine itself.Her analytical skills are used by the very corporation that she wanted to expose and lives are placed in her hands and in front of her guns, daily. Trapped in a vortex of rage and shame she is confronted by two familiar faces, and they are being housed in her cell. Josias and Isan were investigating the disappearance of personnel at the Corporation headquarters when they were relieved of their duties and assigned to positions working in the mine.It might not be love at first sight, but biology is powerful and with her mates at her side, there is nothing that they can't do. Risking life and limb isn't an ideal honeymoon but they manage to work together toward their goal of launching themselves into space and to a colony infected by disaster. How romantic can you get?",
