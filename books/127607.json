  "description": "Originally published in 1931, this bestselling American family saga from Pulitzer Prize-winning author Edna Ferber shares the story of the Oakes family, as their relationships and property encounter numerous struggles over the course of hundreds of years. In the early 18th century, the Oakes family was one of many working to settle their land in the Connecticut Valley, facing harsh winters and land disputes. Their attempts over the years to tame the land and produce a properous tobacco farm prove more difficult than expected, and when the family takes on Polish immigrants to work the farm, cultures clash, and relationships become complicated. American Beauty follows the goings-on at the Oakes estate from 1700 through 1930, and whether in times of family turmoil or hopeful prosperity, Edna Ferber's cast of fascinating characters and pitch-perfect take on American life rings true.",
