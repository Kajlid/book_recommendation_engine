  "description": "Originally published in 1861, this early work by Charles Reade is both expensive and hard to find in its first edition. It tells the story of a young scribe s travels through Europe and deals with conflicts between family life and the church. This is a fascinating work and thoroughly recommended for anyone interested in historical English literature. Many of the earliest books, particularly those dating back to the 1900s and before, are now extremely scarce. We are republishing these classic works in affordable, high quality, modern editions, using the original text and artwork.",
