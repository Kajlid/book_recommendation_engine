  "title": "Wuthering Heights",
  "description": "Librarian's note: Alternate cover edition of ISBN 0140430016.'Stronger than a man, simpler than a child, her nature stood alone.' So Emily Brontë appeared in the eyes of her sister, Charlotte. Her one novel, Wuthering Heights, published a year before her death in 1848 at the age of thirty, similarly stands alone as perhaps the most passionately original work in the English language. This dark, unforgettable story of Catherine Earnshaw and the swarthy Heathcliff 'is moorish, and wild, and knotty as a root of heath', and Emily Brontë records the progress of their love with such truth, imagination, and emotional intensity that a plain tale of the Yorkshire moors acquires the depth and simplicity of ancient tragedy.",
