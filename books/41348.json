  "description": "Carolina Cantrell is used to running her family's import business - and having to travel to keep it successful. So a hurried trip to the Montana Territory to settle her brother's estate is nothing out of the ordinary. Simply sell David's interest in his store, gather his personal belongings, and then return home. But God has different plans. Struggling to do business so far from home in this untamed man's world is a challenge to everything in Carolina's life - her business sense, her faith, her plans...and her heart. There are confrontations and tensions all around as rumors of gold spread throughout the territory. Carolina must even fight for the future of the town growing up around the store. But the greatest conflict is the one within her, fueled by an explosion of emotions that leavers both her and particularly handsome and saddle-tough drifter wondering about their future together.",
