  "title": "Nothing Is Promised",
  "description": "Although many Americans were touched by the tragedy of 9/11 or the deployment of loved ones to a far-away desert region or the crisis of breast cancer surgery and recovery - few dealt with all three at the same time. Even fewer were able to write about the experience in a voice that will help others with similar struggles. New York City native Marjorie Belson has captured the American spirit of recovery and redemption in her first novel by melding such a story in a brilliantly evocative tone while letting realism and her enduring spirit shine on center stage.Marjorie Belson is a quintessential New Yorker. Born in New York City, she received both her undergraduate and graduate degrees from the City University of New York. As a single mother, she chose to teach early childhood education rather than work on Wall Street.Motivated by her experience, she started writing this book in 2004.",
