  "description": "How far would you go to save the love of your life? Through a doorway to another world?  When high school sweethearts Sebastian and Gina discover a doorway to a new world, adventure-loving Gina falls in love with the world of Ghoupallesz and wants to stay. But studious Sebastian fears losing touch with Earth, so he returns alone. Nevertheless, he sneaks back time and time again for his own strange adventures before finally giving up the habit after too many lost loves, betrayals, and war.  Years later, working night shift at the IRS service center, Sebastian feels the cosmic pull once more. Gina is in trouble--again. Of course he must return and save her! Perhaps this time, they can stay together. Returning through the interdimensional doorway, Sebastian must first gather his comrades from the war, cross the towering Zet mountains, and free Gina from the evil Zetin warlord’s castle.  Unfortunately, Sebastian finds there are more questions than answers. Is his adventure on the other side real? Or is it just the dream of a psychotic killer? That’s what the police want to know when friends and co-workers go missing.  THE DREAM LAND is an eloquently efficient epic of interdimensional intrigue and world domination by high school geeks, filled with twisted humor (think double-helix), some steampunk pathos, a patina of psychological thriller (imagine a police procedural gone bad), passionate romance (tears will be shed!), graphic violence (de rigueur in battles scenes with a cast of millions), and the inevitability of quirky conundrums of time and space.  \"Long Distance Voyager\" is the first volume of The Dream Land trilogy.",
