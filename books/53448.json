  "description": "What is the consequence for falling in love with someone you are forbidden to touch? An eternity of guilt? Shame? Misery? Or can you find incredible bliss?Penn I’ve resigned myself to a lifetime of loving the wrong person because it feels so right. But nothing worthwhile comes that easily. The challenges we’ve had to face to be together just kept on coming, like a storm with no end. Would this ever get any easier? Or was it always going to be a tug-of-war between my head and my heart? Wilder There was no going back. No do-overs. I fell in love with my father and I have zero regrets. Every day was a battle to keep our secret from getting out, and when it finally does, will the bubble surrounding our perfect world burst? Sins of My Father is the second book in the Family Sins duet. It features an incestuous relationship, belt play, daddy/boy role play, food play, stuffing kink, and spanking.",
