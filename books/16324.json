  "description": "2010 Reprint of 1932 First Edition. This is an early statement of Religious Science by one of its founders. Holmes explains Religious Science itself, the way it works, what it does and how to use it. According to Holmes, Religious Science is the science of Spirit, a culmination of the age-long search for Truth. The Truth has been known by a few in every age, but the great mass of people has never dreamed that actually we live in a spiritual world. Holmes attempts to explain that world and how to live in it. Scarce and very early statement on Religious Science.",
