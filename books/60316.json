  "description": "Her name is Grace, queen and Firebearer of the summer Seelie court. Ian is the court’s well respected, rather good looking prince whom she is now betrothed and completely devoted to as she stands beside him while ruling a people she didn’t know existed before. Days before her eighteenth birthday she followed him into this fairy tale that remains unknown and hidden from the human world. Now, nearly a year later, they are to be married, convince others to put aside their ill will to spare their court, avoid the pestering Unseelie prince who thinks Grace should belong to him, and find time to really know each other in the process.\tUnfortunately, the two other princes play a part in the fairy tale prophecy threatening to take Grace away from not only Ian, but the Seelie court as well. Kinsler, prince of the Unseelie court stands ready to persuade her that his unethically driven winter court is a better choice and will make her the most powerful queen in all of Fey history. Pike, the broody forgotten prince of the Seelie court stands by at the ready in case she leans his way and decides to discard Ian. But this isn’t just about the heart…other motives are in the mix. \tKidnapping, slavery, and murder. Grace will be confronted with the worst of circumstances she cannot turn back from and be forced to face the consequences despite her honorable intentions. With knowledge and power comes heartache. With heartache comes strife. Will Grace fulfill this prophecy like they say or lose everything she holds dear?Second Edition",
