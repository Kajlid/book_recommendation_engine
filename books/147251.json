  "description": "Princess Marin knows she lives a charmed life. She’s the envy of her mermaid sisters— gifted with the art of aquamancy, set to become Queen, and betrothed to one of only seven mermen in the five Oceans.It sounds great to everyone else, but Marin would rather pick her scales off one by one than go through with it. Her fiancé is a spoiled brat (exactly like every other merman in the world), her duties are boring, and her aquamancy comes with the caveat of killing her father someday. So Marin does what comes naturally: she avoids it.Unfortunately, a lifetime of dodging her royal duties finally catches up to her when her father demands she meet her betrothed and grow up. Marin accepts that she doesn’t have a choice.Then she meets Finn— a merman who isn’t part of the status quo, one who grew up half-way normal. He awakens desires within her she didn’t know she had. It was never easy to give in to her destiny, but suddenly it seems impossible.Torn between her duty and her heart, Marin must decide what she’s willing to sacrifice… and who.Though a stand-alone tale, Tryst is a companion to the Rhapsody Quartet series.",
