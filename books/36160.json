  "title": "Tablets: Understanding Software and Apps",
  "description": "The operating system of a tablet PC is important, and was the focus of the first eBook in this series, but the OS only gets you so far. Apple proved that to no end when the App Store was expanded in 2010 for the iPad, marking the beginning of what is becoming the “ecosystem” model for all tablet PCs.Apps allow users to pick and choose functionality from a centralised database of options. They allow developers to be innovative and they allow tablet makers to produce devices that focus on getting a smaller number of very important things right instead of a huge number of things passable. This eBook discusses not only why the app model works, but what enterprising developers have been able to do with it and the different ways this technology continues to change how we do business, entertain ourselves, and use our devices. This eBook contains a wealth of information for tablet PC users of any platform (including Apple, Android or Microsoft Windows) and it’s also a wise read before you make a tablet purchasing decision.Hugo also shares some of his favourite apps and what they’ve allowed him to do on his mobile devices.",
