  "description": "Interracial Romance BWWMDavid Hudson was rising in the political field. As a senator from New York, he had it all â€“ good looks, a well-known family name and the finances to go with it, but for David, it was never enough. He graduated from an Ivy League school at the top of his class, and his parents were political royalty in America so he grew up in the spotlight with all of the luxuries one could imagine. David was immaculate in his appearance. His dark brown hair was always parted to the side and combed smoothly, while his tan complexion and deep brown eyes caused many women to take a second glance every time he walked into a room. His fit build ensured every suit he owned looked like it was tailored to his body. Even in his mid 40s, he looked ten years younger and his energy was as high as it had ever been.",
