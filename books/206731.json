  "description": "He was from the wrong side of the bayou.A place where voodoo was revered and fallen angels whispered.I didn’t care.I loved him from the first time we played together, and I love him still.I haven’t seen him in so long.I went back to New Orleans when I could.I never stopped thinking about him.My bayou boy with the heavy Cajun accent.I just didn’t know that the happy little boy had turned into such a different man.I didn’t know that he had been looking for me too.I didn’t know a lot of things.But finding out was much worse than staying in the dark.",
