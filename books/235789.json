  "description": "Heather Myles isn’t exactly thrilled to accompany her groupie roommate to an Emerald Phoenix concert. The aspiring screen writer would rather be home with a good book. After Susie pleads with her, though, Heather relents. What the heck? Maybe a change of scenery is just what she needs to combat her desolation over getting turned down by yet another small production company.After the performance, Jett Draconis, lead singer and guitarist for the band, isn’t up for the party scene. He’s grown tired of being mauled by horny devotees…until an auburn-haired goddess catches his eye. Though she initially rebuffs his advances, he’s determined not to take no for an answer. Sparks erupt between him and Heather, but Jett knows better than to fall in love. A secret from his past could destroy him—and everyone close to him—if he does.",
