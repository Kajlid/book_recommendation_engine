  "description": "Débuts Summer of 2012Sebastian’s haunting gaze seemed to penetrate my very being revealing my secrets, fears, and desires. My name rolled off his tongue, tempting me to take exactly what I hungered for. His world was laced with agony and inconvenient truths, whereas mine was saturated with sweet, beautiful, carefree lies. Sebastian promised me nothing of a happy ending. The demonic spawn with an angelic voice could derail my only purpose for living, but still I hesitated to look away. My curiosity would certainly be my undoing–but then again, death was inevitable. Life perceived by the soulless ones…Created to die, Catherine’s fate never veers from the surgical death awaiting her next birthday. As a soulless spawn, she’s utterly obedient to all of the Ringer’s demands in hopes to fulfill her only purpose for existence–to be the perfect organ donor for her terminal progenitor. Although Catherine hasn’t ever met her progenitor, an unexplainable, impossible bond ties their lives together, forever. Catherine waits patiently for death, until Sebastian gives her a taste of something more, something worth fighting for. When his uncontrollable, consuming passion can’t get any more dangerous, Sebastian reveals the Ringer’s most guarded secrets–secrets they’d kill to keep.",
