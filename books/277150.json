  "description": "A dystopian dark romance by International Bestselling Author Nikita Slater.  Only the strongest can survive in a hostile world ravaged by a disease that turns humans into primitives.  She is the Desert Wren, a rebel bent on providing safe passage to illegal refugees entering into her Sanctuary city. If she’s caught she’ll be executed, but the price is worth the privilege of doing what she knows is right. Except when she’s finally caught, the sentence isn’t death, it’s her freedom.  It’s the Warlord’s job to weed out the weak and sacrifice them for the good of the Sanctuary. Brutal and autocratic, he is the highest authority. The only threat to his dictatorship is a rebel faction rising up from the slums of his city. When he arrests a rebel leader, the Desert Wren, he sees his redemption. She will help him guide Sanctuary into the future. He just needs to convince his little captive that she’s better off with him than flying free.  What is the price of Sanctuary in a dying world and is it worth the sacrifice?   Sanctuary’s Warlord is the first book in a trilogy. Please watch for the second book in summer 2019. This book is a dark dystopian romance with sensitive subject matter that may offend some readers, please read at your own risk.",
