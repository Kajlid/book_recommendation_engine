  "title": "The Author of Dead Men",
  "description": "An early-morning phone call wakes Chicago police lieutenant Devlin Cahill. Author Charlie Newton—who has been using Devlin as a consultant—has been connected to a brutal murder, and Charlie is missing. Without any more details, Devlin had to consider that Charlie was either a murderer or a murder victim—either way, isn't good. When Charlie shows up alive, Devlin has more questions to ask. What follows is a trip down an investigative rabbit hole filled with possible drug ties, FBI agents, a confrontational media, and Devlin finding that he, too, is under suspicion for multiple murders.How can Devlin clear his friend when he's also under the magnifying glass?Filled with the sights and sounds of life on the Chicago police force, The Author of Dead Men is cut from the same cloth as Joseph Wambaugh and Elmore Leonard. The language, style, and feel of the world swirling around Devlin and Charlie is tightly drawn, pulling readers in from the first pages and not letting them go until the end.",
