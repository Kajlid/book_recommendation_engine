  "description": "They defied the might of Genghis Khan...a brave young warrior from Frankistan and the beautiful Oriental maiden, Cho Soo. Theirs was a forbidden passion that was at once supremely delicate and yet relentless. Neither the Mongolian hordes nor the timeless sands of the Gobi Desert would keep them apart.In a spellbinding novel of romance, intrigue, and adventure, the phenomenal John Jakes weaves an unforgettable picture of two people caught in the cruel grip of history's most savage era. Here is storytelling at its very best, by the man who singlehandedly made the American Revolution come alive in his American Bicentennial Series. No other writer in history ever had three best-selling novels published in one year!",
