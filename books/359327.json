  "title": "Homo Domesticus: Notes from a Same-Sex Marriage",
  "description": "In this “sweet, funny, true tale of same-sex romance” ( PUBLISHERS WEEKLY ), David Valdes Greenwood sets the record straight on gay marriage-and reminds us what really matters to any couple. Here he charts the ups and downs of an all-too-human relationship: going on that first “non-date”; learning to share duties (and mince words) in the kitchen; dealing with a wandering eye; and realizing that life as a couple is all about discovering “just how many things you can approach differently without actually killing each other.” When along comes baby, David and his husband find out just how outrageous and maddeningly wonderful the ties of love can be. This is a radiant, whimsical testament to love and commitment by today's “gay Erma Bombeck” (NPR).",
