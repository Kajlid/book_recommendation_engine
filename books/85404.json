  "description": "Have you ever fallen for someone in secret, and you couldn't tell him because you're both male?My friend has. He used to work in a gym and it's pretty easy to \"catch\" an eyeful whether he liked it or not. There was where he met Sam, one of the personal trainers. He's handsome, has a perfect bod, a great buddy -- and he was totally crushing on him.But no one knew there that he was gay so when Sam caught him staring as he peeled his clothes off for the shower, my friend ran for home, afraid he'd be beaten up. He was chased, yes. All the way to his door. By Sam. And he confessed to taking a peep at my friend once or twice, too. And that he's gay. Too. In my friend's own words: \"This is about when I first arrived in Los Angeles on the summer when I fell hard for Sam. And I want to share this story with you.\"",
