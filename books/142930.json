  "description": "History affirms that man learns nothing from history. The Flood has ended and has left behind a cleansed, new world eager to be replenished. After the Great Scattering at Babel, the tribes of Noah's three sons have been driven to every corner of the earth. Yet the old struggles, the old disputes, and the old questions remain. Fifty years after Babel, the fledgling clan of Joktan has settled in the fertile grasslands of Uz to the west of Shinar and slowly begins to take root, but some of his sons are impatient to acquire honor, and lands of their own â€“ and gold. With endless fields and pastures to fill their days, their future looks rather bleak. And then they meet a trader who tells of mines and rivers glittering with gold. After learning that two of his brothers have forsaken their clan for the fabled mines of the South, a young boy named Job chases after them in what will begin the greatest adventure of his life. And during his adventures and trials, Job will discover the answer to the question that has plagued mankind since the Beginning.",
