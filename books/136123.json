  "description": "From sublimely silly, to heartfelt, to just plain bizarre, this collection of poems by first time authors Robbin and Kevin Tenglin is full of giggle-inducing rhymes that sound good to the ear and feel just as good on the tongue. The illustrations by Drew Stalker feel modern and add a visual dimension to each poem helping to further engage every imagination that dives into this book.",
