  "description": "Imaam Ibn Al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said:“Then, reflect on the favor of humankind, in terms of both types ofeloquence, verbal and written. So, in the first Soorah that He theExalted revealed to His Messenger, sallallaahu `alayhi wa sallam,He Said (what means): {Recite in the name of your Lord whocreated - Created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and yourLord is the most Generous - Who taught by the pen - Taught manthat which he knew not.} [Qur’aan 96:1-5].”He then said: “Teaching through the pen, which is the greatest gift andfavor He the Exalted has given His slaves, since through it,sciences become eternal, realities are established, words ofadvice are known, testimonies are preserved, the accounts ofdealings between people are precisely kept, and the news ofthe past is recorded for those who remain and who will comelater. Had it not been for writing, news from certain periodof time would be cut off from other times, traditions wouldbe obliterated, rulings would be confused, and the lattergenerations would not know the ways and methods of thepredecessors. The most confusion that occurs within peoplein matters of their religion happens due to forgetfulness thatwipes some aspects of knowledge from their hearts. So,Allaah the Exalted gave them the book as a container thatpreserves, like other containers that preserve goods fromperishing and breaking; so, the favor of Allaah the Exaltedby teaching through pen after the Qur’aan is of the greatestof favors.”",
