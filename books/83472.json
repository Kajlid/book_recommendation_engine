  "description": "A chance bet took Nikki from town life, with a wardrobe crammed with brightly coloured high-heeled shoes, and transported her deep into the African bush; her size five feet encased in practical if inelegant hiking boots.Game for Anything follows Nikkiâ€™s adventures and misadventures as she got to grips with living amongst axe-wielding staff, fires, floods and wild animals, especially elephants; so many elephants... The story starts in Botswana, and continues in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, where it becomes that of her family; with the addition of a conservationist husband, and later their young son Martin. When the changing political landscape threatens their blissful lifestyle, their roles and goals shift, and returning to the bush becomes more of a necessity than a luxury.",
