  "description": "Mental illness is greatly misunderstood. It is distorted, feared, and hidden - often leading to shame, guilt, and exacerbated mental health symptoms. Whole Happy and Healthy: A Revolutionary Approach to Understanding and Thriving with Mental Illness challenges this stigma and opens up new possibilities by exploring how people who experience mental illness can create a full, purposeful, and vibrant life by connecting with and continually expanding their perceptions - the intersection and interaction of emotions, intellect, intuition, and the senses - in twelve areas. Author Jessica R. Dreistadt reframes mental illness as a gift, rather than a deficit, to help readers discover and develop a holistic, integrative process that leads to more inner peace, emotional freedom, and joy. Whole Happy and Healthy changes the conversation about mental illness and emotional well-being, resulting in increased empathy, compassion, and resilience.",
