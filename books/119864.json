When her granny’s dying wish makes womanizer Cord McBain her guardian, Jonty finds herself in the hands of the man who promises to change her from a “sissy” into a rawhide-tough wrangler. Until the stormy night Cord discovers that Jonty would never be a man—only the wildest woman he’d ever taken in his arms.",
