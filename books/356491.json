  "title": "Desert Notes: Reflections in the Eye of a Raven",
  "description": "In this collection of narrative contemplations, reminiscent of Carlos Castaneda but without the drugs, Barry Hulstun Lopez invites us to walk with him in the desert, where \"things are rigidly clear and elemental.\" Away from the world, we see it more clearly. Sweating from all our pores, we remember our body.Desert Notes is discovery and rediscovery. The desert, the spring, the birds, the rattlesnake, the wind. And man, who, according to an Indian tale, comes to the desert like \"a boulder coming down the side of a mountain.\"Lopez gives us a fresh language. Desert Notes will lull you and shake you, and you will go back to it in the search for the clear and elemental.From the first-edition dust jacket.",
