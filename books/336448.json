  "description": "Do the Adamses have more to fear from the living or the dead? \"He grabbed the edge of the ice, clinging desperately. Murky water filled his boots, becoming as weighted anchors. Numbing cold squeezed his limbs as he tried to scream for help. But his chest hurt. It was hard to breathe. His heart beat wildly in his thin chest. Water seeped inside his clothing, his skin turned to ice. He stared up at the sky. The ice cracked again, creating fragments of drifting sheets. As his glove caught on the jagged edge, his hand slid out. Dark water swirled over him as he began to sink into the frigid depths of the black void.\" Twenty-five years have passed since eight-year-old Carl Weber drowned in Gray's Pond, and now one member of the Adams family has returned to Kimberton, Pennsylvania, to reside once again in the old mansion. It is time for Mark Adams to revisit his past, and for his wife Donna and daughter, Kim, to become acquainted with their neighbors, a rather odd old couple who own the farm next door. Each day, however, brings strange occurrences, increasing paranormal activity, till it becomes agonizingly clear that ghosts of the past are trying to make their presence known. As the search for the truth be.",
