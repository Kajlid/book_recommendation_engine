  "title": "The AI-fication of Jobs: Preparing Ourselves for the Future of Work",
  "description": "Undeniably, we are at the precipice of the next big technological transformation in the form of AI. Although critically important, the big questions still remain unanswered and under-researched– \"What will the impact of AI be on jobs?”, “Have we seen this before with past technologies like the Internet? Is it different this time?”And perhaps most importantly - \n“How do we dispel the uncertainty around the future of jobs with the advent of AI?”\nThis book is your guide to understanding how artificial intelligence will transform jobs. It is also a book for those who want to be a part of this transformation, and be actors to ensure that AI can benefit all of us - whether at the level of their organisation, governments, or just themselves as individuals.Although predicting the exact future may yet still be a farfetched aspiration, it doesn’t prevent us from structured thinking, learning from the past, and learning from others. In \"The AI-Fication of Jobs,\" Huy Nguyen Trieu presents a data-driven, practical, and proactive approach and perspective. Utilising the CDE framework (Cheaper-better-faster, Different, Enhancing) - a comprehensive innovation model, the book methodically analyses the impact of AI across various actors and sectors, revealing opportunities for adaptation and growth. With comprehensive analysis, actionable strategies, and clear insights, this book will change how you view the integration of AI into the workforce. It provides a roadmap for understanding and managing the technological changes ahead, ensuring you are prepared for the future of work.Our decisions today constitute our future tomorrow; as decision makers, industry leaders, individuals we all have a choice to make we do nothing, and we are moving into a world where some people will do incredibly well, but many many others will lose jobs and purpose.Or we do something and we can build a world of abundance from resources that were previously unimaginable.The challenges may be significant, the knowledge gaps vast, but with the right approach, they are surmountable. We have the chance to create a future where AI enhances and aids our society. The first step to acting is knowing.",
