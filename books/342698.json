  "description": "The Jeshua Channelings are a series of spiritual messages about the transformation of consciousness in the present era. Humanity is growing towards a heart-based consciousness, acknowledging the oneness of all that lives and letting go of fear-based ways of thinking and living.As you evolve into this new level of consciousness, a deep inner transformation takes place. Jeshua's channelings seek to support you in this process, offering guidance, inspiration and a clear perspective on where you are going.Jeshua is the Aramaic name for Jesus. He prefers this name, as it better conveys his humanness and kinship with us. In these channelings, Jeshua presents himself as our brother and friend, who knows about the hardships of human existence and who wishes to lighten our burdens by sending us messages of love and hope.Jeshua's messages shed light on our soul history and destination and they also deal with everyday issues such as relationships, health, work, and more. They are written in a clear and accessible language.",
