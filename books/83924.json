  "description": "Cooper is one of the happiest guys around, except for the last month. He’s been crushing on the assistant in the training room, Derek Kent, but when he goes to ask him out, Derek instead pledges the fraternity. Cooper doesn’t want him to become a target, so he tries to wait his attraction out. Now it’s time for Cooper to be in charge of the fraternity’s annual Valentine’s date party. He knows he’s going to have to make sure the kegs are filled, the music works, no fights break out, and keep the fourteen pledges in line. However, it’s hard for him to keep his mind on his job when he sees Derek coming into the party wearing nothing but Cupid’s wings and boxer briefs. Cooper knows as an active member he shouldn’t touch the pledge, however, every man has his breaking point. Will this be his? Authors This book may be read as a stand-alone story but for better reading enjoyment, you may want to read secondary characters, Hayden and Lawson’s story in Bewitched at the Pumpkin Patch.",
