  "description": "There once existed a collective of Gods called the Duwaiu. Mortal long ago - now bound together for a thousand years - the Duwaiu swore allegiance to the Vildarii: three faceless entities that governed the spirit worlds, Otherworlds and the Hell plains; ensuring that the great wheel of life continued to turn.But the second Vildarii, Guardian of the Hell plains, desired that there be ultimate suffering upon the world and drove all the Duwaiu Gods into madness. As consequence for their insanity, the Rhai-Angof - a ferocious female race - were hunted unto extermination and the essence of the Vildarii was crafted into three human men.Lilyth, the last remnant of the Rhai-Angof, fights to survive against the ruling, tyrannical Vildarii regime. Her journey leads to encounters with William, the only remaining Duwaiu God; Sky, an ethereal being of otherwordly magic; and a philandering sky-pirate named Vergo. As they progress through their adventure together, Lilyth slowly begins to piece back memories that were stolen by the magic of the Vildarii. Eventually, putting together the puzzle of the regimeâ€™s evil scheme, it leads to an unforgettable climax, where races and worlds collide.",
