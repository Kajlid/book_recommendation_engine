  "description": "In the city, I belonged to no one. Here in the wild, I'm an omega for a pack to claim.Inside the walls I was a respected scientist. Out here I'm vulnerable, desperate, and soon to be at the mercy of the beasts and barbarians who rule these harsh lands. But that is not the worst of it.When the suppressants that keep my shameful secret wear off, overwhelming, unimaginable need will take hold of me. I'm an omega about to go into heat, and I know what comes next...But I'm not the only one with instincts far beyond my control. Alphas roam this wilderness, savage men driven by their very nature to claim me more fiercely than I can imagine, paying no heed to my screams as one brutal climax after another is ripped from my helplessly willing body.It won't be long now, and when the mating starts, it will be nothing short of a frenzy.Publisher's Note: Frenzy includes spankings and rough, intense sexual scenes. If such material offends you, please don't buy this book.",
