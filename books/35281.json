  "title": "Women in the Martial Arts",
  "description": "Many women learn of martial arts through a male companion's interest in kung-fu movies or a six-week self-defense course. Some venture beyond. This book contains the stories, in essay and poetry form, of a group of women who have trained for at least seven years in this demanding activity. Many speak of martial arts as an equalizer of power, with skill being more important than raw strength. Other benefits include endurance, confidence, and determination. There are a variety of viewpoints among this select group, which ranges from a physically disabled student to a Native American practitioner. This collection fills an important niche in a male-dominated sport.",
