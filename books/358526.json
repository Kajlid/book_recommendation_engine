  "description": "Beneath the surface of Cane River, Texas, is a mystery that tangles the town like the vines that slither into yards and swallow up houses. Early in the history of the town, a little girl disappeared; now she makes appearances with the vines, and Eugene Wheeler may be the only one who has the answer to the mystery. His son Bill Wheeler returns to Cane River following the death of his wife and unborn child. He is lonely, looking to reconnect with his crazy father and forget the pain of his loss. But strange occurrences surround him. Phantom breezes in his apartment, strange voices from empty rooms, and a little girl who wants more from him than he knows all follow him. And only his father seems to know why. Bill meets Sandy Duprie, but before their relationship can blossom, the strange little girl with the too-wide smile takes something precious from them both, leading him on a journey of terror into the heart of the Texas swamp that is Cane River.",
