When he saves the gorgeous but frightened doctor from a boating mishap, sparks fly. It’s supposed to be an easy mission, but then his heart and mind get tangled in the danger surrounding her. When infectious-disease specialist Jules Moretti is plagued by strange incidents she’s paired with their pilot-turned-bodyguard to ensure her safety while working on top-secret projects. As they grow closer, she learns there’s more to her protector than she first assumed. But then threats escalate, and she realizes that some things are better left buried.
