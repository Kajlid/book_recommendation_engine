  "description": "The freedom of the range, the bawling of the longhorns, the lonesome night watch beneath a vast, starry sky—they got into a man's blood until he knew there was nothing better than the life of a cowboy...except the love a good woman.PearlIn the West there were only two kinds of women—the wives and mothers and daughters, and the good-time girls. It was said that Pearl Belladonna could show a man the best time ever, but Sean O'Ryan had not come to the gold fields looking for a floozy. He wanted gold to buy a ranch, and a virtuous woman to make a wife. The sensual barroom singer might tempt his body with her lush curves, and tease his mind with her bright wit, but she wasn't for him. From her red curls to her assumed name, nothing about her seemed real until a glimpse into her heart convinced Sean that the lady was, indeed, a pearl beyond price.",
