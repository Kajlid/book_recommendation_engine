  "description": "'I Have Not Answered', Adam Grydehøj's powerful debut novel, brings a Scandinavian chill to the literature of Scotland. Stark, lyrical prose roots this supernatural thriller in a keen sense of place.A young researcher has come to the windswept Shetland islands in pursuit of a story and in flight from his past.He is not alone. Out on the beach, at the cliff edge, in his room at night, something is watching. He is haunted by a story that cannot be recalled and a love that will not die. As summer ends and the season of darkness approaches, the line between haunted and haunter begins to blur, and this meditation on the masks we wear to hide our true selves transforms into a horror story of the soul.'The sense of place delivered in the book is not just authentic but altogether transporting' - Peter Dabbene, Foreword Reviews'A striking contribution to the literature of the weird' - S.T. Joshi",
