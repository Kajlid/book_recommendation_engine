  "description": "For generations two peoples have fought over the mountains of Thanador. The native Tarra'ans hate the recent arrivals, the Contolte, and eventually that hatred turns to war. Yaotl and Jensen, though, are a Tarra'an and a Contolte who live as brothers. Yearning to stay together , they find no safe place where both can be welcomed.  Frorn across the great water, Nadia is a missioner from the clinic who is able to walk outside the battle. When her path crosses that of the two men, and she finds one of them injured, they decide to escape down the burning, warring mountain together. She leads them to a Tarra'an village that claims to love TrueGod and promises to protect both the men, but some hatred takes time to fade, and before long staying in the village is almost as dangerous to the trio as setting off alone.  But they also find allies and friends, even a little forbidden romance, and when the evil of the war threatens to destroy the whole mountain, love and friendship may be the only things to save any of them, Tarra'an and Contolte alike.  Visit new lands in this installment of the Tales of Balia series, the Christian historical fantasy series--always with a satisfying dose of romance--that takes readers across lush landscapes and into rich cultures as the deity TrueGod seeks lost and broken people, healing hearts and lives while he calls them home. Readable in any order, grab a Balia book and enter a new world today.",
