  "description": "Dr. Emilie Saunderson is driven to finish her late husband's research. Her quest brings her to Antarctica, where she hopes to find a measure of peace in the isolated and icy wilderness. It's the last place on earth she expects to be given a second chance at love. Tom Wolinski loves his work at the bottom of the world. Damaged by his dark past, he has vowed never to get close to anyone - a promise that's easy to keep in a place with no permanent residents. That is, until Emilie arrives, and he's irresistibly drawn to her warmth and inner strength. Emilie has no desire to get involved with another adventurer, and Tom has made it clear he's not interested in putting down roots. But as they work together to survive in the harshest of climates, they turn to one another for comfort. Is the heat between them enough to melt the ice around their hearts, and bind them together forever? 50,000 words",
