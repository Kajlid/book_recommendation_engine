  "description": "In the village of Cranford, decorum is maintained at all times. Despite their poverty, the ladies are never vulgar about money or their lack of it, and always follow the rules of propriety. But this discretion and gentility does not keep away tragedy and when the worst happens, the Amazons of Cranford show the true strength of their honest affections. A masterpiece of social comedy, Cranford is as moving as it is funny, and as sharp as it is tender.",
