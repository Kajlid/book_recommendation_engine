You get trapped inside a snow cave -- your \"own\" snow cave, that is.5. You're the only person in the \"whole\" grade who can't sing.Alice can't seem to do anything right anymore, especially where her big brother Lester is concerned. When he gets really angry with her, Alice doesn't know how to fix things between them. How is she going to get Lester to talk to her again? And will life ever get any easier? Fourth grade can't end soon enough!The second of three prequels to the beloved Alice series, \"Alice in Blunderland\" lets younger readers get to know the girl everyone wants to be friends with, and proves once again that Phyllis Reynolds Naylor knows the fears, foibles, and fun of being a girl.",
