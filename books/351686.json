  "description": "Part love story, part historical drama, part coming-of-age novel, Romance Language begins in 2007 as 17-year-old Petra runs off from college and shows up in far-away Romania on a quest to find the father she's never known and to uncover the tumultuous events that led to her birth. The story also flashes back to 1989 when Petra's mother, a magazine writer, is assigned to write an expose of Europe's most brutal communist regime.",
