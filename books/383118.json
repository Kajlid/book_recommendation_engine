  "description": "Dedicated to Whom It May Concern, Don't Let the Turkeys Get You Down is Sandra Boynton's hilarious commentary and 150 full-color drawings identifying the ubiquitous turkey's distinguishing characteristics and most common habitats. Any similarity to actual persons living or in Los Angeles is strictly unintentional, including the stuff on page 54 that will remind many people of Snigbert Knuddsen.From the turkeys extremely large ego to its arrogant behavior, the traits are classified. Boynton traces the turkey's influence on history, the neighborhood, the family, more. Several profiles in turkitude and a pop quiz further uncover turkeys in the immediate vicinity.Forewarned is turkeys possess absolutely unwarranted and absolutely unshakable self-confidence. They insist on high visibility, and can show up at a party, in an argument, on the jogging path. The reader's best defense is through study of this important manual, keying in on the single most important turkey a turkey never knows that it is a turkey.",
