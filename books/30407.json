  "description": "This collection of some of Elder Holland's most memorable and powerful talks will inspire us to keep our focus and our faith on the one source of strength that will never fail us: Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Included in this collection are such classic addresses as \"The Other Prodigal,\" \"He Hath Filled the Hungry with Good Things,\" \"Come unto Me,\" \"An High Priest of Good Things to Come,\" \"A Handful of Meal and a Little Oil,\" \"As Doves to Our Windows,\" and many others.The messages gathered here will help us to remember His promises in all our days of trial and challenge. When our souls are spiritually depleted, we can trust that the Lord will provide us with the bread of life and the living waters. When we struggle to fulfill our callings, we can trust that He will sustain and support our efforts. When our lives are hectic and overwhelming, we can trust that the Lord will bless us with peace.",
