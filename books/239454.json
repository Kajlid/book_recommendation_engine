  "title": "From Beer To Maternity",
  "description": "Janet knows she needs to lose weight - she hasn't seen her feet since the nineties - but when she staggers up onto a table at the work's New Year's party, with enough beer inside her to power Australia for a year, and challenges her mortal enemy, Jack, to a weight-loss competition, she has no idea what she's started. She can't even remember it the next day, but her drunken rant has already become an internet sensation, and now there's no backing out of it. Jack wants nothing to do with it - although he hasn't seen his feet since the eighties - but with his doctor forcing him to lose weight and Janet's constant hostility towards him, he is soon on board, and the competition between them is fierce. So, it's on! Every month for a year the rivals compete to lose the most weight in diets set by their colleagues, ranging from the reasonably sensible to the completely and utterly insane! Attracting full media attention.",
