  "description": "What happens when heroes are as broken as the world they must reforge?​A mad king’s genocide destroyed Alea's home and left her sanity in tatters. Caught in the crossfire between the gods and their creators, Alea realizes the darkness inside her is the only thing that can end the bloodshed. Across enemy lines, bastard lieutenant Brentemir Barrackborn is horrified by the blood on his hands. He must choose between the gods he worships and newfound family if he has any hope of redemption—or surviving the war.“I expected a hero to save us all. Turns out, I was thinking of the wrong part of the story. In the beginning, we aren't saved. There are only fragments and grief. The pieces must be gathered and flames kindled before I'm reforged. I don't know what shape I will take. Those pieces might become a hero...or a monster.”Smoke and Rain won New Apple Literary's Excellence in Independent Publishing Award in 2015 and became an internationally bestselling fantasy in 2019This series contains scenes of intimacy between queer characters. If this makes you uncomfortable, this is not the series for you.",
