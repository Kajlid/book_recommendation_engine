  "title": "In the West",
  "description": "For over twenty years John Vicente has sought to avenge his brother's death. Near the point of giving up, a prisoner's confession sets him once again on the path of revenge. But justice is not so easily administered, and vengeance becomes muddled when the lives of others are interwoven along the interminable and uncertain road of retribution. John Vicente soon finds himself pitched between the love of a woman well-versed in retaliation, a young man fast with a gun but too young to understand truth from deceit, and his brother's assassin grown ever more skilled in the manipulation of the inexperienced. They find themselves, every last one, in the West. A land not made for the weak. A place and time where suffering is the default of life, and where truth must be found and reckoned with through the unrelenting harshness of a world all their own.",
