  "description": "Out of PrintA standalone title in the Cougar Challenge series. With the big four-oh looming, Larissa Cross is more than ready to shed the roles that have defined her and make drastic changes. Gone are the widowed Army wife, soccer mom and empty nester. She's even setting aside the schoolteacher until fall. A naughty challenge issued by fellow erotic romance booklovers on their blog, Tempt the Cougar, has come at the perfect time and ignited Rissa's competitive drive. It's going to be a glorious summer full of hot younger man lovin' for a new cougar on the prowl. Rawr! Tattooed and pierced fireman JD Harmon is tempting prey but there's much more to the hunk than his bad boy good looks. A one-night stand isn't in his plans, and sex-no matter how mind-blowing-won't distract him from his goals. JD intends to tame the wicked cougar and stake a claim on her heart.",
