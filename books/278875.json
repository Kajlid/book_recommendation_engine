  "description": "Heard the one about the dying father? In this savagely brilliant graphic novel by slam poet Daphne Gottlieb ( Final Girl ) and Hothead Paisan creator Diane DiMassa, a 19-year-old woman named Sasha loses her father to cancer and takes a job in the hospital where he had worked as a doctor. Moving from room to room with her clipboard of forms, Sasha encounters the insane, the suicidal, and the brave -- then returns to her office to look up all her friends' and enemies' medical records. Taking its title from Freud's Jokes and their Relation to the Unconscious , Gottlieb and DiMassa's first collaboration is both moving and darkly funny. Where comedy meets chemo, where mirth meets mortality, Jokes and the Unconscious explores the murky terrain of grief -- a shadowland of memory, sexual escape, and morbid snickering.",
