  "description": "The most Christ-centered book on witnessing yet written. And Christ-centered is where witnessing must be. - Gene Edwards-Rosalind Rinker writes from her own adventurous life with God, sharing her down-to-earth, humorous, and always profound experiences in the realm of witnessing about Jesus Christ. Previous books on witnessing have been so absorbed in the content of the message that the person witnessed to seems relatively unimportant. Here you will find more than an expos√© of wrong methods. Instead there are simple, practical suggestions for sincere believers.Love is the first requisite. Love teaches us (a) when to speak of Christ and who He is, and (b) when to speak of the differences His presence makes in daily living and relationships . . . It is time we forgot methods and returned to the subject matter used 2000 years The living, resurrected Christ.The frequent mention of listening, sharing, and asking questions will open up a whole new world for most of us. Rosalind's honesty brings into sharp focus our lack of confidence in God, and encourages us to a new course of action.",
