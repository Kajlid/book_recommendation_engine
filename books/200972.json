  "description": "Lusiphur is a young elf whose persona has been forged by life on the mean streets of Port Sarnwog. Then he meets Lirilith, a prep school debutante who's looking for more out of life than her upper-crust lifestyle can provide her. Together, they find love despite the forces that work against them. But when an enemy from his past nearly stabs Lusiphur to death, the young lovers find their paths being pulled apart. Passion, sorrow, hatred, true love, and cold-blooded murder, in the tradition of all great love stories.",
