  "description": "Part one of the epic trilogy that combines historic fiction with fantasy and speculative fiction follows Morad Qutuz, a Saudi Plastic Surgeon, as he starts noticing that events around him don’t quite mesh with his memories – and that his memories are starting to duplicate. Just as he finds a thread to follow to the source of his headaches and confusion, he is jettisoned from everything he knows into an adventure he didn’t want that carries him across time and space. The journey truly begins when he begins to seek the truth inside himself.",
