  "description": "In the wake of the Worldmind/Stellarax Crisis, the Sentinels have scattered to the four winds. But thereâ€™s little time to relax and recover, as the dangers facing Earth have never been greater. Esro and Mondrian cross the depths of space in a desperate attempt to stave off galactic civil war, while Pulsar and her sister work to assemble an entirely new team of heroes back on Earth. Now time is short, and the supply of heroes shorter, and enemies old and new lurk at every turn; foremost among them the deadly mechanoid from space--the being known only as METALGOD! Presenting the first volume in the new SENTINELS story arc, \"Order Above All\"--where action and adventure await at every turn, and nothing is quite what it seems! Interior illustrations by Chris Kohler; cover art by Chris Kohler and Sarah White. \"I've already bought the next Sentinels book! Van's got me hooked!\" --Percival Constantine, author of FALLEN",
