  "description": "Lioness. That’s the first word that comes to mind when I see the brilliant redhead selling cupcakes at the hockey arena.With the soul of an artist and the spirit of a nomad, Bea Turner is gorgeous, quirky, and refreshing. She’s also my teammate’s little sister.As the Tennessee Thunderbolts' Rookie, I should steer clear. I’m here to play hockey and provide much-needed financial security for my family. To do that, I need to avoid distractions.Bea doesn’t just distract me; she flips my world upside down. One bad joke has me pursuing her. One date and I crave more. Calling her mine? Well, now I’m dreaming of a future.The life of a hockey player — trades, travel, uncertainty — isn’t for the heart of a creative. Bea desires adventure and possibility, not early morning skates and strict exercise regimens.When I’m thrust into a situation at odds with Bea’s dream career, I know I can’t hold her back.If we’re meant to be, we’ll make it work. But what if we’re not?What if my greatest regret is letting my lioness go?",
