Emigrating from their failing world, they land on an Earth-like planet and conquer the technologically backward natives that they contemptuously call ‘barbarians’. This book takes you on a breathtaking journey into the world of the Zon and their rebellious barbarian subjects, riven with battles over power, culture, gender and will.",
