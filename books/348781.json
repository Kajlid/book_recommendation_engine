  "description": "Many years ago, on a dark and stormy night, the disfigured and enigmatic Doctor John Smith invited his closest friends, Inspector Victor Schaeffer and his wife, Jacqueline, to a dinner to celebrate his birthday. A few hours later all the occupants in that house had been changed ­ some were dead, others mentally scarred forever by the events of that night.So, what happened to the distinguished dinner guests on that evening? Perhaps, we'll never know. But two clues have led to much speculation ­ found outside the study window, a charred umbrella with a curved red handle and found inside the house, a blood-stained copy of Stevenson's The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde.For one person, this night represented an ending: an ending to one thousand years of darkness and an ending to ten years of light.But, for everyone else, is there no ending of this one night of Hell?Chronological Placement: This story takes place between the television adventures, Survival and the 1996 TV Movie.This is a full-cast audio play produced by Big Finish Productions.",
