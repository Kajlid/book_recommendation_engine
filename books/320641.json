  "description": "The Moonlight TrilogyContains all 3 unabridged editions of the award-winning Moonlight Beach, Moonlight Canyon and Moonlight Rocks.All three books feature some rough rides but first ask yourself...Would you get into a car with a stranger? What if he was really handsome, maybe rich but somewhat mysterious? Maybe you shouldn't... but what the hell, some may go for it. Read and find out what happened to Fay in Moonlight Beach when she accepted a ride from Roy. Susan got into a pickup truck with Steve in Moonlight Canyon, but then she didn't really have much of a choice and Steve wasn't that attractive given all his scars. No one offered Jessy a ride in Moonlight Rocks so she had to take Marty's car for her escape attempt. Mona takes a ride with Ben in Moonlight Rip Tide but that book hasn't yet been released...What's the worse that could happen with these strange rides? Read the books if you really want to know but think about it... Left for dead after a crash? Drugged and murdered maybe? Taken to the Bate's Motel for a meeting with mother? Gives me the shivers just thinking about it but you really need to find out.Scroll up and read a sample... better yet splurge a little and buy a copy today!",
