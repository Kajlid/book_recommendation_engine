  "description": "I am trapped in Hell by a demon that seems to be more powerful than Satan himself. A prisoner in a nightmarish castle where I get lost in eerie mazes for days, while my baby grows inside me… I'm running out of time, but I cannot escape, so I have to strike a bargain with my captor. But what he wants from me is too much. I cannot give it to him and live with myself after.I wish Adrian, Seth, and Davien would rescue me now. But this devil… this monster that calls himself the King in Yellow keeps them away. No one can penetrate his ancient magic. He’s more than he seems, more than he says. The only way I can return to my lovers and finish the job I started is to pass his trials and accept his proposal. I knew there would be a price to pay. I just never imagined it would be so… crushing.",
