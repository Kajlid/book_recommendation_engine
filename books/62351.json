In the twenty first century, vampires are out in the open and even have rights. Well, that sucks for someone who is born to kill them.Now she must find a new venue for her talents. The shifter community has decided to reveal itself, and what better way than a live TV concert to introduce them. Eva, because of her supernatural ties and relationship, at one time with a WereLion, is asked to host the concert.Eva's Vampire Slayer ability allows her to be a great Rock Star, and this is the story of how those two wondrous things tie together in her current life.From Book:Jack and Aiden both stood, shouting my name, trying to embarrass me.

Thanks guys, you're the best!\" I waved and pointed at the boys, who ducked their heads.Everyone in the audience turned and clapped at them. They graciously smiled and bowed, then took their seats. I giggled uncontrollably all the way down the aisle way.http://www.ahrcnyc.org/http://www.evaheartvs.com",
