  "title": "Humboldt: Or, the Power of Positive Thinking",
  "description": "The Iraq War? The housing market collapse? College football's concussion crisis? How can anyone be expected to understand such complexities, especially a \"horticulturally dyslexic\" farmboy with an eighth-grade education and a penchant for perpetually misunderstanding, misreading, and misinterpreting the world? Born on a farm in Ohio, Humboldt is content to spend his life \"outside amongst the oxygen and unhurried hydrocarbons.\" But when his father's farm is threatened with foreclosure, Humboldt is forced to save it by enrolling in college, leading him on an epic absurdist adventure through Washington politics, New York performance art, Boston blue-bloods, post-Katrina New Orleans, multiple murders, and holy resurrections. Mixing the speed and structure of Voltaire's Candide with a heavy dose of Joycean wordplay, and a love of literary acrobatics worthy of David Foster Wallace, Scott Navicky's debut novel assails some of modern America's most cherished beliefs and institutions with the battle cry: \"Ticklez l'infame!\"",
