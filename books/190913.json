  "description": "Speakers in James Tate's poems are and are not like those we know: a man's meditation on gardening renders him witless; another man traps theories and then lets them loose in a city park; a nun confides that \"it was her / cowboy pride that got her through\"; a gnome's friend inhabits a world where \"a great eschatological ferment is at work. \"Shroud of the Gnome\" is a bravura performance in Tate's signature style: playful, wicked, deliriously sober, charming, and dazzling. Here, once again, one of America's most masterful poets celebrates the inexplicable in his own strange tongue.",
