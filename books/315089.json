There’s a tacit understanding they are off limits to one another, as neither one wants to risk getting involved with a long-time local and dealing with the inevitable awkwardness that would ensue. But when you live with someone, boundaries get blurred, and hearts get involved, despite best intentions. And when one of them has a secret identity, it’s bound to get complicated.",
