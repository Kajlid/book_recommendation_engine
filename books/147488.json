  "description": "To Rylan Bradley, love is overrated and forever only happens in fairy tales. She’s perfectly content spending Friday nights at the bar with her friend Allie and a cold beer while shooting down every guy that comes her way. Wesley Kade is new in town, still picking up the pieces of a past he never thought he’d have to leave behind. When a chance meeting in an elevator introduces him to Rylan he’s forced to face what he’s feared all along. It will take a fateful night, an old flame and an unread letter to show them that love doesn’t have to hurt and that second chances do exist. But can they trust each other enough to let go and let love in? Or will they continue to let happened to them haunt their happiness and take it all away?",
