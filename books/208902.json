  "description": "From white trash mill village girl to Senior-Cinderella.  In Alabama Blue, Toni K.Pacini, shares her tumultuous journey. A girl raised-up like an invasive weed in an Alabama cotton mill village where illiteracy, bigotry, religious fanaticism, and abuse were as commonplace as fried chicken on Sunday.  Toni’s momma, the village drunk and a woman who married seven times, tried repeatedly to kill Toni in her womb. Toni doggedly survived the clothes hangers, poisons, and all the terrors that followed, after she flowed forth in momma’s toxic vodka laced waters. Like that wild vine that covers most southern states, kudzu, Toni proved to be a weed that would not easily die.From pillar to post, and coast to coast, she sought a dauntinglyillusive refuge. Toni fled a life predestined for sorrow from cold cradle to cold crypt, and she made it! Her life needed a major re-write, and in Alabama Blue, she rewrote the hopelessness into hope, the sorrow into joy, and left the past to rest, as she moved forward into a new tomorrow.",
