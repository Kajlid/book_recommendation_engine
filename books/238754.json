  "description": "From New York Times and USA Today's best selling author, Stacy Borel, comes the series finale of The Core Four.  Hadley Marten's first year at LSU was supposed to be a fresh start. Somewhere she could reinvent herself and leave behind old stigmas.  Eighteen years of being a nobody, and she was ready to be a somebody.  Just when she thought she could finally take life by the horns, she heard a familiar voice say her name.  Wrigley Brooks was the boy she always wanted, but could never have. He was the last single Brooks brother.  One forced friendship, budding feelings, and a man that can't take no for an answer, has her world turned upside down.  Life was determined to show Hadley that there was a lesson in everything. Whether she liked it or not.",
