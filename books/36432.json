  "description": "After A Winter Scandal comes a new season for unexpected love in this sparkling second novel in New York Times bestselling author Candace Camp’s Legend of St. Dwynwen trilogy. No one in tiny Chesley knows the truth about Damaris Howard; a woman of wealth and beauty, she rarely allows anyone to get close. Her past was marked by scandal and abandonment—better to stay aloof and reinvent herself. Then Damaris meets Alec Stafford, the Earl of Rowden. The tall, handsome border lord is a man of quiet but deep passion, raised to show no weakness and burned once before by a woman’s love. But when he and Damaris cross paths inside London society, they set sparks of attraction blazing—and rumors flying. And when someone abducts Damaris from the city streets, Alec must stake more than his reputation to rescue her. . . . Finding out who’s behind a dangerous plot plunges Alec and Damaris together in an intimacy that melts their well-guarded reserve, proving that true love’s rich rewards may just be worth the risks.",
