  "description": "MIRIA BECOMES HIS is Book One of “Owned by the Master”, a BDSM Master-Slave Romance. It is intended for mature readers.   Miria lives in a decadent, dangerous world we can scarcely imagine—the world of the Darwellian Collapse.   One hundred years in the future, resources have dwindled, and the human species along with it. Opportunistic men have seized absolute power, and the concept of equality is a distant memory. Decadence and luxury are the pursuits of the privileged, while those of the lower class eke out lives more reminiscent of medieval times, rather than that of an advanced civilization.  The privileged spend their days in pursuits of the flesh, where no sensual act is too bizarre, no treatment of those beneath them too cruel. Human life means nothing to these would-be gods.  It is into this world that nineteen year old Miria is thrust when she is abducted from her bed by men who see her as chattel. But when she meets the strong and mysterious Ronan, a man who commands himself as he does others, she encounters both wonders and evils she could not have imagined before, and her life is forever changed.  While this is a BDSM romance, the world depicted herein is a very dark and dangerous place. The non-privileged are treated as if they do not matter, and are used for the amusement of the wealthy. Nothing is off-limits. Should you choose to read this story, you will encounter graphic scenes that may shock you, or even upset you. Please be advised that this story is for mature adults who can handle scenes of decadence and violence. It is not for the faint of heart.",
