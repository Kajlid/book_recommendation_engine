  "title": "Her Argument: Epiphanies, Theories, Confessions",
  "description": "In a vein at once playful, philosophical and lyrical, artist Ellary Eddy builds a provocative case for the value of self-inquiry, authenticity, and radical astonishment at the marvel of existence. Using her own experiences as raw material, Eddy's essays muse upon the nature of identity and explore the meaning of life in general. Her Argument coaxes you to throw off the shackles of everyday reality and, Tigger-like, bounce free, stripes rippling, into the frabjous wilderness of being. Eddy romps through a wide range of topics: sex, style, play and dating, philosophy, poetry and dildos, art, joy, aging like a motherfucker, and the 'Good Life'.",
