  "description": "What happens when a man is suddenly left heartbroken by his girlfriend? Does he move onto the next woman as fast as he can? Does he start stalking her next boyfriend for some kind of revenge? Or does he randomly meet another man going through the exact same thing and instantly start some kind of bromance with him? These two men weren't ever supposed to meet, yet crazily they did and now Newcastle will never be the same again. It's as though on their own, they wouldn't be recognised in a police line up, yet together, they can be picked out at ease in a crowded park.This is the story of Bruce and Morris, then all the strange things they did together, just to help each-other avoid another heartache. This is the story of wingman meeting wingman, yet neither one of them know how to use those wings, or fly alone without the other one beside him.",
