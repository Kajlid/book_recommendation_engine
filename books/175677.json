  "description": "It is the winter of 1942 in the Greek town of Larissa. The peaceful life of the town has given way to the chaos of war. Two girls, one Greek, the other German, come together in an unlikely union to save the lives of Jews targeted by the Nazis. Fourteen year old Zoe Lambros' faith in God is shattered after her mother's death at the hands of the German Commander. She determines to defy the enemy in every way she can--including a festering urge to kill the German Commander's daughter, Eva Muller. Eva Muller has a tortured past, and a secret, if revealed, will lead to certain death at the hands of her father. Despite knowing the risk, Eva is working with the village priest to help the Jews escape. With her activities closely observed, Eva needs help to continue the clandestine operation. Zoe Lambros is not who Eva has in mind but they have to put aside their mutual antipathy to each other and work together. They know that one wrong move will put an end to their lives.Awards:- Finalist Gay/Lesbian Fiction - International Book Awards 2015 - Finalist First Novel - IAN (Independent Author Network) Book Of The Year Awards 2015- Finalist Outstanding Historical Fiction - IAN (Independent Author Network) Book Of The Year Awards 2015",
