  "description": "Clare Elian has always known the risk of being married to a rich, handsome younger man like Marc. She just never thought she'd be the one to bring the danger home. But when she gives birth to two gorgeous babies - one of each, naturally - she discovers motherhood isn't quite the cinch she'd expected. Desperate to escape back to her chic chain of boutique flower shops, she hires Jenna, a confident, efficient nanny keen to escape a relationship that has gone horribly wrong. Before long, a deadly rivalry emerges for control of the nursery. And as events spiral out of their control, both women find themselves forced to make wrenching decisions about love, loyalty and motherhood.",
