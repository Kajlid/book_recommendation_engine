  "description": "Poetry. Whether working within the confines of short poem, or stretching out into a \"domestic novel\" the poems collected in THE MORNING are a delight. Tracking the minute changes of the everyday with exquisite attention, Snell's eye and ear enliven whatever they touch. This is a poet who, like Reznikoff, dares to write \"in the great world small\" and knows enough to let things speak for themselves.",
