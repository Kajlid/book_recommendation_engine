  "description": "Time is running out to find the Qilin.We were thrown into Haret without a plan, and we have a lot of ground to cover. Allies would be nice, but not everyone is happy to see my team return. We’re finding more secrets than intel.Plus, I’m not allowed to shank my new mother-in-law, who definitely deserves a horn to the heart.My guys are eager to share their home with me, but darkness seeps in everywhere we go. I’m ready for some serious sugar, as soon as we open the Path and save the two worlds.Good thing I work best on my feet - all four of them.The problem is, we’re heading under the sea - where a tail is more useful than wings or hooves. This girl has a few more tricks to play, though.I’m Carlyle Licorne, and I’m so much more than a Qilin.",
