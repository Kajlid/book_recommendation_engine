  "title": "Sleeveless",
  "description": "Sleeveless is the darkly humorous and provocative story of Lisha, a sardonic and very twisted teenager living on Long Island in the late 80s, dealing with the accidental death of her younger sister after a botched DIY abortion. Alienated from her peers and a fanatically religious mother, Lisha begins exploring the creative potential of self-abuse, through what she refers to as skin design. When her razor art becomes the latest trend at school, it’s all she can do to maintain the purity of her original vision and protect the memory of her sister. Employing a variety of styles and shifting tempos to describe Lisha’s descent into an inner-world of visceral creativity, Sleeveless is an intensely psychological novel, a stunning debut by this gifted writer.",
