  "description": "Come to Majipoor, the magnificently exotic planet of Lord Valentine's Castle. Come to Hissune, favorite of Valentine, as he probes the deepest secrets of Majipoor's long past in the depths of the great Labyrinth. Join him as he becomes one with its many peoples--dukes & generals, thieves & murderers, Ghayrogs & Metamorphs--& discovers wonder, terror, longing & love, learning wisdom that will shape his destiny. 2nd book in the series begun with Lord Valentine's Castle, this is a collection of stories set on Majipoor connected by short interludes with Hissune. As the copyright page says: \"Portions of this book have appeared in somewhat different form in Omni, Fantasy & Science Fiction & Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine.\" It adds some interesting details to the history & geography of the big planet, but does not really further the story of Valentine.PrologueThesme & the GhayrogThe Time of the BurningIn the Fifth Year of the VoyageCalintane ExplainsThe Desert of Stolen DreamsThe Soul Painter & the ShapeshifterCrime & PunishmentAmong the Dream SpeakersA Thief in Ni-MoyaVoriax & Valentine(Chapter 11 untitled)",
