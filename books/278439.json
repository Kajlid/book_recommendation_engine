  "description": "THE DEVIL YOU KNOW is a tradepaperback edition of the sold-out limited edition of Poppy's latest short story collection. In her third short story collection, Poppy Z. Brite finds fresh ways of exploring territory both familiar and strange. Here you’ll meet the Devil and his giant cat last seen in the pages of Bulgakov, the gourmand coroner of New Orleans, the mad-genius chef who can’t stand to have his cheese list criticized, and an assortment of Crescent City characters who also appear in Brite’s novels Liquor and Prime. Poppy Z. Brite has found a way of writing about New Orleans that bypasses the clichés and approaches the city’s true the hard-working, hard-partying cooks; the ways in which race, class, and sexual orientation do and don’t matter; the love of bottom feeders, be they crustaceans or politicos; the million little juxtapositions of sacred and profane, bizarre and mundane, sublime and ridiculous that make up the everyday life of New Orleans. Some of these stories are set elsewhere, but Brite always returns home in the end.",
