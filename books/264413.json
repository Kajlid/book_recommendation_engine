  "title": "Mrs Durham's Girl: And the Stories That She Told",
  "description": "The idea of people watching is far from being a new one. It has been around as long as there have been people Ann's book, Mrs Durham's Girl, elevates this to an art form. All of her stories contain, humour, loss, grief, sadness and general quirkiness of the human condition. She tells a story in a refreshingly uncluttered and, at times, painfully accurate way. Anyone can merely report the facts. Ann paints a picture with words that allows you to empathise with the characters. A storyteller is part historian and part social commentator. Ann covers both of these wonderfully.",
