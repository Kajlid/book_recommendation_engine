He succeeds on all levels. His art is a hit in her gallery; his \"to do\" list for the bedroom eye-opening and his attention to her like nothing she's ever known.But something isn't quite right. He disappears for hours at a time, returning from \"business\" looking unhappy and acting withdrawn. What's he keeping from Liz? Is it another woman? Another gallery? A family?And does she want to get closer to this man or run as fast as she can to keep herself from being hurt?",
