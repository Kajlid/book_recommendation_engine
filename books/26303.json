  "title": "My Abuela's Table: An Illustrated Journey Into Mexican Cooking",
  "description": "A lovingly created blend of essential Mexican recipes, magical illustrations and a family’s story. My Abuela’s Table is as much a work of art as it is a book of trusted heirloom Mexican recipes. More than seventy recipes plus variations have been passed down from Daniella’s abuela (her grandmother) in Mexico, transcribed and translated by Daniella’s mother into English, and then brought to life by Daniella in this delightfully illustrated book of essential Mexican home cooking. Popular dishes and favorites such as tacos, churros, empanadas, guacamole and huevos rancheros sit alongside less known delights such as Pulpos en Vino (Octopus in Wine), Chilies en Nogada (Stuffed Chilies), Pollo en Salsa de Almendras (Chicken in Almond Sauce) and Buneulos de Harina (Pastries in Syrup). The range of recipes is diverse and includes tortilla dough and sauce staples through to salads, dips, meat and seafood dishes, sweets, traditional festive fare, and even cocktails. Daniella’s gorgeous illustrations are essential to the book in the form of step-by-step instructions including how to correctly fold, tie, and steam tamale or use a tortilla press. They also provide a delightfully whimsical feel with asides such as the chicken that \"highly recommend[s] the bean enchiladas.\" Practical as well as beautiful, careful explanations of equipment and utensils, Mexican herbs and spices, and even types of chilies and their characteristics are included. It’s a book to read, use, enjoy, and display!",
