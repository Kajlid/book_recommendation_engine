  "description": "Are we ever in control of our lives, only able to adapt to changing circumstances and events the best we can, or can we grab it by the scruff of the neck and really influence the kind of life we think we deserve? Those questions and the way his own life descended rapidly have come to haunt Peter Woods making him sleep uneasily. Although fate has appeared to have at last played Pete a good hand, living with the enigmatic Monica in the idyllic hills of the south of France, he wakes up one day in the knowledge that he must go back to the midlands to confront his past and try to lay his ghosts to rest. ‘Stopcock’ is a story of love, lust and betrayal, where an ordinary builder’s life turns into a web of deceit that will eventually lead to his world changing forever.Show More Show Less",
