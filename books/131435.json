  "title": "Fomorian Earth",
  "description": "1500 BC -- The Isle of Destiny is overrun by Fomorian giants. Their king, Balor of the Evil Eye, who rules over Humans with an iron fist, keeps other humanoid species as slaves. The giants are untouchable until the starship Vireo, carrying an advanced race of humanoids, comes crashing to Earth.Caught in the midst of the eve of Samhain, the bloodiest pagan festival of the year, the new arrivals struggle to survive. The Fomorians interpret their presence as that of the prophesied Destroyer. Their mission, seek and destroy whatever fell to Earth, before it destroys them.Fomorian Earth is speculative science fiction, inspired by the Celtic mythology of the Tuatha dé Danann and Fomorians of ancient Ireland. Today, ancient astronaut theorists are suggesting that both the Fomorians and the Tuatha dé Danann were extraterrestrial astronauts from another star system, and it is from this possibility that the Star Borne epic series comes to life. Interweaving historical fact with science fiction and fantasy, Fomorian Earth brings to life the power struggles, bloody human sacrifices, and treachery of an Earth before Humans became the dominant species.WARNING: Fomorian Earth, the first book in the Star Borne series, contains mature situations, violence, and language. Not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age.",
