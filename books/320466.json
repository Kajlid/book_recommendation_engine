  "description": "*A Ridiculously Realistic, Deadly Serious Comedy - With a Superhero Pig*Think you're living in an environmental dystopia?Wait until we start thawing a frozen planet with pig farts. Explore the dark, porky underbelly beneath humanity's seemingly ever-more-virtuous race toward sustainability - and the genius puppet-masters who watch our feeble bamboo-straw-buying attempts and smile, while flattening another rainforest.Oh yeah, and there's our hero. The last remaining pig on Earth just happened to be blessed with superpowers. The anarchic and ambitious Heart of Swine has breath-taking scope and a wry, not totally resigned smile. It incautiously pulls away the covers to reveal how half-assed humanity's efforts to clean up after itself havebeen. It's funny and coarse, sure, but it's deadly serious. The epic failures we continue to see around the world on a personal and political level are taken to frightening lengths. Reading Heart of Swine is like a Rorschach test for one's outlook on the future - although it's hard to think, especially after finishing this book, that everything's going to be just fine.\"The last swine left on Earth, Captain Grunter, is on a quest for justice.With the support of his improbable companions, he delves into the inescapable nightmares of a late-capitalist mediascape characterised by sensationalised poverty, fetish consumerism and glamourised environmental catastrophes.Through the lies and riddles of the villains he faces, the pig superhero begins his philosophical journey of what it means to be more-than-bacon.\"",
