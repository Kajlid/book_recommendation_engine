  "description": "Selena Russo has won the coveted spot as a full-figured spokesmodel for the Rubenesque Romantix clothing line in Paris. When Selena starts getting hate mail, she ignores the warnings-models aren't known for their congeniality when they lose a big modeling gig. Especially a three-year, multimillion-dollar contract in the biggest ad campaign ever for curvy women. Logan's a recent ex-Navy SEAL with a war injury, and his ex CO asks him to protect Selena while assuming the role of her photographer. When the death threats heat up with a dead pooch and bullets flying, Logan focuses hard on the sensual, violet-eyed beauty. It's Logan's pleasure to cover the body of a seductive, curvy, temptress, both in and out of the bedroom as their romance burns up the sheets.",
