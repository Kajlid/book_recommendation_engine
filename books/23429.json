  "description": "When the first whites moved to the region, they asked the Indians where to settle. The Indians pointed to the site of Point Vestal and said, \"Take that. We don't want it. It is cursed.\"With such an auspicious beginning, the northwestern coastal town of Point Vestal has naturally grown to become a modern haven for tourists.Unfortunately, the old curse still haunts the land, and time operates differently for everyone. Victorian ghosts shoot pool with the tourists and even the old buildings can't stay put. It's a good thing that it's the off season when a preacer named Joel-Andrew and a multilingual cat Obed arrive. If the tourists were around, there'd be hell to pay!",
