  "description": "Falling for the guy whose starting spot you're after? Never a good idea.AidenI’m known as the Ice King, but I didn’t become one of the best rugby players in the world by giving out free hugs. I got here by hard work and sacrifice, including denying a large part of myself. But that’s okay, there’s plenty of time to become the poster boy for gay rugby players after I retire.Right now, I’m focusing on cementing my legacy and I’m not about to surrender my starting spot to the cocky loudmouth who just joined the training squad, no matter how talented the kid might be.TylerI can’t believe I’ve made it into the New Zealand rugby team after my first professional rugby season. Now management has decided it’s a good idea for me to room with Aiden Jones, who’s been my jerk-off fantasy for years. And although Aiden is icy to me both on and off the field, I figure with a little charm, I can melt the Ice King.But even I’m not prepared for how heated things become between us.And now it appears I’m falling for the same guy whose starting spot I’m gunning for.But all is fair in both love and sport, right?This book features hot rugby players, fun banter, sweet moments, steamy times, a little bit of angst and of course, a Happily Ever After! You don't need to know anything about rugby to enjoy this story.",
