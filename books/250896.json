  "description": "My dad always said you can’t run away from your problems, but I’m sure as hell going to try. And where do you go when you’re trying to escape life? You go to Europe. Or Scandinavia to be exact, because Scandinavia does have the hottest guys. Have you seen Thor? I’ve got my bucket list and I’m ready to live life to the fullest. Go abroad where no one knows my past? Check. See the sites? Check. Hook up with a Scandinavian Hottie? Check. Despite the threat of my past hanging over my head, everything is going great…until Scandinavian Hottie wants to get serious. It was never my intention to take things to the next level. After all, I don’t want to hurt him when he finds out the truth. However, the more time we spend together, the harder I fall, and in the end I'm not sure if it's his heart or mine that's going to end up broken.",
