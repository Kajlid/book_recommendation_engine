  "title": "Meow Cats United: An Old Beginning",
  "description": "Adoptive sisters Willie and Bertha find themselves being raised by the housekeepers of their family manor after their parents' very own oath to serve the greater good gets them arrested. Due to their vigilante activities, Meow Cats United is considered by the Pherin Police as a \"Paradox\": a criminal individual or group that stays prominent for at least three years. It might appear that this is the end of this group of crime fighters, but Laura and Barry Scott were way ahead of the legal system. Behind bars, they would do whatever they could to protect Pherin, even if it meant choosing the very path their daughters would take to rebuild Meow Cats United, so that a new Paradox would continue where the last left off.",
