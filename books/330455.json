  "description": "Imagine a world where a sleek, dark jaguar wanders after twilight, seeking his mate, offering her protection from harm and the most sensual nights her heart could ever desire....At dusk he prowled the Southwest, a huge, sleek black jaguar with startling blue eyes and a man's thoughts. A shape-shifting Sentinel, Dolan Trevio projected an intensely animalistic aura that hid the scars of his past. Yet as fierce as his pride was, this immensely powerful guardian needed the intuition and spirit of an innocent horse trainer to find redemption.The moment he set foot on her ranch, Meghan Lawrence rejected the shape-shifter's protection - but she couldn't turn her back on her family legacy. Her mother had died protecting a magical manuscript that the Sentinels' dark counterparts would now do anything to recover. With an unbreakable will and all-consuming passion, only Dolan possessed the strength to save Meghan. But was she strong enough to tame the beast within?",
