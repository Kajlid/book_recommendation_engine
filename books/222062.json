The abusive relationship she left behind seems a distant memory in this perfect place.Her first day on the job, Dana receives a call from her friend Allyson who screams \"He's going to kill me too\" before the phone goes dead. Dana immediately dispatches a deputy, but it's too late. Allyson's death is ruled an accident, but Dana just doesn't believe it. She knows Allyson—an investigative reporter—was researching a new story. Did someone want to keep her quiet?Dana continues to look into the accident with the help of Bree and also Allyson's cousin Boone.
