While trying to juggle health problems and a camera crew who’s always underfoot, Daughtry doesn’t put much faith in his new hire. Sure that she won’t fit in or be able to keep up, he’s confident that the woman he’s hired will pack up her tools and run away crying as soon as she messes up her manicure. That will take at least one problem off his plate and he’ll finally be able to tell the meddling women in his life, “I told you so!”Jamie Evans has been working in a shop since she was big enough to hold a wrench.
