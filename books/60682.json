  "description": "Humanity in the early Twenty-First Century is changing. Progressing. Evolving. Transcending.With every passing year, the distinctions which separate mankind from machines are becoming increasingly blurred as technology is quickly helping humanity free itself from the age-old constraints of biology, frailty, and mortality. We are becoming healthier, stronger, and smarter at an exponential pace. We can fight wars from half-a-world away, we can visit any location on earth without moving, and we can not only repair our bodies, but enhance them. Soon, even immortality will no longer be a fantasy of religion or myth, but within our very grasp. We will transcend biology.What lies ahead for mankind is breathtaking -- and even terrifying. And as we peer into that future, we are faced with the startling question:What does it mean to be human?After experiencing a horrible personal loss, Daniel Marks, a former time-traveler, embarks on a journey which will cause him to not only question the entire purpose of his existence, but that very existence itself.",
