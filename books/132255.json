  "description": "One year ago, when attorney Rebecca Andrews swept into the courtroom and took control, it turned Quinn Montgomery’s world upside down. Now, seeing her name on his manifesto, old memories are awakened, not of the hard-nosed lawyer who had far too many tricks up her sleeve, but of the sensual woman who spouted legal jargon from full pouting lips. Taking note of her destination, a posh vacation resort that caters to the more...private entertainment, a plan forms, and Quinn decides it's time to show the sexy lawyer a few tricks of his own.Against her better judgement, Rebecca Andrews accepts her friend's invitation to an exclusive vacation resort. When her charter plane veers off course, the last person she expects to see piloting the craft is Quinn Montgomery—multi-millionaire and CEO of Montgomery Charters—the powerful man she once took down in the court room. Nor did she expect to find herself pseudo-kidnapped and stranded with him on his private island. She can leave, but when he tells her he wants to show her that real control comes in the form of surrender, Rebecca has two choices—run home to her boring life, or put herself in the hands of the commanding man who promises to give her everything she's ever wanted in exchange for total and utter submission.",
