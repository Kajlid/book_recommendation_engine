  "description": "Madeleine has a secret. Five months ago, she met an irresistible man and made a very dumb mistake. She knows that a random hookup won’t want to be saddled with a baby and she’s way too vulnerable in this state to be rejected. Keeping a baby from the daddy might seem wrong, but it’s the best way to protect herself and her child for now.  Oliver wants answers. Five months ago, he met the woman of his dreams, took her up to his hotel room, made love to her until they both passed out only to wake up alone. He’s hired private investigators but with no last name or photographs, his hookup has remained a mystery. And he doesn’t like mysteries. Or surprises.  Oliver knows Madeleine is the one for him. When he finally finds her, he’s determined to keep her...even if the father of the child isn’t him.",
