  "description": "Scarlet Hopewell keeps dreaming about a magical world, a world where winged creatures sculpt with light, where dogs talk, and where Scarlet is the guest of honor at a wonderful party in a castle under the roots of a mighty oak tree. One day her father brings home an abandoned puppy who captures Scarlet’s heart. Dakota is fun and loving and smart. Actually, he’s really smart—too smart. And a lot too big. News shows start to take an interest.As the beginning of the school year approaches, strange and ominous storms have everyone on edge, and Scarlet’s dreams are getting darker and more vivid. Her magical dream world has another side, a darker side with no interest in joyous parties. When the front door is blown off its hinges one night by three beautiful, silver-voiced men, Dakota leads the Hopewells in their escape—right into the world of Scarlet’s dreams. Scarlet and the Keepers of Light, the first in a four-book series, is a fantasy for all ages about the adventure of growing up and finding the magic within.",
