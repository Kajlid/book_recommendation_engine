  "description": "What would you do if your destined love was not your current boyfriend but another man waiting for you overseas? Would you leave your relationship and your job to dive into an international search?Linda did.When she doesn’t receive the marriage proposal she’d long been expecting from her partner Hank on her 41st birthday, Linda reluctantly visits Angelica, a psychic. Angelica predicts that Linda will soon be leaving Hank for a romantic and classical music-filled Odyssey in Europe. There, a \"Russian icon\" will lead to her future husband, a \"tall man with glasses.\"Skeptical at first, but eager to explore her Eastern European roots and reignite her passion for music, Linda moves to Hungary, the land of her idol, pianist-composer Franz Liszt. In Budapest, she reinvents herself as an English teacher and joins a chorus. Soon she’s performing at the Liszt Academy of Music and Tel Aviv’s Opera House.With Angelica’s vision in mind, Linda vows to settle down, not settle for, but is tempted by romantic close calls: Gabi is gorgeous but immature; David in Amsterdam fits Angelica’s description to a T, but his British reserve needs defrosting. Liszt look-alike Ádám has it all, including a wife.With her teaching and singing gigs ending, Linda flies to Finland for one last trip before moving back to Boston. Is her Odyssey over, or is it just beginning?",
