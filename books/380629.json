These are the friends who have been with him through the thick and thin of it. Stuck by him through the hard and lonely times when no one else would. The problem, you see, is this...Max lives alone. He never knew his friends were different...not until that is he ended up in the insane asylum. Now though Max has an even bigger problem. Since the Christ came back and gathered his Righteous Ones, things have become a bit strange. Where once Janet and the others had only seemed real...Now, now they are real. Now they drink his coffee and eat his dwindling food supply. They open doors, close windows, and chop away at the Zombie Hordes outside. As Max tries to keep his mind together, his friendship is soon put to the ultimate test. For they have set forth on a Journey. A Journey that will take Max beyond anything he has ever imagined. Show him truths about who his friends really are and where they might be going. You see, Joey the Child...is really an Angel and the others...Well, the others are something else entirely.",
