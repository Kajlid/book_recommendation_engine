  "description": "She hated her assignment…until she met him\n\nThere's something about a handsome man who speaks with an accent and wears a foreign military uniform. Add an air of mystery and a young child he's raising on his own, and that man becomes irresistible….\nBut resisting him is exactly what Captain Natalie Wentworth's career demands. As an army protocol officer, her duties—showing Colonel Viktor Baturnov around, making sure he's properly introduced to his American counterparts and getting him settled into his training program at the Pentagon—call for professional detachment.Things go smoothly until Natalie learns the real reason for the colonel's visit to America. Suddenly she's embroiled in the struggle of a father to save his son. And her feelings for both could cost her dearly.",
