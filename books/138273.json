She’s tossed into the deep end as the storm of the century threatens to make landfall just before Christmas Eve. Will she be able to collect all of the clues before the weather spins her cozy life into chaos?Blue thinks she can handle everything except the stubborn and objectively handsome out-of-town lawyer insisting on offering his help.
