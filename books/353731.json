  "description": "The journey along the road to recovery may be a glorious and fulfilling adventure, but there are dangers and pitfalls along the way. The person recovering from any addiction needs to be aware of the hazards that lead to relapse. A Hole in the Sidewalk points out ways to avoid the holes; as one travels the path of recovery. Each section offers additional tools for recovery. The more tools one gathers and uses, the more recovery will be strengthened. Key sections include: Overconfidence Resentments Relationships Anger Priorities Plus many more... This book is written in a style that allows the reader to skip to the various themes which explore issues that one identifies to be a priority. This book is not meant to be a program of recovery, but to be used as an additional tool for recovery. I walk down the street There is a deep hole in the sidewalk I fall in I am lost - I am helpless It isn't my fault It takes forever to find a way out I walk down the same street There is a deep hole in the sidewalk I pretend I don't see it I fall in again I can't believe I am in the same place But it isn't my fault It still takes a long time to get out I walk down the same street There is a deep hole in the sidewalk I see it is there I still fall in-it's a habit My eyes are open I know where I am It is my fault I get out immediately I walk down the same street There is a deep hole in the sidewalk I walk around it I walk down another street  Poem by Portia Nelson",
