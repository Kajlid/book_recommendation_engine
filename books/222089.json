  "description": "The day Desmoree Shale was kidnapped and awoke naked on a slab in a Sydney morgue should have been the worst day of her life – but she’s not dead, barely harmed, and her would be assassin, Jax, is actually kind of… cute. Tempted by the idea of a mythical fairy-land, Des joins Jax in discovering the past her mother was determined to keep hidden. She quickly learns there was a reason for her mother’s secrecy. Finding herself smack in the middle of an eons-old war between two feuding Fey species, prophesized to take on a vicious beast, and pressured to unlock her magic is not what Des had been expecting. Now she must decide between a terrible battle in the new life she loves or returning to piece together the one she left behind.",
