  "description": "A novel about a mother-daughter relationship that will send a chill down your spine. Johanne is a young woman in her twenties who lives with her mother. When she falls in love with Ivar, she finally feels ready to leave home. The couple plan a trip to America. But the morning of her departure, Johanne wakes up to find the door locked. Can she overcome her fears? Will she shout for help? Will she climb out of her seventh floor window? Why Peirene publishes this book: ‘We know that men must separate from their fathers – and many novels have been written on the subject. However, the struggle of women to separate from their mothers is rarely addressed either in our literature or our society. The author depicts the mother brilliantly. She is not a nice woman - all the more reason for her daughter to leave. This is a brilliant and important book. ‘ Meike Ziervogel",
