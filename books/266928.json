  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B07LF2PN3XMMMMM Dark Paranormal romance. A prince, a miscreant, a warrior, a workaholic & one wild werewolf.  Karter's been nothing but trouble since the day he learned to walk. A werewolf with a knack for f@#$*ng s#%t up, heâ€™s caused so much trouble that even his pack is tired of dealing with it. With his pack done bailing him out, Karter is left alone and with no one to care. If he doesnâ€™t get his life in order, heâ€™ll end up dead.  When heâ€™s dragged in by the people who will happily put a silver bullet in his head, they give him an opportunity instead of deathâ€¦ to feed vampires â€” aka a walking blood bank. To feed the enemy is unheard of, but with nowhere else to turn he reluctantly goes.  Four vampires and one werewolf. What should be a disaster may turn into something so much more.  Why canâ€™t he stop craving things that no werewolf should crave from bloodsuckers?  (Warning graphic language for 18+, gay Paranormal haram, graphic scenes, vampire take on blood playðŸ˜‰)",
