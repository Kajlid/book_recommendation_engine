  "title": "The Magus",
  "description": "Filled with shocks and chilling surprises, The Magus is a masterwork of contemporary literature and a literary landmark of the 1960s.On a remote Greek island, Nicholas Urfe finds himself embroiled in the deceptions of a master trickster. Shimmering surreal threads weave ever tighter as reality and illusion intertwine in a bizarre psychological game. John Fowles expertly unfolds a tale that is lush with over-powering imagery in a spell-binding exploration of the complexities of the human mind. By turns disturbing, thrilling and seductive, The Magus is a cerebral feast.-----------------------------The Magus is a deliciously toothsome celebration of wanton story-telling. Before one quite realises what is happening, one finds oneself no less avid for meanings and no less starving amid a plethora of clues than is Nicholas Urfe himself. Mr. Fowles's mysteries stand in similar relation to those myths that inspired them. - Sunday TimesA splendidly sustained piece of mystification, such as could otherwise only have been devised by a literary team fielding the Marquis de Sade, Arthur Edward Waite, Sir James Frazer, Gurdjieff, Madame Blavatsky, C.G. Jung, Aleister Crowley, Franz Kafka and the author of They Shoot Horses Don't They? - Financial TimesIt is a major work of mounting tensions in which a human mind is the guinea-pig. Mr. Fowles has taken a big swing at a difficult subject and his hits are on the bull's-eye. - Sunday Telegraph",
