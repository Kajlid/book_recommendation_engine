  "description": "The story of Stop Kiss is deceptively simple: two young women in New York meet, talk about their boyfriends, feel a growing, unspoken attraction for each other, and finally kiss. And that one innocent kiss sets off a savage gay-bashing. But even as Stop Kiss confronts the reality of physical violence, Diana Son's imaginative, moving, and surprising comedy brings audiences - and her principal characters - to unexpected places.\" \"Callie is holding down a job as a radio traffic reporter when she meets Sam, a Midwesterner who, against her parents' wishes, has moved to the city to teach third-grade students in the Bronx. As they get to know each other, their shared experiences and sense of humor create a strong bond. The tragic consequences of their kiss - the center of this powerful drama - serve as both indictment of hatred and a moving study of the perils inherent in living life fully.",
