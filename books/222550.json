  "title": "Adam's & Victor's Principles of Neurology",
  "description": "The classic \"teaching text\" in neurology is completely revised and features a new art program and the latest advances in diagnosis and treatment. Each chapter is rigorously reviewed and updated. Includes new coverage of papillary function, sleep, syncope, inherited metabolic disease, degenerative disease, epilepsy, cerebellar disease and much more. Throughout, new CT and MR images facilitate neurologic diagnosis. Most importantly, the winning organization remains - the systematic progression from cardinal manifestation of disease to how these manifestations arrange in neurologic syndromes to matching these syndromes to specific neurologic diseases.",
