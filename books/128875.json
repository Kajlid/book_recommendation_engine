  "description": "My life was perfect. A dream degree course, amazing friends, a different guy every weekend. Until him.One night. No names. We thought we’d never see each other again. But the man that blew my mind turns out to be Dr. Wilder, a lecturer at my university with a reputation of being cold and unapproachable. Completely wrong for me. He’s a teacher. I’m a student. Did I mention my housemates loathe him? It was only supposed to be a one-night stand… until it wasn’t. Now, we can’t seem to stay away from each other. He’s turning my world upside down. We’re in too deep. There’s only one way this can end, and neither of us are prepared to face the consequences… Ignited is an M/M new adult student/professor college romance, and is the third book in the LSU series. Each book can be read as a standalone.",
