  "description": "The paranormal world just can't seem to cut Ren a break. Just when she thought she could finally settle into normal—well, relatively normal—life as the last of the dragon shifters with her four alpha mates, she finds her people on the brink of a supernatural war. The vampires have decided all shifter kind must be exterminated, and they've got the firepower to make good on that goal.  Ren's got plenty of fire of her own, of course. But she's only one dragon, and there are a whole lot of vampires. As she scrambles to protect all of her kin and figure up what the heck is up with the last of her mates, she can't help suspecting this challenge is more than she and her alphas can handle alone.  The secrets buried in the dragon shifter estate may hold the answer—but finding it will force her to question everything she thought she knew about this new world.  *This is the final volume of a steamy new reverse harem paranormal romance series intended for readers 18+. Expect sexy situations, intense action, and a quartet of alluring wolf, bear, jaguar, and eagle alpha shifters you’ll wish you could make your mates.*",
