  "description": "Welcome to the Atlanta Rising Football Club, where the temperature isn't the only thing turning up the heat...Felicity Sutherland knows what people think of her. She just doesn't care. Her attitude is her armor, and it hasn't failed her yet. Thick skin and working hard in the male-dominated sports industry placed her dream job within reach. And as she vies to become president of the Atlanta Rising Football Club, there isn't a competitor, or a distractingly handsome co-worker, that can get in her way. The only games Gunnar Gracin has time for are the ones he coaches on the pitch. But life just keeps bending the ball, especially where the women in his life are concerned. The death of his wife over a decade ago was a devastating loss. Discovering an adult daughter from an encounter he doesn't remember changed all the rules. And working for the frosty, sharp-tongued Felicity is downright infuriating. But as Gunnar and Felicity spend more time together, the tension between them sizzles like a hot summer night. And the moment Gunnar gets a taste of Felicity's smart mouth, he decides to throw the playbook out the window. If no one knows what they're up to, giving in to temptation doesn't feel so out of bounds. That is, until life gets in the way and the whistle is blown. Will it be a red card for Gunnar and Felicity's secret romance? Out of Bounds is a standalone enemies-to-lovers, age gap contemporary romance. Enjoy it on its own, or as part of the series, with no cheating and a guaranteed HEA!",
