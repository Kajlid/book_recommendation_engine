  "description": "Before his death, St. John the Apostle spoke a prophecy, sometimes referred to as \"The Second Revelation of John.\" But the prophecy was hidden from the world to protect it from those that sought to destroy it or cast shadows over it forever. It foretells the coming of a great evil from beyond Earth's solar system and it gives account of a child who would be chosen to stand against that evil on behalf of all mankind. It speaks of a soulless army that will attempt to prevent the birth of the Chosen One and if that fails, they must find the Chosen One and prevent her from standing on behalf of all mankind at \"The Battle Between Light and Dark.\"A brutal contract hit on FBI Special Agent Johnathan Sette's family leaves his life turned upside down and his newborn child missing. In order to ensure the safety of his children, he will enlist the help of the Seven Dragons family to teach them an ancient form of martial arts. Johnathan, his family, and faithful friends will hold on to their Christian faith as they battle the forces of darkness and search the world for his missing daughter, Elizabeth.",
