  "description": "She saw a silver Jeep making its way toward the grounds. Immediately she felt her heart race, knowing it was Daryl. She did not know if she should hide from him or run toward him. Watching him get out of his car and look around, she felt as if everything was moving in slow motion. She knew she had to make a decision... Sarah is one of the youngest sisters of the congregation at Anchorage Place, a refuge for abandoned children. While running to the love of her Lord, she runs from the romance of a lover, fearful that she cannot love both equally. In her second book, In His Love, author Deborah Brodie, unveils the struggle of relationship versus religion. Sarah must contend with religion to experience the reality of salvation and must surrender her fear before she can pursue love. Is it possible for Sarah to give into her desire for Daryl while giving her heart to the lover of her soul? Will Sarah's relationship with Jesus survive as she wrestles with her faith? Will she ever be able to fully believe In His Love?",
