  "description": "Despite their economic and social differences, Addison Allen and Harley James have been inseparable since sixth grade. But when Harley is arrested for the murder of her ex-boss, prison bars threaten to be the one thing that finally comes between them.  The body left on Harley’s doorstep proves to be too problematic for even Addison’s enormous bank account, forcing the duo to roll up their sleeves and search for the murderer themselves. Working to prove Harley’s innocence brings out an unexpected passion for investigating a knack for uncovering the buried truth.  However, their freshly-acquired skills propel them into a dangerous new world full of lies, secrets, and quite possibly…romance.  Will they be able to keep Harley out of jail? Or will they lose their hearts, and maybe even their lives, in the process?",
