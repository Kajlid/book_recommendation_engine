  "description": "Sera was just a normal girl, or so she thought- that is, until her parents were killed in a freak car accident, thrusting her into a mysterious world of wealthy relations she never knew existed. A world, that, until now, had been kept hidden from her. As her sixteenth birthday approaches, dark secrets converge, and Sera's reality is further shaken when she falls for the alluring, yet forbidden Adam Crandall. This earthy stranger ignites something dangerous deep within her that she doesn't understand. Is he the key to unlocking the mystery that surrounds her, or will he only lead to more questions? To make matters worse, someone wants her out of the picture. Could it be her arch rival, Bree, who is somehow connected to Adam and wants him all to herself? Or is something else responsible for her near-fatal mishaps?",
