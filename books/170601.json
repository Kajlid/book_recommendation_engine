Boyle transforms two real people from the pages of American history into rich mythic creations whose tortured love and epic story is intimate enough to break our hearts.Boyle anchors his unforgettable tale with the remarkable and courageous Katherine Dexter. Her husband, Stanley McCormick, thirty-one-year-old son of the millionaire inventor of the Reaper, has become schizophrenic and a sexual maniac. Stanley is locked up in his Santa Barbara mansion and forbidden the mere sight of women — above all, his wife. Throughout her career as a scientist and suffragette, Katherine's faith never wavers: that, one day, one of the many psychiatrists she hires to try to cure her husband will free him of his demons.One of America's most imaginative contemporary novelists, Boyle weaves his hallmark virtuoso prose into a masterful epic. Textured with his acclaimed humor, versatility, and imagination, Riven Rock is his most fully realized and compassionate novel to date.",
