This goalkeeper is about to find out...Moving to America forced Liam Daley to leave almost everything behind in Ireland - his family, his team, and his dreams about what might have been.

In fact, life would be perfect if she could just score a date with her dream guy. But overcoming her natural awkwardness is unlikely, and her insecurities aren't doing her any favors either. She's desperate for help, and who better to teach her how to attract a football star than another football star?As Avery's reluctant partner in crime, Liam hopes to show her that she doesn't need to change for any man. But simply telling Avery how he really feels seems impossible. While Avery gets closer to everything she thinks she wants, Liam starts to feel the pressure. Will he be forced to pass when he's finally ready to make a play for her heart?",
