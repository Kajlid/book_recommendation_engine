  "description": "Emmerick hated vampires with everything in him, and with good reason. When he’d been taken in by Kylor’s clan, he almost left because there were a vampire in it. But Emmerick needed to stay with the only dyad clan he knew about, a dream his father never realized.  When another vampire joined, Emmerick ignored him, until Bladen hit on him. Angry at the presumption, Emmerick had been cruel and vicious to the little pyrina. Then, he was ordered to protect both Bladen and Samuel on an expedition to town, along with Jytis, a young were spirit Emmerick could never get off his mind. Worried about drawing attention, Emmerick wasn’t prepared for the chaos that happened. Kidnapped by a rival vampire clan, it was up to him to save not only himself, but the two vampires and Jytis.  Before he could come up with a plan, he was stunned at the help that came from a shocking direction. It seemed some of the vampires of this clan were not happy with their master. But Emmerick couldn’t trust them, even if he was inexplicably drawn to two of them.  Thanks to his violent past and distaste for vampires, when he realized they were his mates, he wasn’t sure he could make the choice to claim them. And what of his attraction to Jytis?",
