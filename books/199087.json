  "description": "The world has become nocturnal for fear of a gruesome death by sunlight. Societies roam exclusively beneath the night sky, or in tunnels during the day, and countries are plunged into various phases of the Dark Ages. The unthinkable happens in the kingdom of Tynan when a little girl is found by their warriors in the beast-ridden forest surrounding their country's gates, her skin riddled in freckles, and her red hair too naturally bright. After 800 years of darkness, a human has somehow survived sunlight. The miracle child is given to the care of local outcast, Darcy. Indebted to the government for previous criminal activity, Darcy has little choice in the matter, but she soon discovers that having custody of the biggest mystery of the millennia could mean finally exacting revenge on the country that destroyed her life-if she can solve it first. What she finds is a devastating secret that could undo the world as they all know. The first of the Generation of Night Series, Night Dwellers is for fans of Cinder by Marissa Meyer, and Legend by Marie Lu.",
