  "description": "A bus filled with ski enthusiasts headed for a rustic chalet in Canada breaks down in the middle a blizzard, sending a mismatched group of strangers out into the night to find shelter from the storm. Shelter is found by way of a dilapidated country mansion replete with a crazy old woman and her caregiver, who “accidentally” shoots at the skiers as they approach. Unlike the would-be skiers, the inhospitable situation only goes downhill from there.",
