I thought I was doomed to live my life alone.Then he came along.Grant ‘Bear’ Warren.I stand across from him at the altar, an imposing man, big like his name, but quiet and reclusive by nature. He’s the best man to my maid of honor. Our eyes meet. I think I see a smile, maybe some interest in his eyes. He doesn’t want to dance, but I convince him. I don’t want to stay past dinner, but he convinces me.Then we start drinking.I remember laughing.I remember talking.I even remember going for a long walk together.What I don’t remember is saying ‘I do’.Somehow, I’m the bride, married to a man—a mountain man—I just met.What do I do now?Note: Get your swoon on with this soft-spoken mountain man and a curvy bridesmaid who fall into each other faster than you can say ‘love at first sight’. As always, this Megan Wade book comes with her ‘Sugar Promise’. High heat, low drama, guaranteed.",
