  "description": "Arriving at a new school part way through the year, Linda is just trying to be a good student, do the right thing and fit in, but Jeffrey Butler, the most annoying kid in class, keeps getting in her way.  To make matters worse, it is the 1960s and the world around Linda is spinning with revolution. Her class is practicing nuclear bomb drills, her mother is listening to the Beatles and has stopped wearing a bra, and her brother is about to be drafted. Itâ€™s a good thing that Linda has Annie, her new best friend, to hold onto.  Now, if only Annie was more accepted by the other kids and Jeffrey Butler would stop staring at her, life would be bearable. It is not until the popular kids accuse Jeffrey of stealing money from the school baseball team that Linda has to find her own truth and fight for what she knows is right.",
