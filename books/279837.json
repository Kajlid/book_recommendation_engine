  "description": "Transported to another world with purple alien barbarians who don’t even speak English?!  Strange storms have been raging all over the world for the past months. Some say the end of the world is coming, but for Ella, life goes on as always: stressing about work, her health problems, and now a broken car to top it all off. She tries to make her way home in the stormy weather when a lightning suddenly strikes her. She loses consciousness and when she wakes up, she finds herself in the middle of a TV production. Because giant purple aliens just can’t be real, right? Especially not when they come in threes and want to mate with her…  Alien Barbarians’ Hope is the first book in a brand new sci-fi reverse harem romance series! Each book is a standalone romance featuring a different woman and three hot, purple aliens who want her as their mate. No cheating, no cliffhangers, and a HEA!",
