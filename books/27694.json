  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Fantasy/Paranormal Romance, M/M, shape-shifters, public exhibition, spanking, sex toys] The Gathering is called. The spell is cast. There is no escaping the Midnight Matings. Milo's spent the majority of his life parading one man after another through his bedroom. He doesn't do relationships, and he definitely doesn't do commitment. While trying to escape the chaos of the gathering, the sweetest sound in the world catches his interest and threatens his playboy lifestyle. When Milo Gavari loses control and claims him in the middle of the ballroom, Lark thinks he's finally found his missing half. The hellhound has a body to die for, but Lark quickly realizes the total package is far from perfect. Milo's reputation for being cold and evasive isn't going to deter him, though. There's a sweet center to that rough exterior, and Lark intends to bring it to the surface. With his meddlesome aunts and Milo's overbearing father in the mix, finding his happy ending isn't going to be easy. But, the best things in life never are. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
