  "description": "An alternate cover edition exists here. This is a book you READ ALOUD to find out just how smart your tongue is. The first time you read it, don't go fast! This Fox is a tricky fox. He'll try to get your tongue in trouble.Dr. Seuss gives fair warning to anyone brave enough to read along with the Fox in Socks, who likes to play tongue-twisting games with his friend Mr. Knox.\"Here's an easy game to play. Here's an easy thing to say.... New socks. Two socks. Whose socks? Sue's socks.\" But Mr. Fox Socks isn't about to let Knox off so easy. Soon Goo-Goose is choosing to chew chewy gluey blue goo, while tweetle beetles battle with paddles in a puddle (in case you were wondering, that's called a \"tweetle beetle puddle paddle battle\"). Mr. Knox gets exasperated: \"I can't blab such blibber blubber! My tongue isn't made of rubber.\" But he catches on to the game before it's all through.One of Dr Seuss' best, this must-read-aloud classic is guaranteed to get many giggles out of readers young and old.Best Audience: Ages 4 to 8",
