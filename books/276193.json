  "description": "Dr. Wendy Hall Sims in The Many Facets of Me shares how she moved From A Heart of Hurt to The Joy of Jesus. She expounds upon how God allowed the facets of her life to build her character and faith. Dr. Sims encourages her readers to put their trust securely in God, who will always channel every situation into one that will ultimately work for your good. Being mocked (for the color of her skin) and molested at a very young age, she identifies with those who have been hurt but encourages them like her, to use their hurt to their advantage by spreading a message of endurance, love, and hope. She attributes her relationship with Christ for helping her to move from a heart of hurt to the joy of Jesus.",
