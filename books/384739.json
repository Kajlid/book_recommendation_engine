  "description": "The World's only Umbrella Cover Museum actually exists on Peaks Island, Maine. You know those little sleeves that new umbrellas come in? Those are the umbrella covers. There are hundreds of them in the collection. The museum is dedicated to celebrating the mundane in everyday life, to finding wonder and beauty in the simplest of things, and to knowing that there is a story behind every cover. Director and curator, Nancy 3. Hoffman (her middle name IS Three) conducts this fully illustrated tour. You'll feel like you've been there, right down to the museum's theme song at the end of the tour. Nancy 3. has been interviewed on National Public Radio, BBC Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio. The museum has been featured in the International Herald Tribune, The Boston Globe, The New York Times, and in 2010, The Weather Channel! This witty and whimsical guide to the quirkiest museum you've ever been to makes a perfect coffee table book - for a very small coffee table. The most thought-provokingly mundane of New England's unusual museums. Endless Vacation Magazine, 2004 It isn't a joke. It isn't ironic. It isn't fake. It isn't to be missed.
