  "description": "\"Because it rejects the cycle of life and death, violence and the threat of death have become the dominant grammar of international political relations. Patriarchy now threatens the world with terminal illness generated by nuclear weapons of mass destruction. A brilliant combination of scholarship, art, spirituality, and experience, Leslene della-Madre's book powerfully brings us back to ancient ways of honouring divinity both in our lives and deaths. I highly recommend it.\"Mary Condren, author of The Serpent and the Women, Religion and Power in Celtic Ireland.",
