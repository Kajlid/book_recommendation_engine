  "description": "The Treaty between Draconia and the Earth Union was in shreds. The experimental colony of Hatching, a product of that Treaty, was to be removed from Draconia. Varthikes and Audwin's dream of a peaceful co-existence between their two kinds seemed lost. Forces from Earth were closing in to avenge what was believed to have been an unprovoked attack on the colony. Norseen forces were also closing. Renegade Draconians still remained to ensure all aliens are repelled from their world. Enemies were everywhere.Hope still existed, however. Captain Mark Johnson of the United Earth Space Fleet is determined to defend Draconia against all threats--Norseen and Human. Malcon Ambassador Cairleeta has devised a plan to save Draconia and the colony. But, ultimately, it is up to Varthikes and Audwin, and the power of their friendship, to ensure their home survives the Norseen invasion to be rehatched.",
