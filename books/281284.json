  "description": "Em Charvez has grown up in the shadow of the strong willed and colorful Charvez women and she feels a bit invisible. While on the hunt for a book of magic that could well destroy the Compact that gives them their power, she meets Conchobar MacNessa, a ten-thousand-year-old Faerie warrior, and suddenly she’s not quite so invisible. Things heat up between Con and Em as the battle over the book—the battle between good and evil—takes shape around them…Note: This book contains a brief instance of explicit m/m intimacy.",
