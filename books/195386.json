  "description": "Book 1  \"It's Daniels.\"  All sixteen-year-old Faith Daniels, or Daniels for short, wanted was a chance. A chance to forget her dark past and forge her own future. But that's hard to do when your past is full of great darkness.  Death always comes at a hefty price, more so, when you're unsure if you've carried out such a sentence.  Given the chance to break free from her hometown with an officer by her side, Daniels will find out that sometimes it's not the past you have to be worried about; the future can be just as scary. Especially in a new town where three hot neighbor guys want your attention. As Tyler, Kayden and Lincoln McGuire try to break down the walls Daniels has formed; things get a little out of hand. Maybe it was the dumb mutt that kept harassing her or the crazy cop foster parent that seemed to keep her on her toes, either way; Daniels walls were cracking. Sometimes it takes more than just one guy to keep your walls down. To gain your trust. To help you love again. Maybe for Daniels, three hot guys was her lucky number. Or perhaps, it was all about the mutt.",
