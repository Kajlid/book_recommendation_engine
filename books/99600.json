  "description": "COMPLICATED BY YOU is a sexy New Adult love story about a girl who loves so deeply that it may cost her everything. Evie's childhood friend Jay has always had her back. But college complicates things as Jay starts dating Evie's roommate Cynthia. Now, Evie spends her nights trying to sleep while Jay and Cynthia go at it like rabbits a few feet away! Evie hates feeling like a third wheel and hates wishing it was her in Jay's arms even more. It doesn't help that Jay won't let Evie date or even hook up without interfering and making sure everyone on campus knows that she's off limits. Something has to give. Evie can't continue pining away for Jay, and Jay can't continue to act like he owns her when he won't so much as touch her. And worse of all, Evie can barely look Cynthia in the eye for fear she will know just how she feels about Jay. Then one night shifts Evie, Jay and Cynthia into an web of love and deceit, tangling their hearts and forcing one of them to come to a compromise that will change all their lives. How far should someone go for love? Until it’s no longer convenient, or until it’s tearing apart their soul? Evie soon realizes that love isn’t always easy and loving someone isn't as simple as it seems. Sometimes, it's COMPLICATED. Look for Evie and Jay's story to continue in December 2013!",
