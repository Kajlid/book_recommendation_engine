  "description": "FROM DIFFERENT WORLDSMarissa Quinn is as untamed as the wild mustangs that roam free across her Montana cattle ranch. She lives for her land, but when her sister Leslie writes from Seattle to say that she is in danger, Marissa leaves her open-range paradise to help her. Once in Seattle, Marissa encounters a doctor conducting ancient Druid time travel rituals using nectar extracted from the rare night orchid. Leslie appears to be a victim of the doctor's ill-gotten powers, as is Alek--a glorious pre-Roman warrior--who is trapped in the modern world. Soon Marissa and Alex discover that though two millennia separate their lives, nothing can sever the bond forged between their hearts.",
