  "title": "The Suffering and Celebration of Life in America",
  "description": "This is the gritty reality of more than a year on the road, with little money, and no back up plan.One American couple, with their dog and turtle, take to road searching for a place to call home and a glimmer of hope.The plan was to document the year leading up to the 2008 election, not with typical political nonsense, but instead by listening to the people of America.“Sounds like fun until you consider, we began our journey with $180 between the four of us. This was a journey we never expected, it would have killed most people, it nearly killed us.” - Shane BugbeeShane and Amy Bugbee documented creatives, scholars, madmen, and all points in between in a quest to find answers and understanding in a world that seemed less and less welcoming of individuality. They asked about the freedom of artistic expression and speech, the soul of faith, and the purpose of the “American Way”.The couple dedicated themselves to their project with no funding and no money in their pockets. They survived, not off grants and sponsors, but by working odd jobs found on Craigslist and the kindness of strangers. They stayed with many people of differing views and lifestyles while on the road, and lived on literally a few dollars a day. Some can enjoy that prospect for a few weeks, but no one but a dedicated and perhaps insane few would do it for an entire year!",
