  "description": "A heart-tugging picture book by the author of the Newbery Honor Book Misty of ChincoteagueSometimes it seems that the only thing these twins have in common is Midge, the family's Shetland pony. Joseph has fair hair and a deep love of the outdoors. Dark-haired Justin would rather play his piccolo or read a book. But they lovingly tend to Midge, and she, in turn, gives them the best gift of all -- a horse family of their very own.",
