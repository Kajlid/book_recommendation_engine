  "description": "This travel memoir tells the true story of one man's struggle to help a desolate Saharan village lift itself from poverty and into self-sufficiency. \"The stuff that dreams are made of--and it's all real.\" --Kirkus Reviews \"Seasons of Sand entertains right through its surprise, disturbing ending, and leaves one with a sense of an exotic place and its people--everything that can be asked of a good travel book.\" --Brad Newsham, San Francisco Chronicler \"Frank and humorous, filled with marvelous people and the details of his own daily life, Aebi's book tells an original tale.\" --Publishers Weekly \"With the guts of Hemingway and the erudition of Sir Richard Burton, Aebi's writing is pure exhilaration. Amazing grace under pressure and a graceful zaniness pressed like wild flowers between so many pages, the result is deeply moving, wildly funny, and profoundly impressive.\" --Paul William Roberts, River in the Desert",
