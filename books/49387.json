  "title": "Rosa's Child: One Woman's Search for Her Past",
  "description": "This remarkable, tragic story is ultimately an uplifting account of one woman's determined journey in search of her past and herself. In London in 1939, 3-year-old Susi Bechhöfer had just arrived in London on the Kindertransport evacuating Jewish children from Germany. Adopted by a childless Welsh minister and his wife, she and her twin sister were given a new identity to erase all traces of their previous existence. Only fifty years later do these women discover they're the daughters of Rosa Bechhöfer, a young Jewish woman who perished in the gas chambers of Auschwitz, and Otto Hald, a proud soldier in Hitler's army. The discovery of her real identity propels Susi on a painful and courageous quest in search of her past and the surviving members of her natural family. In the course of her search, she confronts dark secrets from her own past and urgently needs to reappraise her life. Now a practicing psychotherapist, the memory of Rosa, the mother she never knew, will always be with her.",
