  "description": "Recently out of college, broke, jobless, and without a boyfriend, Lou Whitson is recognized by a talent scout at a football game, and then offered the opportunity of a lifetime. To be the star of a reality television show. Along with it, $500,000 in prize money. There is a catch, but it isn't much. Especially considering her life's lack of love. Live with six different men, one a month, for six months. Then, pick one to marry for an additional $500,000. A Navy SEAL, a biker, a jock, a surfer, a business man, and a billionaire. Without hesitation, she agrees. This is her story. It's smoking hot, sexy, funny, and will take place at the pace of one book a month for six months. Each book has a satisfying ending (never a cliffhanger) that will leave you grinning for more.",
