Inside, assailed by mysterious forces, doctors and patients are left to remember the world they've lost and to imagine one to come.

Simultaneously epic and intimate, wildly imaginative and unexpectedly relevant, The Children's Hospital is a work of stunning scope, mesmerizing detail, and wrenching emotion.",
