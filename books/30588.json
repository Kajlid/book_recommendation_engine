  "description": "Linda Pischke, wife, mother and social worker is convinced the justice system is fair until she receives an invitation that forces her to question every middle-class belief she has about crime and criminals. When a retired priest asks Linda to serve at the county jail she is certain itâ€™s a mistake. How could God possibly use a lukewarm Christian in jail ministry? The call brings her to Block 12 a holding unit for women waiting trial. Linda believes she is the teacher and the women are her students, but God has another plan. As the prisoners reveal their deepest personal stories, Linda realizes she has much to learn about faith, courage and what it means to be a friend. A page-turner - both heartbreaking and humorous. The reader will never forget the women of Block 12.",
