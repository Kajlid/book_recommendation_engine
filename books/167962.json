  "description": "X-Men meets Blake Crouch in the addictive, explosive conclusion to Daniel Price’s genre-bending Silvers trilogy about six extraordinary people whose fates become intertwined on an Earth far different from our own...one that is headed for utter destruction.It's been two years since the world collapsed in a sheet of light, obliterating everything on Earth...but not quite everyone. Saved from the apocalypse by three mysterious beings, sisters Hannah and Amanda Given were marked with silver bracelets and transported to an entirely different Earth, a place where restaurants move through the air like flying saucers and the fabric of time is manipulated by common household appliances. Joined by four other survivors from their native world, each wearing an identical, irremovable bracelet, the new companions became known as the Silvers. Afflicted with time-bending powers they never wanted, and on the run from unexpected new enemies, the Silvers embarked on a dangerous journey for survival across an alien America—a hunt for answers that bound the group like family while revealing the gravely sinister intentions of their “saviors.\"But their new Earth is about to suffer the same fate as the old one and the Silvers have only ten weeks to prevent it. Their one hope is to find the remaining survivors of their home world—a quest that will take them from Mexico to England to a radically changed Japan—to gain more allies for the final confrontation with the god-like beings who first brought them to this Earth. Failure will mean death for billions of people. But victory may come at a cost the Silvers cannot afford.",
