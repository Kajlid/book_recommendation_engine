Wiersbe discusses basic biblical instruction on defeating the strategies of the devil. Centering his material on Satan’s attacks as deceiver, destroyer, ruler, and accuser, the author emphasizes conquering the enemy by obeying God’s truth. Chapters are included on defeating the devil in the church and in the home.",
