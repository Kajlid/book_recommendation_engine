Arthur Conan Doyle has written that \"[Stevenson's] short stories are certain to retain their position in English literature. His serious rivals are few indeed.\"This Modern Library Paperback Classics edition includes explanatory notes, a Scots' Glossary, and a unique appendix dedicated to Stevenson's influence on the Oxford English Dictionary.",
