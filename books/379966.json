  "title": "Transported: Erotic Travel Tales",
  "description": "Something about traveling can bring your blood to the boil: Is it the exotic locales? The chance encounters with attractive strangers? The break from the routine? These nine sizzling tales of love and lust on the move capture a few of these scenarios: A single woman, wandering the dusty corridors of an old bookstore, runs across a book of erotic woodcuts… and a man with like interests. A slide presentation at an Alaska hotel has some of the guests squirming. A long train ride offers a young woman a chance to examine how she truly feels about her body … with two other passengers. Two lovers on a business trip to Japan confront their problems and their passions in a steamy outdoor bath. A man on a layover makes excellent use of his downtime. Told from both male and female points of view, Sharazade’s inventive stories of goings and … well, you know … will have you at the edge of your window seat, spinning your own fantasies about the unexplored potential of planes, trains, and hotels.Although Transported touches on themes of exhibitionism, voyeurism, bondage, and group sex, its stories contain a large dose of old-fashioned romance and feature independent women with healthy egos. “I enjoy stories that are realistic enough that they might have happened,” the author says, “and fanciful enough that they might not have. I value communication, adventure, exploration, passion, and love, and they’re present in some form in all of my stories.”",
