  "description": "From the cover:In a comprehensive narrative of courage, passion and forever friendship, sixteen year-old Tessa Price, an orphan with a broken heart, little trust and eyes on the future has one really big wish. That someday she could get out of the lives of her Aunt Kiki and Kiki’s abusive husband, Dino, or just die. The difficult-to-impress Tessa spends her days theoretically saving everyone. She is a heroine of an unlikely kind who denies her pain and regret by getting wrapped up in the troubles of others to forget her own. With rock-star sized aspirations, Tessa seizes one moment in time and rolls the dice, taking her teenage friends on a life-changing journey, crashing and burning into someday. That road is wrought with grief and catastrophe and Tessa struggles to keep things together, while denying herself true love and ignoring her limitations until it’s too late. As she watches her friends spiral to rock bottom, Tessa blames herself for their fall from grace. When the death of a loved one sends her reeling into substance abuse, Tessa, everyone’s champ, falls to her knees and becomes everything she hates. Even the life growing inside her seems unable to deter her from a path of self destruction. Can Tessa rise, once again, from the ashes? Moreover, will her champion wait for her with a genuine love forever?",
