  "description": "This tongue-in-cheek romantic short story takes place in 2186 at Earth II Headquarters at the Dream Actualization Clinic. It's been out of fashion to engage in romantic and physical relationships for well over a hundred years; the emotionless method now in play is photosensory sex. Galaxy officials deliberately manipulated citizens to \"go cerebral\" and focus on intellectual pursuits to reduce conflict in the confined living conditions of space stations. But subversive elements such as the Climax Factory lurk beneath the galaxy's facade of sexless, intellectual utopia, and some of its residents are going off-zone to explore the forbidden world of sensory pleasure.After nine hand-fastings that didn't work out, Ariana is still struggling to quell an over-abundance of emotions and desires. She has come to the famous Dr. Alec Duval for fantasy treatments...only to discover that beneath his party-line facade, he is as desperate for genuine love as she is.Atlas Shrugged Again is spicy and it's ironic/humorous tone entertains.",
