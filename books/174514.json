  "title": "The Fall Of The House Of Habsburg",
  "description": "Edward Crankshaw's distinguished study offers a compelling account of the final decades of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. At the centre of the dramatic events stands the majestic figure of the Emperor Franz Josef, facing the tragedies of his disastrous marriage and the suicide of his only son, and doggedly resisting the ruin of his inheritance. In a sweeping panorama of Vienna, Imperial Russia, Napolean's France, Bismark's Prussia and Cavour's Italy, Crankshaw portrays the political and military intricacies, the statesman, soldiers and common people, and examines the ambitions and disillusionment that broke the Empire and forged the destiny of the twentieth century.",
