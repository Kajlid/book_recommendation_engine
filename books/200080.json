  "description": "Short stories from the radiant \"cute-brut\" world of a truly remarkable artist Against Pain is the first collection of multipage anthology pieces by Ron Regé, Jr. The storytelling side of his expressive work is featured in these comic strips gathered from McSweeney's, The New York Times, Kramers Ergot, NON, Rosetta, Arthur, The Comics Journal, and Drawn & Quarterly's anthology. Suicide bombers, art appreciation, a Lynda Barry \"cover,\" and even a Tylenol-sponsored comic about pain are brought together under the theme of suffering andhow people cope with it. Against Pain also includes the alt-comics zine classic Boys:a twenty-two-page collaborative comic--considered by many to be Regé's finest work--illustrating the \"lust life\" of a friend in explicitly honest and hilarious detail.",
