  "title": "An Englishman in Patagonia",
  "description": "When John Pilkington journeyed through Patagonia, he found that being Patagonian is more a matter of how you feel than where you live. Patagonians are resolute dreamers, and as he meets the Welsh and Scottish settlers, the Nazi refugees and the hippy exiles he meditates on what it is that drives people to live and travel in such inhospitable regions.",
