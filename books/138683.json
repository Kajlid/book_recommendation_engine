  "description": "Discover the Secret Sky universe and embark on an epic fantasy adventure! The stars speak in a language of secrets, yet their stories cannot remain hidden forever. Do you ever dream of flying through the stars? Skylar does, but his dreams are more than just dreams—they’re the key to saving his world. Billions of years ago on an ancient Earth, Skylar’s life is turned upside down when he leaves his home for the last time. To survive, he must fall in with the knights who destroyed his peasant village and live under the shadow of the king who sent them to exterminate Skylar’s people. But no one realizes Skylar is haunted by dreams where he becomes a starship soaring through space. Magic, which should only exist in dreams, becomes real—and he holds immense powers others would not want him to have. Skylar must keep his head down, and his secrets hidden, for as long as possible. Enter a world filled with monsters, brave knights, powerful magic, hidden treasures, and ancient mysteries. Because the key to unlocking it all is the Secret Sky that guides Skylar’s dreams.",
