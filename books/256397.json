  "description": "What if all you want is the one thing you can’t have? First grade teacher Emily Towson always does the right thing. The sensible thing. But in her dreams, she does bad, bad things with the town’s baddest Tanner O’Connor. But when he sells her grandmother a Harley, fantasy is about to meet a dose of reality.And then he goes and calls her “sensible”...Tanner can’t believe sweet Emily is standing in his shop. Yelling and waving her hands and looking so god damn sexy he’s having trouble focusing. He’d spent two hard years in prison, with only the thought of this “good girl” to keep him sane.He really should send her away...Before either one thinks though, they’re naked and making memories on his tool bench with apparently the oldest condom in history. Now Tanner’s managed to knock-up the town’s “good girl” and she’s going to lose her job over some stupid “morality clause” if he doesn’t step up.But can this bad boy teach his good girl they’re perfect for each other in time?",
