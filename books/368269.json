  "title": "The Faery Reel: Tales from the Twilight Realm",
  "description": "Faeries, or creatures like them, can be found in almost every culture the world over--benevolent and terrifying, charming and exasperating, shifting shape from country to country, story to story, and moment to moment. In The Faery Reel, acclaimed anthologists Ellen Datlow and Terri Windling have asked some of today's finest writers of fantastic fiction for short stories and poems that draw on the great wealth of world faery lore and classic faery literature. These authors, including Neil Gaiman (American Gods; Coraline), Gregory Maguire (Mirror Mirror), Patricia A. McKillip (Ombria in Shadow), Charles de Lint (The Blue Girl), Holly Black (The Spiderwick Chronicles), and Kelly Link (Stranger Things Happen), have contributed stories and poems that are varied, unexpected, and wonderfully absorbing reading. Charles Vess's lovely decorations bring each piece to life; as an added bonus, Terri Windling provides a fascinating, thoughtful essay on the history of faery literature.This companion to the World Fantasy Award-winner and Locus best-seller The Green Man is edgy, provocative, and thoroughly magical. Like the faeries themselves.",
