  "description": "To most people it looks as if Angela Bushman had it all: a marriage of 21 years, three wonderful children, and a comfortable life in a beautiful family home. But something was not right, and deep inside she had known it for a long time. Then one day it happenedâ€”she could no longer deny her authentic self. She stepped beyond fear, gave up everything she considered normal or comfortable, including family, friends, and community, and embarked on a journey to discover authentic freedom. She now shares her gift with the world. Her courageous story provides the process and inspiration for anyone seeking their true self.",
