Junya can’t imagine who (or what) would have it in for his family, but he’s positive it has something to do with the heavily guarded safe in his grandfather’s office. Yet the deeper he digs, the stranger things become: earthquakes no one else can feel, spotting dangers no one else can sense…and being followed by strange men with reptile eyes and forked tongues.Now he’s being hunted—by his grandfather’s own men. It’s only thanks to a mysterious and beautiful Japanese exchange student that Junya’s able to escape. But why does she keep disappearing on him? How does she know so much about his family? And is she here to help him…or kill him?4.4 out of 5 Stars on Amazon.com",
