  "description": "Hi, I’m Alexis Delaney. I’m your average 17-year-old girl. Except I can see the dead. And talk to the dead and help them move on. So… okay, I’m not your average 17-year-old girl. The Veil is still shut. Which means the dead can’t move on, not on their own. Through my Link to the Veil, I’ve been able to start helping souls to cross. The Veil is changing, healing. Like I am.Since I came home from the hospital, I’ve been hiding behind my best friends. That’s about to change. I want my life back. I’m ready to get back to normal. Then Sophie, the twins’ little sister, tells me she’s ready to cross over. Ethan pulled her back, and now it was time to face it. I have to tell Ethan and Isaac their sister’s soul is in their house. What the hell am I going to say?",
