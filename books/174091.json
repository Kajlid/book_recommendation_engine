  "description": "Hraban the Marcomanni has been cast out of his tribe by his treacherous father Maroboodus. He has lost his tribe, his mother and both grandfathers, and his fame and honor with the ones he loved. He has been lied to, he has been used to further his father’s plots and in the end discarded, and his lot was to linger in slavery to Odo, a priest to Lok until he would die, having fulfilled the needs of a deadly prophecy.  However, he refused to die.  Instead, he escaped Odo and the Roman ally king, Vago the Vangione, and took the head of his mother’s slayer. Now, he will go home. He will go home to burn his father’s hall for revenge, and to erase the blot on his fame, the title of the Oath Breaker, by deeds of bravery and spears. He has much to pay back for, his friends to rescue and his fame to regain.  Yet, his allies are few and none come without a price. In the end, Hraban will find the road to regaining his fame is twisted and tricky, and what he will find might be entirely different from what he set out to gain.",
