  "description": "He’s always saved her. Now she’s going to return the favor... Gray Duffy never thought he’d end up as the co-lead guitarist of Oblivion, one of the hottest rock bands in the country. Even better? He's sharing the experience with his best friend, Jazz. Since the day she’d showed up as his family’s new foster kid, Gray has protected her. Loved her. And not just platonically either. After all these years of wanting her in his bed, he still doesn't know what it would be like to have her mouth on his. Except for that one time. The time he’d shared her with Nick. The best worst night of his life. Now they’re living their dream. They’re making music together and spending every waking moment trapped in tight quarters. With success at their fingertips, the time is right for him to finally make his move toward the woman he needs. He just never figured he would lose control. Or that she would find out. They’ve loved each other through everything. But what if this time love just isn’t enough?",
