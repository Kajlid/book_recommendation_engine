  "description": "Scarlett was a sensible seventeen year old young lady or so everyone thought, but there was definitely more to her. The daughter of famous English Egyptologists and archeologists Theodore and Gemma Seely, she was prone to adventure and all the world had to offer. It was the 1890s, and she had just received a letter from one of her parents' dearest friend, a certain detective who lived on Baker Street, who needed her help on a case most bizarre. As she embarks through the supernatural side of London, ventures into the forbidden realms bordering Victorian society; often accompanied by a dashing but infuriating Lord Darthmoor; Scarlett's first case, which had seemed so innocent at first had taken a turn for the unexpected and dangerous.Official Steampunk Scarlett Trailer:http://youtu.be/itEiEa6Pa6U",
