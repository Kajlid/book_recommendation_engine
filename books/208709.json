  "description": "Henry Santiago resigned from the Bureau of Detectives when it cost him his family-the wife who divorced him; the missing daughter he failed to protect. Now transient, he finds himself in a bar in Carvel Ohio. When a local teenager dies in his arms, however, Santiago will be dragged into a conspiracy of murder, kidnapping, and small town political corruption. Former nationally-renowned demonologist and Carvel native, Everett Sturm, blames the crime on a satanic cult. The girl's family suspects her boyfriend, who himself has been missing for nearly a year. When the mayor's daughter disappears Santiago has reason to suspect her political rival as the killer. However, none of these theories are correct.",
