  "description": "Lillie is an assassin. Itâ€™s not exactly the life she would have chosen, but she has made the best of it. Until now. Disguised as a servant at the palace, she waits for an opportunity to kill the heir to the throne. Her conscience tells her that killing an innocent man is wrong, but failure to do so will mean her death. Nef, a handsome stable hand, is intrigued by the young red-haired maid that has charmed the animals in his care. He longs to know her better, but harbors secrets of his own - secrets that could rock the very foundations of the kingdom. With their lives forfeit, Lillie and Nef must work together to find a way to save themselves, their love, and two thrones from destruction at the hands of an evil overlord.",
