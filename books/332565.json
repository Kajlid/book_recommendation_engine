But Lauren doesn't have time to pine over lost love. If she doesn't get her songwriting mojo back-and fast-The Kingmakers' new album is going to be a colossal failure.When Lauren returns home to New York for a recording session, a publicity stunt gone awry brings her face-to-face with her past and her biggest regret: Danny Padovano, the ex-boyfriend who broke her heart.

Lauren knows she's playing with fire-things are a lot more complicated now than they were when Lauren and Danny were younger, and the stakes are much, much higher. Soon, everything Lauren's worked so hard to achieve starts to unravel.Can she come to terms with her regrets? Or will they finally destroy her?",
