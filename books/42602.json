  "description": "Mya realizes prayers aren't always answered the way she thinks they should be when her pleas for her friend, Mercedes, who is having a difficult pregnancy, results in the sudden appearance of the stunningly beautiful seraph, Garamond, who doesn't seem to have a clue how to help anybody. Even though Mya's guardian angel, Pershabael, takes her under his wing, so to speak, everything Garamond does seems to rub Mya the wrong way. More so when Mya discovers Pershabael and the lovely Garamond have a past.",
