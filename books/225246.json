  "description": "Written by Brian Johnston, a former nuclear scientist turned missionary, this book draws together some of his previously published writings on apologetics to produce a concerted offensive against what the apostle Paul would surely describe as the ‘indefensible’ arguments of the so-called ‘New Atheists’.The short chapters in Brian’s conversational style serve as an ideal entry-level primer for anyone wanting to get to grips with one of the most important of today’s debates.",
