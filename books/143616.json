  "description": "A sugar baby in love. A doctor with a heartbreaking secret. And a love neither of them ever expected to find.  Lucy McPherson struggled all of her adult life to take care of her daughter and later, her mother. At the age of twenty-eight, she became a ‘companion’ to Bradley Blackwell, seeing him one weekend a month and being compensated handsomely enough to ease her worries.  Two years in, Lucy realizes she’s broken rule #1 and fallen in love.  Afraid of losing him, Lucy keeps her feelings private, only for Bradley to begin acting strangely and breaking the rules himself.  When she finds out the past that Bradley has kept hidden from her and the world, she begins questioning their whole relationship.  The revelations leave her wondering if she is truly the one with the most to lose…or if he is.",
