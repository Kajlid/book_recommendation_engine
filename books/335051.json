With the Anti Magick Alliance closing in on me, the Bureau convinced I murdered a helpless human, and the Human Extinction League getting ready to unleash their plans on Phoenix Falls, I'll need all the strength I can find to survive. But I'm pretty sure there will be time for some fun along the way... 'Ashes' is the third book in The Phoenix Prophecy series. It is a full-length paranormal reverse harem novel with graphic sexual content, sword-crossing, possible triggers, and a cliffhanger. It is aimed at readers 18+.",
