  "description": "Bandit or lawman… this man will take what he wants.  Having the misfortune of being in a bank at the time of a robbery, Nurse Greta Stock treats one of the wounded gunmen, the man shot right before her eyes. The bandit is a handsome devil with a knowing smile, so she had best watch her step with this one, because he might just steal more than her money.  In Silver River on a job, Travis Brooks ends up in the hospital being treated by a winsome blonde with a pretty smile. Although harboring more than one secret, he is here for a reason. He yearns to reveal the truth to Greta, but he must continue the charade, although it might just be the death of him.",
