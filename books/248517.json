  "title": "Food Addiction, Binge Eating, Addiction Recovery: Choose: Health, Life, and Love",
  "description": "This book is written for food addicts and binge eaters with information applicable for almost any addict. This person may have type II diabetes, prediabetes, or neither. This is not a diet book. Some people will be able to eat more than they currently eat. This is about changing behavior and thinking. This is about changing the way you think about food, life, and health. This is about lifestyle changes and enjoying life more fully. My purpose is to help you learn new skills and change thinking and behavior---if it is needed. For some, this will require a fundamental change in thinking, a paradigm shift. It may turn your world COMPLETELY upside down, and that just may be a good thing. For many of us, our world, or at least our health is already turned upside down. There is a term some of you may have heard, \"right a boat,\" or something similar. Our health has been turned upside down and our goal is to right it, or turn it back to a way that provides more opportunity for health, wellness, and smooth sailing. Many of you may already know or believe much of what you'll read here. You have tried some of this. This may only be an affirmation of what you already know and tools to help you organize that information and put it into action. This book is especially for binge eaters and food addicts. While binge eating is recognized as an official diagnosable disorder, food addiction is not, though anyone with one, knows it exists.",
