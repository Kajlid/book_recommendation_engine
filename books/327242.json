  "description": "Football is one hundred percent the focus of my life—until a squawking toddler, with a temper to rival my own, lands in my lap and flips my life upside down.I’ll never be Dad of the Year. Anyone will tell you that. Except maybe Sienna, my sister’s former roommate, who somehow manages to make my broody ass laugh and sees something in me no one else does.When Sienna offers to let me and my little princess move in with her, I’m not sure if it’s to help or because she wants revenge on my teammate and long-time rival, who broke her heart.Either way, I’m game. Because I need to get my ex off my back, and Sienna doesn’t mind pretending to be my girlfriend.Only neither of us is ready for the sparks that fly between us or the consequences when they do.★ What you can expect:- single dad- small Texas town- sports romance (football)- college (seniors)- fake dating- friends to lovers- diverse backgrounds- slow burn but steamy!",
