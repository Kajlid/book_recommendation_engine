  "title": "God: As He Longs for You to See Him",
  "description": "God is often described as all-knowing, all-loving, and all-powerful. But are there other traits that we overlook? What is God really like? Can we truly put his eternal attributes into words? And how does the way we describe God affect our relationship with him? Best-selling author and speaker Chip Ingram helps readers answer these questions and more in this fascinating study of seven attributes of God. With engaging insight, Ingram guides readers through a challenging but accessible study of God's goodness, sovereignty, holiness, wisdom, justice, love, and faithfulness. Inspiring and perceptive, As He Longs for You to See Him may forever change the way readers see their Creator, even as it shows how their view of him influences every decision in their lives.",
