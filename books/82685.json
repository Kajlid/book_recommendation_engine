  "description": "Abby, Jun, Henry and Neil are four sstudents at Capstone Ridge University in late 70s and early 80s. The first three years of college life the friends bonded at the dorms, worked together in their studies—forming a life-long friendship—and decided to go to graduate school together. Once the decision was made they knew they wanted a house together. Abby, being the rich boy of the bunch, fronted a lot of the money for their house, earning him the master suit of their craftsman style house on steroids. Too bad about that bathroom. Jun, the nerd of the group, has the carpentry experience they all need to get the house in working condition. Henry and Neil just do the grunt worked handed down to them and try to keep their heads down. As the friends work through the senior year and prep for grad school, they will hit road blocks and uncertainty—not to mention a few flames. Abby, himself, trying to make it through the year with his undying attraction to Neil remaining concealed. But a few flames and a dress may ruin his 'secret'.",
