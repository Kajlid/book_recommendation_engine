  "description": "Egyptian-goddess descendant Selk nearly lost everything while returning a stolen artifact to an alternate dimension called Post World to prevent her family from dropping dead. After a pleasant spell of happy, normal college life, everything changes when she begins experiencing inexplicable pain and blackouts. That confirms her worst fear, that there is one more artifact left to return, but she never dreamed she’d have to enter a new Post World. Fighting her way through vast dangerous landscapes, eccentric creatures, and new enemies, she clutches two goals: keep her family safe—and avoid mummies at all costs.",
