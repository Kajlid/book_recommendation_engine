  "description": "MishkaAngels, demons… the afterlife.I’d always thought they were bull****.Until all my misguided beliefs were proven wrong by an infuriating, flippant a**hole with horns who has no concept of boundaries.Summoning him was never the plan, especially since I’m not willing to do what it takes to send him back.If I’ve learned anything from Loch, it’s that preconceived ideas are usually false, and the truth is much messier than fables.The theory of good and evil is flawed.Nothing is that simple.LochThe only side of human nature I’ve ever encountered is vile and perverse, depraved and cruel.However, Mishka’s none of those things.She’s an insufferable, snarky creature who makes me question everything I know about myself.The longer I’m with her in this world, the less desperate I am to return to mine, which is absurd.I am son of Asmodeus.A prince spawned from lust to torment the damned.The mortal realm is not where I belong.Incubastard deals with Christian lore that does not align with the Bible. It is completely fictional. If this will make you uncomfortable, please do not read this book.Content This book may have content that is disturbing for some readers. Mature audiences only.",
