Written by Ellis (Transmetropolitan, Planetary), with art by StormWatch: Change or Die's Tom Raney - who also provides a new cover (inked by Crimson's Sandra Hope) - and Randy Elliott, Force of Nature includes the stories that introduced The Authority's Jenny Sparks and Jack Hawksmoor, as well as WildStorm's most infamous villainess, Rose Tattoo. The companion volume to Stormwatch: A Finer World, the new collection begins with StormWatch Weatherman Henry Bendix planning big changes for the group, beginning with a total reorganization of the team. Gathering new StormWatch operatives - including Jack Hawksmoor and woman of the century Jenny Sparks - the Weatherman positions himself as an international superpower, setting in motion the events that would cause the 'Watch's final demise.Collecting: StormWatch 37-42",
