  "description": "Relentless in their pursuit of perfection, the rock trolls have waged war for millennia. Legendary warriors, vast armies, and even dragons have fallen before their might. But now their enemy comes from within. Rising to the throne by right, King Sybrik seeks conflict even as his people dwindle and perish. His thirst for blood will see no end.  Unless Tryton can stop him.  Endowed with strength, gifted in battle, it is his honor that sets him apart and leaves an indelible mark on friend and foe alike. Now it will require all his skill to end the age of warâ€”before Sybrik incites a conflict that cannot be won. But Sybrik has his own plan, and hunts a weapon lost by time. If he finds it he will become powerful beyond measure.  And all that lives will be his prey.",
