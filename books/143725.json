  "description": "She woke in the dark. The sharp surge and sway of her world the only hints she has of her surroundings.  Penelope Santoro is alone, trapped in an empty room of what could only be a boat in the middle of a rough ocean. With no recollection of how she got there, and no escape in sight, she's quickly losing hope that she will ever find her way home.  Tag Reynolds is detached. His life depends upon it. But when the beautiful daughter of one of his biggest rivals winds up in his care, his entire world shifts. Drawn to her innocence, he desperately fights the feelings he can't have...feelings that could destroy everything he's worked for.  Penny is nothing more than a pawn in a deadly game -- a game that Tag cannot afford to lose. Can he save her without compromising his position, or will they become victims of their twisted desire?",
