  "description": "* First published in the anthology, The More The Merrier.Cara has spent her entire life as the good girl – the straight-A, straight-laced, good girl – and she’s tired of it.  When her roommate Meredith invites her to a private party, one that will earn her fifteen hundred dollars just to attend, she discovers a hidden world where society’s rules hold no sway, where sex is readily available under the privilege of anonymity and safety, and a mysterious man wants to bring her dark side out to play.  Will Cara run and ignore the thrill the party brings her, or will she dive in head first to discover what she’s really capable of?  Note: This story includes a nice dose of tall, dark, dominant, and handsome, several scenes of hot sex with multiple partners, and a heaping dash of BDSM to top it all off. Knowing all of that, will you accept The Invitation?  EXTRAS: This edition includes the exclusive short 'Ben's Day' and a sneak peak at Jennifer Bene's upcoming novel 'Security Binds Her'! Enjoy!",
