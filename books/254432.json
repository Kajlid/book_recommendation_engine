  "description": "Duncan M. Hamilton debuts the first book in a fast-moving trilogy—a dangerous tale of lost magics, unlikely heroes, and reawakened dragons.IT'S BEEN A THOUSAND YEARS since dragons filled the skies above the countryside. A thousand years since mages and swordsmen joined forces to battle the magical creatures to destruction.In the centuries since, those with magical talent have been burned at the stake—save for a handful recruited by Prince Bishop to serve his own ambitions. The Chevaliers fell into debauchery and drunkenness and were disbanded. There's been war and struggle, but mostly, the people of Mirabaya have gone on about their lives in peace.Until now.A dragon awakens deep in the mountains of Mirabaya, racked by hunger, tormented by grief and anger. For him, the thousand years have passed in the blink of an eye. He soars forth from his cave, eager to fill his stomach and take revenge on the humans who slaughtered his mate.After Prince Bishop's mages are killed trying to destroy the dragon, Mirabaya's young king has no choice but to track down the last Chevalier of the Silver Circle. Perhaps Guillot dal Villerauvais has the magic and heroism of the knights of old.He doesn't.But he has a sense of duty and a conscience. And if that means he dies facing a menace no one has seen in a thousand years, so be it.",
