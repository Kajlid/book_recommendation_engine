  "description": "If Angela Grace, reporter for The Postulator, hadn’t seen the gorgeous naked man with her own eyes—and shot some rousing photographs to boot—who would have believed her? Yet, there he stood in all his glory staring up at the full moon in the deep woods of the Colorado foothills. It wasn’t until the tabloid ran the titillating photo on the cover that she found out, Blaze Trent, reclusive millionaire in question, took issue with his privacy being sold to pay Angela’s rent. Worse, the article in her paper not only exposed him, but her wild speculations exposed the vulnerable wards he protected and put her life in unthinkable danger as well. But over night, Blaze changed everything Angela believed in and her world would never be the same again—without him.",
