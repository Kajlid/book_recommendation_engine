  "title": "Cellular Hypoxia and Neuro-Immune Fatigue",
  "description": "Chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia have severe and sometimes disabling symptoms, yet the affected patient looks well. In this book a mechanism is presented arguing that these illnesses are defined by decreased cellular energy production. This is not a book that describes the signs and symptoms of the illnesses; it is a book that explores mechanisms that lie beneath the complex symptom patterns. Dr. David Bell is a well recognized expert in chronic fatigue syndrome. He is the author of several books and was chairman of the Department of Health and Human Services Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Advisory Committee.",
