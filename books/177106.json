  "description": "His whole life, Myles has suffered pain and rejection. He knows that he deserves it—what use could anyone have for a tiny, pathetic werewolf like him? In a last bid for survival, he seeks refuge with the Lone Wolf Pack—but he has no expectations or hopes for the future. He definitely doesn't expect to find his mate.Braendan is one of the oldest Sidhe on earth. Endless centuries of loneliness have made him bitter and irritable, and when he meets the adorable werewolf, he reacts poorly and makes the worst first impression to the man—to his mate.Both men are broken in different ways, and both think they are no good for one another. Shannon Simmons might be only a baby, but he will have none of that nonsense. Sometimes, adults need all the help they can get—and really, if he nudges them in the right direction, who can blame him?",
