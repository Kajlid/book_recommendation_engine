  "description": "African the Untold Story... Opinions of Judgments represent a position on an issue that is measured against standards other than those of personal taste; standards that are rooted in values and beliefs of our what's true and false, right and wrong, good and bad, better and worse. This dialogue will consist of real life events, facts, and statistics and address the issue of reparations and why payment to African Americans are 150+ years overdue. This argument is for everyone that is Black, and YES, I will start with the Bible and Jesus Christ, and the role of The Church. We will address the Crusades, the Colonization of Africa, Slavery in America, Willie Lynch Syndrome, Share Cropping, Jim Crow/KKK era, Civil Rights Movement and its aftermath, those currently receiving reparations; AND THEN, I will make my case.",
