  "title": "The Corner Office",
  "description": "Kayla Gardner was a tough, conniving beauty who didn't mind using her body to get ahead. Trading sex to the arrogant Michael Stone in exchange for a corner office had seemed like such a simple idea at the time. But she had underestimated just how cruel and ruthless he could be. In the brutal world of office politics she found herself involved in cutthroat, backroom intrigues at their worst. If she is to make it to the ranks of the senior partners it will be kill or be killed, destroy or be destroyed, eat, or be swallowed up. The powerful heights of a wealthy New York law firm form the backdrop for a tale of cruel lesbians and vicious, power hungry lawyers, of greed and sexual predators, of blackmail, lust and shattered Graphic sex and sexuality",
