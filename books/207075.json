  "description": "While similarity and correlation don’t automatically imply viability, finding a close match or discovering a large overlap between independent schools of thought, particularly those schools which have passed Einstein’s test of experience, lends a great deal of credibility to the common elements. Even in science, the idea of certainty is approached with caution. “As far as the propositions of mathematics refer to reality they are not certain,” Dr. Einstein explains; “and as far as they are certain they do not refer to reality.” The scientific method uses confirmation and correlation to move incrementally closer to certainty but always stops short of declaring it complete; so should we proceed in moral and ethical philosophy so as to not only keep up with science but to converge with it.
