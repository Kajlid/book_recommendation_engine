  "description": "In his second book, Adam Carolla€”author of New York Times bestseller In Fifty Years We'll All Be Chicks and chart-topping podcaster€”reveals all the stories behind how he came to be the angry middle-aged man he is today. Funnyman Adam Carolla is known for two hilarious rants about things that drive him crazy and personal stories about everything from his hardscrabble childhood to his slacker friends to the hypocrisy of Hollywood. He tackled rants in his first book, and now he tells his best stories and debuts some never-before-heard tales as well. Organized by the myriad \"dumps\" Carolla called home€”through the flophouse apartments he rented in his twenties, up to the homes he personally renovated after achieving success in Hollywood€”the anecdotes here follow Adam's journey and the hilarious pitfalls along the way. Adam Carolla started broke and blue collar and has now been on the Hollywood scene for over fifteen year",
