  "description": "Kingsley.... I thought letting loose for a night would be a good thing. He was cute and lived close by, why not? I didn't plan to fall for his boyfriend... The boyfriend that I didn't know he had.... The boyfriend that caught us together, asleep on his couch.... The boyfriend that had cancer. I also didn't expect to go back and explain myself the next day.... Or to run into him a few days later; seeing him sick and alone.... But I did... I did all those things, and now the more time I spend with him,  the more time I want... I just need him to stop pushing me away.... I need him to get better.... I need him to survive.... I just need him....  Kingsley's story is book #2 in this series of Kennedy Ink. It contains strong language and adult situations.  (Don't worry. I'm a sucker for a happily ever after)",
