  "description": "Mauve’s a little needy. But could you blame her? She’s the daughter of an actress and a circus clown – craving attention is in her blood. Unfortunately, her attempt to dazzle the popular kids at high school ends in pity and actual egg yolk. She has never been one to give up. When she sort-of gets invited to an influencer-star studded birthday party, she knows this is her big break. The only one stopping Mauve is herself, and she can’t handle any more egg on her face. Perfect for fans of The Field Guide to the North American Teenager and Dork Diaries.",
