  "title": "The Third Buddha",
  "description": "Jameson Currier expands his richly detailed storytelling to an international level in this new novel, weaving together the intertwining stories of the search for a missing journalist in the Bamiyan region of Afghanistan with a young man's search for his older brother in Manhattan in the aftermath of 9/11.The result is a sweeping, multi-cultural novel of what it means to be a gay citizen of the world.Like Currierâ€™s previous work (Where the Rainbow Ends, Dancing on the Moon), the author once again targets the big themes of modern gay life in his new novel: identity, faith, homophobia, romance, and the complexity of relationships, but at the heart of The Third Buddha are the little acts of random kindness that continue to astonish in times of crisis and war.",
