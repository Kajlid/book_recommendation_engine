  "title": "More than Words: 10 Values for the Modern Family",
  "description": "“What could be more valuable to us than family? But what could be more divisive and troubling than the way the term ’family values’ has been used as a weapon in today’s culture wars? I’m so glad that Erin Wathen has given us a fresh take on family values in her beautifully written, very readable new book, More than Words. Mom, blogger, and pastor, Erin is a writer worth following, starting with More than Words.” —Brian D. McLarenThe values we live and raise our families by are grounded, first, in love. Contrary to many of today’s so-called family values, our values go beyond one or two loaded social issues to a wholehearted lifestyle of practicing compassion, hospitality, justice, peace, and belonging.More than Words articulates ten values that forward-thinking, openhearted people want to embody in their lives and pass on to their children. With practical ideas and thought-provoking questions, this book inspires families to live more intentionally, engage their communities, and make a difference in the world.",
