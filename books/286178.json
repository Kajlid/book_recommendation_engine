  "description": "Stay alive at all costs. No attachments, no looking back, no emotion.\n\n\nI met Noah’s gaze steadily. “We all have our weaknesses. Yours is blood. Tobias just happens to be mine.”“Tobias? Your friend … or is he your lover?”My neck heated. “That’s none of your business.”This time Noah’s smile was wider, almost predatory, and a shiver of apprehension bordering on fear skated up my spine. He stood up and walked over to me, and I realized how the space between us had been a buffer, how the air was suddenly too charged. He crouched so he was at eye level, and my breath stalled in my lungs, but I kept perfectly still, refusing to shy away, to show weakness, to be afraid. His leonine gaze remained on my face, but his hand came up, fingers settling on the hammering pulse of my jugular.“No, Eva, that’s where you’re wrong. Blood isn’t our weakness. Blood is our power.”\n\n\nThe Collection contains all three books and a sequel novella. \nFor the Blood - book 1For the Power - book 2For the Reign - book 3For the Hunt - book 4 (Novella)\n\n\nThere is no hope. There is no haven. Not alone. Not until them…\nSurvive, my father said. Look out for no one except yourself. But sometimes the only way to survive is to make attachments. Sometimes the only way to live is to accept a dance with death. And right now, for me, the path to survival is in the blood. Here’s to hoping it doesn’t kill me.",
