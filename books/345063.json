  "description": "Harper Blaine was your average small-time P.I. until a two-bit perp's savage assault left her dead for two minutes. When she comes to in the hospital, she sees things that can only be described as weird;shapes emerging from a foggy grey mist, snarling teeth, creatures roaring.But Harper's not crazy. Her \"death\" has made her a Greywalker; able to move between the human world and the mysterious cross-over zone where things that go bump in the night exist. And her new gift is about to drag her into that strange new realm:whether she likes it or not.",
