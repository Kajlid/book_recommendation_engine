A dangerous place inhabited by new apex predators, where the remnants of humanity struggle on the brink of extinction.Now, locked in the fight of our lives against entropy, Bill Bartles must decide if saving the last of humanity is worth losing the Infinity Drive, and with it, all the knowledge of mankind …In this stunning debut novel, McGinty brings us science-fiction at its best. Set against an ominous backdrop of desolation and decay, ENTROPY asks the question: with every trivial moment of our time here saved to file, can the human condition continue long after we’re gone?",
