  "title": "Eating Pussy;A Response to Eve Ensler's 'The Vagina Monologues' from a boy",
  "description": "The Title Eating Pussy is not meant to be derogatory, at least not completely. A joke while I was working for a metal fabrication plant was that men’s facial hair grew because they ate pussy. It was meant as a sign of maleness, and manhood, in its way. It was also a play on words. Eating pussy of course is the term used by men mostly to describe oral sex. As I read the book, I was ingesting it…its title the Vagina Monologues. It is a humorous look mostly at this well-written book about a woman’s self-discovery. Being one who has sought counseling, and had conversations with my walls, This book was part of my work in dealing with myself. Being a bit broken from the divorce and loss, the exercise in reading and writing helped me if no one else, to find humor and love once again",
