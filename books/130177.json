After escaping an abusive relationship, Rosalie is baking her way to stability for her new pie business and five-year-old daughter, who suffers from Muscular Dystrophy. A chance meeting with Garry through her best friend, Noelle, Rosa thinks she may have found a way to make her daughter Mary's wish for a father come true - if Rosa can put aside her bad memories and learn to trust again. Garry is strong, stubborn and big hearted - the qualities expected of a Vragan. Crash landed on Earth, he decides to take a chance, seeking more than friendship with Rosa. He knows it will mean trusting her with his secrets as well as his heart, and he'll gladly eat every pie in her shop if it means being able to spend more time with her and Mary. Made With Love is Number 2 in the Celestial Seasons series. It can be read as a standalone story, but starting with Number 1, Noelle In His Heart, is recommended.",
