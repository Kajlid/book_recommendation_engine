  "description": "Author Jennifer Millikin delivers an emotional and riveting small town, second chance romance about a broken man and the woman who can fix him, if only he'll let her. I'm a soldier.A cattle rancher.A Hayden. My family's legacy is spread out in front of me, just waiting for me to seize it. If it weren't for one outdated rule, I'd be the owner of the Hayden Cattle Company and my aging father could retire. When Dakota Wright shows up to buy and develop twenty acres of Hayden land, I see more than a pretty mouth and strawberry blonde hair. I see a way around the decree keeping me from getting what I want. And, as luck would have it, Dakota has a big problem of her own. We strike two one for the land, and a second that'll make both our problems a distant memory. It isn't too long before I realize I'm in over my head. I've convinced myself the ends should justify the means, but everything begins to fall apart when my birthright is no longer all that I'm after. I never thought there'd be anything I could love more than my ranch and my country.I was wrong. Turns out, I want it all.Including her.*Author's The Hayden Family series is standalone, but starting from the first book is recommended for maximum enjoyment.",
