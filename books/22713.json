  "title": "The Pagan King",
  "description": "The mysterious Song of Camlon tells of a mighty warrior who will win the crown of Cambria. This is Arthur's great destiny-or so prophesies Merdin the seer. To claim his birthright, the simple Welsh rustic must overcome the tyrant Vortigern, his brilliant son Modred, and the other formidable foes arrayed against him. Is Fate the architect of Arthur's success, or is his rise to power determined by the strength of his sword arm and the shrewdness of his advisors? The naive young warrior must learn much about his enemies, both open and secret, and the prophecies that so rule his life before he can step from the pages of dark history into glorious legend. The Pagan King, first published in 1959 and long out of print, is one of the first modern novels to rediscover the Arthurian legend's Welsh roots. In Edison Marshall's splendid retelling, readers will share the agonizing losses and thrilling victories of one of the world's greatest heroes.",
