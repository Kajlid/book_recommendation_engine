In the midst of it all, one girl catches his attention and tries to break that shell, a girl with problems of her own yet able to focus her concerns on the health of others.Something about Cricket Brookes attracts Ryland; her smileslike Irelyn’s, her eyes, her laugh, everything excluding her hair.Irelyn.
