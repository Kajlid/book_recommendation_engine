  "description": "“…a modern-day fairy tale or a Fellini film…” -Kim Conklin, All Write in Sin City (Windsor-Detroit podcast).“This is a delightful view of the inhabitants of one short street through the eyes of the neighbourhood voyeur. See everybody’s secrets laid bare, and one or two bodies too. The whole gamut and range of human experience is here in a beautifully gentle form that can be dipped into as the fancy takes you. This is a splendid piece of work.” -Peter Snell, ed., Vine Leaves Press, AU.Brief SynopsisReginald Rutley lives on Bank Street and peeps through the windows of his neighbors when the sun goes down. He is as weird on the inside as he is on the out. Sad and lonely, he lives life through the life of others. What does he see? Two scheming sisters plotting murder; a cheating husband; a basement bootlegger; an armless painter painting an armless nude and more. But the story is more than just about Reginald peeping through windows, it’s also about the spirit of a people and their love of a neighborhood and how that neighborhood brings them and holds them all together.",
