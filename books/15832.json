Heidi is growing fond of her new mountain family and friends when she is suddenly taken to Frankfurt to be a companion to Clara, an invalid. Although she brings great joy into Clara's life, Heidi pines for her home in the mountains.Only a miracle can bring joy to both Heidi and Clara, but for someone with Heidi's faith and goodness, miracles really can happen...This classic story lyrically evokes a young child's growing understanding of poverty and wealth, illness and health, and despair and hope.",
