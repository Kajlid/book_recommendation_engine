  "description": "‘Only her love can restore his trust—only with his trust can she win her battle.’Kilter, an immortal Senses Visionary, excels at being rude and crass with little hope of finding peace after being betrayed and tortured by his brother more than a hundred years ago. Reckless and stubborn he has alienated everyone—just the way he likes it. Until the day he meets Rayne and emotions he buried long ago are reawakened. Rayne suffers from Anorexia Nervosa. Trapped by debilitating thoughts and a false sense of control, Rayne is slowly dying. Her husband has kept her secluded and alone for years, causing her to withdraw into an emotionless shell. But Rayne’s outward behavior is deceiving for beneath her delicate existence is a woman with strength. The trouble is—can she find that part of herself that has been driven away? Or has her cruel husband broken her fragile existence?The two tortured souls are brought together only to be torn apart and forced to relive their horrific pasts in order to find salvation. But Rayne’s past has more significance than the Senses realize and their enemies will do anything in order to get her back. The Senses are in for one hell of a fight as Waleron is forced to make the hardest decision of his life—Damien is tortured beyond his emotional capability by the witch Abigail—and Delara is drawn into a vampire’s arms only to have him use her darkest secret against her.(Not a stand alone. JUMP is the first book in the series.)",
