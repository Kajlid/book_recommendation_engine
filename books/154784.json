  "description": "Heaven, Hell, genetic engineering, particle physics and bloodshed.Civil war between demons and angels lies just on the horizon. Alezair Czynri, member of the Purgatorial Jury, is thrown into a world of murder, exploitation, chemical substances, betrayal and bureaucratic red tape as his court attempts to diffuse escalating conflicts.Yet things are not as they seem. Ever since his induction into the Celestial Court, Alezair has been treated with cool indifference by the Justice Commander, Leid Koseling. A former prisoner of the Nexus Initiative, Justice Czynri exists without any memories of his former life, the consequence of being a slave merc for hire. But Purgatory is strangely familiar, and slowly little pieces start coming back. There might be a good reason why Alezair's boss keeps him at arm's length.",
