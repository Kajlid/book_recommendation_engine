  "description": "Melody thought that her adventures in Heivion, the make-believe world of her childhood game, were over--She was wrong.Four years have passed, and Melody, unsatisfied with her life, has resigned herself to the fact that her fantasy world, and what happened in it, was nothing but a dream. But, when her best friend is stolen away, Melody must do the unthinkable -- return to Heivion, and become her alter-ego, \"Izzy\", once again, joining forces with Dais, her game's villain, in order to restore the world to peace, and free Kay. But, Heivion is not what she remembers, and seems more real than ever before. And, as \"Izzy\" and Dais make their way across the Darkness that has overtaken the land, \"Izzy\" finds herself lost between what is real, and what is not, all the while questioning who it is that she can trust -- a man who was meant to be evil, but who appears to be changing, or, her memory. In part two, the final installment in the Phantasmagoria Duet, one woman returns to her dreams as she searches for the Truth, fights for the power of trust, and uncovers the secret of belief.Genres: New Adult, Fantasy, Contemporary; does not contain: sexual content, language, or drug/alcohol abuse.",
