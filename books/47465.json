But now petty thief and ex-stripper Mink LaRue has a rival for the ultimate temptation...\nIt didn't take long for Mink to blow all the money she conned pretending to be missing oil heiress Sable Dominion. And now that a sweet chunk of the huge Dominion family trust fund is up for grabs, nothing can stop her from going for even more. Trouble is, her drug-dealing ex-boyfriend and the Dominion's irresistible eldest son, Barron, as well as his scheming fiancée, want to take Mink down in as many ways as possible. But her most dangerous opposition is the new pretender who's come to town... and she looks—and lies—exactly like Mink! Now, if the sexy little liar is going to come out on top, she'll have to make friends out of enemies and click up with a few very powerful haters. And knowing the insatiable Mink, she'll gamble everything to keep her conniving house of cards from tumbling all the way down... \"This is top-of-the-line street lit.\" —Library Journal on Natural Born Liar  (starred review)",
