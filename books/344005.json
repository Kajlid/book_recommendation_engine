  "title": "Let Slip the Dogs of Love: Suburban Legends of the Living and the Dead",
  "description": "In an urban legend style of storytelling flavored with magical realism, Let Slip the Dogs of Love blends together a thought-provoking collage of mesmeric short stories. It grips your full attention by flinging open, widely, a few infinite portals of perception. It brings an awareness to consider why we feel the things we do. This tapestry of stories reveals the sublime, ridiculous, triumphant and tragic ways in which ordinary people deal with the often extraordinary consequences of their choices and actions. With a rapidly and frequently changing pace and rhythm, taking gentle curves and sudden, unexpected hairpin-turns at full centripetal force, these ironic and karmic accounts tell tales of love, crime, poverty, tragedy, greed and evil in a thoughtful, sometimes playfully humorous, youthful voice. Delve with wonder into the depths that lie beneath the surface of all things in a quiet, sleepy metropolitan suburb. Eugene Kachmarsky was born in Toronto, Canada, to Ukrainian immigrant parents. The majority of his formative years were spent growing up in the neighborhood of Eatonville, in the western Toronto suburb of Etobicoke, the foundation setting for the stories in Let Slip the Dogs of Love. He lives, writes and swims with the current deep in the heart of Toronto, Canada.",
