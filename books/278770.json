At the age of just two weeks, he was placed into care, and the beginning of a life lived in a constantly changing environment of homes, authorities, and institutions began. Let down and frequently abused, it wasn't long before Jimmy strayed onto the wrong side of the tracks. Before long, the mold for a problem child was set. He quickly turned from substance abuse to drug use, and in turn, to crime. He soon became associated with the ringleaders of an infamous gang responsible for prison riots and hostage taking. A heart-felt, shocking, and despairing insight into life as a state-raised boy, Lost in Care is the heart-rending tale of a man who has lost his childhood and also lost his way.",
