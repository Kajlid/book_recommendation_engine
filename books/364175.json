But she never thought that she and Cyrus Krantz, the special agent brought in to \"convince\" Jess to join his elite team of \"specially gifted\" crime solvers, would turn out to have something in common.But when a local boy's disappearance is attributed to a backwoods militia group, Jess's goal--to find the missing child--and Dr. Krantz's--to stop a group of madmen before they kill again--turn out to be one and the same. Suddenly Jess finds herself working with one enemy in order to stop a far worse one. In an atmosphere of hate and fear, can Jess and Dr. Krantz--not to mention Jess's would-be boyfriend, Rob--work together to unite a community and save a life. . .without losing her own?",
