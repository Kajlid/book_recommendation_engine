London Harmony is hosting the biggest battle of the bands the world has ever witnessed.When things start to fall apart when their lead guitarist defects to another band. The race is on to find another lead guitarist before they are dropped from the competition.What Kacy finds instead is a love like none she had ever experienced when she stumbles upon Mei Hammond, a woman who has the most unusual gift with music that not even tragedy can take from her.(London Harmony is a spinoff of the Music of the Soul books.)",
