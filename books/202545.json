  "title": "Deconstructing the Starships: Essays and Review (Liverpool Science Fiction Texts and Studies, 16)",
  "description": "The subject matter of this collection is varied, but displays Jones' stance as a practising SF writer and a feminist; the writing is characterised by both an incisive engagement with the texts and a refusal to dress that engagement in jargon. This very readable book provides insight into the work of one of our most interesting writers and presents strong sometimes even subversive views of a range of modern SF and fantasy.",
