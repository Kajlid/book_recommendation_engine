No turning back now.\" Boris slowly tucked his iPhone back into his front, jean pocket. \"I ordered the Uber, he'll be here in six minutes.\" As we moved our backpacks towards the doorway, we did something that we both separately did growing up--took a seat before leaving on a trip. I always just wrote it off like any other kooky, Moldovan superstition, like not giving anyone a kiss over a threshold or not whistling inside the house, you know the normal stuff. But as I got older, I realized that, maybe, there was something more to it. Maybe, when we force our bodies into rest, it allows the mind to relax and jogs any forgotten memory (such as the iPhone charger or something less vital, like a passport).

Everyone was screaming, it was crazy. And ever since then, I can't fly.\" If he hadn't been him, it would've been a deal breaker for sure. Luckily, I had hope. And that hope led us here.
