  "description": "After a Soviet spacecraft on a secret mission falls to earth in the Santa Cruz Mountains in 1978, three young men are forced to face a central question of when ancient sources of narrative lose their credibility, who owns the truth? In their decades-long quest for authenticity these unlikely sleuths formulate an answer â€” but not before they have traversed a bewildering world of Russian spies, ancient mysticism and modern day cyber-misdirection.",
