  "description": "The strange little town of Elm Fork, Missouri had become an unlucky place to live. It seemed almost cursed, as of late. And for Sheriff Alan Fleming, things were about to get even worse!For not long after a young girl vanishes without a trace from a back-country road, a nurse is viciously murdered at her home. And dismembered bodies are suddenly being discovered in Crawford’s Woods, the home of ninety-year-old invalid, Eileen Crawford, and no one knows how they’ve gotten there, or why. Sheriff Fleming believes that Eileen Crawford’s seedy-eyed caretaker with the criminal past is somehow involved, but Detective Beavy would lay his bets on the strange hermit who lives in a barn and patrols Crawford’s Woods with an axe. Both are potential suspects, but there is precious little to go on, and Fleming realizes that Elm Fork County is full of peculiar citizens who might have had a hand in the murders. But it’s Sheriff Fleming and Detective Beavy’s job, along with the rest of the Elm Fork Sheriff’s Department, to uncover the connection between the young girl’s disappearance and the horrific homicides before the killer can commit his next grizzly murder.",
