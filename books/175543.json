  "description": "Stand-Alone, HEA, No cheating. Selected Sinners MC Romance Book II.  After serving half a dozen tours in Afghanistan and Iraq as a US Marine, Cambio Todelli - known as Toad to his MC brothers - is left with a penchant for violence and no emotional attachment between his heart and his groin.  As the Sergeant at Arms for the Selected Sinners, Toad has one assignment and he takes it very seriously. Keeping his Brothers safe from harm at any cost.  Although he believes he ultimately stands for what is moral and justified, he admits sometimes the lines simply become blurred. In short, Toad is a walking contradiction. The descendant of a long line of prideful Italian American US Marines, he is now living a far cry from his upbringing in the Catholic church.  Sydney Shephard is an orphan, and has recently lost her only sibling, an older brother, to a lifelong prison sentence. After losing her job, she is now homeless, penniless, and without any form of family or friend.  As easy as it may be to do so, she refuses to lose her spirit, her spunk, or her sense of humor.  After having been in multiple abusive relationships in her past, Sydney has vowed to either live a life of solitude, or find a man who will treat her as an equal.  When a bank robbery goes awry, leaving Toad on one side of the bank, and Sydney on the other, Toad must make a decision and make it quick.  And when Toad decides to do something, heaven help anyone who tries to stop him.",
