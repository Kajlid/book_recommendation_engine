She's the little old woman who lives on a hillside in Norway and has the habit of shrinking to the size of a pepperpot at the most inconvenient moments.In this adventure Mrs. Pepperpot shrinks five times (which is very unusual), and it just so happens that when she is tiny, she can speak with animals. This proves to be handy because as the day proceeds, she meets four animals who have a story to tell.",
