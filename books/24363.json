  "title": "Neil Must Die",
  "description": "Neil falls in love with his newly-wedded sister-in-law, Tuli, forcing seeds of suspicion and spilling blasphemy into the conservative Bengali family. He runs away from the chaos, drowning himself in lies and false assurances, only to discover that Tuli is pregnant with his child – and all becomes clear. His fears and doubts evaporate, and he sets out to make life wonderful for Tuli and their child, completely unaware that, even with the impending battle he has to fight, it is written in stone that he must die. A story of silent rebellion, desperate escapism, self-destruction – and thunderous passion.",
