  "description": "Happy Again at Life in the Art World is a collection of thirty stories set in various corners of the art world. These short fictions speak of the nature of the artist and the creative impulse, the artist's experience in the world, and the various issues, psychological and intellectual, that are integral to that experience and to the art world itself. The stories are wide-ranging, some of them darkly serious, others lightly amusing. This altogether unique collection is fully accessible to general readers and provides colorful insight into a world that in popular perception is often considered remote and mysterious.",
