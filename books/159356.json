  "description": "SOME DAMAGE IS BEYOND REPAIR When Celia, a six year old child replacement, gets caught up in an assassination attempt on the Mayor of Los Angeles, Detective Jack Cutter is obliged to protect and serve despite any misgivings he may have towards her kind. Youâ€™d never hear Cutter say he hates androids. Not out loud anyway. Damn synthetics hear everything. Cutter drags Celia from grisly murder scene to cracked-out cyber-den, hot on the trail of the assassin. As they sink deeper into the case, a far more sinister scheme emerges which threatens the lives of all Angelenos and the only way to stop it lies in the head of a childish android. DAMAGED GOOD is a fast paced science fiction thriller set in the dystopic near future of Los Angeles. It has been likened to Blade Runner, Altered Carbon, and Ghost in the Shell.",
