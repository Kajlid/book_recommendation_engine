  "title": "Welcome to Mineola",
  "description": "This post World War II story chronicles the lives of Matt and Rachel Williams as they leave the big City and settle in the suburbs of Long Island, New York. Between the back yard barbecues, and neighborhood get-togethers they encounter those who will become dear friends and loved ones while also being under the threat of someone who is out to destroy their relationship. They experience loss, tragedy, joys and heartaches which become the fabric of the Williams family history. They are exposed to the ugliness of anti-Semitism, and misinterpreted implications. Through it all the story is told by several family members as they \"take the microphone\" to give the reader their own perspective as the pages turn. Mineola, the icon of a simpler life, with ever present family values, is the Town where the author spent her childhood and which becomes the central figure in this and the upcoming books in the Long Island New York trilogy.",
