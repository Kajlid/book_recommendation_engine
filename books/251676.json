She finds herself stranded in a city well known for its decadence, and with nowhere to go, she’s a tad on the desperate side.Enter playboy Ian, uptight Michael, and reluctant bodyguard Buster.They’ve made the city of New Orleans their home, and while not in the habit of rescuing damsels in distress, they make a unanimous exception for Jane.It’s not long before Jane develops feelings for her rescuers, but with one of them broken by a past betrayal, can she make a relationship with all three of them work?\"A slow burn that turned white hot!\"\"A Cinderella story with THREE princes.....my favorite kind.\"\"Whew, (fan myself) no contest. I pick all three!\"\"The banter was awesome, the sexual tension sizzled, and I'm so glad I didn't have to choose!\"A full length, standalone reverse harem novel. Mild language and sexual content may be inappropriate for younger readers.",
