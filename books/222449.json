With animal names for these \"guests,\" and human names for the animals, it's no wonder that the zoo's code name became \"The House Under a Crazy Star.\" Best-selling naturalist and acclaimed storyteller Diane Ackerman combines extensive research and an exuberant writing style to re-create this fascinating, true-life storyâ€”sharing Antonina's life as \"the zookeeper's wife,\" while examining the disturbing obsessions at the core of Nazism.",
