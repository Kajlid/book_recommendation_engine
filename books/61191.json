Mia's kept her submissive tendencies a secret, until now. She'll have ample opportunity to explore her fantasy because to succeed in her new role at SRE, she will need on-the-job training at the hands of Asher Cane. During Asher Cane's very first training session with Mia, he fails to follow his own rules and has the hottest vanilla sex of his life. Mia needs training, and Asher is damned if he'll allow another Dom to touch her. Can Asher be the dispassionate trainer Mia needs to learn the exquisite give and take of dominance and submission? Or will Mia's submission come only at the cost of his heart?Mia’s Submission is Book One of The Satin Rose Experience (SRE) series. SRE, New York’s elite BDSM club residing on the twentieth floor of Rosebud Resorts, contains ten uniquely themed suites, each with its own story to tell. Find the introduction of SRE in The Satin Rose Experience, a short story in Evernight Publishing’s Keyboards and Kink Anthology.",
