  "description": "\" HACKSAW \" is at once a slam-bang page-turner and a sophisticated, unusual mystery story. I fell in love with Eva Baum, the novel's sassy, straight-talking, thoroughly modern narrator/sleuth. A terrific debut for the Phillips/Phillips team.\"William G. Tapply author of ONE-WAY TICKET and GRAY GHOST Houston PI Eva Baum knows how to find people, even if they don't want to be found. Her newest client is Shade, a mentally ill, homeless artist, and he wants Eva to tackle a bizarre case. His ex-wife, Julie, may hold the key to revealing the identity of a vicious serial killer-known as Hacksaw -who tortured and mutilated underage prostitutes years ago and was never caught. When Shade asks Eva to find Julie, her new mission could turn this very cold case hot again. Eva isn't the only one searching for Julie. A vicious Seattle mobster, a couple of unscrupulous federal officers, and possibly even the Hacksaw Murderer are keeping close tabs on Eva's progress. Eva is looking for Julie, the truth, perhaps even some justice and redemption, but all she can see at the end of this complicated trail is terror, blood, and death. What she cannot see coming is ultimate, devastating betrayal. \" HACKSAW has everything I want in a private eye a brain-teasing mystery, heart-squeezing suspense, vicious villains and a detective truly worthy of this great story! Don't even open this book unless you're prepared to be up all night.\"Austin S. Camacho, author of the Hannibal Jones mystery series",
