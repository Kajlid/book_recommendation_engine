  "description": "Far from the concrete and steel of Boston, the town of Northwood nestles beneath the summit of Mount Sugarloaf. The quiet community seems like the perfect place for Steve and Diane Nailer to raise their family of two children, with a third on the way. Their new home is perched on the edge of a forest. A trail through the woods leads to an old Victorian mansion that once housed the town mortuary. But the memories of the dearly departed are the least of what lurks there... Eleanor Grimm is a woman of desperate cunning, possessing unfathomable power. Driven by the enchantments found in fairy tales, she has bewitched the parents of Northwood, keeping them spellbound and distracted from her true agenda: claiming the most innocent of souls. For more than fifty years, she has been spiriting away Northwood's children.And now she has her sights on the Nailers' son and daughter.",
