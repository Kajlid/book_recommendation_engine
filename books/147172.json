  "description": "You can take the biker chick out of the motorcycle club, but she always comes back. Especially if there’s a tattooed god in a cut. Ever is back in the Life she left behind five years ago. She wants revenge…and the tattooed god in a cut.  When her momma saddled her with a name like Ever, she didn’t have a prayer of a normal life. Mix in a motorcycle club and a lot of rough adoptive fathers, and Ever is raised not to take any flack. Five years ago she battled her way out of the Life, got a degree and a good job. The only thing that would bring her back to Heller’s Gap and within range of her ex is revenge.  Jamison’s motorcycle club doesn’t live, breathe, and ride for drugs and guns, unless they’re fighting to uncover the roots of the crimes. After years of watching his friends and loved ones die, Jamison’s only desire is to stop more of the trade from coming into Heller’s Gap. At least until he gets an eye—and hand—full of the redheaded vixen, Ever.  In spite of the world she hates, Ever can’t stay away from the god dressed in black leather. When he discovers she’s practically MC royalty, and that she’s being hunted by her ex and his gang, Jamison’s instincts to protect rev to new speeds. He’d do just about anything to keep her, even help her get the revenge she craves…if it doesn’t break him first.",
