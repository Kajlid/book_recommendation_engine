  "title": "Argh Fuck Kill: The Story of the Dayglo Abortions",
  "description": "The DayGlo Abortions are perhaps the most misunderstood and maligned punk groups ever to exist. To this day, critics and naysayers are unable to see past the corrosive lyrics and explicit imagery to the true meaning beneath. Readers of this book, however, may be shocked to learn that below the nasty exterior and foul language, the DayGlo Abortions are much more concerned about the fate of humankind than anyone could have imagined. Defenders of the underdog and crusaders against injustice, the legendary band from Victoria, British Columbia, Canada have identified greed as being the single largest problem facing this world today. Survivors of a landmark obscenity trial, endless abuse from the musical press, and nonstop personal debauchery, the DayGlo Abortions remain undaunted after more than thirty years as the toughest, most outrageous punk group of all time.",
