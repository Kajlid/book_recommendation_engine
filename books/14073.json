  "description": "Mr. Willowby, the unwitting hero of this Christmas classic, looks quite a bit like the little mustachioed mascot from Monopoly. But as befits a Yuletide tale, this diminutive millionaire turns out to be a good bit more generous. The Christmas tree in question shows up at Mr. Willowby's home by special order, aboard a big pink truck: \"Full and fresh and glistening green--The biggest tree he had ever seen.\" But it's just a little too big, so he asks his butler, Baxter, to trim off the top few feet that brush up against the parlor ceiling. Baxter realizes that this snipped-off top would make a perfect little tree for \"Miss Adelaide, Mr. Willowby's upstairs maid.\" But she, too, must clip off the top of her tree... which then ends up with Timm, the gardener. Timm's trimming goes on to Barnaby Bear, the tippy-top of Barnaby's tree ends up with Frisky Fox and family, and then Benjamin Rabbit finds the top few inches that Mrs. Fox snipped off. And so it goes, until soon the whole countryside learns that it's simply \"grand to have a tree--Exactly like Mr. Willowby.\"",
