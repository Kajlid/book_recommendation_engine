  "title": "Within the Sacred Circle: A Native American Connection",
  "description": "Also available in Kindle edition. Taken from the pages of the Where the Horses Run series: Book I Mass Extinction, Book II Sacred Hills, Book III Ciphers and Realms of the Earth (prequel) are ten short stories. Together they tell about a historical tribe of Lakhota beginning over three hundred years ago. Each is a story unto itself, but as a whole, they read like chapters in this novella. Presented in chronological order as they happened during the time period they occurred, not as presented in the novels. Most are embellished to round out the stories. If a hidden tribe did exist separate from the Lakhota nation, in order to keep their sacred stories and way of life when the great scourge came to destroy them, and with full knowledge of the timeless valley never found, they may have lived as the Sni Taniya. And they might have known the Ancients of their Ancestors and expected the guardians of that valley to still exist. Into that world a great mystery crept. The occurrences began in a small area of east Texas, but its roots were in the Black Hills of South Dakota, the sacred heartbeat of Native American Indian tradition. And the guardians are still watching.",
