  "description": "On Jasper Lane, Cassie Bloom is gearing up for Halloween; Becky is expecting, and her father is overbearing and paranoid; Rick and James are their usual happy selves, though James has developed a porn obsession; Terrence is putting together an all drag cheer squad; and David is helping Cliff transition from adult film star to bodybuilder. Of course, thatâ€™s just what's going on at the surface. This is suburbia, and its underbelly is teeming with secrets.Like what's up with that rather odd family that moved in down the street - the family with the big cross in the front yard who look nothing alike. Like where Cassie's son, Jason, has disappeared to and why he hasn't called. Like what on Earth Nanna Hench is doing with a scooter, a megaphone, and a clown car full of religious zealots.When Cliff suddenly disappears, Jasper Lane goes on high alert. Terrence posts fliers, and Rick and James scour the gym. David is determined to get his husband back, but when he goes missing too - and with Cassie and Melinda on a road trip to find Jason - it's up to Terrence to solve the mystery and save the day.",
