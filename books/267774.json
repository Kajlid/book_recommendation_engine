  "title": "Atomic Marriage",
  "description": "All marriages are hard. Many of them fail. Brock Lewis, an evangelical businessman turned self-published author, has the answer. Follow his international best-selling book’s 12-point “Atomic Doctrine” - make eye contact with your spouse? Always! Use the bathroom in front of them? Never! - and you, too, can build a marriage that thrives.What Hollywood power broker Heather Thiesen knows about marriage is that hers is sputtering, anything but romantic, and utterly exhausting. But she still aspires to turn Brock’s book into the blockbuster romantic comedy she knows it can be - now she just has to convince Brock.Narrated with depth and warmth by Oscar nominee Diane Lane, what follows is a remarkable story about the life partners we choose, the secrets we keep, and the compromises we make by one of America’s funniest and most astute cultural commentators.",
