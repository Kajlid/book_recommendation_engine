  "description": "They call this place Magic Blessed Academy, but I sure as hell don’t feel blessed.I never asked for these powers. I never asked to be yanked away from my perfectly good life and forced to come here.But the gods have gifted me with magic, and now I have no choice.If I was smart, I’d keep my head down and play it safe until I can graduate.And I definitely wouldn’t go up against the three gorgeous, infuriating men who rule the school—Trace, Merrick, and Lachlan.But when we’re all chosen to compete in the Gods’ Challenge, a deadly competition for the honor of meeting the gods themselves, teaming up with my bullies may be my only chance at survival.Now the only question is: will we kill each other or screw each other first?This is the first book in the Magic Blessed Academy series, a university-age reverse harem paranormal romance. It contains cursing and sexual situations, and is intended for readers 18+.",
