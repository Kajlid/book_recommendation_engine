  "description": "A revolutionary social and political commentary, North and South solidified Gaskell’s place in the company of Victorian England’s finest novelists.This Norton Critical Edition of her best-selling novel is annotated and edited by preeminent Gaskell scholar Alan Shelston. \"Contexts\" includes contemporary reviews and correspondence related to North and South, along with the full text of Gaskell’s 1850 short story \"Lizzie Leigh,\" which, like North and South, is set in industrial Manchester and deals with strong working women. This topic is further addressed in Bessie Rayner Parkes’s essay on Victorian working women. \"Criticism\" collects eleven assessments of the novel, among them Louis Cazamian’s 1904 study of industrial fiction and Hilary Schor’s recent study of North and South in the context of discourse analysis. A Chronology and Selected Bibliography are also included.",
