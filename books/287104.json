  "description": "“There was a truth once. Truth we shared in the dark and scribed scars upon our hearts.There was a lie once. A lie that shattered our hard-earned truth apart.” Eleanor Grace did the unbelievable. She fell for a man who trades in women, dabbles in myth, and has the morals of a cold-hearted beast. However, love isn’t enough where past sins are concerned and only pain can follow.Sully Sinclair did the impossible. He gave his trust to a goddess who has the ultimate power to break him. Unfortunately, paradise is just an illusion, his islands aren’t impenetrable, and now he has to pay the price.A fledgling connection.A war they can’t stop.A future that doesn’t bow to fate.",
