  "description": "When Charmaine and her husband adopted Toby, a Chesapeake Bay retriever, they figured he might need some adjusting time, but they certainly didn’t think he’d be a holy terror, beset by severe anxiety and destructive behavior that would take a miracle to curb. Turns out, Toby routinely opened and emptied closets, turned on water taps, and pulled things from the bookshelves. Oddest of all was his penchant for locking himself in the bathroom, and then push the lid of the toilet tank onto the floor, smashing it to pieces. After a particularly disastrous encounter with the knife-block in the kitchen—and when the couple discovered Toby’s blood and paw prints on the phone—Charmaine decided Toby needed professional help.Little did she know what they would discover about this dog.“Simply a beautiful book about life, love, and purpose.” —Jack Canfield, Chicken Soup for the Soul series“In a perfect world, every dog would have a home and every home would have a dog like Toby!” —Nina Siemaszko, actress, The West Wing\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever loved a dog, wanted a dog or wondered what to do with the dog they've got.\"—Maggie Schlegl, Behaviorist, Capable Canines",
