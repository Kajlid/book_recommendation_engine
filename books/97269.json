  "description": "She was dying. Her life draining away on a hot city sidewalk and she gave it up willingly. Life had been hard and she was ready. With a jolt and a prayer she awakens in Heaven. Through her flows all the joy and wonder of existence and she comes face to face with God. Overwhelmed, she begs to reincarnate to share this wonderful message of God’s unconditional love with those on earth. Will God give her this chance? One thing before she goes, “Please,” she begs. “I want to be blond and petite and find my soul mate in this new life.”Poof! She wakes up on earth as one of the smallest dogs on the planet! Does God have a sense of humor or what?",
