  "description": "Nothing is easy ... certainly not for Max Blake and Caeli Brown, former investigative journalists and now private detective agency partners who are about to leave the comforts of Oregon's Willamette Valley for a new life on an Irish estate. But an unexpected development from their previous case, the attempted rescue of Caeli's Uncle Jack, the former Archbishop of Armagh in Northern Ireland, sends them off on a new adventure. They discover in short order that the dead can, in fact, rise again, that a corpulent evil presence lurks behind the scenes inside the walls of the Vatican in Rome, and that everything you thought you knew about the death of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, more than 50 years isn't necessarily true. The intrepid couple face myriad dangers that include palace intrigue, clerics with guns, and a man they'd thought was dead who is not only very much alive but who also is willing to tear down the walls of the church to tell the truth.Early reviewers describe Melia Ridge, the 6th installment in the Max Blake Mystery series, as \"a terrific read with great characters\"; \"Fabulous. The book is so fun. It's heart-stopping and filled with tension. I found myself busting out laughing on several occasions and greatly concerned for the main players minutes later\"; \"The characters are believable, and the story is complicated and filled with unexpected twists.\"; \"Without question the best book yet in the series, and that says a lot because all of the novels are wonderful reads, containing everything that a good story, well told, should tell.\"",
