In this definitive oral history of \"Late Night,\" Letterman’s NBC 12:30 am talk show that aired from 1982 to 1993, writers, producers, executives and actors share revealing stories — from the origins of the \"Top 10\" lists and \"Stupid Pet Tricks\" to the battle over who would replace Letterman’s mentor, Johnny Carson, as host of \"The Tonight Show,\" to Letterman’s final days at 30 Rock before moving to CBS for \"The Late Show.\"  Brian Abrams has been described as \"the Ken Burns of presidential alcoholism.\" His first book, \"Party Like a President: True Tales of Inebriation, Lechery, and Mischief from the Oval Office\" (Workman Publishing), is scheduled for release in February 2015. He has written for Playboy, Heeb, High Times, Mental_Floss and other publications, and has contributed to the books \"I’m a Lebowski, You’re a Lebowski: Life, The Big Lebowski, and What Have You\" and \"Reefer Movie Madness: The Ultimate Stoner Film Guide.\" He lives in New York City.
