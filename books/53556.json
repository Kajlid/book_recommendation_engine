  "description": "Thomas George Ford learned early that life is not easy, especially for a young black man growing up in 1920s West Virginia. Forced to be known as \"George\" rather than \"Thomas\" to avoid being associated withhis fugitive father, George struggles to fi nd his identity and make his way in the world. Eventually, searching for work, he moves south to live with his uncle Eli. Though lighter skinned than her siblings, Grace White never thought to question the circumstances of her birth. But that changes when a tragic act of violence brings her face-to-face with both her past and her nowuncertain future. When the lives of these two intersect, both Grace and George experience unexpected blessings, including survival through faith, strength through family, and wisdom through forgiveness.",
