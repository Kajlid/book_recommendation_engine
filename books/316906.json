  "description": "Don't mess with the Daddy. Atticus Heisler is a man who knows what he wants, and how to get it. As the owner of Heisler Security, he's familiar with intrigue and danger; as a Master of Avalon, he's learned the intricacies of the submissive mind, and what makes a sub quiver. But underneath the mask of contentment is a loneliness he's not sure will ever go away. Resigned to a life of watching his closest friends find their perfect matches, Atticus does what he does bestâ€”help those who need his assistance. Paralyzed from the waist down when she was just a kid, Alicia McGee has a history she doesn't share with many. With her parents' blood on her hands, a life where no one wants her, and a disability that turns her into a burden to everyone, she is prepared to die, alone and unloved. When Atticus comes to her rescue, the unspoken crush she has on him sparks into something more. As secrets unravel and her past spirals into the present, can the impossible become possible in the arms of a Daddy Dom?",
