Division members have served in WWI, WWII, and Korea and they are still serving in South Korea, Iraq and Fort Lewis today. These are true stories written by the veterans of the Korean Conflict and passed on to me to be included in this book. The book is dedicated to the brave men who fought to preserve our freedoms at a cost that many of us can only imagine.",
