  "title": "Thoughts That Go Bump: Heels Over Head in Love",
  "description": "This book is the second part of a collection of poems I wrote from 1999 to 2001. As I sped away from a broken marriage and into, what would become, a failed relationship, these thoughts skidded through my sleepless nights like bumper cars. They pummeled my self-confidence until I was unsure of my ability to find and maintain a loving relationship. Loss can send you reeling into a whirlwind of self-doubt and uncertainty until you finally realize that it is not your limitations, but your capabilities that define who you are. Thoughts That Go Bump is a book of candid poems written after the loss of a child, a parent, and a spouse drove me to the precipice of love and life and left me teetering on the edge. It is a trip through the dark dreams of endings and the return to the light of new beginnings.",
