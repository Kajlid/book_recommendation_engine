  "description": "It was the 1930s. The avarice of the elite had plunged the country into the Great Depression. Class warfare was being waged, and someone was about to snap! Young Betty McDougal discovered how hard life could be when her family was evicted from their farm and forced to live in a Citadel City shelter. They struggled to survive. It was a time of desperation, sin, mistakes and lessons Betty didn't want to learn. Her life felt pointless until a mysterious stranger delivered her an ominous black car. It transformed her.Pandora Driver was the relentless avenger of the common man sifting right from wrong in a realm where the villains were the local gentry and the heroes were outlaws. Pandora was a mistress of disguise who used sly audacity and an unstoppable Car-of-Tomorrow to unleash chaos into the halls of wealth and power. She infiltrated the unscrupulous rulers of Citadel City and adopted their unsavory methods to usurp them. Her fight was the fight of the ages. She was the fist of the people battling greed, graft, inequality, and exploitation. Her time was in the past, but the problems were the same blights facing society today.She intervened when law enforcement or the justice system failed citizens. Sometimes her methods were unsettling. Battling sin in the filth where it resides can dirty even the purest hearts; the good old days we remember in monochrome were lived in color. In a time when good and evil was simply black and white, Pandora lived in the gray area.Pandora The Origin, summons the spirits of pulps past and adds dieselpunk hardware. This retro-hero tale is for mature readers. It ain't Shakespeare. It's pure Pulp!",
