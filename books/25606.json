  "description": "Richard Savage is used to scrutiny. As the illegitimate son of the Marquess of Dorset he can be sure that the eyes of society are always upon him, and it is second nature to him to make sure his behaviour is never less than impeccable. He pays his debts, he never drinks to excess, and he doesn’t quarrel – certainly not with his family. The only gossipworthy things Richard allows himself are his friendship with Fleetwood, the radical scholar, and the occasional visit to an extremely discreet gentleman’s club called Greene’s.No one ever pays much attention to Lucas Greville. His brother manages the estate, his mother is preoccupied with finding husbands for his sisters and the cousin who promised to show him around London abandoned him at the first opportunity. He is not an attractive match for girls on the lookout for a title or a fortune, and he fully expects to spend his first season in cheerful anonymity.When Richard rescues Lucas from an unpleasant situation at Greene’s it is the start of an entirely proper friendship, and neither of them is looking for more. But then a stray word from his new acquaintance sheds light on the great mystery of Richard’s life. Can Lucas help him discover the circumstances of his birth? And will the resulting upheaval help or hinder their growing affection for each other?",
