  "description": "Zoe Morton has a list. No longer under the thumb of her controlling mother and stepfather, she’s hitchhiked across country to start a new life, looking to try all sorts of erotic escapades. Among the Free Spirits in the city of Stallbrook, she finds fertile ground to satisfy her sexual desires and curiosity, and even make some money doing it. But there’s a dark reason behind her checking off all those items on her list – and she’s going faster than expected. What will Zoe do once she’s finished? Will she carry out her final plan, or will her quest lead her elsewhere?",
