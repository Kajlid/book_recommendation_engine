  "title": "The Concept of Nature: The Tarner Lectures Delivered in Trinity College, 11/1919",
  "description": "\"\"The Concept of Nature\"\" is a philosophical book written by Alfred North Whitehead and first published in 1920. The book is based on the Tarner Lectures that Whitehead delivered in Trinity College, Cambridge in November 1919. In the book, Whitehead explores the concept of nature and its relationship with the universe. He argues that nature is not simply a collection of natural objects, but rather a complex system of interrelated processes and events. Whitehead also discusses the role of perception in our understanding of nature, and how our experiences shape our perception of the world. The book is considered a major contribution to the philosophy of science and has had a significant impact on the development of process philosophy. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the philosophy of nature and the relationship between science and philosophy.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
