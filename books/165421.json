  "description": "So tiny is the peak and how sheer the slope when atop the world. The gravity of fate weighs heavier and heavier until all one hears is the incessant echo of a final How far will I fall and where shall I land? Belief in self-determination of fate is the most enticing mirage. At one time or another we are all deceived into believing destiny is within control. Live right, do unto to others well, and prosper—the mantra of fools. Fortune is altered a thousand times per second. We face countless choices every day. How much thought do we really give each choice? Cole Newman had a choice to work late or make a date with his wife. Not a big deal? Think again. If he’d chosen wisely she would not be dead. If he hadn’t again succumbed to ambition, he would be with his toddler son. Strewn into the middle of an international child trafficking ring, Cole’s path would lead to Rochelle, an undercover reporter more fearless and capable than any person he’d ever met. Their quest to rescue stolen children would take them from Oakland to Singapore and into the heart of genocidal Sudan. Powerful men, professional killers, could not let them succeed. Their fate and those they vowed to save would eventually rest in the hands of an African boy, a young prodigy leading his village from savagery and slaughter.",
