The communist Chinese want to carve off a colony in North America, and the United States is mobilizing for war to stop it and to finally reunify the country split apart a decade before.As hunger and violence sweep across what had once been the Golden State, Kelly Turnbull must undertake his most daring mission yet. With his trusty .45, some old friends, and an elite team of operators, he faces a terrifying new enemy and a deadly old one as the battle to restore the United States of America climaxes in the ruins of the People's Republic's western capital city of San Francisco.Deadlier than ever, Kelly Turnbull is going to settle old scores and new ones too, shooting first, then shooting again before bothering to ask questions later. From blue Hawaii to the red Florida Keys, from the USS Teddy Roosevelt's berth in San Diego to the Supermax prison in Colorado, Kelly Turnbull does what he does best...It's all-out war, this time in the midst of blue America's total Collapse.",
