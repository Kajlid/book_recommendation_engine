  "description": "Raymond Chandler created the fast talking, trouble seeking Californian private eye Philip Marlowe for his first great novel \"The Big Sleep\" in 1939. Marlowe's entanglement with the Sternwood family - and an attendant cast of colorful underworld figures - is the background to a story reflecting all the tarnished glitter of the great American Dream. The detective's iconic image burns just as brightly in \"Farewell My Lovely\", on the trail of a missing nightclub crooner. And the inimitable Marlowe is able to prove that trouble really is his business in Raymond Chandler's brilliant epitaph, \"The Long Goodbye\".",
