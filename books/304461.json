I've waited too long to lose her now, if they think they can take what is mine they will have to go through me.  BRIELLE My whole life I've been told that I'm not good enough, therefore when Bion shows an interest in me I can't believe that a man that can have any woman he wants will want me. He's possessive, handsome and as hot as hell, but after being put down my whole life, will he be able to make me believe that I'm the woman for him?  BION is a steamy possessive, alpha male romance with guaranteed HEA, no cheating, and no cliff-hanger! This book is the fifth book in the Elemental's MC series.",
