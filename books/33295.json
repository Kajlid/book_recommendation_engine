  "description": "Four girls, one remarkable dress and an extraordinary friendship. This title comes from the bestselling author of \"The Loving Kind\". Julia's best friend has always been Ed - they've grown up together. Ed is now engaged to the sophisticated, grown-up Louise. Julia should be happy for them - but she manages to make a complete fool of herself at his engagement dinner. She suddenly realises she doesn't want to lose him, and throws herself at him in front of everyone. When Louise organises a ball with her charity committee, Julia sees this as her last chance to get Ed back. When she spots the most incredible dress in Shoestring, the vintage clothes shop she runs with her sister, she knows she'll only be able to stagger through the evening if she's wrapped in its silky drapes. But the beautiful dress costs an absolute fortune...Arietty Pilgrim can't and won't attend her ghastly ten year school reunion unless she can arrive wearing exactly that same dress 'funked up' with her favourite cropped leather jacket. But looking after elephants in Dublin Zoo does not a millionaire make. After a chance meeting in the shop, Julia and Arietty set up The Shoestring Club to timeshare the dress - and start a life-altering friendship. There's just one problem. In order to buy the dress, they need more partners...",
