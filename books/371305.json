  "description": "Rosie is not alone in her growing apprehension towards Australia's involvement in a war. Like many mothers, she feels helpless as her sons are swayed by the relentless pull of 'mateship' and are lured by the sense of 'adventure' awaiting them in another continent. While yearning for news from them in Northern France, Rosie grapples with the changing reality that war is placing on women on the home front. Women are increasingly the fabric of the community and Rosie shoulders her share of responsibility with grinding work at the factory. She also discovers women working for a common cause at an industrious Red Cross parcel drive, converging at a controversial peace rally and embroiled in the conscription debate. Each has a story to tell. A Woman's War takes us into the life of a mother during the Great War. It provides a unique and intimate perspective of how she and other women of her inner-city, working class community endured an incredibly difficult period of Australia's history and exemplified to future generations how to face hardship. This poignant and insightful story reveals tribulations and tragedies not talked about by the generations of women who followed them.",
