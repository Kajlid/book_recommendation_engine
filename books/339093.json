  "title": "The Destineers' Journal of Fantasy Nations",
  "description": "This book is a \"field guide\" to Fantasy Nations based on classroom lessons, research, and personal experience from encounters of the fantastical kind. How'd I get personal experience? Let me explain. Ancient prophecies foretold Destineers would save the worlds. Yes worlds with an \"s\". There's a lot; you just have to know how to find them. We are Destineers. A new headmaster arrived at our school and life suddenly got very interesting. He brought some new professors and a whole new curriculum with him. I'm not so sure the school board knows about these changes...but school is a LOT more fun since they arrived. Who are the Destineers? There's RyanÂ - he's 16 and the leader of the group; Sean, his roommate (also 16) who has a great sense of humor (but he loves to play practical jokes so watch out!), and Ryan's little brother Brady (he's 9). Brady is awesome. He has this amazing energy and really has a knack with languages. I'm Kylie, I'm 15 and the writer of our group.",
