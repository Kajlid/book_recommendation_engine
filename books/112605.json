  "description": "Life isn't meant to be easy, but for Zachary Bennett the last two years have been downright hell. The one shining light in his life, his precious daughter, Hayley. Deciding he needs a clean break, Zack gets a new job in a small town called Leyburn in the hopes they can settle down and live a peaceful life.Between worry over one brother's increasingly erratic behaviour and constantly walking in on the other two making out with their mates, Simon Holland is ready to pull his hair out. All he'd ever wanted in life was a mate and a family. When his wish is finally answered with Zack's arrival, Simon finds out first-hand how far hate and bigotry can drive some people. But life wasn't meant to be easy and Simon would protect what was his to the end.Please Note: PM has been reedited, and expanded by 25 K.",
