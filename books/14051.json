  "description": "In the near future, an experimental study alters gene therapy subjects into living vampires, giving them superhuman strength, speed, stamina and senses, yet leaving them dependent on blood for survival. Under Mathius Marsden's charismatic leadership, the vampires create the secret V Society, a sanctuary for vampiric families. They build the Fourth Planet Farm, a massive agricultural and financial empire used to manipulate the course of world events. Determined by test years, the vampires are divided into the powerful, sterile Founders (first round), the long-surviving dominant Seniors (second round), and the subservient Juniors (third round). The V Society argues over control of the farm, which is also the primary source of blood for its members. Tired of the friction from within, the Founders withdraw into obscurity, leaving the V Society in the hands of the manipulative Seniors. For 350 years, Founder Mathius has secretly monitored the V Society. He's silently watched as it degenerated from the refuge he created into a cult of subjugation and fear. Senior Eliza Ricos is searching for the genetic key to freedom from the oppressive Society. When the reigning triumvirate targets the entire Ricos family, Mathius plans to use his considerable power to oppose the dictatorship and put the Society back on the course he originally set. But nothing ever goes as planned... About the Kate Nevermore is a fictional character who writes for fun and profit. She plans to write a sequel to Blood for the Living and two other novels.
