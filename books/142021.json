  "description": "In this outstanding first book of poems, Lee is unafraid to show emotion, especially when writing about his father or his wife. \"But there is wisdom/ in the hour in which a boy/ sits in his room listening,\" says the first poem, and Lee's silent willingness to step outside himself imbues Rose with a rare sensitivity. The images Lee finds, such as the rose and the apple, are repeated throughout the book, crossing over from his father's China to his own America. Every word becomes transformative, as even his father's blindness and death can become beautiful. There is a strong enough technique here to make these poems of interest to an academic audience and enough originality to stun readers who demand alternative style and subject matter. â€” Rochelle Ratner, formerly Poetry Editor, \"Soho Weekly News,\" New York",
