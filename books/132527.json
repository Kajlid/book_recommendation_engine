  "description": "This second book in the hot-and-heavy Opening Act series blows the roof off the joint for fans of Shay and LoniThis fast-moving and captivating sequel to Opening Act proves fame isn't all it's cracked up to be. Just when Shay and Loni think they have each other for real and can finally breathe easy, a small disagreement escalates into a huge blowout. Underneath it all, the pressures of stardom — among other issues — are pulling the couple apart at the seams, and they’re over almost before they get started. When Shay flies off in a rage, Loni finds herself in the arms of a man who truly understands her . . . or so she thinks. Meanwhile, Shay takes refuge with another lady, one who — thank God — DOESN’T TALK. And yet, as Loni and Shay fling themselves further and further into mutual self-destruction, they still can't seem to get out of each other's lives. Their band — featuring Shay as the heartthrob frontman and Loni as the critically acclaimed lyricist — is peaking with platinum sales, TV appearances, and a sold-out tour. They need each other professionally, but can they stand the separation in such close quarters?",
