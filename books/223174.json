  "description": "Violet is now nearing the end of her harrowing journey, but she still has a lot to accomplish. She is in danger of turning to the dark side and needs to take drastic action to purge herself of the toxin. She will have to trust in Fate that her plan won’t go horribly wrong. Leo is still being held captive by the angels. Violet needs to rescue him and to retrieve Nathan’s grace as well. It will take skills that she doesn’t yet possess to pull this off. Once more, she will need to suffer before she can gain the abilities that she will need. When it comes to her friends, she is willing to do whatever she has to in order to keep them safe. Violet still has one final fragment of the object of power to retrieve, which means she will need to return to hell again. The Demon Princes warned her that disaster would fall once she killed them all. She will finally learn what they meant, but by then it will be too late. It will take power that is currently out of her reach to stop the apocalypse from wiping out humanity.",
