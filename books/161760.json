  "description": "Honor Quirk arrives in Ireland excited about meeting the estranged family of her late great-grandmother. The welcome from her cousins, Dermot and Bryan, is confusing. One is warm, the other aggressive. The outwardly antagonistic Bryan makes it very clear he doesn't want her there. Dermot is delighted to meet her.  Honor stands up to Bryan, letting him know his trail of baggage has nothing to do with her. Despite their confrontational and hostile relationship, an undeniable attraction creeps insidiously into the house on Robinhill Farm. They both desperately try to stifle the sparks, but living under the same roof makes it impossible. Unable to cope with the turmoil of living with Bryan, Honor runs away, straight into the arms of charming Sean.  Shattered, Bryan finally takes control of his irrational belief that all women are evil, and fights to bring back the woman he loves. But is it too late?",
