  "description": "Shards of Summer immerses the reader in the sultry feel of the Jersey shore. Alison Ginger Jones, now a respected pillar of her community, is accused of the murder of a decorated WWII soldier that occurred sixty years ago, when she was a young barroom dancer. Evoking the life of the beach resort in the 1940s and present day, Shards of Summer dances through the lives of its main characters, focusing on the intelligent but emotionally disturbed Alison. In the 1940s, Alison collects things—shells, sea glass, men—and gets entangled with a married homicide detective investigating a series of bizarre murders in the resort town. The unexpected final scenes of the story expose each broken shard of the characters’ lives. Passion and dark obsessions mix in this satisfying, sexy read with as many brilliant colors as the sea glass Alison collects. K. Jameson explores relationships, female narcissism, and sexual obsession in a hot, twisted tale that raises more than the reader's pulse rate.",
