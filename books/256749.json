  "description": "The author has set his story millions of years into the future after the sun has burnt much of the earth and people live with their own belief and culture. With some exceptions, it is not, therefore, a culture or a country the reader can presently relate to. 81 is a young man living in his society trying to do all that is expected of him but he has some forbidden feelings within that lead him to do some unconventional things. In the world in which 81 lives, men, after having conquered their weaknesses, lead the society and the Zoufos' (women's) role is just to provide children. But everything does not always remain that way, does it?",
