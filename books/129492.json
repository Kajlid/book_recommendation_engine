  "description": "Michael Marshall Smith... \"Brutal and uncompromising, with unforgettable characters and real emotional punch - C. Marten-Zerf raises the bar on how good intelligent action thrillers can be.\" The Review (London) \"Hard hitting and grittily realistic. Marten-Zerf never fails to impress, once again combining fast paced frequent action with gut wrenching emotion - another sure fire winner.\" To some he was merely the gamekeeper, a quiet, private man. To others he was a soldier, forged in the flames of war. But to Manon, who needed his help, he was her ultimate choice of weapon. Garrett had spent most of his adult life fighting other people's wars. Now he lives in the highlands of Scotland. Alone but not lonely. Reclusive. Hiding from the person that he had become. Eschewing the violence that was once his way of life. But then he receives a phone call from a friend who needs his help. An orphanage in South Africa is missing some of it's children, suspected kidnapped, and the local corrupt police will not help. It is up to Garrett. And he is once more drawn into a world of dark and deep brutality as he tries to do what is right. Together with the guard from the children's home and an old combat compatriot he discovers a world of darkness and depravity that threatens to overwhelm him, forcing him to react in the only way that he knows how. The way that he swore never to follow again...because someone has to protect the children.",
