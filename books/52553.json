  "description": "In this popular Grimm's fairy tale, a king tells a young woman that she must spin a room full of straw into gold by morning...or die. To complete this impossible task, she is forced to promise her firstborn child to a mysterious little man in return for his gold-spinning ability. Years later, he returns to claim what is his—only to find that he has underestimated the power of a mother's love. This is a haunting and heartfelt retelling of the classic German tale.",
