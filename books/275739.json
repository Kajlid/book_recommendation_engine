  "description": "You are the designer of your presence. You can only erase the death program in your presence. The present, all \"now,\" can be put together. Life is the synthesis of all \"now\", but also of all other times, future and past; and not only that, life is also the synthesis of all universes; that life takes place, therefore always on all temporal and spatial levels. In the big now. That we rarely notice this is a great disadvantage for us; for some other beings, no matter what kind, notice this. Eternal life is beyond the terran matrix. The Terran Matrix was created by foreign and unknown powers. You don't mean anything to them. They don't care so much about you, they don't care about your possible death. If you want to live forever, you have to create your own matrix.",
