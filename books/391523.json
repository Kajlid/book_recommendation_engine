  "description": "A novel, illustrated by Alf Van der Plank. Set in Paris, Lukas Tomin's second book is the narrative of a tempestuous Czech artist living off the generosity of his girlfriend, struggling with the desire for fame and the alienation of his exile. Writing in an adopted tongue marked by both his native Czech and the French of his setting, Tomin forges an English that is rhythmic, mobile, energetic, and often sharply humorous. Here the extremes of the material and spiritual worlds collide and intersect, creating a space of extreme reality which directly confronts the mundane.",
