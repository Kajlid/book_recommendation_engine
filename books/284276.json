  "description": "Amethyst is a curse worker on the run after hexing her ex. (He he that rhymes) On the bus to Silver Springs, she meets a set of hot twins but with a vengeful ex after her and a group of pissed off vampires, she’s a little distracted. In a town she swore she would never return to she runs into her old tormentor, a hot af wolf shifter, befriends an angel, and spends more time ducking and dodging her family members than she would like. Lady Luck is supposed to be on her side, but with so many problems, what’s a girl to do? Maybe a pumpkin spiced drink and 3 hotter than hell supernaturals is just what Amethyst needs, or will her hatred over her past keep her from opening her heart and have her end up hexing herself.",
