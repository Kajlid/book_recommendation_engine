  "description": "After a horrible and humiliating break-up, chef Jolie Hill wants nothing more than to lick her wounds and avoid all involvement with men for a while. An ad for a cook and nanny at a remote ranch seems like the perfect opportunity to get away. She thought she’d learned her lesson about having a workplace romance—until she met Colson Westland, a hard, taciturn man who’s as hot as he is serious.

He may be a hard man, but Jolie recognizes a soft side, one that makes her heart melt just a little too much.Ever since Jolie came to work at the ranch, the place seems lighter. Happier. And Colson has felt lighter and happier too. Caring for Adam has been a pleasure, but ever since his best friend left the little guy to his care, he’s felt a bit overwhelmed. Jolie, with her laughter and spirit, seem to be just the right touch his ranch needs.
