  "description": "This book summarizes the author's thoughts and dreams when she feels above normal and connected to the higher being, which we have so fondly, fearingly and limitingly named GOD. Surprisingly it was not religious or spiritual but metaphysical. It can be called , science of God or the God of science. She is convinced that the curves of number 8 will solve the evading mystery of the UNIVERSE, and that there is darkness in light which needs diving in. Sadguru was the candle in the search for the Sun.",
