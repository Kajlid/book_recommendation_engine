  "description": "Catherine Grier seemed to have it all—money, prestige, and a beach house that would rival the Hamptons. But an old scar buried deep in her soul hides a life filled with lonely nights and painful memories…until a dusty old book lands in her lap, sending her back in time to 1767 and into the arms of sexy Lord Bryne Adair.  Forced from his country on charges of treason, Bryne trusts no one, especially not the blue-eyed, blonde-haired vixen he discovers in his bed, claiming to be from the future. Unable to resist, he’ll play her game to the end. He has nothing left to lose but his heart.",
