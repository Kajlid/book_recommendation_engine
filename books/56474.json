  "description": "Kieran, the proud king of Gleannmara, great-grandson of Queen Maire and King Rowan, was once rejected by Riona of Dromin. But this time the willful lady will have no choice. Kieran promised his dying best friend, her brother, to protect Riona as her lord and husband. She must give up her absurd dedication to a fickle God who lets the good die while the vile go unpunished. Kieran's sword and lifelong love is all she will need.When Riona takes to heart three orphans, she begs God for guidance. What of her plans to join the church? Besides, how can she adopt a family without a husband? But when the arrogant Kieran of Gleannmara rides through the abbey gate, Riona cannot believe this is God's answer! She could never accept his swaggering arrogance--or his anger at God.Kieran is framed for murder. Suddenly the prideful king becomes a fugitive, fleeing for his life. His only hope? The faith and wit of a would-be nun, her prodigal band of homeless waifs--and the very God he has so fiercely denounced.These unlikely cohorts are joined in an adventure of faith, hope, and love--an adventure that, for Kieran, can have only one end: acquittal...or death.",
