For vampire-hunter, Anders Dragolescu, a conflict that has lasted for generations is finally drawing to an end.In the mountainous land of Carpathia, a particularly ancient and aggressive vampire has begun to prey upon women in the village of Rabuj. Dragolescu has already tangled with this monster before and has witnessed first-hand the devastation that his flock of carnivorous bats can inflict if unleashed upon on the local population.To save the innocent, Dragolescu must confront the vampire in its mountain eyrie, but to get there he will have to scale a sheer cliff that is every bit as dangerous as the guardians he will find in the vampireâ€™s cave.",
