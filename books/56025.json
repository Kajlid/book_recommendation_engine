  "title": "The Magic Shop",
  "description": "Out for a walk in London one day, a father and his son, Gip, happen upon a magic shop. At Gip's urging, the two go in â€” and things grow more and more curious by the minute. Counters, store fixtures, and mirrors seem to move around the room, and the shopkeeper is mysterious himself. Gip is thrilled by all he sees, and his father is at first amused. But then things become stranger, even sinister, and the father is no longer sure where reality ends and illusion begins. Fantastical illustrations underscore the macabre atmosphere of the tale, making this a perfect read-aloud book for Halloween.",
