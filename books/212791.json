  "description": "Margaret Ridgemont and James Treadway will marry. Period, end of discussion. Too bad she overhears him tell a friend that he likes her sister better. Pacing with the tragi-comedy of an ill-arranged marriage, magic holes are appearing in the oddest places. If Adrian Hughes can ferret out the rogue wizard responsible for creating the holes, he might receive a knighthood -- people might not die of holes in their foreheads -- and England might not crumble into the ocean. And if it were an ideal world, Adrian and Margaret would be together.",
