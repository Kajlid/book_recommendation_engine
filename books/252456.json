  "description": "A murdered dancer. An attractive policeman. A tangled mystery. Newly settled in a quaint small town in the English Fens, Rory Cornwell knows no-one and is too shy to go out and make friends. When a local festival is marred by the murder of a morris dancer, his pretty house-mate Haley is distraught–her uncle is the prime suspect. Nervously investigating, and smitten by Zach, the attractive policeman on the case, will Rory uncover the true culprit before the wrong person is jailed? And can he untangle the knot of fake dating and misunderstandings between himself and Haley before dreamboat Zach gets away? Murder of a Straw Man is a cozy mystery that will appeal to fans of Ellery Adams’ Books on the Bay and Agatha Frost’s Peridale Cafe series. Readers who love small town mysteries with British detectives will love this fun glimpse into the bizarre hobby of morris, when vengeful spirits run riot amidst the festival bake offs and bunting.",
