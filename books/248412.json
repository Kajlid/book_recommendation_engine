  "description": "\"If you want to be a student at VIP College, get used to rubbing shoulders with royalty, rockstars and billionaires.\"  As a non-wealthy, non-celebrity scholarship recipient, VIP College freshman Aubrey is intent on joining the college's Literary Society. As a budding romance writer, she hopes to find a group of like-minded bookworms. Instead, she is confronted with the VIP Lit executive committee: Luka, the prince, elegant and refined. Has he ever dropped that genial smile and shown someone his true self? Jaeson, the billionaire, handsome and alluring. With such a commanding presence, does he have a not-so-secret dominant side? Riot, the rockstar, guarded and aloof. He writes such passionate lyrics, surely there must be more to him than his prickly exterior? With the literary club in danger of being disbanded due to low readership, Aubrey’s anonymous romantic stories may be the only thing that can save them. There’s only one problem: Aubrey's experience with romance and love is limited, but her readers keep asking for more. Can Luka, Jaeson and Riot help Aubrey find the inspiration she's yearning for? *** Accepted is the first book in the VIP College Reverse Harem Romance series. A portion of this novel was originally published in the now out-of-print Royalty, Rockstars and Billionaires.",
