  "description": "*New Adult Romance***Explicit scenes and language**To resist the perfect man, please follow these simple rules: Step 1: Never make eye contact. Step 2: Never smile at him. Step 3: Never agree to anything he suggests. Or better yet, just follow Lenna Davenport's example and give in to temptation, sparking a whole tangle of passion, forbidden romance, mounting secrets and deceit. She meets her prince charming at her father's company Christmas party. Problem is he happens to be her dad's new boss. Worse problem is, her dad totally hates him. But what Daddy doesn't know... Braxton Farris takes over Farris Industries out of family obligation and expects his new employees might resent his youth and inexperience. What he doesn't anticipate is the level of contempt Tom Davenport carries for him. Nor does he count on falling for Tom's daughter. When he and Lenna start a secret affair, a disaster of corporate proportions is bound to follow. But to be together, they must decide if the fallout is worth it.(Revised and republished from the 2010 version)",
