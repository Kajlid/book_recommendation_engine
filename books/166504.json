  "description": "Joining Southern rock band Steele Horse on the road for a week would’ve been any fan’s dream, but for Summer it is so much more. She knew the first time she heard sexy front man, Beau Steele’s, growling lyrics about pleasure and pain that he understood her dirty little secret. After months of talks and texts, she now has seven days to convince Beau that she can be everything that he needs, and that while she may lust after the rocker, she’s in love with the man. Beau’s life is in the spotlight, but he hides his heart away. The physical comes easy for him, but love and trust is a whole other thing. Coming off an ugly divorce, he meets Summer online. She’s easy to talk to and their life scars seem to crisscross in a way that makes him feel she gets him. Taking a chance, he invites her on the road for a game of sex and we’ll see. Their kinks compliment and the sex is smoking hot, but can they put their doubts aside to find the bond they both crave?",
