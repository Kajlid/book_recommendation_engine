When you want the real deal on sex, you go straight to the Gigolo's mouth.Vigliano Books tasked Showtime's Gigolos with dipping into their vast knowledge of sexuality to create erotica, written by men who know what women want.

Ash Armand, the winner of Vigliano Books Sexoir Contest, writes with the same beauty of spirit that he brings to his life and lovers. Presented here are three poetical, sensuous Ride to the Break of Dawn, Ashâ€™s winning story about a very public sexual encounter; Beyond the Labyrinth, an otherworldly journey orchestrated by a powerful woman; and Dreamlandia, a penetrating look at the mentality of spiritual sex.",
