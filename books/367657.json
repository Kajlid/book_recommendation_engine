  "description": "When a selfish enchantress steals mystical powers from her twin sister, she sentences the far away world of Lor Mandela to an untimely death. Only one can save it--a Child of Balance named Audril Borloc. All hope seems lost, however, when shortly after her fourth birthday, Audril disappears without a trace.Desperate to save their world, a group of spies travel to Earth in search of the little girl with black hair and bright blue eyes, traits that on Lor Mandela are exclusive to the ruling Borloc family. Instead, they find sixteen-year-old Maggie Baker. While the age difference between the girls is obvious, Maggie has the Borloc traits--evidence enough for the desperate spies.Following an earthquake that no one feels but her, Maggie's mundane existence is launched into a roller coaster ride of twists and turns as she finds herself bouncing back and forth between her hometown of Glenhill, Iowa and the mysterious lands of Lor Mandela. On this strange world, she must learn who to trust and who to fear. More importantly, she must find a way to convince the Lor Mandelans that she is not their missing \"Child of Balance\", and her family and friends in Iowa--and herself for that matter--that she's not going insane.Amid battling a ferocious two-headed beast, being captured by a lawless band of Shadow Dwellers, and falling head-over-heels for the enchanting son of an evil warlord, Maggie discovers that her blas√© reality could be the real fantasy, and that the fate of an entire world may actually depend on her.",
