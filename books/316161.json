  "description": "My name is Fauve, I’m twenty-two years old, and two months ago, I was a normal French college student. Now? I was just accepted into the prestigious National Institute of Circus Arts of Montréal and moved to the other side of the Atlantic to attend their 10-month Intensive Program.The catch? Every term, the lowest ranking half of the class has to go home, and the best student wins a job at the legendary Cirque des Etoiles at the end of the year, guaranteeing a long, prosperous career as a performer.Will I be good enough to stay in the program until the end? Will the open relationship with my boyfriend help us overcome the distance? Will the connection with my flatmates be the end of it all or is it just the beginning?One thing is certain: the show must go on, and failure is not an option.Aerial is a steamy, fast-burn Reverse Harem Romance Novel intended for audiences 18+ only. It contains sex scenes with 2+ participants, MM, and other kinks. It ends with an HFN and no cliffhanger.",
