  "description": "http://youstupidrelativist.com/WGDE.htmlWhy God Doesn't Exist (WGDE) presents a novel entity as a mediator for electromagnetism and gravity: a DNA-like rope. The proposal is that all atoms in existence are interconnected by a twined pair of threads. There is a closed-loop, single-piece thread that makes up all of matter. This seminal model of interconnected atoms explains the mechanism of both cosmic and earthly action-at-a-distance as well as the properties of light, magnetism, and the workings of the atom.If you are open to new ideas and want to have a fresh look at science, specifically the physical workings of light, gravity, electricity, magnetism, etc., WGDE provides you with a rational alternative.A book designed and written for the layman. Over 300 illustrations. http://youstupidrelativist.com/WGDE.html",
