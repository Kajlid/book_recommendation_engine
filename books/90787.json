  "description": "When Elle Ison finally flees from a five-year abusive relationship, she finds that freedom is still just beyond her grasp. She has no place to run, no money and no options.That is until a band of mysterious, good-looking heroes come to her rescue, sweeping Elle up into the world of ani-shifts, humans with the ability to shift into animal form. Elle becomes mesmerized by the magic of their world—one she believed only existed in her imagination—and the mystery surrounding the Lake family. Especially the intimidating Asher Lake who is charged with leading the secret organization of shifters known as the Union, and the protégés left in his care. Elle is lost and lonely—and wants nothing more than to be part of a real family, even one as broken and dysfunctional as the Lakes. But if Elle chooses to stay, she must bind herself all over again—this time by archival laws which dictate that she make a commitment to a man who has vowed never to fall in love. For Elle, this means forfeiting the one dream she has never realized. Elle must weigh her options: should she give in and relinquish her right to dream of love…or will she leave the safety of Lake Manor behind, along with the family she has come to care for—and never look back.",
