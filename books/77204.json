  "description": "The successful and renowned conductor of a major symphony orchestra in Sao Paulo, he is married to a beautiful and talented violinist, close to thirty years his junior. But his happiness is undermined by two that he will never wholly share her life because, unlike her, he is not Jewish; and that she is unfaithful to him. Black Waltz opens a fascinating and harrowing window into a mind bordering on paranoia and psychosis. In it the reader accompanies dark passions that presage the inexorable sundering of a relationship and lead inescapably to its unforgettable climax.",
