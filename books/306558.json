  "description": "Melissa Scott’s life takes a turn for the worse until the charming yet arrogant Damien Wentworth walks into her office building. He makes it clear from their very first encounter that he wants her but when she finds out that his father owns the law firm she works for, he becomes off limits.The only problem is that Damien doesn’t hear the word no very often and he is determined to get Melissa under him before he leaves at the end of the week. Melissa isn’t interested in only being another notch on his bedpost but when the temptation gets to be too much, it leads to a weekend of intense passion that alters both of their lives forever.Unattainable is a standalone novel, however the main character Melissa also appears in Letting Go of the Past, book six in the For Keeps series and she also briefly features in Seeking a New Beginning, book five in the For Keeps series.It is not necessary to have read those books before reading Unattainable.Due to its explicit content, bad language and graphic sexual content, Unattainable is recommended for mature readers of eighteen years and above.",
