  "description": "Very first published work by the Author C. JoyBell C.; this book of poetry and prose is an open invitation to be human!  The Sun Is Snowing has been described by many as \"a masterpiece\" while others have said that it is \"the key of angels\"; \"profound\"; \"passionate and romantic\"; \"beautiful\" and \"like an intimate talk with a friend.\"  The author herself just thinks that she can hear the angels whispering to her through the pages of her book, and if that be the only reason why she published it- to hear the angels' whispers; it would be reason enough!Note: This edition is out-of-print, please look for the current, third edition, \"The Sun Is Snowing: The Scrapbook.\"",
