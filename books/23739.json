  "description": "Love lost, found, and kicked around“It might be my imagination, but it seems like most people in the building tend to steer clear of me. I’m the one who gets the weird phone calls, the strange visitors, and disturbing mail.”“My last great love affair didn’t work out—many don’t, but maybe the next one might, and if not, maybe the one after that. There may not be someone for everyone; there may not be a God in heaven, or peace on earth either. But that doesn’t mean you just sit around at home, doing nothing.”",
