  "description": "'I have always known that in another life I  was-or will be-a dolphin. I am a pink human, caught in  a net of ambition and years of hard work. In a few  minutes I will dive into artificially turquoise  water waiting at my feet. A minute later I'll  either be ecstatic or a  failure.'Fifteen-year-old swimming champ Alex Archer has her  mind set on one goal-competing in the Olympic Games  in Rome. Alex has been training hard for six  years--but so has her archrival, Maggie  Benton.Maggie isn't the only obstacle Alex must  overcome. She's spread herself too thin at school,  and at home she's worried about her grandmother's  failing health. She needs complete concentration  for the competition, but it's becoming harder to  give her all. Then, her handsome boyfriend, Andy is  in a terrible accident. Even if Alex can deal  with all these unforeseen problems, can she beat  Maggie to make it to the Olympic Games?",
