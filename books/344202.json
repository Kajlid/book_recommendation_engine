  "description": "Lycan Warriors, Book TwoHe's the worst of the bad, the deadliest weapon of them all, except to her…then he's the gentlest teddy bear.Liberty was the first member on the lycanthrope team of soldiers-for-hire. Her specialty is technology. She's seen every member join, some of them to stay, others to leave — permanently. One colleague has always managed to make her lose her legendary cool.

Liberty knows better and has lusted after the quiet, towering lycan with the serious eyes for years, silently wishing he'd just make his move.
