  "description": "WOR(L)DS APART is a book about a friendship across cultures, and the insights it evokes. While Smitha Murthy is in a foreign country for the first time – teaching English at a Chinese school – she chances upon a fellow traveller in the web: Dorothee Lang, who has just returned to Europe from a journey to Asia, and is trying to find the balance between everyday joys and worries, work, and the call of the horizon.An engaging travelogue in the form of emails unfolds. It leads from the Great Wall to Shanghai, from Munich to the Mediterranean Sea, and from curious questions (\"How does one type on a Chinese keyboard?\") to shared life lessons that wait along the road: \"And that is the beauty of travel. It's a journey to discover the truths that lie underneath.\"Interlaced with photos and notes, and rounded up with practical advice for travelling and teaching in Asia, WOR(L)DS APART is both an inspiring travel read, and the story of a friendship across cultures and borders.",
