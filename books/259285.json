  "description": "Anton Venter, a South African champion of human rights, is the son of an ultra-conservative Afrikaner pastor. When the divorced lawyer falls for a stunningly beautiful black woman the predictable social complications pale into insignificance at the revelation of her brutally abused past. As he helps her to come to terms with her pain, Anton finds himself confronting the most evil and degenerate characteristics of the male psyche. Little does he know that his relationship with the gorgeous and vulnerable Kelly Modise will lead him to uncover the identity of a depraved serial killer. A tale of horrific sexual abuse and brutal murder - offset against an incredible love story. \"Not for the faint hearted \"",
