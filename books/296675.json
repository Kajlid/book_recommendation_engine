  "description": "One hot chefOne beautiful woman One chance encounter Mix and dish up some love Erin Bazzara is living life to the fullest as a single woman in New Orleans and making a name for herself as one of the top psychologists in the state of Louisiana. Years ago, she swore off men after receiving devastating news, news that proved her fiancé didn’t care about the rule “in sickness and in health.” It also proved he didn’t really care about her. Good riddance, who needs a man anyway? Not her. Not ever again. Or so she thought, until she literally runs into a certain world-renowned chef who looks at her like she might be his next four-course meal. Chef Curtis Rockwell, host of the award-winning Chef To Go, never knows who the next participant on his show will be. State to state, city to city, he scours grocery store aisles each episode, looking for the perfect stranger to go home with so he can teach them how to cook a gourmet meal. It’s always been just a part of his job, a job he loves but still a job… Then he spots her. The perfect participant. The perfect woman. A woman not even his dreams could have conjured up. Now, all he has to do is prove the heat between them won’t just sizzle out like yesterday’s flambé.",
