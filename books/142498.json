  "description": "Alternate cover for this ASIN can be found here*Disclaimer* If you are easily offended by hot, dirty biker books, then this is not the book for you. However if you love panty melting alpha males with a mouth on them then enjoy the ride. My name is Grim and this is the beginning... This isn't a fairytale romance or for the faint of heart. Deep in the hills of Drag Creek Kentucky, there is a group of outlaws, whose love of moonshine and motorcycles runs through their blood. We are known as the Black Rebel Riders' MC. For the past twenty years my club has been at war with a rival MC, The Devils Rejects.",
