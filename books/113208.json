  "description": "Warning - 18+ due to sexual content.  Kenza nightclub owner, Ruben McKenzie can have any woman he wants, but the only woman he wants is Rosie—his sweet innocent employee, who happens to be eleven years his junior. Watching her parade her hot little body around his club, serving drinks completely unaware of the attention she attracts is driving him to distraction. But when he sees a regular getting close to her, all bets are off.  Rosie has had more than enough life experience, but when it comes to matters of the heart—the one place that Ruben wants in—she’s completely innocent. Having no family of her own, it’s a dream to be invited to a McKenzie family gathering. Rosie always wanted to belong to a family like the McKenzie’s, but she’s afraid that if she gives her heart to Ruben and things don’t work she’ll be crushed, beyond repair.  Neither one of them may be able to keep their distance for long. The trouble that has been brewing at Kenza finally comes to a head, and when Rosie finds herself caught up in it, how far will Ruben go to protect her?  ~*~*~*~  In this third installment of the McKenzie Brothers series you’ll learn more about the two remaining brothers, Lucien and Ramon. New players, Hunter and Julian, will be introduced.  None of my books have cliffhangers and they can be read as standalone, but to get the full background on the rest of the family then I do suggesting reading Seduce, The Wedding and Rapture first.",
