  "description": "This fascinating expedition consisted of so much more than learning about ancient civilisations such as the Aztecs, Zapotecs and Mayans and seeing the remains of their once great cities. Whether travelling by coach, visiting a remote site by five-seater 'plane or travelling up-river by boat, the journey itself was part of the adventure.However, it was the discovery that many Indians still practised ancient customs, plus unexpected events such as an erupting volcano, falling rocks and animals invading the bedroom at night that made this trip through Mexico, Guatemala and Belize so memorable.Meet the priests and the natives and find out why the Zapotecs competed for the honour of being selected for human sacrifice. Also, discover why the Indians revered Coca Cola among many other bizarre traditions and beliefs.",
