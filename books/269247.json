  "description": "“I’ll be good to you,” he purred and swept his thumb over my pendant, caressing, making me feel it on my lower lip. His ki surged into my mind, hammering at me with a soothing promise, abusing the link he’d left behind with a kiss. “You’ll never want for anything…”Asher promises to teach me the forbidden while my city—my home—burns at his back. Because of him, Tritan falls, and the Caledonian forces take the best of my people for their own sick uses.To fight, those of us who remain must flee. Regroup, or submit.But he’s coming, hunting me, and Asher won’t stop until I wear his mark. Until my goddess-given power is his to command.He’s tasted my lips and fed me nothing but lies, but his betrayal has given me strength even he didn’t expect.His people took everything from me, and Goddess be damned if I won’t take it back.",
