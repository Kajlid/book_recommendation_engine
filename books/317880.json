  "description": "Our young fairy godmother was once a sorcerer, and Princess Eleanor was chosen by Fate . . . to be the mother of the chosen one.In the Petty Kingdoms of Algernon, where name and country are of the utmost importance, our young fairy godmother has neither. Her job carried out at the behest of Fate, is to lead important figures unknowingly to their assigned destiny.When Eleanor de Hauteville, the second princess of a northern kingdom, returns to the southern Kingdom of Illyria she intends to make a name for herself— yet an engagement to a jaded prince isn’t quite the way she envisioned doing so.This tangled tale finds unexpected heroines in a reluctant princess bride and her chain-smoking fairy godmother, both of whom decide to challenge the foreseen destiny that binds them. Will their offbeat path cause catastrophe within the Petty Kingdoms? Chaos in the Court Circus? Or—even worse—the collapsing of a soufflé? A story within stories where desserts come with deception, princes combust into flames, and lovers dance decades into the past—can free will prevail over prophecy, or will these heroines be crushed under cosmic retribution?For fans of The Night Circus, Once Upon a Broken Heart, and The Wicked King",
