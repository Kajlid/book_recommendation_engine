  "description": "Alternative Reads are exactly what they sound like—stories youwon’t find just anywhere. First, we gathered up our boldest authors and told them to write whatever the hell they liked. Their only restrictions were common sense, as defined by the following passage: any subject matter is acceptable except pornography and/or stories promoting cruelty, hate, bigotry, pedophilia, government overthrow, and similar illegal and illicit activities.What did we come up with? A bunch of happy authors, some realtreats for our readers and a name you won’t soon forget. These are... Writers on the Wrong Side of the Road, and we’re proud they went there. Adults Only, Please.",
