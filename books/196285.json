  "description": "Is it worth risking a wonderful friendship for the chance at perfect love? Bonnie has been burying her feelings for her best friend Lucy for years. Lucy was in a committed relationship when they met, so when Bonnie's feelings grew, she chose to bury them deep, rather than losing Lucy altogether. Bonnie filled the void with meaningless sexual encounters, while getting what she needed emotionally from Lucy. But now Lucy is single and the undeniable sexual tension that seemed to be growing between them is pure torture for Bonnie. So with their yearly trip to Lucy's lake cabin fast approaching, Bonnie is left with a very big decision. Should she risk ruining the beautiful friendship that she shares with Lucy for a chance at quite possibly finding that epic kind of love that comes only once in a lifetime?Is it really worth the risk?",
