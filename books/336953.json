  "description": "Can a powerful warlock from an original line be everything a broken shifter needs to heal? Benjamin Ward loves seeing his fellow enforcers find their fated mates. He wants that and has made it no secret that he would love someone to cherish and spend his life with. When his aura reacts to the adorable cutie cooking, his heart hurts when he realizes who his fated One is and what he’s been through. Benjamin takes a step back and tries to give the fox shifter space and time to accept him, but will it be enough? Elias Holmes had an amazing life, but that was taken from him when he was kidnapped one morning on his way to work. After months in captivity, he’s rescued with not much time left before he and the others would have been beyond help. Now that he’s no longer in captivity, it’s time to put his life back together. That’s difficult when the mountain is surrounded by large, intimidated alphas that scare both him and his fox. Benjamin and Eli discover they’re fated mates, but can Eli be what Benjamin deserves? Benjamin isn’t nearly as intimidating as the other enforcers, and he smells amazing. Can Eli trust him with not only his body but his heart? Benjamin is Book Six in the Paranormal Council Enforcers series. Each book in this series will focus on a different couple, but these books are not standalones and should be read in order as there is an ongoing backstory that won’t be resolved quickly. This is a fated mate story in an MPreg world, and there will be babies in this story. You should expect all the normal shenanigans, heats, biting, and remember that sometimes even fated mates need a little help.",
