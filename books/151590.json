  "description": "Book 1 of the Nine Devils MC series   Years ago, Rose Aguilar's heart was broken when the man she loved left her for the Nine Devils MC.  Broken hearted, she swore off bikers for the rest of her life and left her hometown of Eagle Valley with no intentions of coming back.   Not a day goes by that Joseph Warner doesn't question the choices he made years ago.  He's never forgotten the girl whom he loved more than anything else in the world and spends almost every night wondering if the Nine Devils--and its simmering conflict with the cartels to the south--had been the right choice to make.   Death will set the two on an unexpected collision course.  When their mutual friend is gunned down by the cartel, the two find themselves standing in each other's presence once again. Has time healed the wound of their separation or only widened the rift between them?",
