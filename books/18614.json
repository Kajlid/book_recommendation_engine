  "title": "Nollekens and his Times",
  "description": "Joseph Nollekens, the fashionable and infamous sculptor who worked in London between 1770 and 1823, produced ‘bustos’ of almost everyone of consequence in his day. Despite his eccentricity and bad manners, sordid appearance and notorious stinginess he numbered people as highly-respected as Johnson, Garrick and Reynolds among his many admirers and friends.John Thomas Smith, keeper of prints and drawings at the British Museum, distinguished art critic and former pupil of Nollekens, first produced this ‘rambling memoir’ in 1828, five years after his subject's death. It not only gives a unique portrait of Nollekens himself, but is a mine of information about the topography, sights and sounds of London in its Georgian heyday.Inviting inevitable comparison with Boswell's Life of Johnson, this is a memoir that will delight anyone interested in either our historic or artistic heritage, or the character of the past.",
