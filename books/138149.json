  "description": "At the height of the Cold War, Roy Chisolm arrives at the edge of the free world.An idealist in less-than-ideal times, Chisolm’s military orders have taken him to the Bunker, an underground fortress in West Germany where intelligence and war footing operations convene. Within the impenetrable concrete walls, he finds a complete lack of military protocol, a total disregard for the stakes of the game, and a life of soul-crushing absurdity.Under constant threat of Russian annihilation, those assigned to the Bunker grapple with the inescapable futility of their posting. Chisolm struggles to maintain his moral compass in the face of disturbing apathy and chaos. But even as he plots his escape, he begins to form enigmatic bonds with his fellow warriors—and a romance outside the Bunker walls—unearthing a new understanding of trust, conviction, and love.Inspired by true events, Bunker Mentality is Joseph Heller’s Catch-22 meets David Graeber’s Bullshit Jobs, exploring the meaning of war, morality, madness, honor, and courage in a world of utter insanity.",
