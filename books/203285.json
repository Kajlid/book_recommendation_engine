  "description": "Robert Tracy is spirited away from his own execution. A top-secret government project makes him an offer he can't refuse: work for us or disappear permanently. With no choice, he embarks on a mission to undo a terrorist attack that has already occurred, by being sent back in time 36 hours. But all is not as it seems. Soon, a conspiracy at the highest level of government to seize total power over the country threatens the second chance at life he has been given. Not knowing who he can trust, he must fight to survive and save himself, as well as a woman in the past who was unwittingly drawn into the battle for the survival of the country. Spanning both time, and the width of America, 36 is a unique thrill ride that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",
