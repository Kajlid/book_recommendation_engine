  "description": "Twenty-three-year-old Pepper Spicer is not living the dream. She ended her engagement at the last minute because her fiance,a musician and soon-to-be reality TV star, wanted her to sacrifice her own career ambitions for his. Now she's stuck at home sharing a room with her little sister, trying to pay off massive debt for a wedding that didn t happen, and spending Friday nights Facebook-stalking everyone who has a better life. Her therapist father urges her to choose her career dreams and count her blessings by writing weekly thank-you notes, but gratitude is a tall order when she botches an important job interview and has to settle for writing an undercover dating web-zine column the last thing in the world she wants to do. Still, as Pepper ( Indie Girl) chronicles her bizarre and hilarious blind dates, she gives her father's challenge a try and slowly finds herself leaving self-pity behind. Life takes a major upswing as Pepper's column hits the big time and she tastes the exhilarating thrill of success. But there's one tiny the intensely hot man she's falling for is having issues with her job (again). Will Pepper trade her personal ambition for another chance at love?",
