  "description": "When Doc joined the Yale womenâ€™s rugby team, she expected a rugged time on the field. But nothing prepared her for what happened off the field, especially when Eva fell in love with a gorgeous teammate, rankling her hostile Southern Baptist family. Filled with raucous song and ivy league rivalries, 'Hookers, Flankers and Locks' also explores questions of identity and human acceptance.",
