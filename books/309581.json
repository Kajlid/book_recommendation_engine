When a hunk with dark blue eyes and perfect bone structure hits me with a silly line at the bar, my mission is complete.I vow to move on from our steamy night as I head to the rehearsal dinner, certain one of my brother’s hot pro football player groomsmen will be my Prince Charming.Then the best man turns around. Dark blue eyes. Perfect bone structure. A body I won’t soon forget.And apparently my new roommate.",
