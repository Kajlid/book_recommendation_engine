  "description": "Be careful what you wish for. Isn’t that what they say? In my defence, what woman wouldn’t wish for a handsome, intense, and successful man? Aiden is all of these things and more.He is also a jerk of epic proportions.He is blunt, closed-off, and secretive. I know there’s more to him than just his good looks, but he refuses to open up. So why do I keep going back for more?Yes, our chemistry is off the charts, but physical attraction isn’t enough to sustain a real relationship. And that’s what I want—a real connection with the real Aiden.Too bad he just keeps on breaking my heart. Will I finally crack that tough armour Aiden wears like a cloak?Or will Aiden truly be my greatest mistake?**Please note that this is a book with a strong, arrogant, male character. If you are looking for a PG sweet romance book, then this book is not for you. If you want a raw, stripped down, gripping romance that can only come from having a bossy, domineering, unapologetic male character, then sit back and enjoy.**",
