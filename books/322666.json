And with whom is he willing to share his heart?The werewolves of the legends were nothing like this.When every month threatens a different transformation, will Jasper be willing to accept the risks that being with the professor entails?This is a sexy and dark story of a once innocent college boy and his dangerous shifter alpha professor.
