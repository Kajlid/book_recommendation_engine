  "description": "Anna Katz is a musician and composer. She is also a prisoner in Terezin, a Nazi concentration camp. Despite her dire circumstances, Anna defiantly offers the other prisoners hope by hiding coded messages in the music she secretly composes.  Emily Thurgood is a modern day music history professor who specializes in the music created and performed by prisoners in Nazi camps during the Holocaust, but her research is in danger of being compromised by a stressful path to tenure, a rocky romantic relationship, and the sudden murder of a university librarian.  The police draw unexpected connections between Emily and the murder victim. When Emily finds a mysterious musical clue left in her office, she takes matters into her own hands and embarks on a complicated mission to prove her innocence. Her search leads her to the Czech Republic, to the concentration camp Terezin, and to times gone past as she attempts to find a killer and unravel a musical mystery.  It all comes back to Anna Katz. In the end, Anna might be the only one who can save Emily from being charged with murder.",
