  "description": "Have you ever wanted something so badly you would kill for it? Identified only by the hastily—and clumsily—chosen alias Charles Brockden, the narrator of this story finds a bookstore that instantly piques his desire. He must call it his own; he must add it to his already-extensive collection of bookstores. But surely the owner of such a fine shop wouldn’t easily part with it. Brockden forms a plan to acquire the store in such a way that no one would ever suspect foul untraceable murder. And he knows he will be successful—because he has done it before.The Bibliomysteries are a series of short tales about deadly books, by top mystery authors.",
