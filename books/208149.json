Noah waits anxiously and impatiently for Ethan to get home from work to start their night of sexy fun. Noah discovers a man is watching him through the window across the street. When Ethan phones to let him know he's caught in traffic, the fun starts with phone sex. Shortly after, a masked Ethan arrives for the Halloween night of fun. But a knock at the door later has left Noah wondering who he just made love to. They find themselves dealing with more than they bargained for in this debut book of an erotic M/M series. Itâ€™s a one-night tale with twists and turns, and lust wrapped in suspicion. A hot read that will have you begging for more!",
