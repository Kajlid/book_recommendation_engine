  "description": "Tera Kenner’s life revolves around Pandora’s Box, her erotic novelty shop. It’s a place where fantasies come alive, where lackluster lovers are inspired, and sexual fulfillment is for sale on every shelf… for everyone but her. Running a shop for lovers is torture when she doesn’t have a man of her own around to help her let off a little steam.When her pent-up sexual frustration attracts an incubus, Tera can’t resist tasting the pleasures he offers. Rowan is lust incarnate, a consummate lover whose merest touch fires every sexual part of her body. Every moment raises her need to new heights, but every sexual encounter drains a little more of Tera’s life force.And to make matters worse, Rowan isn’t the only incubus who is drawn to her need. Troian is older, stronger, and he wants Tera for his own.Tera’s been unlucky in love before, but never like this. To leave Rowan is to risk her life at Troian's hands, but to stay is to risk not only her heart, but her very soul.",
