  "description": "When Kynan McGrath approached me about joining Jameson Force Security, I jumped at the chance. Just call me Dozer Burney, one half of the genius duo who keeps the team at the forefront of security technology. The move from NASA to Jameson also put me back on the east coast, closer to those who mean the most to me. Jessica Anderson has been my best friend since college. A single mom who found herself mixed up with a dangerous man years ago, she’s been living a safe, quiet life in Miami after helping police put him behind bars. We both knew her safety, and that of her daughter, was reliant on him staying locked up. So when I see an alert that he’s escaped from his maximum security prison, I know where he’s heading to exact his revenge. Now it’s a race against time to get to Jessica before he does.Protecting her with my life is easy, because there’s one thing I’ve never admitted to anyone, not even myself—I have been in love with Jessica Anderson since the day I met her. And if we both make it out alive, I’ll make sure she knows it every day for the rest of our lives.",
