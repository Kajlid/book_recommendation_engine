  "title": "Swimming with Wings",
  "description": "For most seventeen-year-olds, graduating high school means college plans, leaving the nest and shedding old hangups. But Lark Jennison is different. Ever since her parents died, she thinks she has wings. People think she’s crazy. Her wild imagination helps her escape grief and the doldrums of being smothered in the humidity and narrow opinions of a small town along the Savannah River. Under the guardianship of a brother who cares too much about the family name and his golf swing, she lives in their old mansion under the shadow of a family legacy fraught with rumors and too much disrepair. Leaving the nest is as unlikely as a bird swimming with its wings. When she meets Peter, one of the \"river gypsies\", her world begins to change. Along with connection found in their histories and Peter's mystic roots, Lark finds love, spirit and the conviction she’ll need to move on to pursue her talents as an artist, but when you’re crazy in love, how do you leave? Peter carries on the tradition of being a light healer, but in a world of corruption and fanaticism, his misinterpretation of this gift sets Peter and Lark on a collision course that will reveal the underpinnings of the town, the truth about “river gypsies”, beliefs and love itself.",
