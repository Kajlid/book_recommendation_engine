  "description": "The Outcasts is a story of loss, running away, hope and return. Three protagonists boldly confront a tradition-driven and repressive world. Through a series of serendipitous encounters, and against all odds, their paths intertwine at a time when each stands at a personal crossroads.Tabu is a rebellious young Muslim woman, who speaks her mind under the guise of jinn influence. Santan, an aging Hindu man, in the face of a near-death experience, suddenly discovers a new spark for life. And Chameli, a dazzling but emotionally fragile transgender woman, is forced to leave the community which had once provided her with safety and identity. Together, they embark on a transformative journey, laced with doubt and danger. They are forced to re-examine their values, renounce their old risk-averse selves, and face a dark night of the soul.Set in contemporary India, a land of dichotomies, the novel challenges the notions of gender, feminism vis-Ã -vis spirituality/religion, and culturally appropriate romantic expression.",
