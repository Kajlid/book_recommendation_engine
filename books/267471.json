  "description": "Single mum Ginny Smith has been trying for months to distract her 12-year-old son, Jason from his Brexit obsession. Even though she imposes tight parental controls on their internet, he still has the ability to source out conspiracy theories. Jason is borderline autistic with mild anxiety disorder. He’s convinced that everything will turn bad after Brexit and has been relentlessly telling friends and neighbours to be prepared. Fortunately, the people in their Scottish village have known Jason his whole life and are tolerant of his persistent warnings about Brexit.The day after Brexit starts like any other day, and Ginny breathes a sigh of relief as she goes in to work. But by the end of the weekend, it’s obvious things have gone terribly wrong. With all communications shut down, a silent government, food shortages, and no policing in rural areas, things get worse and worse. Choices are made that end lives. People show their true colours, and Ginny finds out just how many people were, in fact, listening to Jason all along.This novel takes a fictional look what could take place in the UK after a no deal Brexit. It shows the best—and worst—of people who are faced with a crisis that changes an entire country.",
