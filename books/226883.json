  "description": "Who Knew Lunch Could Change Your Life? Award-winning author, Diane Keyes, tells the story of her journey from heartache to wholeness in her memoir, To Wendy’s With Love. Forty years after a brain hemorrhage stole her childhood and left her feeling alone with painful memories and unanswered questions, Keyes began having lunch with her mom every week, finding healing in an unlikely place – a fast-food restaurant. What happens along the way is a tribute to the power of the family meal – changing her life and all those who join Diane and her mom around the Wendy’s table. The book chronicles a simple lunch tradition that now includes four generations of her family and has been part of their lives for 22 years and counting. It is here the pieces come together, perspectives shift, old memories find new meaning, and new memories are made. Pull up a chair and let the book’s powerful lessons on relationship change your life.",
