  "description": "Never Lie  \"Which stories were true?\"Jefferies watched the new guy survey the battlefield. \"What makes you think they weren't all true? This is SEAL Team Three. Alpha Platoon. Never doubt us. Never cause us to doubt you. Every man's life depends on the trust between his brothers. If we catch you even in a white lie, we'll make hazing look like a ten-year old's birthday party. You feel me?\"Never Settle  \"You don't want me. Not really. You see the car, the bike, the leather, the long hair. You see a projection. To love and be loved is the most selfless act a person can do for another. Life is too short to settle for the broken pieces of a shattered heart.\"Never Quit  \"I'll ask you again, Evie. Are you quitting?\"\"I didn't come this far to quit.\"\"Good. I'm going to make you cry. I am going to cuss like a sailor, because I am one. I'm going to push you hard and demand nothing but your very best. You'll want to quit, but if you quit, ever, we're done--do not ring the bell Ms.Sinclaire.\"",
