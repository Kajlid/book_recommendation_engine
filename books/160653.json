  "description": "Vivienne is one of “those” people, the kind that believes in love at all costs. Broken hearts are a natural product of that, and Viv is used to dealing with it by simply ignoring the ache, and moving on to a new love. But this time, she can’t seem to shake the pain — until Carter comes along, handing out easy smiles and the kind of attention that makes her not feel so fractured after all. Everybody knows Carter as this cool, confident, charismatic guy. He has a penchant for saying just the right things at just the right times, being just the kind of friend that’s needed in the midst of sorrow. But, as he and Viv embark on what was only ever intended to be a friendship, the idea of Carter as the “perfect” guy is challenged, and the real person could very well just be the next guy to break Viv’s heart.Old hurts are unraveled, familial bonds are tested, and hearts are put on the line in this story of two people who didn’t mean to fall in love.",
