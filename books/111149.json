  "description": "Emerald O'Brien, single mother of two, owns Chintz 'N China Tea Room, where guests are served a blend of tea and tarot reading. She never set out to be a detective but once word gets out that she can communicate with the dead, there's no turning back....It was a ghost. There, at the foot of Emerald's bed. A pen hovered above a piece of paper and scrawled these alarming words: I was murdered by my husband but nobody knows. Help me. True, Emerald was considered town witch, but she owned a teashop, not a detective agency. What did the spirit expect? After another darker entity emerges, bent on destroying her world and her family with it, Emerald's life takes a screeching detour onto a wild and dangerous road. As she careens into a web of lies and secrets woven around her ghostly visitor, death strikes again. Now, along with her friends - ex-supermodel, cop, and new love interest - Emerald must search for clues to put the killer behind bars and this tortured soul to rest.",
