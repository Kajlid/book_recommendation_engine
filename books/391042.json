  "description": "As Zwane is rolling his dung ball home, a mortally wounded bulbul crashes into the dust ahead of him. A member of his community who understands the bird’s language listens to its last gasps. Solemnly he turns to Zwane. “I am sorry to tell you your father is dead.” Zwane’s father, Mandla, was killed on the shores of Lake Ukufa, the Lake of Death, far to the north. He had been seeking a sacred Seed that, if planted, would grow into a great Tree similar to the one where scarabs had dwelt in the distant past in a state of bliss with Ilanga, their deity. Zwane is shattered at the news of his father’s death. Soon, however, he resolves to fulfil his father’s mission which is nothing less than to re-establish paradise. He knows he will need companions to help him, but how will he convince anyone to accept him as the leader of this momentous quest? After all, he is a mere dung roller, greatly outranked by warriors, priests and artificers. Young Zwane is the first book of The Baobab Tree trilogy. It is an epic adventure tale, but also chronicles a spiritual journey – a page-turner of note.",
