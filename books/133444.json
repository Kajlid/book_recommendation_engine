  "description": "Eighteen year old Claire Watkins is still reeling from the tragic loss of her best friend, Jamie Morgan, and is learning to navigate being an outcast without his help, learning to live with regrets as she realized she should've told him how she really felt about him, and she's learning how to deal with the fact that all the rumors swirling around school involve her being the cause of his death.Claire is one step away from a breakdown when Ryder Andrews comes into her life, rough around the edges, a former golden boy fallen from grace, living on his own borrowed time. He's not looking to get attached, seeing as how that's never gotten him anywhere and he's decided that he's tired of living and is just biding his time until the right day comes. But Claire complicates things and the two quickly realize the beauty that is life, love, and learning to live again.",
