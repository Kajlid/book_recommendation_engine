  "description": "May Be Too Hot To HandleElle Gray looks like a supermodel, thinks like a super agent, and can kill a man with her bare hands. But when she meets Dr. Beau Ruston, the brilliant scientist and ex-college football star in charge of the project she's been sent to protect, she wants more of her bare self around him than just her hands. If his muscular grace and quick wit hadn't turned her on, there would still be those big brown eyes . . . watching her suspiciously. With a man this smart and sexy questioning her cover, the bad guys are the least of her problems. Beau Ruston knows Elle is a government spy, and he doesn't like to be spied on-or lied to, no matter how charming the liar happens to be. Wait, did he say \"charming\"? Damn hot is more like it. He should know, chemistry is his business, whether it's in the lab or in the bedroom, but the reaction Elle is setting off might be too much for even him to control . . . \"Monroe writes with a flourish the type of lovemaking and desire that women can truly appreciate\". -Romantic Times on 3 Brides for 3 Bad Boys\"Monroe's exciting romance is a great read\". -Booklist on Ready\"Lucy Monroe is one of my favorite writers\". -Lora Leigh",
