  "description": "A lunar cruise ends in disaster after a moonquake sinks the cruiser Selene beneath a sea of liquid-fine lunar dust on the Moon's Sea of Thirst. Facing enormous environmental barriers, the rescue team finds their courage, ingenuity, and resources tested to the breaking point-as trapped passengers and crew slowly run out of time.Originally published in 1961, A Fall of Moondust was nominated for a Hugo Award for Best Novel-and was the first science fiction tale chosen as a Reader's Digest Condensed Book. Informed by the most current scientific knowledge of the time, A Fall of Moondust is a realistically-conceived and gripping story of human resourcefulness and triumph in the face of nearly-insurmountable challenges.",
