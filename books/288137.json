  "description": "SWEET CURVES FOR THE ALPHA COP An Alpha Older Man, Younger Curvy Woman Romance  Morgan Life as a bakery shop owner is sweet, but not as sweet, and deliciously sinful, as the hunky cop who melts my heart. As soon as I see him I’m instantly attracted – much like the instant attraction my loyal customers have for my yummy chocolate muffins! Tall, dark, handsome, and ripped to the bone, Officer Connor is easily the hottest man I have ever seen.  When my business is broken into one night, he goes above and beyond the call of duty to make sure I’m okay. What I never expected, though, was what his style of police protection would entail. Not that I’m complaining!  Connor Most people in the small town of Lakewood would probably say that the nicest thing about Morgan Summers were her calorific cakes. But I’d say it was Morgan herself. Curvy, beautiful, sassy and smart, she’s the most beautiful woman I have ever met. From the very first moment I saw her I knew she’d be mine – all in the sweetest of ways, of course!  This is a Steamy, Sweet, Short Story Romance. No Cliffhangers, mild drama, and a Happily Ever After. If you love short romances with insta love, hot love scenes, and a sweet story, then this one is for you.",
