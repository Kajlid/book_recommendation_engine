  "title": "Why People Love God but Hate Church?",
  "description": "This book is a summary of my dissertation research on why church attendance has declined over the last 40 years. My research included personal interviews, questionnaires using SurveyMonkey, and written statements from church members and leaders, those who stopped going to church, as well as people who never went to church and will not join a church. Various reasons were indicated as to why people did not go to church, but an unexpected finding from my research was that people still loved God, studied the Word of God, prayed often, and developed alternative methods of worship and spending time with God outside of traditional church services. The purpose of the 3-staged study was to determine if there are causes and effects that compel people to stop attending church services. In this book you will discover ways to help reverse the trend of empty seats in Christian churches on Sunday, improve perceptions about Christians among the general population, and save souls for Christ.",
