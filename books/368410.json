  "description": "Someone was terra-forming Venus and it certainly wasn't anyone native to the solar system! First Lieutenant Sybil Hunter was dispatched with her crew to discover what was going on. She'd expected the possibility of being shot down if it was aliens, as everyone thought. She'd expected the possibility that her and her crew might be taken captive. She hadn't expected to find herself sleeping with mankind's enemy, but from the moment she met Commander Anka l'Kartay, she was mesmerized. How could the perfect man she'd waited for all her life turn out not to be a man at all, but a feril, an alien, perceived by everyone but her as the enemy of mankind? Rating: Carnal, adult situations and language. Genre: Futuristic Romance.",
