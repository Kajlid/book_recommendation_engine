  "description": "A lifetime ago, he was my world.But then I ran, and swore I’d never return.Never is a long time.Growing up, it was never a matter of if when it came to Garrett Finnegan-- but when.From the moment I met him, I knew I’d met my perfect match. My soulmate. In a split second decision, however, I let that perfectly paved future of ours slip away, and I said goodbye with nothing more than a hastily written note, stained with my tears. It’s been eight years since I’ve been back. Eight years since I’ve faced the consequences of that decision.Eight years since I’ve felt his lips on mine.They say everyone deserves a second chance, but how could I seek forgiveness knowing the truth of what happened all those years ago will only destroy us in the end?",
