  "description": "“In the dark of the night desire burns and temptation lures. But it is in the harsh light of day, when the time to face the choices made presents itself that you see what a person is truly made of. In the fleeting moments where wrong faces right, will pride be your saving grace – or your downfall?”  The mismatched trio discover a place of sanctuary embedded within the heart of the sturdy mountains where the blessed Luminous once roamed. The dwelling is guarded from the evil malice of the Shaded by the Heavens promise. However, the assured absence of the Shaded does not mean other beings will not hunt the world far and wide. It is this probability that cements the three, forcing them to accept each other not only as constants, but to work together for the wellbeing of not only the mystical, but for all of humanity. A war is brewing and Myla is the undefined variable no one can predict. With both the blood of the Shaded and the Luminous pumping in equal portions through her veins, she is fighting a war of her own. Emotions are running high and Shaded cravings are plaguing at her mind, tickling her senses, and teasing her desires. All the while the Luminous will holds strong to her consciousness. But when a new threat and temptation breaks through her trembling resolve, will Myla continue to stand strong for the path she knows is right or will she cave to her cravings and entertain the ways of the Shaded?",
