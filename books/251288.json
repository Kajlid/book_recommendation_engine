  "description": "An enchanting biography of J. M. Barrie, the man who created Peter Pan and his Lost Boys“For an insightful exploration of Barrie and the boys who inspired him, nothing rivals [this book].”—Norman Allen, Smithsonian MagazineJ. M. Barrie, Victorian novelist, playwright, and author of Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn’t Grow Up , led a life almost as magical and interesting as as his famous creation. Childless in his marriage, Barrie grew close to the five young boys of the Llewelyn Davies family, ultimately becoming their guardian and devoted surrogate father when they were orphaned. Andrew Birkin draws extensively on a vast range of material by and about Barrie, including notebooks, memoirs, and hours of recorded interviews with the family and their circle, to describe Barrie’s life and the wonderful world he created for the boys.Originally published in 1979, this enchanting and richly illustrated account is reissued with a new preface to mark the release of Neverland, the film of Barrie’s life, and the upcoming centenary of Peter Pan.“A psychological thriller . . . one of the year’s most complex and absorbing biographies.”—Gerald Clarke, Time“A terrible and fascinating story.”—Eve Auchincloss, Washington Post",
