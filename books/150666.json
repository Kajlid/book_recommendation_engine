  "title": "Muddy Men",
  "description": "Mamzer is trapped in an unending routine of a maddening workday, feeling voiceless and shattered. His son-in-law and young wife are dismantling what's left of him when he gets home. He realizes he’s a 30-something decrepit whose legacy will be buried under the weight of his insignificance. That’s the scenery under which Mamzer decides to turn the odds in his favor and leave his mark on the world by doing something… good.Muddy Men is the first short-story by Sam Knaip to be translated into English. Written in an offbeat, minimalistic style, this not-so-short-story renovates the dirty realism tradition, whilst keeping faithful to the genre expectations.Note: This book is not recommended for readers under 18 years old.",
