  "description": "In the realm of Celadmore, evil is stirring. The war torn land has not recovered from the last conflict as evil rises and threatens to ensnare the world of light. Venetia, favourite daughter of Queen Annalia, must fight enemies and allies alike. She must uncover truth amidst deception to discover the source of this new threat to her world before the darkness engulfs it. Four years after the Dragonian Wars raged across the realm of Celadmore, leaving it ravaged and ruined; Venetia, Queen of one of the five Anaguran tribes has seen evil lurking once more. She led the Allied Spirit of Celadmore to victory against the tyrant, Dragonious, but the world has changed. Politics, deception and mistrust have separated the old alliances so now each nation stands alone. It is up to Venetia to unite not only the five tribes of Anagura, but all the peoples of Celadmore to fight against an unseen enemy that threatens to destroy the peace that she has fought so hard to achieve.",
