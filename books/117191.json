  "title": "Further Still: A Collection of Poetry and Vignettes",
  "description": "Things Pondered was a different kind of Beth Moore book. It was a window into Beth’s tender and creative soul that before could only be viewed at her speaking engagements where she often shares her poems and short stories. The perennial success of Things Pondered proves that many continue to be moved by Beth’s reflections.Broadman & Holman is pleased to offer a second collection of Beth’s creative writings. Further Still once again proves Beth Moore a gifted, sensitive writer and poet.",
