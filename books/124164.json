  "title": "The True Patriot",
  "description": "Over the course of a generation, patriotism in America has been hijacked by the right and abandoned by the left. But the principles and values of true patriotism – country above self, contribution above consumption, stewardship over exploitation, freedom with responsibility, purpose through sacrifice and service, pragmatism, a fair shot for all – are inherently progressive. The True Patriot, written in the pamphleteering style of Thomas Paine (Common Sense), challenges progressives to reclaim patriotism – and spells out just how to do it. This powerful and timely \"little red book\" combines a manifesto, a ten-principle plan, a model speech, and a moral code. Throughout, it weaves between the words of the authors and excerpts from foundational American texts and speeches, as well as a parade of iconic American images.",
