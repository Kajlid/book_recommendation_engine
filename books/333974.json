  "description": "A WORLD TORN...To be forgotten was inevitable, but to forget was not an option. A world once forged in fire and ice was now nothing more than violence carved from myth, but when a legend resurfaces and threatens the makeup of magic, time, and morality, a group of mages must act before their world crumbles to ruin.A BOND TESTED...Cateline, a since forgotten princess turned amateur mage, and Varin, a warrior with no fight to lead, must band together and choose between two sides. To believe in and fulfill a prophecy was heresy, and could cost them the world as they knew it, but to side with humanity and prevent a war of supernatural powers was an impossible task.However passionately they may loathe each other, through their strife they find the line between hatred and love is thinner than they would have ever imagined.AND A LIAR EXPOSED...After surviving journeys of love, loss, and agony, this group of unlikely allies must decide the lesser of two evils and fulfill their promise. But, when a liar emerges, it pushes the boundaries of newfound love and resurrects dreadful rage that could turn the tides.",
