  "description": "“Love isn’t an emotion. Love is a promise.” –Doctor Who Cam My life has been one big broken promise. So I can’t risk putting my heart on the line. It’s all I have left. I’m safe behind my keyboard: working as a computer programmer, running VetNet, an online support group for military veterans, and gaming. Until West–a former SEAL and my gaming partner–begs me to meet him IRL (in real life). I didn’t expect to feel anything. But one look, one touch, and I knew I was in trouble. So I fled like a coward. Back to the safety of my job, and the deadline that could make—or break—my whole career. Problem is, he followed. “You are loved by so many and so much and by no one more than me.” –Doctor WhoWest On paper, my life looks great. Purple Heart, honorable discharge, enough SEAL missions under my belt to be a bit of a legend at the Naval Academy. But my quiet civilian existence isn’t all it seems. My business is tanking, and I can’t sleep more than a few hours before I wake up screaming. Sweating. Alone. And then I met her. Cam’s been through the kind of hell that only someone like me can understand. And though she hides her secrets behind a veil of sharp wit and a salty mouth, I see her. If only she weren’t so terrified of feeling. When I’m forced back into a life I thought I’d left behind, she’s the one thing I’m afraid to lose. But will she be there for me? Or will she let her past drive us apart?",
