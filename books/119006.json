Delderfield’s Avenue saga, set in an English suburb between 1919 when one war has just ended and 1940 when another has just begunIn the spring of 1919, his wife’s death brings Sergeant Jim Carver home from the front. He returns to be a single parent to his seven children in a place he has never lived: Number Twenty, Manor Park Avenue. The Carvers’ neighbor Eunice Fraser, at Number Twenty-Two, has also known tragedy. Her soldier husband was killed, leaving her and her eight-year-old son Esme to fend for themselves. At Number Four, Edith Clegg takes in lodgers and looks after her sister, Becky, whose mind has been shattered by a past trauma. No one knows much about the Friths, at Number Seventeen, who moved to the Avenue before the war. The Dreaming Suburb, the first novel in the Avenue saga that also includes The Avenue Goes to War, takes readers into the lives of these families as their hopes, dreams, and struggles are played out against a radically changing world.",
