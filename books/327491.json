  "title": "Henry VIII: Man and Monarch",
  "description": "The year 2009 marks the 500th anniversary of Henry VIII’s accession to the throne, and to celebrate this momentous occasion, leading Tudor scholars David Starkey and Susan Doran examine the extraordinary transformations—personal and political, intellectual and religious, literary, aesthetic, and linguistic—that took place during Henry’s reign. Drawing on the British Library’s unparalleled collections, Henry VIII explores the motives and beliefs that spurred Henry’s actions, masterfully telling the story of his reign. This refreshing approach reaches beyond the myths and stereotypes surrounding this monumental historical figure and encourages readers to reassess their perceptions of the great Tudor monarch who still manages to cast a spell over our imaginations. Richly illustrated with color images from the accompanying exhibition at the British Library—including many of Henry’s own annotated volumes—and including contributions from notable scholars such as Eamon Duffy and James Carley, this volume presents an unsurpassed firsthand outline of the revolutionary changes in ideas that took place during Henry’s reign—and above all, in his own mind.",
