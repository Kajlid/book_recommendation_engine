I'm trained in the art of persuasion and I love a challenge.But how can he know the answers to questions I haven't thought to ask? I’ve been putting out fires, fighting like crazy to get my life back on track. And this man? He acts like he knows who's holding the match. Maybe there's no such thing as mistakes. What if it's all just sabotage?Can be read as a standalone, but contains spoilers to Entangle.",
