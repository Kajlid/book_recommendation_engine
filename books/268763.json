  "description": "Learn to fight. Pass my trials. Stay alive.  As long as I can keep my supernatural origins hidden, my life is simple. It’s just my best friend and me against the world, eating dried Ramen and peas, watching reality TV, and laying low in the city that never sleeps.  That is until Draven, a dangerously attractive hunter, tracks me down and kidnaps me. He’s with the Obsidian Order, and he gives me a choice: join their ranks or die. All I have to do is pass a series of deadly trials, competing against a bunch of supernaturals who want me dead. Sounds easy, right?  There’s one problem with that; I have no memories of my past, which means I don’t have the skills to compete. Now, I have to learn magic—fast—because I’ve been promised my best friend will die if I fail, and if we both die, the secret we’re carrying could fall into the wrong hands.  Then it’s all over.  Wings of Light is a fast paced urban fantasy, with characters that'll make you laugh, gripping scenes that'll make you frantically turn pages to find out what happens next, and sizzling romance that'll leave you wanting more.",
