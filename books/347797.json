  "description": "Scores of missing mummies have turned up at the Museum of Legends and Antiquities, and her father has fallen under suspicion. Now, not only must Theodosia keep him out of jail, but she has unwanted mummies to take care of - and the Serpents of Chaos are back! What could they be up to? And there are all those bothersome governesses to deal with. It really is a bit much for one girl to handle. At least she has Sticky Will as her ally. Or does she? He seems to be keeping secrets of his own.",
