  "description": "Locked inside an iron mask by the King of the Fey, Sable Erwyn Sylvana has waited ten years for freedom—and to take revenge on those who cursed her. But with every second that passes inside the mask, her soul begins to fade farther away. The memories of her loved ones and her former life become a blur, and soon she cannot even remember her own name.As the princess, Avalon Edenstone knows how important it is to obey her father, the King of the Fey. So when she finds a mask while wandering the catacombs beneath the House of Ice, she knows exactly how much trouble she would be in if she took it—never mind agreeing to free the mysterious warrior whose soul is trapped inside it. But Avalon is more than familiar with how it feels to be trapped, so she doesn’t hesitate to help the warrior whose thoughts begin to accompany her own—and who has an uncanny ability to save her from danger precisely when she needs it.With the help—and muscle—of Hadrian Courts, the Captain of the Guard, Avalon travels land and sea, collecting seven magical jewels that have the power to undo Sable’s curse. But the king will stop at nothing to take back what was stolen from him through violence and vengeance. And as he closes in on them, Avalon discovers she is not only on the verge of losing her freedom, but also her life…as an ancient evil believed to be dead is stirring awake. One that could bring life as they know it to a sudden and terrifying end.",
