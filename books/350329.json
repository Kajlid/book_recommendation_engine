But Hana’s daily grind is finally going to change, thanks to the demon she’s purchased from the mysterious website Make5Wishes.com. At last Hana’s going to be popular, her parents are going to stop fighting, her world is going to be as perfect as she’s always dreamed. So how could Hana’s best-laid plans for happiness turn to tragedy? Perhaps because everything has its price. . . .“A disturbingly well-constructed comic [with] emotional depth.”–Ain’tItCoolNews.com",
