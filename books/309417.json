  "description": "It is on this theme of adjustment that Rod Waleman has based his new novel, The Stepdaughters. Although it is, in essence, the story of the love-starved, widowed Valerie, we cannot ignore the presence of her two beautiful teenage daughters, Ethel and Penny, both of whom are in heated competition with mother for the attentions of Valerie's new husband, Mark. When Mark's son by his first marriage, Neal, is brought to live in the household, Valerie realizes what is happening. It almost immediately becomes evident that Neal has some of his father's characteristics and attributes. Valerie, herself, fighting valiantly against her own hot, dark desires, is one of the first victims of Neal's strength and charm.",
