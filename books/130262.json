  "description": "Here it is at long last, Revs - book six in the ‘Memoirs of a Houseboy’ series.And they say miracles don’t happen. Ha!Revs isn’t about revelations in a grand sense, so don’t build your hopes up. There’s nothing biblical. I’m not a long-lost prince. I don’t have connections to mafia-style villains. There is no finding of ancient treasure or uncovering of plots to kill royalty and take over the world. My revelations are small fry. Basically, it’s just stuff, stuff about me and about other people too, though mainly about me, because I am that egotist, possibly even a narcissist, but nice with it. I wouldn’t personally harm a fly, not unless it harmed me first and even then I’d yell for one of the men folk to do it.Anyway. It’s stuff that happened ages back, stuff I couldn’t write about at the time for one reason or another: I was too close, too raw, too emotional and maybe just not mature enough.Read on, and if you don’t like it, then you’ve lost nothing but a few quid and a small portion of time.",
