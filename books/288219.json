  "description": "To rise from the ashes- first, you must burn. Once, I sold my deadly skills to the highest bidder. These days, I’m trying to tip the scales to my favor. Even out karma before it bites me in the ass.I’m a doctor, or what passes for one in whatever war-ravaged country I end up in. I treat the sick, saving lives, hoping that for each one I save, I'll be forgiven for the ones I've taken. But when I land in Chicago, and my path crosses an immortal god’s, my assassin’s skillset could be the only thing that tips this unholy war to our favor.Oh, the irony- I spend half my life turning over a new leaf only to discover it was a complete waste of time.",
