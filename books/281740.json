  "description": "In the wake of a high school massacre, a copycat shooter begins to stalk otherwise sleepy Franklin, Missouri, further traumatizing the community. Disturbed by these crimes, logistics manager, Jackson Warner, finds his way into an illicit chatroom ‘happydayz,’ dedicated to glorifying the killers. Jackson fixates on the young men’s disregard for life and suspects the copycat is among them. In his frenzy, will he mistake a troubled youth for one of possibly many shooters?  “Great plot…really well done…” Thomas Jones, British author of GAME THEORY",
