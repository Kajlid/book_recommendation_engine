  "description": "You will be scared. But you won’t know why…In this deeply suspenseful and irresistibly unnerving debut novel, a man and his girlfriend are on their way to a secluded farm. What follows is a twisted unraveling and an unforgettable ending that will haunt you long after the last page is turned. Jake and a woman known only as “The Girlfriend” are taking a long drive to meet his parents at their secluded farm. But when Jake takes a sudden detour leaving “The Girlfriend” stranded at a deserted high school, the story transforms into a twisted combination of the darkest unease, psychological frailty, and a look into the limitations of solitude.With remarkable, masterful skill, Iain Reid builds a plot that steadily crescendos into a harrowing ending—one that will have you at the edge of your seats and one that you will never see coming.Reminiscent of Jose Saramago’s early work, Michel Faber’s cult classic Under the Skin, and Lionel Shriver’s We Need to Talk About Kevin, I’m Thinking of Ending Things is an edgy, haunting debut. Tense, gripping, and atmospheric, this novel will pull you in from the very first page…and will never let you go.",
