  "description": "You know that perfect feeling? That life-is-good moment on the open highway with the windows down and the radio up, when the perfect song comes on, and you sing along with carefree, top-of-your-lungs abandon? When joy and contentment and life well up from somewhere deep in your soul? What if you could live that way? A 17th-century monk named Brother Lawrence figured out how, and wrote about it in the devotional classic, The Practice of the Presence of God . He found a way to connect with God moment by moment, to experience the joy of His divine presence every minute of every day - whether during deep, contemplative prayer or while washing a sink full of dishes. In God Is Here , Steve Case unearths that 17th-century wisdom and remixes it into a 21st-century guide to everyday life. With modern, thought-provoking essays drawn from Brother Lawrence’s original writings, God Is Here shows you how to connect with a God who’s always available. God is here.Connect.",
