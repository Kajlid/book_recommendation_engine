  "title": "Seven Forbid",
  "description": "Seven Forbid is a collection of short stories, a wickedly satisfying study in evil …Evil wears many faces in this chaotic world of ours.It often lives in the limelight, perhaps in the guise of a cold-blooded, haughty actress. At other times it can be less obvious, taking the form of a lustful old man, or his shallow, manipulative paramour. It is unnervingly close to us, evil, maybe even next door, where the neighbor is always drunk and his wife often sports a black eye.And sometimes—just sometimes—the façade of our daily existence is lifted, and the Devil himself makes an appearance …It would be wise to read these tales with the lights on.",
