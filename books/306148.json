From Earth, a lone cyborg is dispatched to solve the mystery of resurrection and quell all rebellion, but her journey beneath the pomegranate trees will lead her on a darker path, towards a secret that will undo the growing world beneath her feetGhanâ€™s tale is not a story but a journey to a place that is both dangerously foreign and familiar, a journey from which no one will return unchanged.",
