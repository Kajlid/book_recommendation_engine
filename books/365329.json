  "description": "This edition is no longer available.Dante knew Daniel was the man for him the minute he said his first curse word. He was everything Dante could ever want in a sub: gorgeous, spunky, and totally into the lifestyle Dante enjoyed most. But nothing's ever as simple as it should be. When Dante gets called away on business he expects to be gone for a couple of weeks. He figures to claim Daniel when he comes home, but two weeks quickly turn into six months.  When Dante finally returns, everything he'd been looking for in a mate is gone. Daniel's been assaulted and beaten by a Dom out of control. He no longer trusts anyone-including Dante.  Determined to find the man he knows Daniel can be, Dante moves Daniel into his home and his life. But along with Daniel's insecurities and lack of trust, Dante has to fight the Dom that assaulted Daniel in the first place and a host of other misunderstandings before he can prove to Daniel that what they have is worth fighting for.
