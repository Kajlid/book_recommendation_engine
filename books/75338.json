  "description": "Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for B0051BTWD4.Maggie decided to have an affair. No one needed to know, not even her lover. . . . Who would it hurt, if Maggie decided to carry on a torrid affair in her mind? It would soothe her feelings, hurt by her husband’s emotional abandonment while he worked on a disturbing new murder case. It would provide an outlet for the dizzying desire she felt for her employer. It would make her feel loved and appreciated and better able to be a good wife and mother. But Maggie loses control of the fantasy as lust becomes love, and things she believed confined to her own imagination are somehow known to her spectral lover. A harmless mind game spins out of control and threatens the sanctity of Maggie’s greatest treasure – her family. Part women's fiction, part suburban fantasy, and part psychological thriller, this unique tale is difficult to categorize. Women looking for a fresh voice in contemporary storytelling will enjoy the genuinely likable characters and an engrossing story that explores marriage, motherhood, morality and, ultimately, the nature of love.NOTE: Contains strong language and content. Not appropriate for readers under 18.",
