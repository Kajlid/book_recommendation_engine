  "description": "There’s never been a media disaster bigger than this.You may not remember her, but you know her all too well. Before, Olivia Ashbury’s name resonated globally through your YouTube pages, demolished primetime television and polished itself beside high-priced brands: until the unthinkable happened. Now it’s your turn to access the gated communities, live like an Idol and hold the behind the scenes information on the scandals Perez Hilton couldn’t attain and the Illuminati covered up. After premiering her debut TV show, Olivia is repeatedly attacked by her ex-boyfriend in the same fashion as her cult-themed show but quickly discovers college pranks won’t measure up to the truth. It’s with this series of memoirs that Olivia will begin to tell her journey from stardom to the downfall that leads her to question the throne on which she ruled. THIS IS NOT A SOB STORY defines the fear of \"sleeping with the enemy.\" And while everyone’s favorite Barbie Bitch may be a piece of art, the ugliness that founded the ultimate conspiracy theory will burn her Angel wings and ignite the true nightmare within. Who ever said heroines were pure?",
