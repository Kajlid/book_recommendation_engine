In the small town of Mystic Springs, only love and betrayal can show true character and the best signs are those hidden. Join April and Noah as they fight an unidentified evil who threatens everything they value.  Noah Easton, a Special Forces dragon shifter, escapes the torture of a hoard thief bent on stealing dragon hoard stones and their elemental power from the mages who possess them, but the situation becomes personal when the hoard thief targets April, the woman he loves. He must return to his hometown of Mystic Springs to protect his own hoard from a magickal threat he cannot identify before he loses everything.  April Easton is a modern day oracle. She reads tea leaves and just about anything else that can predict coming events. However, past abandonment issues make her resistant to reading her own signs. But when evil comes to Mystic Springs, April must face her biggest fears of abandonment and betrayal in order to save what’s most important to her. Only by studying the past and owning her future can she stop a magickal criminal who threatens to steal everything she’s ever loved and destroy the one dragon mage who holds her heart always and forever.",
