  "description": "\"My name is Rylee, and I am a Tracker.\" When children go missing, and the Humans have no leads, I'm the one they call. I am their last hope in bringing home the lost ones. I salvage what they cannot. \nA missing girl and a deadly item belonging to a power-mad demon need to be found before the killing begins. The problem? This is my first salvage. And I have no idea what Iâ€™m doing. These were the moments that began to define me, my skills, and my drive to face down the darkest side of the supernatural in order to bring children home. This is where my journey began... This short story precedes all the Rylee Adamson books including Elementally Priceless.",
