  "description": "The JACK CREEK Horror is an intelligent cautionary tale about a simple but exceedingly horrific organism. The story follows a small resort communityâ€™s efforts to make sense of increasingly strange changes in the eco-system of a large cedar swamp. What starts out as poor fishing and complaints from locals in an area that survives on tourism and sportsmen soon evolves into a wave of death with implications that stun the nation.",
