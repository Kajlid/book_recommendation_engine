  "description": "Brilliant, brave, controversial, combative, intellectual - just how do you become Janet Street-Porter? Born in working-class Fulham to parents who for years she refused to believe were really hers, Janet loathed her mother, tried to murder her sister, and had a friend who was given a life sentence for a contract killing. In a household subsumed with repressive 'Welshness' (even the budgerigar spoke Welsh), she found solace in unsuitable friendships and outrageous behaviour. In this mesmerising account of growing up in post-war London there is poignancy, mystery - and a trademark black humour. \"Baggage\" will touch readers at many levels; it is as edgy and fearless as Janet Street-Porter herself.",
