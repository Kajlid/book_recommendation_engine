  "description": "Admirers of the well-beloved Mr. Chancre Scolex should find reason to rejoice in Everything Can Be Beaten which, according to the author, is \"based on a completely fabricated true story.\" Mr. Scolex devoted his time and talent to writing Everything Can Be Beaten's compelling story, as well as to designing the book's unique layout and the appearance of its complex, multi-faceted characters. Matching Mr. Scolex's devotion to quality and artistry, Mr. Scrambly supplied colorful painted illustrations. These paintings vividly depict the story of IT, a hapless creature who breaks out of his monotonous existence to explore the realms that lie outside of the only room he has ever known. Bored of a life spent beating an endless supply of kittens, IT ventures outside and discovers a world entirely new to him. Though he is at first elated to find a place full of wonder and happiness, IT soon realizes that he can never belong in this welcoming, joyful land. \"Alone in paradise,\" he is despondent and depressed until he realizes that, indeed, everything can be beaten, even in this strange new world. Writing and layouts by Chancre Scolex (sometimes known as Jhonen Vasquez), paintings by Crab Scrambly.",
