  "description": "\"Really big trouble\" is an understatement these days. The war between the Yeerks and the Animorphs is full on—and it's definitely going to get worse. But Cassie, the other Animorphs, and Ax have a lot more going on than just trying to stay alive. Now they've got to actively protect their families and the free Hork-Bajir. And they no longer believe they can do it alone. The Yeerks are just too powerful.So Cassie and the others have to ask themselves a very important question: Is it time to increase their numbers? They all remember too well what happened with David—the Animorph gone bad. But this time do they really have a choice?",
