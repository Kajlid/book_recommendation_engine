  "description": "Michael Moore sizes up the new century - and that big, ugly special-interest group that's laying waste to the world as we know stupid white men. Whether he's calling for United Nations action to overthrow the Bush Family Junta, calling on African-Americans to place whites only signs over the entrances of unfriendly businesses, or praying that Jesse Helms will get kissed by a man, \"Stupid White Men\" is Mike's manifesto on malfeasance and mediocrity.",
