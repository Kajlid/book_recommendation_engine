  "description": "“One final fight to reclaim everything lost is my only hope in saving the demon everyone assumed would remain my enemy.” The end is near for me, Lexianne Monarch. I can feel it in the depths of my veins, while my mind prepares for the physical, emotional, and mental constraints that would do everything to prevent my King from losing this battle that is inches from being won. Enemies will rise to the surface. Allies will sacrifice anything to get me to that sacred spot that holds the very key to the valley. And I’m destined to succumb to the hands of my Alpha savior, all in hopes of giving the crown of domination to the rightful owner of Demon Valley Pack. As the current Ruler of Demon Valley, it’s up to me to finish what we started, and no matter the blood, sweat, and tears, I vow to unleash the true villain deep within. To reveal how deadly a pretty little monster can be when betrayed. It’s time to show this sinister world that two can play this game called survival. Let the final round begin.",
