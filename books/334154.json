  "description": "The first new English translation in sixty years of the most important Cuban novelist of the twentieth century's rousing historical novel about a French pirate who led the campaign to take back the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe from the British, featuring a new foreword by Alejandro Zambra When he arrives in Cuba at the close of the eighteenth century, Victor Hugues, a merchant sailor from Marseille, brings with him not only the idealism of the French Revolution but also its ambition and bloodlust. Landing at the Havana doorstep of a trio of wealthy, eccentric Creole orphans, he sweeps them across the Caribbean Sea to Guadeloupe, whose enslaved Africans he frees only then to exploit them in his fight against the British for colonial sovereignty. What ensues in Alejo Carpentierâ€™s swashbuckling, magical realist masterpiece is an explosive clash between the New World and the Old World, and between revolutionary ideals and the corrupting allure of power.",
