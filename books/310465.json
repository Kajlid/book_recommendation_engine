But for the first time in my life that protective streak extends outside a hockey rink.  Because the second she walks through the stadium doors she’s mine.  All I can think of, all I want to do, is wrap up this little girl in my arms and shield her from the dangers of the cold, harsh world.  My game might not be up to par lately, but suddenly that slump I’m mired in doesn’t seem to matter.All that matters is her and keeping her safe. Making her mine. It’s as if the rest of the world doesn’t even exist, as if she’s the sun in a sea of clouds.  She’s a special snowflake all right, the most special in all of eternity. And she will be mine. This is a short, steamy \"daddy-lite\" romance with some daddy elements, but it is not a spot on ddlg story. No OM / OW drama and no cliffhangers. Always a sweet HEA.",
