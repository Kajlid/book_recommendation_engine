  "description": "The Germans had television in the early years of the Hitler regime. Now see what happens when TV changes the history of Nazi Germany and World War Two! The BBC has lured the Marx Brothers away from America to London so they can perform a variety show each week that's transmitted all the way into Berlin. Their producer is the young, hard-drinking, womanizing Dylan Thomas, who goes from hating foreign politics to being obsessed with stopping the Nazis. Meanwhile, on the night of the Reichstag Fire, young English correspondent George Orwell manages to explore the ruins and makes a startling discovery: the burned bodies of five men handcuffed together, one of them a Brown Shirt and another a high-ranking army officer. Orwell has to team up with a roving band of pirate signal broadcasters to expose the truth about the fire-and the secret of a terrifying new weapon in Nazi hands. Espionage, murder, sabotage and betrayal. They'll all be exposed on Reich TV, culminating in the most sensational trial of the century.",
