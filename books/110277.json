  "description": "Katrina Turner is on the run for her life. On the run from him. What better place to hide than on a sprawling mansion overlooking the ocean in beautiful Bermuda. Isolation, silence, and high security – the mansion sounds too good to be true – and unbeknownst to Katrina, it is. How long will it take him to find her and drag her back to her hellish past? Secret Service Agent Cole Nielsen is being rewarded for a year of nose-to-the-grindstone work. Guarding The Secretary of State and his family at a luxurious private mansion in Bermuda is a perk, but Cole soon realizes the reward is more like a prison sentence. Saddled with a cranky veteran agent and confronted by a feisty staff member with the most beautiful jade eyes Cole has ever seen, this assignment can’t be over fast enough. Katrina and Cole soon put their differences aside when her life hangs in the balance. Cole quickly becomes her protector and takes care of her abuser permanently. A complacent level of relaxation soon surrounds the mansion, but the serenity is short lived as a group of gun-wielding men take the dignitary’s young son hostage. Cole and Katrina must work as a team to rescue the frightened boy from certain death.",
