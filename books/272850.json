Herein are the answers for everyone with an interest or reason to learn the techniques to regress themselves easily and safely. We can just travel and explore anywhere that we choose for no other reason than we want to.

Are you living your best life? Can you imagine it? Would you know if you were? If you are struggling or suffering, the solutions to heal are within you and with guidance from this book many answers can be found. Another rather cool thing is that you don't need to have a problem or any issues to be able to retrieve your memories from the past or to explore your possible futures. Desire is more than enough of a reason. After thorough explanations of the whys and wherefores, the author will share the regressions carried out specifically for the book but also others already done.She will include hers, including one where she murdered an irritating husband and another during which she had an accident performing on a stage that resulted in her having intermittent stage-fright in this life - all sorted now. The stories range from profound healing experiences and phobia release to funny spontaneous memories that her clients, friends and strangers have shared. Not everyone is interested in any kind of verification as just the knowing or the changes they experience is enough. However, for those who wish to research their memories this book will enable that with a step-by-step how to.",
