  "description": "River is the charismatic lead singer of Caged Hearts and it's an open secret that the vibrant energy he displays on stage doesn't bleed away as soon as he's out from under the lights. That sometimes causes considerable friction with his bandmates.Jeff is the guitarist for Caged Hearts, but he's not your typical party-hard rockstar. He's far more focused on taking care of everyone in his band--especially River.An offhand comment from Jeff inadvertently helps River discover his submissive side, and he asks Jeff to help him continue to explore those desires. While Jeff is turned on by the idea, he's also reluctant. There's no telling what it could do to the band and his friendship with River. Especially when Jeff wants so much more than just sex.",
