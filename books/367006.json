  "title": "Driven: An Autobiography",
  "description": "When he was sixteen years old, Larry Miller came home one summer night to find all his possessions sitting in three bags on the porch of his darkened house. The door was locked. From those troubled and humble beginnings rose a man whose influence has touched, according to reliable pollsters, more than 99 percent of the population of Utah as well as myriads of people worldwide. Seven months before Miller passed away, he began working with Doug Robinson on this biography. Written in first person, the book talks about the many facets of Larry's life and legacy and speaks candidly about the people and experiences that influenced him. It doesn't just tell Larry Miller's story, it shares lessonspainful as well as joyful lessonshe has learned from his experiences. This fascinating and inspiring biography includes:• A moving foreword by Utah Jazz great John Stockton• An epilogue written by Gail Miller, Larry's wife• Numerous photographs• A firsthand look at the incredible breadth of Larry Miller's work and contributionsin business, in sports, in the arts, in his support of the Joseph Smith Papers Project, as well as his personal humanitarian service• A full section addressing the question Larry was most often asked: \"How'd you do it?\"",
