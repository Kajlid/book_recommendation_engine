  "description": "Stories of Music explores the incredible ways in which music has impacted people's lives, from its role in healing, community, and family relationships to musicianship, travel, and much more. Bringing together the works of more than 40 authors and artists from 11 countries, the book features poetry, nonfiction, photography, audio, and video (the print book includes URLs and QR codes that direct readers to a free companion web edition for accessing audio and video components). Readers will learn how rock and blues music helped to heal the war-torn country of Bosnia, about the tradition of candombe drumming in Uruguay, and about the history of musicians who travelled on foot—from the balladeers of Victorian England and the Delta bluesmen of the early 20th century to present day musicians who participate in the Massachusetts Walking Tour. Along with these and other stories, the book includes photography from around the world, poetry readings, and original music, including a song that was performed to honor first responders at Ground Zero.The book was compiled and edited by Holly E. Tripp, and also includes a foreword by Dan Cohen, MSW, Founder and Executive Director of MUSIC & MEMORY℠. Ten percent of book proceeds will be donated to Hungry for Music and Music & Memory.
