  "description": "Ember relies on two things in her life: Cleanliness and order. Owing to a traumatic childhood, she’s got OCD and clings to control, doing her best to avoid people and men, in particular.When a handsome stranger named Aimes Padmoore comes to her cartography office in Sweetland, claiming he needs her help deciphering a map that belonged to the Blue Faerie, Ember wants nothing more than to assist him and send him on his way.What she’s not counting on is another meeting with the young man who, this time, brings a friend—the prince of Sweetland—Blake Nonpereil. And Blake is just as handsome as Aimes, which causes Ember quite a bit of angst because both men are nothing but trouble as far as she’s concerned.When Aimes and Blake declare their wish for Ember to travel with them while they attempt to recover yet another map, she staunchly refuses. But when a third man gets involved, Vaughn, he forces Ember’s hand by targeting her where she’s most vulnerable—her family.Forced into traveling with all three men into the Anoka desert and beyond, Ember finds she might end up needing them just as much as they need her.",
