But the vengeful ghost of Rebecca, Maxim's first wife, continues to cast its long shadow over them. Back in England after an absence of over ten years, it seems as if happiness will at last be theirs.But the de Winters still have to reckon with two hate-consumed figures they once knewâ€”both of whom have very long memories...Rebecca was Daphne du Maurier's most famous and best-loved novel.
