  "title": "Travels with Tyler: A Mom's Journey with Her Aspie Son",
  "description": "Thirteen years after Tyler is born in the idyllic Swiss village of St. Aubin, his mother decides it is more than time to take him back to his home country, as Tyler likes to think of Switzerland. First, though, they will travel through six other European countries and Tyler will see (well, it is his mother's hope) that there is more to her than a stressed-out working mom; underneath is the adventurous traveler of years gone by, just waiting to get out in the world again. So off they go, mother and special-needed son, as Tyler puts it so beautifully, leaving Northern Virginia behind for a month of exploring Europe by train, bus, and foot. They sweat and shiver, laugh and argue, get lost and get lost again, all the while making memories. This is the story of an Aspie and his mom seeing part of the world and finding their place in it. Come join their journey, where Asperger's becomes assburgers and there is never a dull (or quiet) moment.",
