  "title": "Robert Burns: The Tinder Heart",
  "description": "Attitudes to sex have changed since Burns' time, passing through the prim, censorious 19th century, to move slowly towards the more open attitudes of the 21st. In writing about Burns, his women and the influence of love on his poetry, biographers have followed the mores of their own day, rather than his. Consequently, for two centuries his sex life has been denied and glossed over, even though it was the real catalyst for so much of his poetry and songs. In all this the real Robert Burns has been lost. This title aims to explore the life of the real Robert Burns.",
