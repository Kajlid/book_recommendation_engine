  "description": "Greg Johnson retired at 40 from a Greenwich, Connecticut hedge fund. He thought his life was as close to perfect as it could get. He had millions in the bank, he had a great home, and he was engaged to Cindy, a beautiful woman who seemed to love him. Greg is devastated when Cindy breaks off their engagement. He became an emotional wreck, finally adopting an old Labrador Retriever to help him cope. Florida Atlantic University Professor Frank Weber, a chronic womanizer who is also Greg's best friend, convinces Greg to start over in the Sunshine State. After buying a home near the ocean in Delray Beach, Greg manages to be reasonably happy for more than three years. A health scare and the announcement of Cindy's imminent wedding combine to push him over the edge. Greg is in complete despair when he has an unexpected visit from Ali, his gorgeous 21 year-old neighbor who lives with her overly protective father. Ali has come to Greg for help in finding her friend Michele, a radical environmentalist who has recently gone missing. Ali believes a shady politician is connected to her friend's disappearance. With seemingly nothing to lose and the inability to say 'no' to his stunning neighbor, Greg agrees to help. While he welcomed a task that gave him a sense of purpose, Greg has taken on much more than he ever imagined.",
