Yet nothing prepares him for the chemistry when he helps Joanne into his truck. She’s curvy, blonde, and vulnerable—a three-alarm warning to do the right thing and keep her at arm’s length.Still keeping watch over her through the night sounds reasonable. Until she awakens, and desire burns reason to a crisp…Warning: Contains explicit sex scenes that may be too hot for summer reading.
