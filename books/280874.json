  "description": "Evan Eldridge never meant to be a war hero—he only wanted to fight Napoleon for the future of his country. And he certainly didn't think saving the life of a peer would mean being made the Earl of Whitelock. But when the life you save is dear to the Prince Regent, things can change in a hurry.Now Evan has a noble title, a manor house in shambles, and a stranger for a bride, all thrust upon him by a grateful ruler. What he doesn't have are all his memories. Traumatized from wounds incurred on the battlefield, Evan knows there's something he can't quite remember. It's important, dangerous—and if he doesn't recall it in time—will jeopardize not only his new marriage but someone's very life.Readers who enjoy Julie Klassen, Carolyn Miller, and Kristi Ann Hunter will love diving into this brand-new Regency series filled with suspense, aristocratic struggles, and a firm foundation of faith.",
