But Jess is waging a personal war, too—to save the tiny shred of soul she has left. If she loses, so does the city...New York City is in the grasp of a deadly, unseen enemy. But Lieutenant Jess Vandermire, New York City police officer, is uniquely specialized to recognize and fight this threat. It’s her job to forge a black ops team—a team that is tough and, if need be, expendable. Jess understands what she’s fighting and what’s at stake. For her, it’s all about retribution...until she recruits ex-cop John Brittain...Suddenly, her priorities aren’t quite so easily definable. John Brittain has a chip on his shoulder and is as strong as they come. But is he ready for the whole truth? That combating “super” vampires whose primal need for blood and the addictive drug “Sunshine” is only the beginning of their problems?Because Jess has a secret. And when John finds out, will he stay and fight with her? Or will he realize that she’s the enemy, too?",
