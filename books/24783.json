  "title": "Spectatorship: The Power of Looking On",
  "description": "This book cuts a lucid path through the debate on spectatorship. It revisits the classics of Hollywood; explores films beyond the mainstream, such as Dogme 95; and shows how cinema makes a spectacle of the everyday while turning the spectacular into something commonplace. It also muses on the consequences of our sharing in or witnessing the private or intimate acts of others and our enjoyment of events that often represent a gross break with legal and social mores.",
