The village itself is currently in turmoil over a genetically modified crop growing in a nearby field and sinister doubts are being expressed over its supposed government licence.  The Sci-Med Inspectorate send Steven Dunbar to investigate. His search for the truth soon gives rise to the horrific suspicion that the rat incident - one of several in the area - might be connected to the GM crop.
