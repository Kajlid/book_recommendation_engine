  "description": "Months have passed since Jere and Wren first came to peace with their new life together in the slave state of Hojer. Jere's clinic has succeeded perhaps too well, leaving both men exhausted and stressed. When Jere goes looking for a new slave to help with the business, Wren objects vehemently. He doesn't want to risk the exposure of their secret relationship, much less the forbidden gift he's only just learning to control. || Worse yet, the new girl, Isis, is nothing but trouble. Battered, broken, and rebellious, she won't even let Jere heal the most basic wounds left from years of abuse by her previous masters. When Isis lands them all in legal trouble, Jere can no longer afford to ignore the realities of being in a slave state. The three of them will have to work together to fight back. Can Jere confront his public role as a master and still be the submissive partner Wren loves so dearly? (M/M)",
