  "title": "The Richest Heart",
  "description": "Emiline Elmwood dreams of being a fair lady. She longs for drama, fashion, cities and fancy tea parties. But as a twelve year old farm girl in the late 1800's, those things seem to be out of her reach. Meanwhile, a mystery begins to grow as she and her best friend find the ruins of a burnt house hidden in the forest. Unraveling the story of a family quarrel and a fatal tragedy, she searches for clues and answers. Who had lived there? What had happened? Had anyone survived? Her dramatic quest and imaginative dreams carry her away. Could the town gossiper, Mrs. Bufford, be her only hope of finding answers? And when all of her dreams seem to come true, will she really be satisfied? Or will she discover that contentment comes from a simple life, and that the richest heart is the one that is full of Christ's love?",
