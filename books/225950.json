  "description": "Teaching Molly Desiree Holt Molly Gerard is facing her mid-forties divorced, unfulfilled and wondering if the things she reads in her erotic romances could actually happen to her. When she meets Nick Trajan, the first thing that comes to mind is wow! The second is the recognition of the ten-year difference in their ages. When she accepts an invitation to spend the night with him, she wonders how she'll compare with younger women, but the night is so erotically satisfying she tries to push the thought from her mind. Nick is immediately taken with this lush, mature woman whose appearance belies her inexperience. He wants more than just the one night with her, but Nick lives the D/s lifestyle to its fullest. When he introduces Molly to it, will she run?",
