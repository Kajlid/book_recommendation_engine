  "description": "Cat lovers everywhere will wryly recognize their own lives in these whimsical vignettes. Worshipped since ancient times, cats are fickle, capricious and fiendishly clever. Oh, did we mention \"vain,\" \"elegant\" and \"charming\"? Life has got to be on their terms or not at all. These willful creatures are masters of our homes, our wallets--and our hearts. By treating us with casual indifference our feline taskmasters keep us in our rightful place. We're just here because someone has to buy the catnip and pay the astronomical heating bills. Call a dog, he'll come running. Call a cat, he'll probably take a message and get back to you later. There's so much we can learn from our feline friends.",
