  "description": "Jarby is in love. He wants to marry the charming but penniless barmaid who works at his uncle's inn, but his uncle won't tolerate True Love without a matching dowry. So Jarby follows a tattered map to the fabled Star of Jolanest, a lost treasure that will provide all the dowry his beloved barmaid could want. Riding his randy dragonhorse, carrying his disenchanted sword and accompanied by an accident-prone stableboy, Jarby sets off on a journey dogged by surprises and giggles.",
