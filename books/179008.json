  "description": "In 1798, Charles Roworth published his first edition of The Art of Defence on Foot with the Broadsword and Sabre, uniting the Scotch and Austrian methods into one Regular System. Although not a fencing master himself, Roworth's book provides an easy-to-follow system for a student of the broadsword or sabre. His instructions are clear and presume no prior knowledge of the sword; the book works well for beginners, yet even experienced swordsmen will benefit from Roworth's explanations of and rationales for techniques. This facsimile has been recreated from the original treatise owned by the Academy of Historical Arts in Glasgow. Each page has been photographed carefully and edited to provide an exacting reproduction of the highest quality. Additionally, the work includes a biography of Charles Roworth by Keith Farrell, and a brief essay by Ben Kerr on the Long-S character found within the original printed text.",
