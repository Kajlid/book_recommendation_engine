  "description": "When Sarah Kane's first play, Blasted, was staged at the Royal Court Theatre, London in 1995 it was hailed both as a \"masterpiece\" and as a \"disgusting piece of filth\" (Daily Mail). That play, and the others that followed, have been produced all over the world. This anthology includes Kane's never-before-published Channel 4 screenplay, Skin. Complete Plays include Blasted, Phaedra's Love, Cleansed, Crave, 4.48 Psychosis, and Skin.",
