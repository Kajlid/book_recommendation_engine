  "title": "Age of Reptiles: Tribal Warfare",
  "description": "Thundering herds of lizards roam Cretaceous America, and the earth trembles with their passage. Enormous yet graceful meat-eaters shred the still-living meat from the bones of placid plant-eating saurians. Tyrannosaurus rex, the most fearsome carnivore that ever lived, is king. But even T-rex isn't safe from the greedy eyes and the ravenous appetites of a band of bird-quick Deinonychus. A tale from an age before humans and language, Age of Tribal Warfare is a 128-page epic told entirely in pictures. Ricardo Delgado, production artist for \"Star Deep Space Nine,\" has crafted the finest graphic novel about dinosaurs ever released.",
