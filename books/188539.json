Aided by his band of scruffy irregulars -- \"the Boys,\" a team of residentially challenged connoisseur of inexpensive spirits -- Leo remains Seattle's most unorthodox p.i. Now, SLOW BURN ignites the fuse on the most combustible entry in the waterman cannon. Anticipating disaster, a prestigious global restaurant convention hires Leo as Special Security Officer. His monitor the movements of two adversarial steakhouse competitors whose \"beef\" has previously made for some nasty confrontations and a food critic who's caught in between the warring factions. Leo sends the Boys off to shadow all three parties and report back to him. But even the simplest of plans can casade into catastrophe. And Leo soon finds himself served up as the prime suspect in a murder...realizing that both his life and career are at stake.",
