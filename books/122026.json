  "description": "An American Demon is Jack Grisham's story of depravity and redemption, terror and spiritual deliverance. While Grisham is best known as the caterwauling front man of the pioneer hardcore punk band TSOL (True Sounds of Liberty), his writings and true life experiences are physically and psychologically more complex, unsettling and violent than those of Bret Easton Ellis and Chuck Palahniuk. An American Demon documents a youth rebellion that changed the world, told from the point of view of the American punk movement.",
