  "description": "Man has turned his back on his brothers and a war, unlike anything anyone has ever seen, rages out of control. The knowledge and desire to broker peace has been lost and despair grips the population; still their remains the faint Shadow of Hope.  Adam Carson, a young man orphaned by the atrocities of war, has only one person left to turn to—an ancient mystic woman plagued by visions and intuition—his grandmother. With her guidance, he discovers that the heart of a warrior beats in his chest as he struggles to save the earth from destruction in the worst war humanity has ever endured.",
