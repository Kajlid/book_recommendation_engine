  "description": "‘A superb read … brilliantly chronicles the incredible passion, poignancy, and nail-biting excitement in pulling off one of the most inspiring animal rescue stories of all time.’ Graham Spence, co-author of Babylon’s Ark, The Elephant Whisperer and Saving the Last Rhinos‘One of those rare, true stories that gives a voice to the people swept up in events larger than themselves … If I had not seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn’t believe any of it either.’ Lieutenant Colonel William Sumner, U.S. ArmyImmerse yourself into the humanity and brutality of an unshackled post-invasion Baghdad. As the desperation of tigers, lions and a sun-roasted pelican inspired compassionate American soldiers, Iraqis and mobilising foreigners to improvise audacious animal rescues, the city simmered, then boiled. The Accidental Invasion of Baghdad Zoo is not just a zoo story. The addictive chaos of Baghdad comes to life through uplifting missions, tragedy and unshakable camaraderie, suicide bombings, unexpected comedy, Iraqi hospitality and political adventurism. For a year, abandoned palace menageries, Green Zone politicking, raw violence, Saddam Hussein’s stolen Arabian horses, wounded bears and checkpoint puppies spiralled the recovery into animal welfare theatre",
