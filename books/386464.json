  "description": "Poetry. LGBT Studies. Like Tennyson's In Memoriam, Teare's book sees within a personal loss evidence of an epochal shift at work, a shift at once historical, political, and cosmological. Asserting the lover's body as a lost Eden, revisiting again and again the narrative of \"the fall\"--its iconic imagery as well as Gnostic reinterpretations--the book also records the eventual end of mourning and a return to the ecology not of myth but of the literal weather and landscape of California. The book is haunted throughout by the task of \"writing the disaster\" of AIDS; its lyrics link emergency to inquiry in an attempt to make a memorial \"in language sufficient/to pain: not in itself the world: the thought of it.\"",
