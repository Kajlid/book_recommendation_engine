  "description": "It’s easier to move a mountain than escape the past. After the ultimate betrayal results in the death of his lover, Jamie Mainwaring looks to the past for answers, and discovers his entire life is a lie. When uncovering the truth leads to a more devastating loss, there’s only one place he can turn for understanding. When former-detective Remington left the police department, he never looked back. Now, his glory-stealing ex-boss is dead, leaving Remy’s real name scratched in the dirt at the brutal murder scene. Two years ago, Miguel Rojas left New York in the back of his best friend’s car, in real danger of falling victim to the same addictions that left his twin sister in bed with the drug lord he’d been deep undercover investigating. When she shows up looking to make amends, misplaced guilt mixed with curiosity open old wounds. While Remy returns to his police department roots to track down a killer, Miggy and Jamie team up to find the bones from Miggy’s past and bury them once and for all. The truth shall set you free—except when the past is determined to claim you.",
