  "description": "A highly charged fiction debut about a young woman in India, and the love that both shatters and transforms her She is twenty, restless in New Delhi. Her mother has died; her father has left for Singapore.He is a few years older, just back to India from New York.When they meet in a café one afternoon, she—lonely, hungry for experience, yearning to break free of tradition—casts aside her fears and throws herself headlong into a love affair, one that takes her where she has never been before.Told in a voice at once gritty and lyrical, mournful and frank, A Bad Character marks the arrival of an astonishingly gifted new writer. It is an unforgettable hymn to a dangerous, exhilarating city, and a portrait of desire and its consequences as timeless as it is universal.",
