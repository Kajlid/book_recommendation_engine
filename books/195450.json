She is often seen sitting on this very chair. And it is said that the chair is always found in front of the mirror no matter where you leave it.”  Rohan Agarwal has been appointed the manager of a play, and how excited he is to work with Chandni Joshi – his childhood crush, and unfortunately, his senior! A happy-go-lucky high school boarder, he has his fun with his friends, enjoys the odd sport and does not think twice before raiding his warden’s office to leak question papers. Then, one misty night, he sneaks into the infamous Green Room; and there, he finds something that wasn’t meant to be found…  Mysterious happenings in the Green Room begin to follow.

Something terrible had happened in the Green Room the first time around, or at least, that’s what the stories said. And yet, Rohan finds, the old stories turn out to be true.  And then, he learns a dark secret the school had been hiding…",
