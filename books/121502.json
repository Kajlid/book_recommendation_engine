A memory triggered, deep in her hindbrain - the disappearance of a childhood friend; no warning, no explanation.Detective Andrew Ryan is working a series of parallel cases: three missing persons, three unidentified bodies - all female, all early-to-mid teens... Could Tempe's skeleton be yet another in this tragic line of young victims? Or is she over-reacting, making connections where none exist?Working on instinct, Tempe takes matters into her own hands. But even she couldn't have predicted the horrors this investigation would eventually uncover... Can Tempe maintain a professional distance as the past catches up with her in this, her most deeply personal case yet?",
