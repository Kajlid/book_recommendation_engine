  "description": "The man had secrets...Blindsided by a hurricane, Katie Flynn was seeking shelter from the storm - but all she found was a moody, broody recluse named O'Neal. Trapped with him in his house on a windswept cliff overlooking the wildly tossed sea, Katie tried to fight the feelings O'Neal awakened in her - both of sensuality and fear. She began to suspect that something haunted the tall, gray-eyed man's domain, something more than the wicked servants or family ghosts...something strange that only O'Neal himself could reveal.",
