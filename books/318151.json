  "title": "Stepbrothers' Darling",
  "description": "Life is never what you expect it to be. I never thought I would end up here, moving halfway across the country on my mother's whim, and then I meet them… My new stepbrothers. Cyrus, Bray, Asher. Sin incarnate, dangerous, dark and deadly. Everything I crave in a man, but they are off-limits and they make that perfectly clear. However, when my past comes back with a bang, the rules begin to mean nothing and lines start to blur. The only way we will survive this is together. They are my Crew and I’m about to be their Darling. Screw what people think, I’m going to make them mine. *This book contains dark elements which some readers may find triggering. All characters in this story are over eighteen and all sexual interactions are fully consensual.*",
