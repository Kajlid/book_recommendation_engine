Wild and sexy is his type, like the dream-girl he caught a glimpse of years earlier he’s never forgotten.Cynthia’s superpower is invisibility, especially with men. It’s better for everyone that way. Besides, she’s got a cat. She’s okay. But when playboy-rancher Chad hires her, she’s got a chance to shine. Professionally, at least.

Princesses glow in the starlight, princes appear out of nowhere, and, sometimes, they look a lot like cowboys…",
