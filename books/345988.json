  "title": "Charley's War, Volume 1: 2 June â€“ 1 August 1916",
  "description": "From renowned UK comics writer Pat Mills (Marshal Law, Slaine) and legendary artist Joe Colquhoun (Johnny Red) comes a truly classic piece of graphic storytelling, by turns thrilling, horrifying and deeply moving. In 1916, Charley Bourne lies about his age to enlist and fight on the battlefields of France. But thoughts of glory and patriotism are swept aside by the bloody artillery barrage of horror and needless sacrifice amidst the trenches of the First World War. Rich in the detailed minutiae of the terror-punctuated existence of a Tommy, Charley's War features a brand new introduction and director's commentary by Pat Mills, a cultural history of the comic, and an essay on the Battle of the Somme.",
