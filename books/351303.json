  "title": "A Paramedic's Story: Life, Death, and Everything in Between",
  "description": "Welcome to the life-and-death world of an EMT€”sometimes bloody, sometimes even funny, but always compelling. When someone dials 911, Emergency Medical Technician Kelly Grayson is there€”to restart the heart that has stopped beating, deal with dangerously high blood alcohol levels, or pull a body from a mangled car wreck. As an EMT, Grayson sees people at their best and worst, in situations that can be gruesome, moving, and heart-breaking. Regardless of the emergency, Grayson is the first line of defense, picking up the pieces and saving lives€”or, sadly, watching them slip away. A Paramedic's Story is bursting with stories that run the gamut from lighthearted to heart-wrenching. With his brutally candid style, Grayson gives readers his special insight into the human condition, and shows us what it feels like to hold lives in his hands every day.",
