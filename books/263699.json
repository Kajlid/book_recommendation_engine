  "description": "What was once reality now fills the minds of Eklean’s children as no more than fables. Despite his pointy ears, not even Devlyn believes that he is an elf; they have all passed from living memory into stories. At least, that’s what he’s been told his entire life, growing up as a ward of the abbey school of Cor’lera. One day, a silver-eyed woman with pointy ears tells him something very different and invites him beyond the village limits to discover the truth about his allegedly criminal family. Swept into a world of magic that includes dragons and a phoenix, Devlyn’s eyes open to a world he believed was a myth when shadows of the past reveal themselves once again.",
