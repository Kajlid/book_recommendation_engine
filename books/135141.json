  "description": "When Stormie Omartian was a child, her mother would lock her in a closet and say, \"You are worthless, and you'll never amount to anything.\" How did a young girl who grew up in an abusive home learn to overcome her past pain to find emotional wholeness as an adult? Lord, I Want to Be Whole offers seven steps that helped Stormie overcome clinical depression and live a more fulfilling life. She shows readers how prayer and the encouragement of Scripture can help them come to terms with their past. She also tells how to find deliverance from spiritual oppression and negative influences, learn to receive God's gifts and believe the good things God says about us, become aware of deceptions and misconceptions, and maintain emotional health by taking care of our bodies and being sensitive to what is happening inside us. Lord, I Want to Be Who helps those who are troubled by depression find emotional wholeness and become all God made them to be",
