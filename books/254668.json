  "description": "\"Beautifully crafted . . . this expertly characterized and tautly plotted story is an extremely impressive debut.\" — Publishers Weekly (Starred Review)When Esther Bailey boards the RMS Titanic as its first female officer, her welcome is lukewarm—and no one is more unwelcoming than her own mentor, Officer Wyndham Murdoch.His cool dismissal only turns colder once they set sail, with Esther’s short temper challenging his own. But as they begin to earn one another's respect, blurring the line between duty and attraction, she and Wynn find themselves questioning what matters most: their careers . . . or the feelings they’re hiding from each other. As the tragic fate of Titanic unfolds around them, will they overcome the odds together and live to see daylight?Blending fact with fiction, On the Edge of Daylight is a slow burn, heart-wrenching historical love story between two officers who were never supposed to fall for each other.",
