  "description": "Sion was 15 when his parents separated. That was the time they told him the truth about his birth. His real father was a Jesuit priest. His parents' marriage had been arranged to shield the Church from scandal.That was also the year when Sion 'came out' and promptly got expelled from his Catholic boarding school because he was a bad influence, and besides he told the truth too much.Sion was lucky to have a friend in this stormy period of his life, a man ten years older than Sion, who loved him and comforted him and guided him. He would have risked imprisonment for it today, but Sion still remembers him with love and gratitude.So this novel is in part a coming-of-age story, and in part a protest against the plague of sexual orthodoxy that has descended on Western society. They tell me my writing needs to carry a moral health warning. Read at your peril.",
