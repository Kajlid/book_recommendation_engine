  "description": "As a child, we all have fears of the strange and unexplained, from monsters under the bed to strangers looking in through open windows to ghosts running through our houses. One of the most common fears we as children tend to have is that of a monster dwelling within our bedroom closets, waiting to come out and feast on our bones.For Nancy Rice, that fear strikes close to home as her daughter Felicity begins having unwarranted and unexpected nightmares about some unseen force in her room. Felicity, a four year old girl who behaves like a twenty year old, is suddenly afflicted with nightmares about a bloodthirsty creature in her closet, and Nancy and her husband Timothy are at a loss as to what could be causing their daughter's nightmares.One night, her daughter's nightmare suddenly begins to become a reality, as a mysterious voice and strange sounds begin to emit from Felicity's bedroom. What can you do when an unseen, unknown force invades your home? How do you stop a creature born of darkness and made out of the stuff of nightmares? That is the story and theme explored in writer Anthony Avina's latest short story, Bedtime. With an afterword and author bio included, the latest story comes just in time for the Halloween season, and is a must read book this fall. The tale is so creepy, so disturbing, that you'll be looking suspiciously at your bedroom closet for weeks to come.",
