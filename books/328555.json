  "description": "Two best friends grow up together, fall in love, get married, and live happily ever after. But what about the one where the girl gets friend-zoned after an awkward attempt at making a move on her best friend?That’s my story.More than a decade has passed, and while our platonic relationship somehow survived, I still cringe when I think about it.Like now.I’m supposed to be getting my hotel ready for all the guests from the St.Patrick's Day parades, but instead, I’m staring at my best friend while he repairs one of my sinks. The memory and sting of his polite rejection years ago usually helps get my head on straight, but it’s not working this time. Not when there’s been an obvious shift in the air.And definitely not when he just grabbed onto my hips, growled in my ear, and told me to run.",
