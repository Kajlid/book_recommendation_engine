  "title": "Undercover Cat",
  "description": "For 30 some years, a goodly part of the world has taken to its heart the annals and antics and love of the Randall family--which includes a cat-person variously called Pancho, Darn Cat and, affectionately, D.C. The story began when D.C., after prowling through the neighborhood, scratching on doors and begging for hand-outs, returned home one night with a wrist watch about his neck, placed there by a bank teller taken hostage by a couple of desperadoes. Twenty-three-year-old Patti Randall, a model, calls the FBI, and agents place D.C. under surveillance. They theorize that the cat will return to a place where he had been treated well. Their job is complicated by a younger sister, who \"falls\" for one of the agents, a brother, 12, who sets off rockets, a gossipy neighbor woman, a quick-tempered young attorney who lives across the street, and an assortment of escapades that the FBI Academy at Quantico had never prepared its agents to handle.",
