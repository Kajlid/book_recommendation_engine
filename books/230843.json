  "title": "Seven Years with the Indians",
  "description": "When the Ainsleys joined the westward expansion of the U.S. in 1862, they could never have imagined the heartbreak awaiting them. Settled in the beautiful Yellowstone Valley and building a new life, their daughter Lillian was taken by Indians. For seven years, Lillian lived with the Nez Perce, until her childhood friend, Mathew Bently struck out into the wilderness to find her. His adventures and hers are the true story told here in this long out-of-print book. Every memoir of the American West provides us with another view of the westward expansion that changed the country forever. For the first time, this volume is available as an affordable, well-formatted book for e-readers and smartphones. Be sure to LOOK INSIDE by clicking the cover above or download a sample.",
