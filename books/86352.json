By the time he is finished, his victims are left as willing receptacles for demons yet to come.Since she was four, a demon has been the only constant in Leora Desmond's life.

She wants Dolan, and she won't be dissuaded.A mistake brought Dolan to Leora. A promise bound him to her. Returning once again to ask for his freedom, he is faced with Leora demanding to be his next conquest. The ultimate retribution would be to take from her the ultimate symbol of her selfishness.Now, Dolan must decide if he can doom her to life in living hell or face his own set of unearthly consequences, while Leora must choose between her pleasure and her heart.The Promise blurs the line between good and evil, desire and love, and promises and commitment.\"",
