  "description": "An earl and an artist walk into a bar, and the barman says—never mind. They’re in a church, and they’re married now. Oops.My name is Evangeline Astley, and the only thing you need to know about me is that I never imagined this was how my life would go.I was supposed to devote all my time to painting gorgeous things to eventually open my own art gallery. Instead, I spent it all trying to sell my art to save my parents’ hotel.Cue the Earl of Anglesey and his not-so-stunning idea.Matthew Bennett needs an heir to the earldom, but for an heir, he needs a wife. And I’m the one the extremely eligible bachelor has chosen. Except I’m just as marriage-phobic as he is, so naturally, I refused—until he gives me an offer that I couldn’t.If I agreed to marry him, provide an heir, and divorce amicably in due course, he would save The Fox and Hound hotel that I love so much.That, ladies and gents, is how I became the Countess of Anglesey.The one thing I didn’t count on, however?Falling in love with my husband.",
