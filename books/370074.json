  "description": "The one true constant in the void that separates worlds is the never-ending hostility between humans and void-elves. Greedy, long-lived, and bent on domination, the only sure thing Dexter can count on is that elves can not be trusted. Or at least not until he ends up taking one on as his arms-mistress. At one anotherâ€™s throats as often as not, Dexter and Jenna, a banished elven princess, learn the true measure of each other while fighting pirates, liberating slaves, and facing the perils of sailing through the void.Voidhawk chronicles the adventures of a man who seeks the things that many of us want most in independence and freedom. Set in an atmosphere that spans science fiction and fantasy genres, Dexter Silvercloud acquires the Voidhawk, an abandoned void-ship requiring repairs. With ship in hand Dexter acquires a crew one misadventure after another. Aside from Jenna and his best friend Kragor, Dexter has to rely on the likes of a former bandit, a forgotten slave, a dispossessed wizard, a cursed priest, and a few outcasts from society to form the core of his crew.",
