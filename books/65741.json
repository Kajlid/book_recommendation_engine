  "description": "Come for a visit to Karsten Field with these Biblically inspired stories of home and family. Best-selling author George Michael Loughmueller goes back to Karsten Field for a new series of short stories. Each story in the series takes place in the district where Allan Howarth was set free. Almost eight years after his journey began, Allan and Mary now have two children, Benjamin and Ruth, in their Amish Home. Attainable has a simple message. It is about the strength of our beliefs. Ben Abrim tells young Ruth a story that bears a strong resemblance to the story of David and Goliath. It is not a tale of defeating an insurmountable enemy. It is about faith and finding answers in unlikely places. Because we have faith does not mean all of our problems will be solved. It means that we are not alone in solving our problems. George Michael Loughmueller is a descendant of German heritage. Finding joy in being a husband and father, he is known by his friends as “Laughing George” because of his cheerful disposition and the pronunciation of his last name. Born in the Midwest, George has spent time both in Omaha, Nebraska and Des Moines, Iowa. He works in retail, but has long had the dream of being an author. With the support of family and friends, George decided to write a story inspired by his grandfather. “Set An Amish Journey” is a work of fiction. However, some of the events are based on facts and stories told by George’s late father about the unusual life of his grandfather. In George’s mind, the fictional church district of Karsten Field is set in the small communities of eastern Iowa.",
