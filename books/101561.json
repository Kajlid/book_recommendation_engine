  "description": "Some SpecOp assignments are more fun than others...Â Matt Coleman. Task Force Zeta's computer expert. Certified genius. Dateless loser. He's getting damned tired of watching his teammates pair off, while the only thing he's had his hands on lately is a computer keyboard.Even Sam, the Omega team's communications guy--who Matt only knows through daily instant messages--is going on missions while Matt sits home, bored and jealous. Until he finally gets a shot at an assignment in Dubai.As the only female on Omega team, Samantha Foster isn't surprised that the mission to Dubai is all hers. After all, only a woman can infiltrate a modern-day harem to ferret out a terrorist-minded mole. The big surprise is when she's sent along with a guest's dinner as dessert--and finds Matt on the other side of the bedroom door. After he gets over the shock that Sam is a woman, Matt is more than happy to help her in any way he can. In the shower. In the bed. Oh yeah, and on the computer too.  What happens in the harem doesn't always stay in the harem.",
