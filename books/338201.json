  "description": "What is destiny? Is it friend or foe? Is it even real? Well, aren’t these a bunch of unhelpful and existential questions? Nevertheless, there are a select few individuals who would willingly delve into those depths. But this story isn’t about those philosophical minds that are in search of stimulation. This story is about a pair of twins that would combat… No, rebel against their so-called Destiny. Having been born into a life of military service, Henn’Ris and her twin brother Jo’Ris must do the near impossible and live up to their empire’s expectations while relying on their unbreakable bond to drive them through adversity. Along this perilous journey across the cosmos, The Ris Twinz find themselves immersed in countless adventures and bizarre situations. And yet, in the end, they must face the truth that is their Destiny. The real question is will they succeed in their endeavor or will they simply be pawns to this enigma we call Destiny? “The bell tolls the loudest for those who are chosen for Greatness.” - King CDW A Conqueror’s The Dereliction of Destiny, is a tale that pushes the boundaries of one’s will to fight against the lines of fate written in stone.",
