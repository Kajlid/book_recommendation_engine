  "description": "Described by her critics alternately as the \"godmother of punk\" and \"rock and roll's poet laureate,\" Patti Smith is an American original. Her first album, Horses, was a landmark album of power, bravado, beauty, and grace. Its famous cover portrait, photographed by Robert Mapplethorpe, \"was the first to claim both vision and authority,\" wrote Camille Paglia. \"No female rocker had ever dominated an image in this aggressive, uncompromising way.\"Seven albums later, and a life punctuated by a long hiatus during which Smith raised her two children and suffered the tragic losses of her husband, Fred Sonic Smith, her dear friend, Robert Mapplethorpe, and her beloved brother, Smith is ready to mark her first fifty years on the planet with a book her fans have long awaited: the complete lyrics. With never-before-seen photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe, Annie Liebovitz, Kate Simon, and others, plus original artwork and text by Smith, Patti Smith Complete is a living commemoration of Smith's unique contribution to music and the empowerment of people through her message of work, love, and charity.",
