  "title": "On Perfecting Your Indian Summer: How to glow as an autumn rose",
  "description": "The best is yet to come - and it can be even better    Clarissa’s How-To books are aimed at a fairly niche readership, women of a fairly specific age: the autumn rose, the mature woman enjoying her Indian summer.  Whether you are single, married, or any variation in between, this one is on how to make the absolute most of being this gift from life - no longer young, not yet old.  There’s stuff you will know, and stuff you should know - some of it is a reminder, because you forgot, or didn’t realize it was important. It’s a very simple book, but it is for those who aren’t making the most of a wonderful time in their lives. The message, in essence, is that you are spectacular. Mature, mellowed, experienced, incredible. You just need to realize it, and stop taking yourself for granted.  There are sensible bits, and sections on quick fixes and healthy lifestyle, the fears that pop up around now, and the restless dreams and hopes, but most of it is about digging deep and changing the way you look at today and tomorrow – about enjoying this Indian summer to the max. It’s light-hearted, not a lecture, but the message runs through every page and if we work it through together, you’ll get there. You’ll like being there, it is a great place.",
