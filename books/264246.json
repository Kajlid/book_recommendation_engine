  "title": "Suspense in the Formula Story",
  "description": "Dove states that the purpose of this book is \"to develop a theoretical base for a critical approach to the interpretation of the formula story.\" Such an approach should take into account the relationship between author and reader that determines such tacit agreements as the two axioms of formula fiction, the reader-knowledge convention, and the signals that pass between author and reader. Specifically, the chief concern of this book will be the criticism/interpretation of the mystery.",
