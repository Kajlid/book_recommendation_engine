  "title": "Continent of Mothers, Continent of Hope: Understanding and Promoting Development in Africa Today",
  "description": "Cutting through the Western media's stereotype picture of Africa as a continent wracked only by civil conflict and AIDS, Torild Skard has written an engrossing introduction to a continent in change. Based on her extensive travels through the region, Skard combines eyewitness accounts, lively description and deeply informed insight to portray the human reality of Africa today. With honesty, cultural sensitivity, and a commitment especially to women, she frankly describes the social, health, and other problems experienced by its people, but also the sources of hope for the future represented by courageous individuals, community-level projects, and programs being implemented in the region.",
