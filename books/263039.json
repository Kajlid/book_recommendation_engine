And then he crushed me.Twelve years later he’s back in town and there’s no way I’ll fall for that sexy southern drawl, irresistible smile and all that charm.No matter how well he fills out a pair of old faded Levi’s.Maybe it’s the taste of bourbon on his lips that burns so good. But the bourbon holds a secret igniting a firestorm neither one of us can stop.Now Brant is risking his legacy, his family, his heart—all for me.",
