By twelve, he was stealing, fighting, and drinking. These infractions led to incarcerations, escapes, and recaptures; auto thefts; and robberies. At age seventeen, he chose his senior yearbook picture from behind bars.Despite attempts to work, attend school, and maintain a relationship, drugs and alcohol always led him back to crime. He realized the pattern was related to the phenomenon of becoming \"institutionalized.\" Some guys he met in jail weren't interested in getting out. They had given up, but Gary decided to break the mold.Blessings in Disguise is Gary's story of choosing again and choosing differently. His recovery began when he successfully completed a two-year academic program at Camarillo State Mental Hospital and began working in the Acute Psychotic Intervention facility for adolescents.Some of Gary's discoveries, including his creativity and spirituality, turned his life around. With help, Gary found enlightenment is the epitome of life's experiences and that God really does not make mistakes. Most of all, Gary found reasons to live when he really needed reasons.",
