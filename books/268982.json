She’s cold, ruthless, and powerful, however she’s not invincible and someone is out to prove that.Now Blue is forced to work with the man who put nearly half a dozen bullets in her just a few weeks ago and a stick in the mud law enforcement agent, neither of whom she trust. If she wants to survive, she must put aside her pride and trust issues before the people she cares about join the string of bodies appearing in Lobrooke.",
