  "description": "More than one thousand years before Luke Skywalker, the galaxy is enveloped in a dark age when an ineffectual Republic has abandoned entire systems to Sith control. A Jedi Knight on her first mission, eighteen-year-old Kerra Holt has joined a band of Jedi volunteers traveling behind enemy lines. She thinks she is prepared for anything, but when the mission goes awry and she is left deep in Sith space without any support or resources, Kerra realizes just how wrong she was... She is alone, unprepared, and stuck in a battle between two warring Sith brothers--but she can't abandon the mission or the colony that the Jedi came to help!",
