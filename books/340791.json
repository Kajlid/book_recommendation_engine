  "description": "It all starts with an assignment. Leon's \"gifted and talented\" class has to make educational videos for the sixth and seventh graders. Leon originally chooses \"sex ed\" as his subject in the hopes of showing a flash of boob. But as time goes on, his project starts to mean something. He wants to tell the younger kids that puberty is tough, but what they're going through is normal.After researching the avant-garde movement, Leon crafts his video in the style of La Dolce Pubert. It's deeply disturbing yet comforting.But when the gifted program's director sees it, she suspends Leonâ€”and he finds himself at the center of a townwide debate over censorship. Who gets to decide how far is too far?",
