  "description": "Julia's father has always taken his anger out her. But after a particularly nasty incident with him, she says \"no more\" and runs away to the one place she's always found peace and safety--the beach. In what should be her sanctuary, she stumbles upon another atrocity. When Julia sees greedy fishermen dragging a mermaid on board their ship, something fires up inside her and she springs into action. But Marella is not what Julia thought, and an unexpected friendship blossoms between them. Has Julia really saved Marella? Or has Marella saved Julia?",
