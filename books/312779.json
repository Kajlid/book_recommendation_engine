  "description": "For fans of scrupulously researched historical fiction, Tricia Goyer releases Dawn of a Thousand Nights . Following on the heels of Goyer's From Dust and Ashes and Night Song , readers journey with Dan Fletcher and Libby Conner, both U.S. pilots fighting in WWII's Pacific Theater. Fletcher is captured by the Japanese and is forced to endure the horror of the Bataan Death March in the Philippines. It is here that he encounters Natsu Hidiki, a guard whose nagging conscience won't let him ignore the human degradation in which he is participating. Libby Conner is a WASP (Women's Air Force Service Pilot), who ferries military planes between Hawaii and the South Pacific. By the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, she has turned the head of Fletcher in no small way. Readers will be captivated by this tale of dignity and honor triumphing in the midst of a very dark time in history.",
