  "description": "Cajas de carton is the first title in the literary series Nuestra vision: U.S. Latino Literature, which features original works by Latino authors living and working in the United States. This work is the Spanish version of the author's award-winning collection of stories, The Circuit. Jimenez' 12 independent but intertwined short stories chronicle the experiences of a Mexican-American family of migrant farm laborers, as narrated by one of the children, Panchito. Unlike many readers for this level, which anthologize standard works, this book presents authentic, outstanding literature and themes that are highly relevant to native Spanish speakers in the U.S.",
