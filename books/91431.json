When Ilan mounts a rebellion against Rideon the Red Hand, the brigand camp is divided between those loyal to their old captain and those prepared to follow Ilan in a war against the mysterious magical raiders.Once again, Ilan’s powerful bow interferes with fate as the loyalties of her circle of companions and her own allegiances are put to the test. While the magic-wielding invaders terrorize the province, Ilan’s lifelong enemy, the Praetor, and her one-time friend Terrac lay a trap fit for a thief.
