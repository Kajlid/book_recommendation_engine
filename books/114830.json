Too bad her dual life doesn't come with an instruction manual. Just when she thinks that fate can't throw anything else at her, the Duchess Isobel is found on the brink of death and Miaâ€™s boyfriend, Jacoby, is the only suspect. Despite the suspicion surrounding him, Mia is sure of the innocence of the boy she loves and she is determined to prove it no matter the risk. The problem is, the one thing that could help save Isobel and clear Jacoby can only be found in the shadows of the Underworld--the last place in the universe Mia should ever step foot in.",
