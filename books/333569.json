  "description": "Explores the evidence for Jesus' resurrection and how that provides a rational basis for Christian beliefs. The resurrection of Jesus from the dead is an extraordinary thing to believe. Such a supernatural event is the stuff of make-believe, many think. Yet millions of Christians around the world believe that Jesus' resurrection was a real, historical event. Indeed, \"if Christ has not been raised, our preaching is useless and so is your faith\" and Christians are \"of all people most to be pitied.\" (1 Corinthians 15) In this concise book, respected apologist Rebecca McLaughlin outlines the evidence that Jesus really did rise from the dead and why it's the best news ever.",
