  "title": "Arachne Rising: The Thirteenth Sign Of The Zodiac",
  "description": "In his search for an all-water route to India, Columbus accidentally discovered America. Setting out to prove astrology an elaborate hoax, James Vogh discovered the thirteenth sign of the zodiac. His search took him from the Dgypt of the pharaohs to the Peru of the Incas, from the caves of Native Americans in the pre-Columbian Carolinas to the labyrinths of Minoan Crete. He examined artifacts, architecture, and poetry. To his surprise he found the claims of astrology withstood every effort to demolish them. And at the same time he discovered Arachne – the thirteenth sign of the zodiac. Arachne Rising, the meticulously documented log of James Vogh’s strange journey through the uncharted regions of mythology, archaeology, history, and language, will come to be recognized as a seminal work in astrology by those whose enthusiasm for the esoteric does not blind them to the need for sound scholarship, painstaking research, and rigorous application of scientific method.",
