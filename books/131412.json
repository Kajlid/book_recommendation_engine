  "title": "Six: A Biography",
  "description": "Eddie is a player, playing the field, chasing the skirts, looking to score, whatever you want to call it. His cute, crooked grin, his smooth, smooth patter, and his rake’s eye for just the right detail are all on display as he chats, flirts, and seduces his way through life, trying to find the perfect woman, and bedding them all along the way. On display, because now the last half dozen of his conquests are comparing notes, sharing their exposure to and their horror stories of their short-lived relationships with Eddie. And these are some pissed off women. This is the biography of a man as told by the last six women he slept with. Is this a guy you’d like to meet?",
