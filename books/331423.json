  "description": "Not long ago the world thought its superhumans dead after a great battle wiped out heroes and villains alike. Now, new heroes?and new villains? have miraculously emerged in the form of teenagers. The new heroes find themselves on the cusp of WWIII, caused by their very existence. One hero is torn between right and wrong as he falls under the spell of a former ally turned villain, while another must come to terms with his dark role in the battle, as predicted by Quantum?s prophecy years ago. If the planet is to survive, our new heroes will need to prove stronger than even they can imagine. The year of the superhero continues in this addictive thrill-ride that brings the traditional superhero comic book to a novel format in the most satisfying of ways.",
