  "description": "After a painful adolescence, Annie Kessler finds herself in an abusive marriage, that nearly takes her life. When her husband is sent to prison for good, she is finally able to start over. She finds a new job, new city - a new life. But quickly, she realizes her sense of security is false. Women around the state are being murdered at a very alarming rate. FBI Agent Shane McCann shows up on Annie's doorstep with a startling link to her past; the murders are tied to Annie's father, nefarious serial killer, Leon \"Alligator\" Graves, who has been sitting on Washington State's death row, for the past twenty-three years. According to McCann and the FBI, Leon Graves knows who is murdering these women but he refuses to talk until his last wish is granted; he wants to see his daughter. The clincher is that Leon is scheduled to hang in ten days. Suddenly, Annie finds her life unraveling yet again. Someone begins stalking her. Terror becomes her constant companion, as she is thrust into the center of a madman's sick and violent game, against her will. With only McCann at her back, she is forced to face the past she has spent her life running from, and the father she swore she would never lay eyes on again.",
