But now, far below the Cornish hills the deep magic is stirring again, summoning Arthur’s rivals to the contest for Cornwall’s crown.It’s time to get to grips with the challenges of time-travel (have you ever tried it?), and with ancient knights who really shouldn’t be around.On a Cornish path a tiny, green-stone dragon stretches a claw.In a churchyard a carved angel tests his wings while, out at sea, an emerald-encrusted pocket watch chimes once… and slips through time.Life is about to get interesting.Comero weeth – take care.",
