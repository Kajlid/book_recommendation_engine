  "description": "This book of short essays, each accompanied by a track on the enclosed CD, introduces the universal qualities of soundmaking and listening. Wide-ranging and accessible, themes include biology, personal reflection, deep ecology musings and social context; Dunn's sudden kernals of sythesis and insight show how sound offers connection with nature, and ourselves, in profoundly direct ways.",
