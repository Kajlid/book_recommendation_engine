  "description": "The Wedding Planner’s Rulebook:Keep the bride happy.Keep the wedding party out of trouble.Never let anyone know you’ve been in love with the groom for years.  I lived by these rules. Until Nate Kingsley. The Capulets and Montagues have nothing on the Beauregards and Kingsleys. Our families have feuded for centuries, and Nate was always forbidden—which made fooling around with him that much more delicious. But then I fell for him, and he fell off the face of the earth, ghosting me without so much as a goodbye.  Fast-forward two years: as an expert in romance, I’m a wedding planner to the rich and famous. I never expected Nate to show up at my office, least of all with a shiny new fiancée on his arm. She’s got money to burn, and she wants me to plan the most extravagant wedding of my career. It’s a make-or-break moment for my business. I convince myself I can do Nate’s wedding and keep my feelings for him in check, even if he does look good. Really, really good. But when the secrets we buried years ago come to light, what kept us apart suddenly binds us together. Even if my heart belongs to Nate, and his belongs to me, he belongs to someone else. And that’s a rule we absolutely cannot break.SOUTHERN BOMBSHELL is a full length, standalone romance coming to KindleUnlimited January 25, 2021!Amazon Pre-order is NOW LIVE!",
