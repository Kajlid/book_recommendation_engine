  "description": "Sometimes the road to revenge is filled with sorrow...and sometimes, it's filled with death.  Sam's hunt to find her mother's killer ends in Oregon when she and Bastien are confronted by an Elf asking the Elemental Witch's help in finding his lost King. Even as she and Bastien agree to help, more Elves invade Sam's shop making demands to see the Elemental Witch. Does the disappearance of this King coincide with the discovery of stone bodies in the city's park?  Returning to New Orleans is easyâ€”mending bridges isn't. As Sam and Bastien bring their Coven and Pack together to stop innocents from dying from an Elven Quest, they discover things are not what they seem, and the Dragon of Dreams returns in the ultimate showdown against Sam, and the Dragon she loves.  This is book 7 in the Eldritch Files.",
