Their reunion followed an encounter on 9/11 when an AP photographer captured Alex carrying Una in his arms while the ruins of the Twin Towers cascaded behind them. Years later, the city of New York wants to erect a statue depicting Alex’s now-famous rescue of Una. The only problem is Una has left Alex and moved to London. Alex wonders if Una’s charming boss has anything to do with her decision. He also wonders if Una ever found out about Rachel. Was Alex and Una’s love real or just a fleeting intoxication from being lauded as heroes? Can a celebrated couple reconcile who they’ve now become versus what the world wants to remember and forever cast in bronze? Alex embarks on folly-filled trip to London where unexpected encounters reveal the answers he seeks.This dark comedy is an examination of what happens when love gets tested by moral choices and impossible expectations.",
