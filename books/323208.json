  "description": "Dayven has passed the test he wanted most desperately to fail – he's been proven to have the powers of a wizard. He always swore he would never become one of the deceitful, disloyal sorcerers who alter people's true destinies, but now it seems he has no choice. The path that was once clear – his friendships, his future, his destiny – is now shadowed with dangerous twists and turns, and the world he knows must change forever.",
