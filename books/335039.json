  "description": "According to Grant Holiday there are two kinds of people in the world: those who follow the rules and those who should stay the heck out of his forest.Alone in the woods with forest ranger Grant Holiday scowling down at me is not the way I prefer to start my day. So what if he’s lean and fit and his eyes are this gorgeous shade of…It doesn’t matter because he’s making my tough week, heck my tough month, worse. It might be true I spent half the night at a campsite without paying, but I didn’t even sleep. Shouldn’t star gazing be free?But Grant insists on making me pay even though it’s his day off and I don’t have a cent to my name.When I get lost in the woods and Grant saves my life, I joke that our souls are now forever bonded. He doesn’t laugh. It’s not apparent he has a sense of humor.A smart woman would lie low, try to follow the rules, and avoid Grant Holiday, but he just keeps showing up and pointing out every rule I’m breaking, whether I’m rescuing an injured skunk or accepting a job at his brother’s bookstore.He’s the last person I want to see every day until… he isn’t.I’ve got trust issues, and he’s still in love with his ex. We should never work as a couple, but I can’t deny the attraction brewing between us. An attraction that might just go soul deep.",
