  "description": "Nineteen-year-old actress Dakota Summer was in desperate need of boundaries… until she met Morgan Fox and the bratty starlet found herself over the no-nonsense army veteran’s knee learning that naughtiness has consequences. Morgan’s firm hand proved to be just what Dakota had been missing in her life for so long, and they quickly grew close, first as friends and then as passionate lovers. Though she is now much more than just Dakota’s bodyguard, Morgan knows she must still guide and protect her feisty little girl, and when a stalker sends Dakota a cryptic, threatening note alluding to her brother’s tragic death in a car crash, Morgan decides to leave home for a while and take Dakota to meet her family. Dakota’s defiant behavior is at an all-time high in the days before their trip, and even when Morgan makes Dakota wear her cute little girl panties to keep the willful teen on her best behavior, she can’t seem to stay out of trouble. It soon becomes clear to Morgan that Dakota needs to know she will always be held accountable, and if that means a long, hard, bare-bottom spanking which leaves her sobbing and remorseful, then so be it. At the same time, Morgan realizes that in order to discover the truth about her brother’s death, Dakota must have the freedom to make her own choices about the investigation. Even as their relationship evolves, can Morgan and Dakota stand strong and discover the truth together? Publisher’s Note: Standing Strong is the sequel to Standing Firm. It is an erotic romance novel that includes spankings, sexual scenes, elements of age play, and more. If such material offends you, please don’t buy this book.",
