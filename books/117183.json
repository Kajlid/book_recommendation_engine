A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back. – Luke 6:38Merry Christmas to all my readers! Since I can’t send a Christmas card to every last one of you, I offer this in its stead—an Original Sinners Christmas story. Maybe your holiday season be filled to the brim with love, a good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and poured into your lap, and may your blessings outnumber the snowflakes and the stars put together. And if your love and your blessings are lacking this year, be a blessing to someone else for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.With Christmas Love and a Spirit of Good Cheer,Tiffany Reisz",
