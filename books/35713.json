  "description": "Seventy-six year-old identical twins Cate and Alice are no strangers to trouble [they drink copious amount of alcohol, outrun cops in their rusty old Bonneville and shoplift from CVS] but when Cate is diagnosed with lung cancer, the sisters face their most challenging battle yet. Cate [the “good” twin] slips fluidly from past to present, weaving a tale of sisterly love, family flaws and middle class memories that chronicles the twins’ upbringing in a city on the brink of destruction. Cate can only be considered the “good” twin because Alice is most certainly not. Born first, Alice has always been the adventurous one. Her saucy attitude and flirtatious ways make the boys in the neighborhood go all kinds of crazy, until she winds up pregnant at just sixteen years old. Raising a baby, dealing with long lost lovers, and navigating family dynamics are just some of the many complexities in this wacky, heart-breaking novel.",
