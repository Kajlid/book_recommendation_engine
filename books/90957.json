  "description": "Welcome to Merritt, Alabama, where summers are lazy, tea is sweet, and guests are always welcome.Thirteen years ago, Tolly Lee cost Nathan Scott his future in the NFL - and he’s never forgiven her for it. Tolly was only sixteen when she led college senior Nathan to believe she was older, but she never imagined he’d want to pursue a long-distance relationship. When he learned the truth, they both paid a heavy price…Tolly didn’t think she’d ever see Nathan again. Now that he’s returned, it’s only a matter of time before the good citizens of Merritt find out she’s the culprit who cost their hometown hero his future. When that happens, Tolly will lose everything. Again. Nathan wouldn’t have taken the job of high school football coach if he’d known Tolly was in town - but he can’t back out now. When an orphaned teenager needs mentoring, Nathan forms an uneasy truce with Tolly as they work together to ensure the boy’s future. But as old resentments resurface, so too do old attractions. After all this time, could the end zone finally be in sight?",
