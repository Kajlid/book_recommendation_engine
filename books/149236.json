  "description": "Cori knows her Xyran captivity has damaged her ability to trust, but when she meets Reiyn, desire flares despite her fear. He's clearly hiding something, but when a distress call sends them into space together, passion takes over.  Cori enflames Reiyn like no other female ever has. She threatens his control over his hidden Xyran heritage, but he can't fight his instincts. When his true nature is exposed during the daring rescue of a dying Xyran captain, will Cori forgive him, or will he continue his life's work alone?  Captain Kyuk welcomes death when his ship is destroyed. He doesn't expect to survive, but when Cori and Reiyn find him, instinct pushes him to live. He's spent years smuggling slaves to freedomâ€”can he now give up his own liberty to bond with Cori and Reiyn? Or is he too damaged to build that kind of emotional connection?",
