A month long, cross-country ride should do just the trick. One last check-up on her new cruiser has her tripping over her hormones while alone in the garage with the town's sexy bad boy, Ian Coghlan.Tattooed, pierced, and able to shape-shift, Ian will give her the ride of her life. Ian Coghlan knows he's nothing but disaster for a woman like Peyton. His place in the Wild Hunt and killer instincts have held him back from acting on a five-year attraction. When the curvy brunette responds to one tiny grin with a spark of interest, sockets fly out of the toolboxes and Peyton is knocked to the floor.That month of solitude she wanted just disappeared, but the consolation prize is looking pretty...damn...hot.With the magic of the Hunt in the air, Pixie pranks abound, and his old biker gang roars into the parking lot, dousing the heat in the garage with the cold dredges of mayhem. Peyton's life is on the line with his bad brothers' return to his world, and Ian has to decide if he can let her go or if he's willing risk her eternal hatred by changing her life forever.",
