  "description": "Will Thunder, one half of television's highest paid comedy duo Thunder & Lightning, is being held hostage in his own home by a masked woman with evidence that Thunder is a paedophile, rapist and murderer. She's streaming his torture live to the world and giving the public the chance to decide his fate, and they love it. Crowds are gathering outside and if she doesn't kill him, they will. Every channel has its own angle on the story, and they're not holding back. But who is she? Is she working alone? How is it that she has all of the evidence of Will Thunder's depravity? And how the hell has he been getting away with it for so long? All very valid questions, but they need answering quickly because today's news is very much Tomorrow's Chip Paper. Faces old and new explode onto the page in the second novel by Ryan Bracha, author of the best selling Strangers Are Just Friends You Haven't Killed Yet",
