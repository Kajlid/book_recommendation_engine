  "description": "As the prospective valedictorian, wide receiver and favored tenor in show choir, Jake knows he’s at the top of his game. He sets his sights on Lexi, the sweetest and hottest girl at Palmdale High and can’t miss. However, racing to class one morning, he plows into Penelope, the overweight new girl. Books and papers fly everywhere. He helps her with her things, even holds her hand so she can stand up. CLICK! Someone snaps a picture and sends the text all over school. Egged on by his friends and desperate to squash any rumors before Lexi gets back from Mexico, he pulls a juvenile prank. NOT his brightest idea. As punishment he must tutor Penelope three days a week. Her grade is now his grade. He sees his chance at a full ride scholarship disappearing faster than a missed field goal. And to make matters worse, Lexi sides with Penelope.",
