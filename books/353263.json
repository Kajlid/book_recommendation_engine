  "description": "Kate Mitchell notices girls in first grade, and despite the messages of the straight world, Kate's rebellious nature forces her not to comply. She finds herself in many memorable mishaps - she ruins a wedding, takes a girl to the middle school dance, and falls in love with her best friend. While growing up gay isn't easy for anyone, it's especially difficult for Kate, whose mother has a future in politics. Having a lesbian for a daughter may jeopardize Barbara Mitchell's chances at winning a legislative seat, but the antics of Barbara's brother, Kate's uncle, may collapse the whole family! Furthest from the Gate is a humorous chronicle of a woman's coming of age, her complicated relationship with her mother, and the responsibilities to family that last a lifetime.",
