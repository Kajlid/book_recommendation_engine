  "description": "EIGHT CHILLING WINTER MYSTERIES…from the new publisher Elm Books (http://elm-books.com & find us on Twitter @ElmBooks). The eight stories in this volume have been hand-picked to provide a taste of the many different kinds of stories that can be described as ‘mystery,’ as well as to form a harmonious and complimentary collection. Stories range from the cozy, represented by Cris de Borja’s A Theft of Teapots, to the ripped-from-the-headlines crime stories exemplified by Lee Mullins’ Burnt December. Sleuths also come in many forms: a precocious child, like the narrator of Death Benefits by Emily Baird; an unemployed person marking time on public transport, like the protagonist of Mark Hague’s In the Public Eye; Kirk VanDyke’s mountain cabin caretaker in The Afternoon of the Storm; or a quick-thinking assistant movie producer, like the main character of Wendy Worthington’s story, Snow in Winter.Also included are two excellent examples of supernatural mystery fiction for your reading pleasure, whether your tastes run to vampires (Christalea McMullin’s Club Pandemonium) or toward Native American legends come to life (Leonhard August’s Storm of Mystery.)Available in Epub, Mobi and paperback at http://elm-books.com",
