  "description": "How to Be Sick: A Buddhist-Inspired Guide for the Chronically Ill and their Caregivers is a life-affirming, instructive, and inspiring book about living gracefully and purposefully with the challenges faced by those with chronic pain or illness. These conditions, while not always life-threatening, are life-disrupting and stressful. The audiobook contains over two dozen tools and practices to help people live skillfully and to find equanimity and joy despite the profound changes in their lives. A recurring theme in the audiobook is that, although our bodies may be in pain or otherwise disabled, our minds can be at peace. The book is Buddhist-inspired but is non-parochial; it is intended to help everyone.Until she had to retire due to illness, Toni Bernhard was a law professor for 22 years at the University of California-Davis, serving six years as the law school's dean of students. She had a longstanding Buddhist practice and co-led a weekly meditation group with her husband. How to Be Sick won the 2011 Nautilus Gold Book Award in Self-Help/Psychology and was named one of the Best Books of 2010 by Spirituality and Practice. Her new book is titled How to Wake Up: A Buddhist-Inspired Guide to Navigating Joy and Sorrow. She can be found online at www.tonibernhard.comÂ©2010 Antonia Bernhard (P)2013 Antonia Bernhard",
