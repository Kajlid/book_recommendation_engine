  "title": "A Good Talk: The Story and Skill of Conversation",
  "description": "A GOOD TALK is an analysis of and guide to that most exclusively human of all activities-- conversation .Drawing on over forty years of experience in American letters, Menaker pinpoints the factors that drive and enliven every good the vagaries (and joys) of subtext; the deeper structure and meaning of conversational flow; the subliminal signals that guide our disclosures and confessions; and the countless other hurdles we must clear along the way. Moving beyond self-help musings and \"how to\" advice, he has created a stylish, funny, and surprising a celebration of \"the most excusively human of all activities.\"In a time when conversation remains deeply important-- for building relationships, for relaxing, even for figuring out who we are-- and also increasingly imperiled (with Blackberries and texting increasingly in vogue), A GOOD TALK is a refreshing celebration of the subtle adventures of a good conversation.",
