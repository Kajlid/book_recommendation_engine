  "description": "Now that her abusive ex-husband is out of her life, Sarah Richard is savoring her freedom. Surrounded by people who treat her and her babies like family, the three of them are thriving. Though occasionally haunted by nightmares from her violent past, she struggles to put it behind her. With a loving surrogate family, good friends, and a new career, all she lacks is a man in her life. The question is, will she ever be able to trust another man with her and her twin daughters’ hearts? Dr. Tanner Collins is running from his own sordid past. The man has left a trail of women from one end of Louisiana to the other, and through half the state of Texas. Even when this bad boy tries to be good, he has women throwing themselves at him at all hours of the day and night. When his admiration for Sarah turn into something stronger, he keeps his feelings in check, knowing he’ll never be near the kind of man she deserves. When Tanner rushes to Houston to be with his parents during his father’s illness, he’s forced to deal with hidden resentments toward his upper crust parents. At some point he accepts the fact that situations aren’t always as obvious as they seem on the surface. Note from the author:The Halos and Horns series is filled with new characters you’ll love, along with frequent appearances of old favorites from my La Fleur de Love series. Enjoy! ~ Lori Leger ~",
