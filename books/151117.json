  "title": "Unseen Rain: Quatrains of Rumi",
  "description": "Rumi's short poems have many tones and effects: some of them are quick, joyful, and whimsical; some are finely faceted abstract statements; some probe the inward space of patience and longing. Moyne and Barks translated these poems using a free-verse style, connecting these poems with great American spiritual poets such as Walt Whitman and Gary Snyder.",
