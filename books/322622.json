If you’re looking for a romance with a hero who has redeemable qualities and a strong heroine who rises from the ashes, then this book is not for you. Cruel God is a standalone romance with a happily-ever-after ending for flawed and broken characters. But if you expect a HEA with declarations of love topped with unicorns and rainbows, then again…this book is not for you.",
