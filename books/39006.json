  "title": "Butterscotch Blues",
  "description": "Sandy Hutchinson has skin so dark and chocolately brown, her friends call her \"the Black Diva.\" At the age of thirty-four, she and her three girlfriends have shared a tight bond since college, and been through the ups and disappointing downs of dating. With high aspirations about careers and love, they sometimes fell a bit short of their dreams, but nevertheless are always there for one another to offer sympathy and support. There's Martha Alston, a successful assistant district attorney, who has the beautiful apartment and luxury car, but is still missing the most important element---someone to love. Britney Weller, timid and overweight, wasn't certain if she would ever find happiness, but when Maurice enters her life, she wonders if this time love will treat her differently. Then there's Janice Duprey, vivacious, warm and giving, she foolishly wears her heart on her sleeve, hoping each time things will somehow turn out differently.Sandy wonders if love has alluded her as well, until the day she meets Adrian Burton, a Trinidadian with caramel skin, naturally wavy hair, and eyes the color of butterscotch. Sandy, plagued with low self-esteem since childhood, is dubious that he could be attracted to her. But Adrian is earnest in his intentions; he opens his heart and wins her over. Together they share a whirlwind romance filled with blissful happiness, until the night of a fateful call from the hospital and she learns of his ailing ex-wife. Now, Sandy must decide if her love is strong enough to help get them through what may be their darkest hour.",
