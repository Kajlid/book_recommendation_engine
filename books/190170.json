  "title": "The Dimension Next Door",
  "description": "13 original stories about the realities just around the corner...Movements glimpsed out of the corner of your eye, inexplicable sounds, knowledge for which there is no rational explanation, dreams that seem as real as our own everyday life-products of overactive imaginations, or unexpected glimpses into dimensions beyond our own? Join thirteen intrepid writers as they explore those unknown territories that may be found in any of countless Dimensions Next Door.From a Celtic knot maze that could trap an unwary archaeologist; to an Internet site that offers to bring karmic balance into one man's life; to a man bespelled to walk the future in the service of his queen-here are tales of the strange, challenging, and often wondrous worlds just waiting to be discovered by those with the ability to perceive them.",
