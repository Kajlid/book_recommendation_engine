  "title": "Fey.",
  "description": "Fairies disappeared from earth history around 1,000 A.D, and except for legends, were forgotten by humanity. Now, after the better part of two millennia, one is back. And where does someone look for a fairy, in the future? Perhaps… on a gambling casino space station? And look what a fairy can do there… \"Fey\" is a sometimes-whimsical, fun, and light fantasy/sci-fi adventure.",
