  "description": "Now that I've found my fated mates, things should be but we all come with secrets.Forging our relationships into a working unit and discussing our futures?That's a molehill compared to my sociopathic ex-fiance who's on the run.He wants to turn my world into an archaic hellscape for Omegas. And make bank off of us.A war is brewing between the factions, spearheaded by the man I hate most--and he's coming for us all.Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. This 40,000+ novel is Book 2 in a non-M/M, non-shifting Omegaverse trilogy with a cliffhanger but with a guaranteed HEA. There are dark, adult themes that may be sensitive to some readers including scenes of violence, war, and an independent woman who won't take on any more bullshit.",
