  "description": "Saucy, snotty, sassy, heartbroken, lovey dovey, mad, mush, poetry by Elizabeth Grace Jones Hell hath no poetry like a woman scorned. A collection of poetry great for post break-ups, fourteen year olds with glitter pens, people who need to loosen up and laugh, or people who need to listen to some blues music. Guys come and go... Which is a good thing because if they didn't we'd never have a single thing to write poetry about!",
