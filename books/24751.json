  "title": "The Wilderness War: A Narrative",
  "description": "The Wilderness War is the eagerly awaited fourth volume in Allan W. Eckert's acclaimed series of narratives, \"The Winning of America.\" The violent and monumental description of the wrestling of the North American continent from the Indians. Two hundred fifty years had elapsed since the Five Nations, the greatest of the Indian tribes, ceased their continual warfare among themselves and banded together for mutual defense. Their union had created the feared and formidable Iroquois League; their empire stretched from Lake Champlain, across New York to Niagara Falls. Theirs was a remarkable form of representative government that presaged our own, and their wealth lay in the vast, beautiful lands abundant with crops. As warriors they were unsurpassed - even the depredations of the recent French and Indian War could not diminish their prowess. But by 1770, the white men living in their land were fighting among themselves again, and war came once more to the Iroquois land.",
