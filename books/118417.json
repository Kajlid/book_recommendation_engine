  "description": "Corporate Survival - The Zombie Apocalypse is the second book in a series depicting the ongoing battle between survival and extinction after the collapse of the United States Government. The series allows you to follow along with a group of like-minded people who have joined together to form a corporation for their mutual survival.Unlike other nations that have collapsed in the past, the United States was different in one major way - over half of the population was dependent upon their government. Small family farms were all but extinct, giving way to Big Agra, leaving just three days of food in the pipeline for over three hundred million people.After the collapse of the Government, the “Free Shit Army” turned on their masters. Tens of millions of people found out that they were unable to provide for themselves after generations of dependency. When the welfare and handouts stopped, the FSA fled the inner cities, laying siege on those who were prepared and self-sufficient. Their hunger drove them like a swarm of locusts, laying waste to the countryside, devouring everything - leaving nothing in their wake - not even the dead.Their overwhelming numbers, combined with desperation to feed, proved too much for even the most hardened Prepper and it was only a matter of time before the Zombie Army reached the Compound at SURVinc.Corporate Survival by C.T. Horner, the first book in the series, is also available exclusively in the Kindle Store.",
