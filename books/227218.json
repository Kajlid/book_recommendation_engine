  "description": "Brianna: My life has always been a little ironic. I’m afraid of the dark, and I’m blind. My parents were my world, but they died in 9/11. I wouldn’t mind a relationship but men perceive me as a burden. So it shouldn’t have been a shocker that the guy I fall in ‘like’ with ends up being a top of the line player from the UK. It also shouldn’t have shocked me that the guy that was meant to be a sexy fling; just an erotic encounter to reminisce over, left me more than just a memory. He left me with a bump. That’s okay, because when life bitch slapped me into being blind, pregnant and single…I just called ‘plot twist’ and carried on. Besides, this little surprise in my belly is relying on me to get it all right. So do we really need him? Gabriel: Party, drink, sex, work, repeat. Sometimes I’ll throw sleep in there. Aside from that the life of a millionaire has brought me everything, but in the night is when I realize I still have nothing. Being a party animal might be frowned upon but it led me to her. She’s the most fascinating woman I’ve ever met and her body and flaming hair make me wild. Can’t trust women, though. That’s why I left. Best not to give women power, but now she’s carrying my child. Brianna’s unique, though. She doesn’t want my money, she wants my partnership. She wants to ‘co-parent.’ What the bloody hell is a man like me supposed to do with a child? I still live like one. So here’s my options. Persuade her to forget it.Walk away or Stay. But can I stay? Can I be the co-pilot she needs and the father our child deserves?",
