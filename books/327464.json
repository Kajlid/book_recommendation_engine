The king has sent out a call for a hero, the Chosen One, to defeat the Dark Lord in his dark realms and save the world from destruction.Lucia, an orphan, never imagined herself as a hero. But a king's order is absolute, and she sets out on an impossible mission alone.After a grueling duel in the depths of the Dark Lord's castle, Lucia is defeated by the godlike demon overlord and is given an ultimatum—\"kneel and become his Champion, or die.\"She grudgingly accepts his unexpected mercy, knowing that she has damned herself but vows to bide her time and take revenge. She swears he has not broken her spirit yet, even as she obediently does his biddings as his new Champion and serves in his bed.But the Dark Lord not only wants her body but also her mind, heart, and soul.The fate of the world lies in her hands—will she be able to resist temptation and finally rid the world of the Dark Lord? Or will she be wholly consumed by the ultimate evil?Author's Note: This epic dark fantasy erotic story contains dubious consent, first time sex, and male domination.",
