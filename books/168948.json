  "description": "Every night, when I go to sleep, I wonder if I'm going to see them, hear them, feel them. For thirteen years, my life was hell and now I'm just trying to keep all the broken pieces together so I can have a somewhat normal life. Then I had to meet him and everything changed.  Twenty-two year-old Jenna Lang is one of the best computer techs in Colorado, if not the country. Known for her eccentric appearance as much as for her intelligence, she keeps all of her secrets closely guarded, never letting anyone close. And no one has ever really tried. Not until twenty-eight year-old billionaire Rylan Archer decides to test the walls Jenna's put up, forcing her to wonder if maybe it's time to let someone in.  Don't miss Broken Pleasures, the prequel to M.S. Parker's newest dark and sizzling Pleasures series.",
