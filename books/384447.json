  "description": "Karen McQuestion deftly blends romance and comedy in this delightful romp where love is discovered in the most unexpected of places.When twenty-nine-year-old Lola Watson unexpectedly inherits a rambling house in the suburbs, she thinks her life just couldn't be more perfect—until her new neighbors make her their “project,” a heartbroken high school friend crashes indefinitely at her house, and her younger sister announces she's getting married, on Lola's thirtieth birthday. Suddenly Lola's not so keen on her newfound domestic bliss. But when she meets handsome, mysterious Ryan Moriarty, Lola dares to hope she's found the perfect guy to one-up her sister and add a little spice back into her life.This lighthearted romantic comedy from Karen McQuestion is headlined by a charming cast of characters, led by the self-deprecatingly funny Lola. Breezy and fun, Easily Amused serves as a gentle, often amusing reminder that love can often be found in the place we least expect—under our very noses.",
