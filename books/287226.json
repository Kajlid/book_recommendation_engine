He’s rich, beautiful and smart, and he summers every year on the same island with the same group of friends. Haunted by the ghosts of a tragedy that took place in his youth, Kyle is more sensitive than his privileged peers. He understands loss, and secrets.When he meets Jack Averill, a quiet, bookish boy, his fateful 18th summer on the island, Kyle attempts to integrate him into his tight-knit yet troubled circle while at the same time he’s pursued by another summer boy, and his best friend toys with the affections of an island girl. Amid mounting familial, sexual and peer pressures, all four young men make heartbreaking decisions that will steal their innocence, destroy lives and consume them forever.Until September is not just another coming-out or coming-of-age story. It’s an authentically emotional tale of obsessive first love with vivid, relatable characters who will take your breath away and break your heart. If you like Brokeback Mountain and Call Me By Your Name, you’ll fall in love with Kyle as he navigates his own summer of love.",
