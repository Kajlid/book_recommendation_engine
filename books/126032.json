  "description": "What’s better than one hot alien at your service? Two hot aliens in your bed. \nAfter four months of orbiting Earth in a spaceship bursting with sex-starved aliens, nurse Shelley Bonham will do just about anything to get off. The ship, that is. Not that the aliens aren’t hot enough to put her hormones on red alert. In fact, the more time she spends with the Garathani leader Cecine and his personal guard Hastion, the more she wants them. Knowing what Cecine and Hastion are doing to each other when nobody’s looking only makes it harder to keep her hands to herself. But she’s already been betrayed by one alien—her dead douchebag of a husband. Can she trust her future—and her children—to another?  Contains the usual Robin L. Rotham smorgasbord of m/m/f menage and D/s elements, plus a shipload of alien alphas in outer space.",
