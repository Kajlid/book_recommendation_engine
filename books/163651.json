  "description": "Harley Rayne's bad choices just keep piling up. All she wants is for her family to acknowledge her existence, and to be needed by someone. Anyone. When Frank rides into town with the Coyotes, and seems to be everything she thinks she wants, she finally feels like more than a piece of furniture. Frank not only sees her, he needs her. Harley runs away for love, but is entirely unready for the world love brings her to. Regret number one? Letting her loneliness drive her into the arms of an exceptionally volatile flavor of trouble named Frank Essex.Regret number two? Jumping on the back his bike and blowing out of town—and away from her family—with middle fingers blazing.You see, Frank and her family share a secret, and while her family has protected her from the truth, Frank throws Harley into it headfirst. The man she loves is a werewolf, and he's nothing more than a charming sadist who doesn’t take rejection easily. Or at all. Turns out, running away again won't be as easy as it was before; especially when Frank isn't the only one hunting her down.Regret number three? Thinking she could escape without Frank tracking her down.To start a new life away from bad boys, bikers, and werewolves, Harley must give up her long-standing fixation on finding her true \"family\" and learn how to be reliant only on herself. Easier said than done, and in the end, she's left with an ultimatum that will change everything she thinks she knows: Pack or prey.ISBN: 1500136069Alternate Cover Edition",
