  "description": "Just outside Los Angeles, a prisoner hidden away for 70 years sits up, gets off the bed and disappears through a solid wall.  In Australia, a magician impresses audiences by producing real elephants. Nobody realizes it's not an illusion.  Across the world, individuals and ancient organizations with supernatural power suddenly detect the presence of something even they can't understand.  At the center of it all, Seb Varden, a 32-year old musician with a secret in his past, slits his wrists, is shot dead and run over on the freeway. He's had better days.  Seb is about to discover the universe is a far more complicated place than he'd ever imagined. ***Please note, this book can be read as a standalone, or as the first in a planned series developing elements and characters from The World Walker.",
