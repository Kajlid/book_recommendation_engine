  "description": "The Passion is a visual portrayal of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus. Gripping photos taken on the set of Mel Gibson's new film, The Passion of Christ, together with the biblical narratives in the New Living Translation, present the story in vivid detail. A sweeping presentation of the Passion story in powerful images that will enhance the movie experience! “This is a movie about love, hope, faith, and forgiveness. He [Jesus] died for all mankind, suffered for all of us. It's time to get back to that basic message. The world has gone nuts. We could all use a little more love, faith, hope, and forgiveness.” —Mel Gibson, Icon Productions",
