  "title": "The Heirloom Gardener: Collecting and Growing Old and Rare Varieties of Vegetables and Fruits",
  "description": "Thousands of gardeners are discovering the joys of growing heirloom vegetables and fruits...older, classic, often rare varieties now difficult to obtain from commercial nurseries and seed companies. Older varieties are often better adapted to specific local growing conditions, offer a rich diversity of choices, and can be better-tasting than new hybrids. Moreover, by growing heirlooms, gardeners help to safeguard a precious gene pool and reap the unique rewards of literally bringing history to life.",
