  "description": "Torn Series: Bass Cole  I had imagined the hardest thing a man could accomplish was getting the woman he loved to the altar. This view instantaneously changed, however. Marriage by far wasn’t easy—far from it. It’s a boundless enterprise consisting of endless negotiations and compromises.  Our marriage may be new but we’ve been through the troughs and hurdles.  Though fate had dealt us a hasher hand prior to marriage, I believed my wife and I will overcome whatever tribulations handed to us.  We’ve come a long way…we’ve come so far to let misfortunes separate us.  We’re stronger together, weaker when apart.",
