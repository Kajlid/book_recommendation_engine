The creatures of nightmares and children’s stories might roam Emerilia, but this isn’t their land it isn’t their home. The Terra Alliance will use everything at their disposal to gain strength and push back the forces that roam Emerilia. The Pantheon moves in the shadows, the forests and across Markolm. Light, Earth and Dark’s forces only grow as they recruit those from The Event into their ranks. Beset on all sides Party Zero prepare for a war not seen since the ancient times of Emerilia. They know that this is only the beginning.",
