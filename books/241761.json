  "description": "We were lost in the woods on our way to the city, my brother Hansel and I, when we came upon the cottage. A faery cottage, with a handsome and mysterious occupant. He calls himself the Magus, and he makes magnificent chocolates and confections for the Wicked Revels, the wild woodland dance of the fair folk.  The moment I lay eyes on him, I sense he is everything I’ve ever dreamed of. And I’ve dreamed of a lot. No one knows what strange desires dance in my mind—until now. Hansel doesn’t want me to stay. I defy his wishes. He’s my brother, not my master.  But the Magus can only offer me desire—never satisfaction. My desire feeds his magic, and his magic makes his confections delicious. He can never touch me, although he certainly has a lot of ways around that. He is forbidden from attending the Revels. And he bears a curse that ends on All Hallow’s Eve, but he can’t tell me its nature. Whoever this man is, whatever his name is, I will find out, because I have never met anyone who understands me the way he does, and I know he is meant to be mine.  Tasting Gretel is a standalone fairy tale retelling of Hansel and Gretel, for those who like an unabashedly adorable happily ever after with serious steaminess! Although it is definitely standalone, it doesn't hurt to read These Wicked Revels before this one.
