  "description": "Nothing can save you from your fate... BJ Kincaid was a genius, a former child prodigy who had built a multimillion dollar software and gaming empire. But the danger she was facing now was no game. She was losing chunks of time, coping with the sudden onset of crippling headaches. Threats to her company, her friends, her life, now shook her sheltered and shy existence to the core. She'd dealt with enemies pirating her ideas before, and had solved any problem she'd ever faced. But this was a puzzle she couldn't solve, an enemy she couldn't defeat on her own. Was she the traitor this time? Or did the mysterious blackouts and terrorization of LadyTech mean she was simply going insane?Brodie Maxwell is the security consultant BJ's partners hire to investigate the threats to their company and their friend. But this beast of a man with deep battle scars inside and out is unlike anyone BJ has known.

His loneliness matches her own, and his mix of fiery kisses and surprising compassion rock BJ's heart. She has no doubt this former soldier can protect her physically. But will this man of mystery, who claims the woman who loves him is destined to die, destroy her soul?Are they fighting an ancient curse? Or battling an enemy who's all too real? Either way, BJ and Brodie are fated to be together...if they live long enough to make the fairy tale come true.",
