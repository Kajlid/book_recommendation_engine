  "description": "My gut tells me I'm screwed the moment my eyes meet hers... A briefcase full of cash in one hand and documents that could land me in prison in the other, but all I can focus on is how she moves in that tight fitting dress. No longer on task, my mind is busy calculating how long it will take to slip it from those gorgeous curves and into a heap on floor. ----- Stepping onto his private jet, I have only one thing in mind... Revenge. I need to distract him just long enough to gather the key piece of evidence that currently resides in his left hand. By the time we reach cruising altitude, however, things are quickly spinning out of control. I suddenly find myself on my knees, between his... this was definitely not part of the master plan! As her master plan begins to fall apart, a more sinister and deadly plot emerges. Can two jaded souls put the past behind them and find solace in one another? Or will it turn out to be another heart-wrenching case of forbidden love? * Both Power Trip and Power Play are only 99 cents until the 3rd book is complete.
