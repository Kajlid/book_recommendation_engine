  "description": "PART 5 BBW Vampire Serial M/F/M SPOILER ALERT - Read Part 4 before you read this description  Still trapped firmly between her kings, it's not the fun-filled vampire sandwich Tanya had envisioned. Things get especially difficult when she realises she has little fangs instead of 'normal' teeth. She's also seriously freaking thirsty. For blood. Her stomach churns at the thought yet her eyes keep dropping to the pulse at Zane's neck. She has the insane urge to drool when she catches Brant's enticing scent.  Maybe just one little taste... It's clear that their plan worked, she must be pregnant with the next royal heir. One teeny tiny problem, the news is making her males all the more possessive of her. Even level headed Zane is not thinking rationally anymore...at least...not where his female is concerned. With the new moon on the horizon and a mating ceremony to plan, Tanya is oblivious to the brewing storm around her. Red Lust is Part 5 of a 6 part serial and is approximately 20,000 words/80 pages. The story contains strong sexual themes/language and is not intended for readers under the age of 18.
