  "description": "In the winter of AD234 no one could have predicted the coming catastrophe …Emperor Alexander Severus has reigned for thirteen years and the Empire remains strong. Popular with the Senate and Rome’s people, his power is known across all four corners of the world. The Severan dynasty, apart from a brief interlude of a few months long ago, has held power for more than four decades. In the east a hard fought war has ended Sassanid Persian attacks. Peace reigns and Rome prospers.But the unexpected assassination of the Emperor in the spring of AD235, will scupper the peace and change everything, for ever.The first book in Sidebottom’s major new series set in third century Rome explores an era of unprecedented violence and turbulence which saw, for the first time, Emperors killed on the field of battle, cut down both by barbarians and by the soldiers of Rome herself. In the space of fifty years nearly as many men were to wear the imperial purple.",
