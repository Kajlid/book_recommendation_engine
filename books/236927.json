  "description": "The body of a smartly-dressed businessman turns up in the yard of Eli Sampson’s car workshop. It there’s no ID in the pockets and Eli swears he’s never seen the man before.A girlfriend comes forward and provides a name but she doesn’t know much more. She says the victim told her he was someone’s ‘right hand man’. But old fractures and scars, discovered at the autopsy suggest a more colourful past. For ‘right hand man’, DCI Bill Slider thinks 'enforcer'. So who was Mr King? Who was he the muscle for? What did he have to do with the Davy Lane project and the blackmailing of an MP? And, most crucially, what did he know that made someone decide it was time to terminate the terminator?",
