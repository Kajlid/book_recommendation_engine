  "description": "Poetry. Latino/Latina Studies. The late AndrA[aï¿½As Montoya's THE ICEWORKER SINGS AND OTHER POEMS evokes a world of machines and violence as it confronts a culture that has abandoned hope. His poems are stories, prayers, and letters that foster a spiritual resolve in the midst of a chaotic and concrete reality that denies the holy. Primarily urban and intensely personal, his poetry is nonetheless universal in dealing with issues of the day: race, faith, urban decay, poverty, police brutality, and the individual search for hope in the midst of despair. Winner of the 1997 Chicano/Latino Literary Prize.",
