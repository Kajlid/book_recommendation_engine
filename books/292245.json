The object of his desire is Lady Guinevere Northwicke who is, unfortunately, the daughter of a powerful duke-who also happens to be a very loving and protective father. Believing his suit to be unworthy, he tries to forget and limits his interaction with her. Then his twin brother arrives in Town. Darius is everything that Miles is not. He drinks too much, gambles too much, fights too much, and doesn't care a rap for Society or its strictures. When the lovely Lady Genevieve Northwicke catches his eye, he ignores the warnings fired at him from all corners, resulting in the death of that lady's reputation. Rather than facing the consequences of his actions, he flees. Miles must resolve the situation the only way he knows offer marriage to the sister of his beloved to rescue her from scandal. But will his action actually solve the problem? Or cause more misery than anyone could possibly imagine?",
