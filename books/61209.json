  "description": "[Siren Classic Erotic Alternative Paranormal Romance, M/M, vampires, HEA] Marc Duggon was on a mission. He knew that Lowell Erickson was up to no good and he was determined to prove it. It was the only way he could keep his friends safe. But Marc has no idea that breaking into the man's lavish estate would give him someone else to protect. Jasper was a blood slave. He had been a blood slave longer than he could remember. His life was hell, a series of beatings and being an unwilling donor to a coven of bloodthirsty vampires. It sucked, especially when the prince of his coven decides Jasper is no longer useful and sells him to the highest bidder. But the man waiting for him after the auction is not the new master Jasper expects. One, he's human. Two, he's the sexiest damn man Jasper has ever seen and his blood calls to Jasper's heart and soul. Three, Jasper isn't so sure that Marc is his new master. Marc fights for their freedom like a man possessed, promising Jasper everything he ever dreamed of, but Jasper hesitates to believe all of the things Marc tells him, especially when the man agrees to do something Jasper never expects. But believing Marc's outlandish tales won't mean a thing if they can't escape the most vicious vampire prince the world has ever known. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
