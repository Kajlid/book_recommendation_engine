  "description": "Harper Lexington knows a lot about birds, but very little about coping with death. Her fiancé, Jack, died in a tragic accident two months before their wedding, and one year later, Harper still has trouble getting out of bed. If she could fly away, she would. Rebuilding her life feels impossible until she meets someone new. Someone who makes her feel like a real person again. Then Jack visits her, traveling from purgatory where he isn’t stuck, but is choosing to stay so he can keep an eye on her. Or so she thinks. Harper doesn’t care, as long as she has Jack again. Letting him go a second time is unthinkable. But as she soon discovers, letting him stay is risking everything she's done to rebuild her life, and, more importantly, is risking his soul. The Indigo Bunting is a love story, a ghost story, and a story of finding happiness when it seems lost forever.",
