  "description": "HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of people try to make it as rock stars, yet very few succeed. We've all read auto-biographies of drugged up ndividuals, sipping champagne from the stiletto of a Playboy Bunny while looking out of the tinted glass of a stretch limo. But what about the musicians who don't even touch those sleazy heights? Are their lives any less outrageous or even readable? EAMON NANCARROW delivers answers to these questions in his side-splitting memoir Holywood Star. It's the tale of a kid brought up on a council estate just outside Belfast who dreams of striding the stages of the world's great concert halls, but at almost every step calamity trips him up. You won't have heard of Eamon or any of his bands, but by the end of his book you'll feel like a life-long fan.",
