  "description": "No one ever said that relationships were easy. I guess I thought that once I found love everything else would fall into place. I didn't count on my accident, the deaths of my mother and friends, and my annoying new ability. I didn't count on a lot of things. I thought my trip into the Otherside would solve all my problems. I thought Dean would be waiting for me when I got back.... I thought....seems to be my theme lately.....my thoughts are like a lot of other people's assumptions.....ass and me seem to go hand in hand. I never for one minute thought Lilith would win....I guess my thoughts should be outlawed..... because Lilith always wins.",
