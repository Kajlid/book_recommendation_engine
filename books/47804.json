  "title": "A Glimpse of Eternal Snows: A Journey of Love and Loss in the Himalayas",
  "description": "Set against the backdrop of one of the most colourful countries in the world, A Glimpse of Eternal Snows is an inspiring story of courage, love and a family’s determination to give their child the best life possible. In pulsating, polluted Kathmandu and an idyllic village at the foot of the Himalayas, ‘Doctor Jane’ and her engineer husband Simon hope to make a difference: Jane to fulfil her vision to heal and advocate for the poor, Simon to avert the floods that threaten to devastate the country every monsoon season. The Nepali people are accepting of whatever fate flings at them and here the family find sanity, compassion and joy with baby David, who in England was little more than an ‘interesting case’. This is a tale of Himalayan highs and monsoon lows, of cultural complexities, unexpected wildlife and rugged terrain, of vivid colour, superstition and spicy smells.",
