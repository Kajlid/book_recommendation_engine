Ultimately, she signs a six month contract of sexual servitude but, as Marcello and Jane grow closer, Janice feels neglected and jealous, creating tension in their normally easy daily rhythm.In an effort to help Jane, her best friend Parker introduces her to Chase, a confident and flirtatious man who lacks the arrogance of either Luke or Marcello.

She is intensely attracted to Chase but does not feel free to consider him as more than a friend.Once Jane gets a real picture of Marcello’s extremes, she knows what she must do. Her feelings about Luke and Marcello and her own sexuality must be resolved before she can find true love with a man who appreciates everything she has to offer. Can she possibly find the kink she has come to desire without the full-time submission?Book Three of the My Body Trilogy (Erotic Suspense Romance)",
