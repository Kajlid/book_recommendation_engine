  "title": "Falling into the Lord's Hands",
  "description": "This is my story of alcohol addiction and how it got its hands on my life for a long time; years, in fact. I want to share my story, in the hopes that people with addiction will seek help. I did, and for that I am eternally grateful. With Jesus Christ, nothing is impossible.About the AuthorI am Violet Yates, 38 years old and born and raised in Hawaii. A recent divorcee, I live on the Kona Coast of the Big Island of Hawaii. I often feel as if I've lived several lives! I have three children, two of whom are grown. My kids are my life and my solace. I am an author of several books, short stories, essays and about 100 poems. I own more books than I could ever read, but I keep collecting more.I lived in Upstate New York for 10 years, and during that time I went back to school and earned my Bachelor's degree in English, as well as my Master's degree in Higher Education Administration. During that time, I wrote prolifically and am just now starting to edit and publish a lot of it. While in New York, I worked at MetLife as an accounting representative, I co-managed a Domino's pizza and freelanced for a bi-monthly newspaper (in addition to being their circulation clerk).I love, love, love to read, and I have wanted to be a published author since I was eight years old, when I wrote and colored a story and sent it in as a submission to Highlights magazine for children. This was my first rejection letter, the first of many. My first real novel, Beginnings, was really rough and contrived, and it did not get published, although I still have every single rejection letter (numbering in the hundreds, I believe!). Following this total rejection, I put myself back into college, determined to become a stellar writer.After my husband and I separated, I stopped writing much of anything for years and drowned my sorrows in alcohol. Two and a half years ago, while living in the Berkshires of Massachusetts, I got into recovery. The last two years have been a journey of self-discovery. I have published a book of poetry, \"Lost & Found,\" as a tribute to that journey, and to Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior. While the struggle was indeed awful, I learned so much from those years and I wouldn't go back and change a thing.",
