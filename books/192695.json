The troops are important to her and she’s always supported them in whatever way she can. Cord Hoffman is a Sergeant with the United States Army who is stationed overseas. Joining the Army straight out of high school, he’s always envisioned the military would be not only his career, but his life. Fighting for his country is something Cord takes great pride in, though being single and away from family is starting to take its toll on him. One fateful day, Cord receives a thoughtful gift of a simple cup of coffee from a stranger through the Java for a Joe program. After reaching out to the sender, an unlikely friendship is formed. As time passes, Maloree and Cord’s friendship progresses across the miles and feelings blossom. When granted leave for the holidays, Cord decides to seek Maloree out. Will two people who found each other through the words of a simple gesture, sent from a world away, have a real chance at love once they’re face to face? Or will their romance be tucked away as a beautiful memory along with the letters signed… With Gratitude and Love… **This is an adult romance book and contains explicit language and graphic sex scenes not suitable for all readers.
