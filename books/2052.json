  "description": "Sunshine in the Valley is about the creation of life after the extinction of time. Taking place in a village surrounded by living walls, in which existence has become a frame of mind, a way of thinking, the narrative centers around a group of “childlike entities” whose age, like most everything in the world around them, eventually gets brought into question. Everything is alien, strange, and beautiful, as if written in hieroglyphics, illuminated by light, within a framework of existential clarity—or, perhaps, the shadow of that clarity, stipulated by its absence.",
