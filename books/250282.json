  "description": "It started off innocuous enough. A simple nod here. A cup of coffee. And slipping off the ring. A walk in the rain. A hotel check in. And a disappearance. Don't think about what is at home. Don't think about what this means. She won't feel a thing. â€¦ Until she feels everything.  Kailee Reese Samuels writes dark, dirty lit. Her words may cause increased heart rate, hand sweating, and other issues. You are strongly advised to enter at your own risk. Not for the faint of heart. May cause triggers in some. Others may choose to ride again and again. You have been warned.",
