  "title": "Jenny Kissed Me!",
  "description": "When Jenny finds an old letter in a shoebox, her mind is flooded with memories of a long forgotten love. She and Jonathan had secretly loved one another in high school, but never shared those feelings except for that one time in the library their senior year. Jenny had impetuously kissed Jonathanâ€”a moment neither forgot. Four decades have passed. Five thousand miles away they meet as strangers on tour in Italy. Will they have the opportunity for a second chance? A clean, wholesome, timeless story , with universal themes built around admirable, charming characters.Some folks are bothered that most love stories seem a bit contrived and have a suspension of belief. They normally label themselves as realists--\"not into that fairy-tale stuff.\" But what better way to deal with the real world, 24/7, than to take a break, experience a lovelier world-- one that transforms the mood and lifts the spirit, giving hope to something better. Although my story is fictional, the magical thing about it is that it could really happen.",
