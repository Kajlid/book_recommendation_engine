He says it’s kismet, but she feels like it’s pure, unadulterated torture to her still broken heart. The last thing she intends to offer him is forgiveness.Making a promise to move on, Eve tries, but when everything she’s worked for is jeopardized, the man who used to be her King is her only option.A favor, an outrageous bid, and a date can’t lead to a second chance. Can it?",
