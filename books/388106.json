  "description": "For ages 3-9 Little Bird awakens to a perfect day. It is going to be his first real taste of the real world and he is so excited! What he finds during his adventure, is something entirely different. His excitement about his perfect day turns to sadness when he realizes that he is different from all of the other birds he encounters and is reminded of his differences by a group of more grown up birds who tease him. A visit by Native American Sorceress Kanka, changes Little Bird's outlook on himself as he gazes into the pools of her eyes and he sees himself as the Great Spirit sees him, perfect in every way! Just like Little Bird, YOU are perfect too!",
