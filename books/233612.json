With his mother gone, he fights to keep his family together and care for his little brother, Charlie, whose developmental problems are another secret Cyrus cannot risk revealing. Add to that an alcoholic and paranoid father, and Cyrus’s life is rapidly falling to pieces even as he’s realizing his feelings for his best friend, Oliver.
