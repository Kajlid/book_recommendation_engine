I’m falling fast for Zade, but my feelings for Nash are still very real. When life starts getting complicated and Nash speaks the words I never thought I’d hear, the only thing I want is for us to find a way to make this work...together.**Every book in the Heathens Ink series can be read as a stand-alone, but it’s way more fun to read them in order.
