  "description": "Will Jelbert had what many people would consider the ideal life: a well paying job and a beautiful wife but he wasn't happy. He found himself lost in the day to day routine and constantly wondering if there was more to life. One day the life he knew came to an abrupt end when he was thrown from his bike, face first into the sidewalk of a Sydney street. After a full facial reconstruction, PTSD, depression and anxiety exacerbated by excessive drinking, Jelbert decided to completely change his life. He dedicated the next four years to a happiness research project knowing that in this beautiful world, happiness could surely be found for everyone. The result, The Happiness Animal, the world's first dedicated exercise guide to happiness, which explains the psychology behind what strengthens our spirit (our Happiness Animal), and how to apply this psychology to the realities of everyday life, while avoiding the happiness traps that have been set for us. Jelbert condenses the latest applied positive psychology research into a simple guide to five muscles. Five exercises for each muscle are juxtaposed with the story of the trials of the author's own experiences of unhappiness and how he was able to use the exercises to strengthen his spirit. Incorporating a little honesty, vulnerability, courage, kindness, curiosity and awareness into our work and home life doesn't take a lot of time, but has a lasting, cumulative impact on the health of our happiness. Perfect for people in all walks of life, the exercises in The Happiness Animal will move you toward profound personal change and act as a driving force for your happiness.",
