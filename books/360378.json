  "title": "Becoming Mommyâ€¦Becoming Me: Every Woman's Journey to Motherhood Is Unique",
  "description": "Every mother has a story that is a major part of her life and makes her who she is. There are many mothers who take pride in their story, and there are also ones that feel ashamed of theirs. Although we may not realize it we are not alone. These are the stories of 14 women that have had to overcome obstacles in life that are seldom talked about but often experienced. Every story is true and from a firsthand basis. These stories are real and nothing is sugar coated for a typical happy ending. These accounts are written as told to the writer. It is advised that the reader have an open mind and heart while reading this book. You can never know what a person is going through unless you were there. Many times people make decisions based on what they think is right for them at the time.",
