  "title": "Unsporting: How Trans Activism and Science Denial are Destroying Sport",
  "description": "The face of female sports is changing.Radical gender activists are using a pseudoscientific theory of human biology to hijack sports and subvert the long-established concepts of fair play — forcing women and girls to risk their safety, pushing them aside for male athletes using the excuse of “inclusivity.”Anyone who questions this dogma risks being branded as a transphobe and having their social and professional lives “cancelled”.In the new book, Unsporting: How Trans Activism and Science Denial are Destroying Sport, former Canadian track champion Linda Blade and renowned National Post columnist Barbara Kay, examine the dangers of gender ideology in sports. They document the attack on biological facts upon which the level playing field of sports rests.Tackling issues few have the courage to say out loud, Unsporting shows the harm inflicted on female athletes, and identifies the institutions driving this movement.What does the future hold for sports if biological reality is ignored? Blade answers that question, and concludes with a reasonable plan to reverse course.",
