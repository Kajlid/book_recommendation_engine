  "description": "Cat Peters just transferred to Darkmont High, and is already desperate to get out. There's no way her mom can afford the tuition at Grimoire, the posh, private school nearby, so when Cat hears that Grimoire is offering a full scholarship to the winners of a soccer tournament, she jumps at the chance! Once she makes the team, everything starts to go Cat's way. It's like the whole town is under a spell, and all they care about is the tournament. Elated by her new celebrity status, Cat doesn't pay much attention when her little sister, Sookie, and their bookworm neighbor, Jasper, try to tell her there's something ... just not right about the old school on the hill. Their worries are confirmed when they uncover a mystery about an entire soccer team that disappeared many years ago. But strangely, no one in the town remembers the incident. When Sookie goes missing, Cat is forced to take Jasper seriously, and the two must figure out what is happening to the town. The investigation leads Cat to a book about ancient fairies and Celtic mythology, and she soon realizes that there is something truly wicked at work inside the walls of Grimoire.",
