  "description": "Sexy. Demanding. Cocky. All words I would use to describe Kingston Avery. The owner of Avery Capital Holdingsâ€” and my new boss. It was tempting enough working together everyday, but ignoring his wicked promises under his roof was impossible. But the company had a zero fraternization policy, and things were already complicated enough. I needed to focus on doing my job. And avoid doing my boss. Kingston wasn't just another suit... He was a cocky suit. And when the suit came off, He was a man who could steal my heart. Gorgeous. Attentive. Compassionate.I just hope it didn't cost me my career.",
