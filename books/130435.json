  "description": "Drake desires one thing—to claim the only woman he has ever loved, but doing so places her life, her immortal soul in unavoidable danger. In order to protect her, he must go against his very nature and openly seek a bond with another. That heart-rending decision will undeniably place them both in mortal danger. For the power lies within two souls made of one. The solution to the present divide lies in the past—a past that Madison Marie is hell bent on uncovering in order to protect the man that brings rapture to her soul and completion to a life that she has longed for throughout eternity.",
