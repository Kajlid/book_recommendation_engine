  "title": "Spooky South: Tales of Hauntings, Strange Happenings, and Other Local Lore",
  "description": "Here we have a collection of unnerving tales of events that happened--and still do happen--in the collective back yard of the Deep South states. Accompanied by evocative illustrations, these compelling retellings of 40 popular folktales feature supernatural occurrences and ghosts of all sorts, from fiddling ghosts to the story of the Jack o'Lantern. Whether read around the fire on a dark and stormy night or in the backseat of the family van on the way to Grandma's, each expertly told tale is guaranteed to make readers look at the South--and over their shoulders--again and again.",
