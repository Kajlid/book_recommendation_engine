  "description": "From award-winning author Carrie Clarke comes Blueprint for Falling in Love, Book 2 in the Falling in Love SeriesSparks fly and the air sizzles when Josh meets Greer disembarking a flight from London. Sparks, and a strange sense of familiarity…JoshI can’t believe I hit on my best friend’s little sister. In my defence, she’s changed since I last saw her ten years ago. A lot. I wish things were different, but there’s no way I’m going there.GreerJosh may think denying our connection is the right thing to do, but I’ve got news for him. And working together on renovating his new house gives me the opportunity I need to prove it to him.Giving in to temptation puts everything Josh holds dear at risk, but not giving in might just break both their hearts.This story features a reluctant hero with abandonment issues, a determined heroine with an unshakeable belief in love, a family who knows much more than they’re letting on and a grand gesture the whole of Sydney gets behind.Author’s Note: Blueprint for Falling in Love is Book 2 in the Falling in Love Series, but it can be read as a standalone and has a guaranteed HEA. Warning: if you like dual POV, tattooed heroes, slightly dysfunctional found families, red headed heroines, accidental flirting and lots of adult cuddles, you may need a fan or a cold shower after reading.",
