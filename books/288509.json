  "title": "Hard Rain: A Dylan Commentary",
  "description": "Hard Rain ranges over thirty years of Bob Dylan's recordings, films, and concerts to deliver astute insights into—and sometimes heretical judgements of—his prodigious corpus of work. This updated edition includes a new epilogue that examines Dylan's thirtieth anniversary celebration in 1992; his albums Good As I Been to You, World Gone Wrong, and Time Out of Mind; his 1997 performance before the Pope; and his 1998 Grammy Award comeback. The result is unparalleled rock criticism.",
