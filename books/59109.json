  "description": "Jes desperately needs something solid to hold onto. In Losing Forever, she learned to accept the inevitability of change. But the change is moving at a heartbreaking pace and her world shifts by the day. The date with boy-next-door Sam shows that even the most awkward moment can always get more awkward. At home, Jes's stepsister, the beautiful and seemingly well-adjusted Angela, is clearly a favorite. When Jes's mother announces she is pregnant and the new baby will need a bedroom, one thing's certain -- it won't be Angela who moves. There's lots of uncertainty in Jes's life, but the biggest uncertainty of all is love. Everyone has a different opinion on it. Jes's teacher says that love is about reuniting what was once divided -- this from a guy who's going through a divorce. If anything's for sure, it's that love is never predictable, always confusing and may hurt sometimes. But, as Jes begins to see, no one ever gives up on it.",
