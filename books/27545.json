  "description": "Translator's Note:\"Aleksandr Blok (1880-1921) wrote The Twelve in 1918, after the Russian October Revolution, in four January days during the Civil War. In his diary he says he wrote it 'in harmony with the elements...perhaps all political sentiment is so unclean that a single drop of it poisons and renders worthless all the rest; but perhaps, again, it does not destroy the meaning of the poem; and, who knows, perhaps it will in the end prove a ferment, resurrecting The Twelve for another time than ours.' The poem is a unique work, even for Blok himself. The three shorter poems included here will give at least a faint idea (I hope) of the quiet, Symbolist-Romantic flavor of most of Blok's other work.\" - Anselm Hollo",
