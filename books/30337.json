  "description": "“If you believe we are one world and our survival depends on inter-dependency rather than independency, then, in terms of food and cooking, this is the book for you . . . the most delicious recipes even a novice can make—it’s all in The World in your Kitchen. ”—Julie Christie “Troth Wells makes a valuable contribution to moving towards a more sustainable world with The World in your Kitchen. ”—Marilyn Borchardt, Food First (Institute for Food and Development), San Francisco The World in your Kitchen brings people together in the same way that food does. This fascinating collection of vegetarian recipes shows how every non-Western culture developed its own vegetarian cuisine. It gives you the chance to enjoy some of the vast range of different foods eaten in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, Latin America, and the Middle East. With historical and cultural background, personal stories, and people photography, The World in your Kitchen brings color and context to global delights like quibebe (pumpkin soup from Brazil), coconut curry from Malaysia, and avocado and zucchini enchiladas from Mexico. Troth Wells has been with the New Internationalist since 1972. She has written a number of world food books.",
