  "description": "From renowned Brazilian Indigenous activist and leader Ailton Krenak comes an urgent and necessary appeal to save the planet.Humanity is facing the greatest environmental disaster of our existence. Global pandemics, extreme weather events, and massive wildfires all define the era that many are now calling the Anthropocene.In the three lectures that comprise Ideas to Postpone the End of the World, renowned Indigenous activist and leader Ailton Krenak argues that the current environmental crisis is rooted in modern society’s flawed concept of “humanity” — that human beings are superior to any other form of nature and therefore justified to exploit it as we please. As a result, our entire civilization is built upon structures, organizations, and institutions that alienate us from the land, rivers, and trees, and that have forced the marginalization (and sometimes outright elimination) of any community that refuses to abide by these rules. Indigenous peoples throughout the Americas have already faced the end of the world many times before. Now, to stop our collective march towards the abyss, we must reject the homogenizing effect of our human-first perspective and embrace a new idea of “dreaming,” one that allows us to regain our proper place within nature. Only then may we find new solutions to survive.A work of rare passion and intelligence, Ideas to Postpone the End of the World is a parable for modern times written by one of the age’s great thinkers and a necessary appeal for the fate of a world in crisis.",
