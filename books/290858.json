  "description": "\"Please don't let anybody call her a poor little thing any more,\" Anne Sullivan begged Helen Keller's parents. \"She's not a poor little thing. She's a strong, healthy child. I suspect she has a better mind than many children who can see and hear.\" Helen was deaf, dumb and blind, isolated in a world of silence and darkness. She couldn't get out of the black closet she lived in until Annie Sullivan arrived one day, burning with determination to free Helen's mind, and teach her to live as a real human being. The job that Annie Sullivan set for herself and never been accomplished before. At first it looked hopeless, for there didn't seem to be any way to reach the child whose strong will clashed with her teacher's. But then one day Helen realized what was wanted of her, and from her first discovery that \"everything has a name,\" there was no stopping her. Learning was fun, and the once bad-tempered little girl was transformed into a quick and avid pupil who could \"see\" a lion, ride a horse, swim in the ocean. Helen Keller, denied pity by her wise teacher, became the most famous child in the world, and then a gracious, well-educated woman whose triumphs make a story more moving than any fiction.",
