  "description": "\"There are moments in life that define you - moments from which entire futures are carved out, where you can practically see the universe split into two.\" Becoming a grandmother at thirty-eight may not be ideal, but Stella Hill can cope - just about - because in two weeks' time she's getting married to the love of her life. She's waited over twenty years to finally get her man; Paul Smart is her destiny, her soul mate. But when Stella finds out she's pregnant - a pregnancy that's unplanned and unexpected, not to mention inconvenient - she takes it in her stride. Marriage, baby, new adventures on the horizon. It's not a problem. At least, not for her. Just how do you break the news of a baby on the eve of your wedding? And what can you do if your plans turn out to be wildly different from the plans of the one you love? As Stella's dream wedding turns into a nightmare, she learns that sometimes the people we love don't react the way we thought they would. And maybe sometimes love means letting go.The Family Trap is the stand-alone sequel to Kindle bestselling Can't Live Without.",
