Life was perfect, full of promise, till she woke up in the hospital and realized life as she knew it, was now over.Fearing that she will fall into an irreversible depression, her family sends her to Scotland to stay with distant relatives in the hope that a change of scenery will help her to get her life back on track.Life in rural Scotland is comforting, except for the fact that her great aunt Maggie is hell bent on finding her a “suitable gentleman” to date. A trip to London and a day at the famed Ascot horse races promises to be quite an adventure, but when Jenna crosses paths with an old friend and his rival Arthur Sandringham, things quickly veer off track.Jenna soon finds herself back in the public eye, but in a less flattering light and she soon finds herself forced to make some very hard choices.
