When a new group moves into an abandoned ranch nearby, Oliver is more intrigued than worried, especially once the strangers place a standing order for a cow per week.The town pack decides to live and let live, but Oliver wants to know more about these Waangoo newcomers. Why are there just five men? Why does the pack beta make Oliver's assistant so belligerent? And above all, why can't Oliver look away from the strangers' alpha, Angus?",
