  "description": "ETHAN:I'm not used to anyone having the upper hand over me, and in a single night, Sean Wright rescues me twice. That's why he intrigues me--why for the first time, I want another man. I'm used to getting what I want, and I don't plan to let anything stop me. Only...he continues to get the best of me, and it only makes me want him more. When I start to see Sean's not just good looks, hot sex, and constant competition, I realize I'm in over my head...and I might like it. He makes me laugh, and he understands the pain I feel over my past, a pain we share. Even more than that, somehow, Sean gets me, but I'm not going to lie and pretend that giving my heart doesn't scare me.SEAN:The night I rescued the presumably straight Ethan Harris...twice, I figured that would be the last time I saw him. However, he keeps finding his way back into my life and into my bed. Guess he wasn't as straight as I thought. Ethan's full of surprises, though, and being bi is just one of them. As cocky as he can be, he's also sharp and witty...and even when he's being his most arrogant self, he's charming as hell. He likes to win, but so do I. However, as we get to know each other, I realize there's more to us than the games we play in and out of the bedroom. It's a game neither of us have played before--one we could both wind up losing. And with our hearts on the line, the real question is, when push comes to shove, are we both up for the challenge?",
