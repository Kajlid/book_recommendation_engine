  "description": "Anyone who says that youth is wasted on the young never met Erik & Isabelle… The two best friends, a year older and a tad wiser, return to Foresthill High to commence their Sophomore Year in the second book of Kim Wallace’s groundbreaking series for gay and lesbian youth. Sophomore Year picks up on the first day of school, launching the protagonists into a flurry of new adventures. Erik finds himself at the center of more than one young man’s attention as he reaches out beyond the closet and embraces the joy and sorrow that life has to offer. Meanwhile, Isabelle continues to propel her conservative town towards acceptance as she exercises dramatic flair to impact the minds and lives around her. Ripe with the angst and comedy that embody high school life, these memorable characters prevail with optimism and hope that will resonate in young people everywhere. Once impressionable freshmen, Erik and Isabelle are now the ones leaving the impressions as they aim to make their Sophomore Year at Foresthill High an unforgettable one.",
