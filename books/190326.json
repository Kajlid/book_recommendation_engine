  "description": "\"God hates you. Regardless of religion, race, sex, sexuality or nationality. He hates all of you. Basically, you are fucked.\" God is pissed off. He has run out of patience with humans and decided that our time is over. We've had our chance and its back to the drawing board. \"Fuck the lot of them\" is his newest gospel. Mo, and Jay, best Friends who've fucked up in the past, beg him for one more chance to get the humans back on track. Alongside Mr Saluzar, the head of a global charity foundation, and Nick, The Fallen Angel, they hurtle towards Armageddon and their one chance to prove God wrong. They have seven days to save us. On The Seventh Day contains strong language and religious irreverence which some may find offensive. Irreverent dark humour from the author of Lanarkshire Strays and the dEaDINBURGH series.",
