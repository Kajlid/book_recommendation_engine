  "title": "Unsolved Victorian Murders",
  "description": "VICTORIAN criminals often got away with murder. The police often made mistakes, forensic science was in its infancy and juries convicted people on the flimsiest of evidence. The wrong people were hanged at the gallows. In this fresh look at 12 unsolved murder cases, Jon Sutherland reviews the stories, evidence and trials to shed new light on the verdicts passed by the judges and juries of the 19th century. The killings attributed to Jack the Ripper in Whitechapel are the most famous unsolved Victorian murders, but few people know the extent of the doubts surrounding the case. Make up your own mind after reading Jon Sutherland's detailed survey of the material. In Unsolved Victorian Murders Jack the Ripper appears alongside less well-known but equally fascinating characters. - Did Madeleine Smith poison her lover with arsenic in a cup of cocoa? - How did a blind man throw his younger, fitter rival through a narrow window? - What really happened in the woods of the Ardlamont estate in Scotland the morning Cecil Hambrough was shot? Read the stories, examine the evidence and decide for yourself.",
