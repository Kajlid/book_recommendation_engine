The second installment was written in 1908 by Houdini, who penned a work on 'The Unmasking of Robert Houdin', a study of Robert Houdin's alleged magical abilities. Book III, written in 1920, and the final volume in The Book of Houdini, is called 'Miracle Mongers & Thier Methods', where Harry again analyzes and exposes the tricks behind magic, while sharing the secrets behind some of his own.",
