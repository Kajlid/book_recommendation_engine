  "description": "“You need to realize leadership isn’t a sprint. It’s a marathon and a team marathon at that. Even if you’re the fastest, sometimes you have to turn around and come back to help the slower ones. If you show them you care about the team, about them, then you’re all running the same race. That’s when you’ll really see what they can do.”  The clandestine war between the Xen Empire and the Terillian Confederation continues. The Dark Zone—officially called the Neutral Quadrant—is littered with the bodies of countless soldiers from both sides. It is into this wasteland that Lieutenant Emily Martin and her crew set out on a recon mission to investigate a planet they suspect contains an illegal Terillian base. Why have the Terillians violated the Peace Accords, and what are they so desperate to protect? It doesn’t take them long, however, to run into a squad of Terillian fighters. Outmatched and outgunned, Lieutenant Martin and her crew make a desperate gamble for survival, aiming their ruined ship for a crash landing at the planet below.  There the fight for survival takes a vicious turn. It’s not only the Terillians and the inhospitable ecosystem of the planet that Lieutenant Martin must defeat, but also dissent from within her own ranks. Her superior officer has no combat skills and her crew questions Emily’s own leadership—skills both her men and her superior officers report are sorely lacking. With the odds this stacked against her, how can Lieutenant Martin ever possibly survive, much less uncover what the Terillians are hiding?  Lieutenant Emily Martin didn’t become the only female officer ever in the Elite Guard because she thought it would be easy, but this battle could easily prove to be her last.",
