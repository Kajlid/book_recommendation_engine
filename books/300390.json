  "description": "By choice, chance and God’s hand, I survived some extremely trying times in the Marine Corps during World War II. I decided not to get mired in the horrors or waste of war. Tomes have been devoted to this subject. I choose instead to tell of my life as a Private, a grunt if you will, and how this life impacted on me. As a telephone lineman for the United States Marine Corps, I had the greatest opportunity to see more of the combat area than most participants. We traveled to the right flank, left flank, up front and to the rear areas to keep our telephone lines functioning and all our artillery and infantry in constant communications. A Japanese general stated “the American troops’ ability to concentrate artillery fire on a given point was a tremendous advantage.” As an artilleryman, I am proud we provided this edge. Our front line troops on numerous occasions told me our artillery barrage had “stopped the Japs cold.” Our constant goal. I have often been asked, “How did you cope with death as an everyday fact?” I tell of losing eight buddies on one day on Guam. We acknowledged the loss then moved on. “What is past is past.” We did not dwell on one or multiple losses. We simply moved on. Yesterday was an age away, this is today, we hope to see tomorrow. Perhaps cruel, but it retained our sanity. Those who stand and wait have not shared this burden. Lest you think I am portraying myself as some kind of hero -- let me remind you, they never asked me if I wanted to go on these combat landings to Bougainville, Guam, and Iwo Jima. I was not a hero, but I walked among heroes.",
