  "description": "A lyric poem consisting of five stanzas, with the first and last being nearly identical. A dream-voyager arrives in a place beyond time and space and decides to stay there. This place is intriguing with \"mountains toppling evermore into seas without a shore.\" Even so, it is a \"peaceful, soothing region\", a hidden treasure like El Dorado.",
