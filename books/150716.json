  "description": "The NOVA Trilogy is intended for mature audiences due to strong language, explicit sex, and abusive situations. Some readers may find it offensive or disturbing.Sophia My story begins in St. Louis with my best friend and former college roommate, Mera. I'm twenty-three, not the romantic type, and convinced that I can mistreat my body however I see fit. I'm not worried about any consequences, only my therapist is. I see her twice a week as requested by my father. He believes my lack of motivation, foul-mouth, and immaturity all stem from my mother's neglect. But my therapist? She thinks I'm a sex addict. All of this is about to change... because of him. Cove Everton holds secrets that are far darker than mine. The demons he carries are destroying him, and his connection to my family is tragic. He distances himself, but our attraction is too powerful for that to last. Once his private life is exposed, there's no turning back. We fall fast and hard, both virgins to love and troubled by the unknowns of a future together. Can we erase the scars of one another's past and move forward? Or will we be consumed by our former lives? You'll spend time in shallow water getting to know me before you advance into the deep end with Cove. And it is deep, be patient. The unexpected is coming. ~ Sophia Jameson",
