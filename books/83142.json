  "description": "So you think you’re an expert on the zombie apocalypse? The walking dead, World War Z, warm bodies? All just entertainment, if you find the walking dead amusing. But there was nothing funny about the beginning of the outbreak. Of course, you can really only learn about the beginning, if you’re willing to invest time in the Zombie Cajun Chronicles.Back in New York, Landon figured his mother was crazy. Always insisting they eat Zombie Cajun Hot Sauce on about everything. But then, maybe his mother wasn’t as insane as he thought. The question haunts him. He’ll find the truth in the bayous of southern Louisiana. You will too. But may we suggest you take a bottle with you?",
