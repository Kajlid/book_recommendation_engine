  "description": "Tommy Lee is known for any number of as the drummer for Motley Crue; as the husband and very public lover of Pamela Anderson; as a convicted felon; as the man who saw a child drown in his pool during a birthday party; and as a celebrity who continues to put his life back together after so many public trials and tribulations. It's been a life like no other - and now he's baring it all in a memoir like no other. Lee takes readers back to his childhood, when his penchant for misbehaviour got off to an early start, and brings them through the dizzying highs and abysmal lows of a life shaped by decadence and super-stardom. He shares what really happened during the Motley Crue days, reveals what it's like to film your own honeymoon and freely discusses his days in jail and how they changed his life. Often hilarious, always shameless, this is every bit the shocking memoir you'd expect from a man whose least interesting experience was being married to Heather Locklear. In an age of celebrity exposure, TOMMYLAND is the ultimate dish on the most notorious musical miscreant ever to dominate the headlines.",
