  "description": "The Melinoe Institute is looking for submissive male subjects for their current research project. Raymond Reynolds, who has always been drawn to strong dominant women, is invited to apply to become a subject in the project and after being admitted to the study, his preparation begins in earnest.It is explained that Ray's responses to stimuli will be carefully charted and measured and that he will sustain no permanent damage. Then Ray is put through his paces, taught to obey women and punished in a variety of ways when he doesn't. As he continues, Ray comes to realize things about his nature and his needs that he neither knew nor suspected before.",
