But what happens when she feels a connection with someone she shouldn’t while at her boyfriend’s family dinner? As she tries to navigate life to accommodate her own needs and not her parents’, will they accept it? Or will she be pushed out like an unwanted guest?Mason King is living the good life.

Will he fight their undeniable chemistry forever? Or will their circumstances make it impossible for them to deny their true feelings?",
