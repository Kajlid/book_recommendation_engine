  "description": "“Harrison, like Peter Tremayne in his Sister Fidelma series, provides a superior brand of historical mystery” Booklist - When clan leader Garrett MacNamara’s dead body is found on the road after a herd of cows has escaped, what was initially assumed to be a tragic case of him being squashed to a pulp by livestock becomes more sinister when a local claims they saw a chain attached to the mutilated body – which has now disappeared. Mara and her scholars must now investigate: was Slaney, Garrett’s wife, threatened by two new arrivals, or is she being blamed for his murder to clear the way for a new leader . . .?",
