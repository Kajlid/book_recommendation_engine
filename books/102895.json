  "description": "How lucky can one girl get? Just ask Jacqueline Croix. She has it all. The right fianc√©, money, looks, and connections. But everything comes at a cost. Sometimes that cost is looking the other way when the imperfections of your world start to show themselves. When something happens that she just can't look away from, she ends up drunk in a Chanel dress at a pity party on the beach in SC. There on the beach, she finally sees the cost of having everything is too high. Luckily, Jacqueline has one thing most girls like her do not, somewhere to run when she leaves it all behind. That somewhere happens to be to the open arms of the New York Rangers' right wing, Mike France. He has always been there through thick and thin, waiting for his chance to make her his. But how do you go from being best friends to lovers, when you know all the dirty details?",
