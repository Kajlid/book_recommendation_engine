  "description": "\"Something dark is coming to Jamesville in The Chronicles Of Nightwolf by author C R Beaumont and it's sure to capture your imagination. A magic that has spanned the centuries, manifested in the forces of good and evil as destinies reveal themselves. It’s a splendid tale that Beaumont has spun, his plot intricate and well-conceived, regaling readers with age old mysteries, whilst the devices of suspense and tension are maintained throughout. A delightful read with gratifyingly dark overtures, generously populated with a host of angst ridden characters and the requisite romance, yet in Beaumont’s capable hands it feels refreshingly unfamiliar. Yes, you could point to a host of bestselling books in the genre and make justifiable comparisons, but Beaumont has a particular turn of phrase which is rather distinctive and it’s this combined with the mechanics of good story telling that makes for such a compelling read.A genuinely bewitching page turner, The Chronicles Of Nightwolf marks the start of an exciting new YA series and certainly deserves to grab a few headlines. Boding well for author C R Beaumont it is highly recommened!\"~Book Viral 2014",
