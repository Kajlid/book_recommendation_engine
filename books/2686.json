  "description": "MUTTS Â is impossibly large. Its subject is the world, all living beings in it, and their relationship with each other. . . . Its touch is incredibly light and gentle, which explains how it alights in your mind and rests there. . . . The way that McDonnell's stories oscillate between gentle comedy and understated pathos is the strip's greatest strength.\"â€”Christopher Brayshaw, Vancouver Review  Animal lovers everywhere adore Patrick McDonnell's charming but pointed MUTTS . The strip strikes a delicate balance between lighthearted fun and social commentaryâ€”on the human condition as well as the animal world.Â The deceptively simple comic follows the adventures of Earl the dog and Mooch the cat, an unlikely best-friend team, and Shtinky Puddin', Sourpuss, Guard Dog, and Crabby.Â Patrick's distinctive cartooning style effectively relays the all-too-real concerns of his characters with entertaining, clever, laugh-out-loud banter.  Infodad.com describes MUTTS as \"humane and funny and gentle and caring and heartfelt and-did we mention funny?\" The site goes on to say that the strip \"includes enough hijinks and outstanding art (yes, art!) to please anyone with a taste for animals and amusement.\"",
