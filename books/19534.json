  "description": "Rahab Carmichael might seem like a perfectly normal teenage girl who's just been transferred to a boarding school, a little lost and very alone. But Rahab is far from normal. Hidden beneath her quiet facade are many secrets. But hiding her strange fears and odd ability only makes it harder for her to try to fit in-something she's never been good at. When Rahab finally does start to make friends, their behavior seems a little odd. Is there a deeper connection between her and these outcast students? She won't be able to find out without the risk of revealing her own secrets. And to make matters worse, she's been getting a lot of unwanted male attention--boys are either flirting with her or teasing her, and she doesn't like either. The worst of the bullying comes from jock John Madison, who can't seem to leave Rahab and her friends alone. As tension rises and John's bullying increases, Rahab wrestles with whether or not to stand up to him. In order to protect her friends, she must face her greatest fear. Into the Flames is the first of the Grover Cleveland Academy books. Approximately 75,000 words.",
