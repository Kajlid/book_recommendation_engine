  "title": "Omega Pathogen",
  "description": "The horrific plague that has spread throughout the world today began in the 1950â€™s, when Soviet geologists searching for valuable minerals happen upon human remains that had been buried for thousands of years. The remains are packaged and shipped to Moscow for further study. Anthropologists studying the remains realize they are ancient and they discover something else, a virus hidden inside the brain tissue of the dead. The virus is ancient and possibly the original form of rabies. Virologists are added to the study. After decades of research, and being turned into a bioweapon, the virus is placed in cold storage and largely forgotten during Glasnost. Over sixty years after the virus is first discovered it is released upon the world. Those infected with the Siberian Cannibalistic Aggressive Rabies virus turn into mad, salivating, primitive forms of their former selves. They seek out and attack nearly anything that moves. Those not infected must flee and kill those with the S.C.A.R. virus to keep from being ripped to shreds or turned into a ravenous version of their former self. In the middle of the mayhem, Jim Matthews and his family try to survive. Jim is a paramedic, an ex-police officer and former private security team medic in Iraq. Jim and his wife and children can no longer hold out in their family home with the hordes of infected growing in number and flee. Jim and his family are compelled by loyalty attempt to travel thousands of miles in the hope they can locate the rest of their family. As they scavenge and fight infected and non-infected marauders along their way, they must rely on each other to have any chance at survival in this new and terrifying world caused by the plague.",
