  "description": "A hundred years ago, the high sorcerer of Velensperia launched a swift and deadly attack against the Draegans--a race of dragon shapeshifters who had always lived in harmony with the humans. The Draegans were all but destroyed, with the few who remained scattered and in hiding. Now, a group of them have united and begun to fight back. Their leader, Keiran Hareldson, seeks to free his people from the cruel repression the high sorcerer's reign has imposed on them.  Gaige Rizik is captain of the sorcerer's High Guard, and known for his lethal ability to hunt down his prey with no remorse. His orders are to infiltrate the Draegan rebels' camp, learn their plans, and identify their leader so he can be destroyed. But when Gaige joins the rebels, posing as a human sympathizer to the Draegans' cause, he discovers the shapeshifters aren't the bloodthirsty beasts he's been led to believe, and their leader is a passionately captivating man who only wants what's best for his people. Keiran sparks powerful emotions in Gaige, tearing down his walls of steely control, and stirring a longing in him he can't deny.  Torn between his duty to the high sorcerer and his growing feelings not only for Keiran, but for the Draegan way of life, Gaige knows he's damned no matter which side he chooses. In a world of lies, deception, and dark secrets, one false move will bring destruction to all he's begun to hold dear. With the fate of so many lives on his shoulders, Gaige's only hope is to follow his heart...and pray it's true enough to save them all.  NOTE: Don't miss the exciting sequel, Lords Of Kellesborne...
