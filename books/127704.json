It is twenty-seven years after the alleged death of Billy the Kid and rumors abound throughout New Mexico and the United States that the Kid is still alive. Those who believe him dead, are labeling the Kid's killer, Pat Garrett, a traitor. While Sheriff Garrett expected a hero's reception for his assassination of William H. Bonney, alias, The Kid, Garrett has become the most despised man in the state. Instead, assassins are now lining up to gun him down. Garrett watches as the Kid's exploits become the stuff of legend, of dime novels and of myth. And the myth continues that the Kid is alive. When an assassin's bullet finds Garrett, many secrets go to the grave with him. Among those secrets is the identity of his own killer.",
