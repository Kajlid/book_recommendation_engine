  "description": "Welcome to Boston, where all your nightmares come to life.... To the tune of a Christmas jingle.Quinn MacKenna learns that the cure for a blinding hangover is simple....Stay in bed, and whatever you do, don’t answer your freaking door. Otherwise, you might find yourself roped into a murder investigation with a psychopath attempting to rewrite the Twelve Days of Christmas as a holiday homicide special, asked to rescue a former international spy, forced to dodge bullets with a Valkyrie, or to take on a power-hungry Fae intent on freezing everything he touches. Hypothetically speaking. In hindsight, snorting crushed aspirin in a dingy alley would have been the wiser choice....Especially when Quinn learns the only way to find the answers she seeks is by...sampling some magically-infused, hallucinogenic flowers. And that someone is waiting for her on the other side of her out-of-body experience. And they've been waiting a very long time.... Welcome the newest antihero in the worldwide best-selling Temple Verse by Shayne Silvers. Join Cameron O’Connell and Shayne at the literary bar to sip a dirty cocktail of feisty Irish brogue - with an unhealthy splash of monsters - today! If you like KF Breene, Shannon Mayer, CN Crawford, Ilona Andrews, or Patricia Briggs, you will love the third installment of the Phantom Queen Diaries.",
