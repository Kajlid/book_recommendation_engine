  "description": "My mother's a witch.  Or an illusionist, street performer, levitating dancer, traveling artist, jewelry maker, or the greatest story teller on earth. Probably all of these rolled into one person.  I'm a pretty good story teller, too. But my mother's the best.   No wands. She's never worn a pointy black hat. I've never seen her cast a spell, but the world changed around her when she wanted it to... Andin Teller can change the world with a pencil and paint brush. Teller isn't just his name. It's what he is--someone who can change memories, reality and even shift time with the right story. But it doesn't come without a cost. When he discovers his mother is part of an otherworldly organized crime family in the middle of a secret war--and has been kidnapped by a rival family, Andin sets out to rescue her with his only two friends, Taryn, a crazy mathematics genius, and deep-thinking, motorcycle-driving Itoshi. With their help, Andin navigates a world he doesn't understand, taking on family betrayers, killers, and others like himself who have powers greater than his own.",
