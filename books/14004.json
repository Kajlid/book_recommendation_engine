The ladies of London's ton clamor for the lacy confections Mary creates, but the earl is seeking something more from her. And he is very persuasive in his pursuit. Gentle, quiet Mary has always avoided romance, but her strong attraction to the adventurous nobleman is immediate and irresistible. Dare she trust the dashing lord with her secrets? She is hiding something—Marcus is certain of it—a clue, perhaps, to explain his sister's untimely death. A sensuous seduction will surely loosen young Mary's tongue,and the determined earl is eager to oblige—for in all his world travels, Marcus has found no treasure more exquisite than she. But is his growing passion for her interfering with his search for the truth?",
