  "description": "Peyton Price Given an assignment to write an article on an outlaw motorcycle club, what award-winning journalist would say no? Not me. I had a weakness for bad-boys, tattoos, and men on motorcycles.  But Nick Navarro wasn't a typical biker. He wasn't even a typical outlaw.  Nick Navarro As president of the Filthy F*ckers MC, when I was offered an opportunity to be interviewed by a local journalist, I didn't accept for the notoriety or the publicity. I agreed to get a shot at the 27 year-old p*ssy between the journalist's legs.  She had plans to get in and get out, and do so quick.  But once I lay claim to something, it's mine.  Until I decide otherwise.",
