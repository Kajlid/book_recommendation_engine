  "description": "Tess Monroe is a werecat on the run. Pursued by Hunters, an elite group of humans tasked with extinguishing the entire shifter species, Tess stumbles upon a safe haven. Due to a long-standing feud, she receives an icy reception. Determined to reunite with her loved ones, she reluctantly accepts the help of, Nate, a werewolf. The attraction to Nate is instantaneous, and Tess finds herself trusting him despite his packs archaic beliefs and traditions. Werecats can’t be trusted. They are the enemy. That’s the motto Nate Tucker grew up with, but when he meets Tess, he can’t help but feel protective of the beautiful feline. He knows that he shouldn’t care about her, and he definitely shouldn’t be attracted to her, let alone desire her, but the feelings are undeniable. Tasked with escorting her to a nearby pride, Nate must fight his passion for Tess. An interspecies romance is strictly forbidden. But as they unravel secrets from the past and discover new threats, a taboo romance is the least of their concerns.",
