  "title": "Cutting Up Two Burroughs",
  "description": "Cutting Up Two Burroughs is inspired by the writings of two very different authors with the same last name -- William S. Burroughs, author of Naked Lunch, and Edgar Rice Burroughs, best known for his science fiction and jungle adventure stories. Mark Leach exploits the cut-up method popularized by William Burroughs to create a science fiction of cold electric horror and burning excrement. Burroughsian text is stripped of its original emotion, meaning and metaphor. Reassembled words are shoveled out and spread across pages with minimal human intervention, revealing an intergalactic war zone ruled by Nebula apes, homoerotic extraterrestrials and The Fold-in Death. Cutting Up Two Burrough embraces language as junk, as detritus, as raw material. The result is robot literature, a science fiction for machines.",
