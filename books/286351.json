Donaghe, author of Cinatis. \"\"A very good story.\"\" -HomoMojo. This revised version of Degranon features more gay characters. On the planet Valchondria, no illness exists, gay marriage is legal, and everyone is a person of color. However, a group called the Maintainers carefully monitors everyone's speech, actions, and weight; the Maintainers also force colorsighted people to hide their ability to see in color. The brilliant scientist Taldra loves her twin gay sons and sees them as the hope for Valchondria's future, but one of them becomes entangled in the cult of Degranon, while the other becomes stranded on the other side of a doorway through time. Can they find their way home and help Taldra save their world?",
