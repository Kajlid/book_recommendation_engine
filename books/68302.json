  "description": "After the death of their father, Jordan moves home to help her brother put him to rest. He breaks the news one night that evidence has come to light that they might not actually be related. Which puts a whole new spin on the vivid sexual fantasies they’ve had for years. Fantasies about each other. There’s a very un-sibling-like attraction between Jordan and Gareth and it’s bubbling to the surface more and more with each day they spend together. A little knowledge can be powerful.The question becomes, do they wait to sort it all out? Jordan wants to learn the pleasure of pain, and she knows her brother can teach her. Gareth is more than happy to give instructions, because he just wants Jojo, he’s wanted her for a very long time. So do they wait, or do they proceed, because…what if they’re wrong?",
