  "description": "IACP Cookbook Award Finalist Nobody knows herbs and spices like Tony Hill, owner of Seattle's famed World Merchants Spice, Herb & Teahouse. Now, in this acclaimed book, Hill gives us a comprehensive guide to these essential flavorings based on his travels around the globe. Blending culinary history, the lore of the spice routes, and his own inimitable tasting notes, he profiles more than 125 herbs and spices, ranging from the familiar to the exotic. He gives practical information and advice, including how best to use nine popular chiles, what distinguishes true cinnamon from cassia cinnamon, and why it makes a difference where your bay leaf comes from—plus more than 75 delicious recipes for distinctively spiced dishes. To top it all off, Hill reveals the secret recipes for 85 of his signature herb and spice blends, including barbecue rubs, mulling spices, chili powders, chai mixes, and curry powders. Complete with 185 color photographs, The Spice Lover's Guide to Herbs & Spices is an indispensable culinary reference that is both a pleasure to cook with and enjoyable to read. \"Hill . . . is way ahead of cookbook authors who cling to parsley in a cilantro world. . . . This is the book for anyone who has been lucky enough to find grains of paradise or Aleppo pepper and wonders where to go from there.\" —Regina Schrambling, Los Angeles Times \"Even those who never cook may find themselves often dipping into this intriguing read.\" —CeCe Sullivan, The Seattle Times",
