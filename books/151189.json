  "description": "Bree Simpson has her dream job at the family company. However, recent events have turned that dream into a nightmare. Bree has learned to tolerate a lot as one of the few women in an executive position in the construction industry. But when the normal bullying tactics turn aggressive and threaten her project in Atlanta, Bree decides to go on the offensive. Convinced an architect is out to destroy her project, Bree decides it's time to give Logan Ward a piece of her mind. Despite being thousands of miles away in London, successful architect Logan Ward finds himself on the receiving end of \"B. Simpson's\" angry messages from across the pond. Deciding to handle B. Simpson’s demands himself, Logan heads to Atlanta only to discover things are not what they seem, starting with the sexy woman he rescues after an accident on the job site. Only time will tell if a case of mistaken identity can turn hate into love—but time may not be a luxury they can afford. Can Logan and Bree discover their real selves and true love in time or will everything be torn down around them?",
