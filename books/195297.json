  "description": "An alternate title/cover for this ASIN can be found here and here.When life turns to hell, most people talk about running away. Abbi Mitchell actually does it. Determined to escape her humiliating heartbreak and her overbearing mother, Abbi takes a summer job at a resort in Alaska. It's supposed to be four months of snow-capped mountains, peaceful wilderness, and figuring out if she should wait for her lifelong sweetheart to come back, as he has promised he'll do.  Instead, it's Henry Wolf.  Owner of the luxury hotel chain, Henry Wolf is cool and composed, successful with everything he touches, and undeniably beautiful. And for some reason Abbi can't fathom, he wants her—the farm girl from small town, USA with no corporate experience—as his personal assistant.  Abbi scrambles to meet his professional demands while she battles her growing attraction to him. Physical feelings she shouldn't have because he's her boss, because she's way out of her league with him, and because they'll never be reciprocated.  Until they are.  Will Abbi be able to let go of herself—her values, her dreams, and her inhibitions—to give him all that he's demanding of her?  *** WARNING: This book has a lot of story and a lot of sex in it. Not suitable for readers under 18 years of age, or people who don't like to read about sex.",
