  "title": "High Strange Horror: Weird Tales of Paranoia and the Damned",
  "description": "What is High Strange? It's the men in black erasing your UFO research. It's a corporate takeover by bio-occult horrors. It's losing your edge, and finding it again at the bottom of the cosmos. It's your television telling you to eat your government-approved genetically-modified breakfast cereal. It's the unexplained lights in the sky and the faceless gray woman haunting your dreams. It's ancient legends working under contract. It's the forbidden film playing at a haunted movie theater. It's the medical staff making sure you stay crazy. It's the 19th round of mini golf with a disembodied pirate. It's the outer reaches of human experience. Where conventional reality ends, High Strange begins. Over a dozen authors mine the deepest reaches of consciousness and Fortean phenomena. Are you ready to see what lies beyond the veil?",
