  "description": "\"The Katurran Odyssey\" is a remarkable visual achievement, filled with spectacle, fantasy, and wonder on every page. This epic tale of faith, hope, and selfless heroism is illuminated by the stunning illustrations of Terryl Whitlatch, the principal creature designer for the Star Wars prequels, and is brought to dynamic life by the storytelling of screenwriter and author David Michael Wieger.Bo-hibba is a remote island in a faraway time and place that is populated by animals who are at once fantastic and startlingly real. The island's survival is threatened by the Long Winter, and not even the High Priest's ancient ceremony of renewal can put an end to the suffering from the hunger and the cold.Katook, a small but courageous young lemur, lives in the village of Kattakuk. When he dares to enter a forbidden area on the island and witnesses a shocking act, the outraged priests banish him from the island forever. Forced to journey across the vast sea in search of a new home, Katook encounters great perils and marvels on his quest and undergoes profound tests of trust and friendship. At last, he finds the place where the secret of the Long Winter is revealed and where he must confront his greatest fear if he is to save his family and his island home.Like such classic works of fantasy as Tolkien's \"Lord of the Rings,\" Rien Poortvliet's \"Gnomes,\" C. S. Lewis's \"Chronicles of Narnia,\" Brian Jacques's \"Redwall\" series, and Brian Froud's \"Faeries,\" \"The Katurran Odyssey\" creates a mythic world imbued with beauty, adventure, and transcendent imagination.",
