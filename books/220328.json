It is a rediscovery of our southern heritage and a renewal of our fascination with the wonders of our ancient world. Dr. Holt's photographs delightfully recreate her experiences and adventures in the small town of Monticello, an eclectic town with a rich, but little known history nestled in the natural beauty of Jefferson County, Florida.",
