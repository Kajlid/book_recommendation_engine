  "description": "The peaceful life in the forest is disturbed one day when something very unusual happens-a dispute starts among all the animals over the title of â€œthe bestâ€. Everyone thinks that they deserve to be named the best as they present their special qualities before the others. But after days of continuous arguments, they find themselves unable to resolve the issue and then turn to the Animal King for a decision. But surprisingly to all, the King declares that no one is the best. He then explains that everyone is different and special in their own way. Each one of them has their unique talent that makes them shine so it is important to appreciate and respect each other.",
