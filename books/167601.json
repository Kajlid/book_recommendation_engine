  "description": "Scottish high crimes and sexy misdemeanors … The Kilt Complex finds former state trooper Alex Dominguez out of his element—on the shore of a distant sea, far from the comfort of his Nevada mountains, guilt-plagued for rejecting the bed of his handsome lover. Castle laird Rory, whose life mantra has always been cum and go, is uncharacteristically flustered by his own deepening feelings for dark-eyed Alex. The singular act of Alex’s moving out of the castle seems to spark both men to come to terms with their intense love affair. Can each of them overcome deep-seated guilt and build a solid relationship on the hot coals of desire? Tracking the story of a lost dog, the men become enmeshed in a deadly chain of events. From the perilous cliffs on the North Sea to the grounds of the Scottish Parliament, and from the luxury of a millionaire’s digs to the rude oak barrels of a native fisherman, Rory and Alex find they must finally confront their complex feelings for each other in order to survive the trap of a killer.",
