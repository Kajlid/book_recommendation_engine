  "description": "Joe R. Lansdale compiles and introduces 26 of his own favorite and most violent dark horror tales in this review of his work. \"God of the Razor\" introduces the dark god behind serial killers. A martial arts fight to the death between a reluctant champion and a sadistic alpha male is featured in \"Master of Misery.\" Human sacrifice to ensure prosperity and as a coming-of-age ritual, are themes of \"On a Dark October\" and \"Duck Hunt.\" In \"The Fat Man,\" young boys learn the hard way that some mysteries should not be investigated. Many of the tales are truly weird, such as \"Chompers,\" a story of false teeth with an appetite. All of the stories are individually introduced by Lansdale, who explains the humorous, weird, and sometimes sad genesis for each.",
