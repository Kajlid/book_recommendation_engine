  "description": "What happened to the Hamelin children after they were whisked away by the Pied Piper? Here, two of them offer their versions - Simon Pullitt in his whimsical way, writes his Chronicle of the Truth while Jessop, in plain-speaking no-nonsense way gives a far more elaborate account.Two worlds, vastly different, exist side by side and it is only when the inhabitants of both become sexually aware and decide to come together that the problems really begin.Without parents to guide them, who will provide their moral compass? Is their guardian, The Piper, up to the task or will someone else have to step up? Each of them has his or her own ideas about that!",
