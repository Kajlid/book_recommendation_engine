After Rob sold his ranch and Matty hung up his skates, they started a new life together in New York City.

Rob struggles to stay in control, and after a well-intentioned anniversary gift goes awry, he still thinks he can handle the fallout. But the concrete jungle is closing in and his coping skills are unraveling.Their love is deep, but Rob will have to admit the truth about what he really wants before they both tumble into chaos.",
