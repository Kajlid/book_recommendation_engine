  "description": "Juniper Window is confronted by the Witch of El Malpais during a night with a full moon. She chases him into a blowhole maze deep beneath the earth where he confronts great lizards in a great cavern by an underground river. The largest of the lizards, who speaks in Juniper's mind, telling the 15 year old that he is a dragon, helps Juniper escape the deep underground.This begins a great magic realism adventure that includes conflict between elder dragons and the dragon leader underground, the revelation that the dangerous Witch of El Malpais is really Juniper's mother, and a devastating event where two bullies on meth send Juniper to the hospital badly injured and struggling.Inside the Blowholes is a story of a Christmas miracle set in the lava country of New Mexico's El Malpais National Monument. It portrays the Navajo, Pueblo, and white cultures of the Southwest while telling a story of discovery and great dragons living in the 21st century even while they are relegated to the status of myths.",
