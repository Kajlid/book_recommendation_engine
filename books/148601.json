  "description": "Raised by wolves, were-hyena Whisper Callahan has spent the better part of her life struggling to fit into a world where she’s the odd one out. Her adopted family loves her, of that she has no doubt, but now they’re encouraging her to connect with her own kind. At an annual gathering of unmated were-hyenas in Pennsylvania, Whisper finds herself torn between the past she never knew and the family who raised her as their own.Were-hyenas Nyte, Azrael, and Fade don’t expect much to come from the gathering except a few days off from work at Stone’s Gym in Dalton, Kentucky. They don’t expect to follow the sound of tears and find their mate crying in the woods. And they certainly don’t expect to find themselves trying to protect her from her own family while she comes to terms with all that she learns about herself and her past. But hyenas are nothing if not protective of their mates, and they’re willing to do whatever it takes to keep her safe. And keep her forever.It wouldn’t be a Hyena Heat novel without plenty of hot m/f/m/m loving, three males that would do anything for their mate, and a female that is in need of love. Expect plenty of possessive behavior and excessive use of the word ‘mine’.",
