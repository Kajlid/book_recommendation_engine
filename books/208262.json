  "description": "Mal isn’t the only human in the Gillham Pack, but he is the only unmated one. He knows most members view him as an outsider for that, but he has his friends, and it’s enough for him. That’s what he tries to convince himself of anyway.  Will still isn’t over Heath, even though his ex-boyfriend mated with Jayden nine months ago. It’s not only the fact that Heath mated that hurts him. Heath lost his memory, and he doesn’t remember Will and the years they had together. Will knows it’s not Heath’s fault, but he still keeps his distance, even if that means staying away from the only family he has.  Will and Mal crash into each other and Will immediately realizes what Mal is to him. The distance between their homes put a strain on their budding relationship, as does the reappearance of Mal’s abusive ex-boyfriend, and the ever-present danger of the new council trying to get rid of the pack. Will they be able to find solutions to their problems or will one of them finally tear them apart?",
