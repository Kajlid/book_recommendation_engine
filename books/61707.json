  "description": "A mysterious love letter, no name and no return address shows up in a soldier’s hands looking for her lost Beloved Soldier, unable to find him to reaches out to a soldier who perhaps no longer feels the reach of his woman hoping to touch someone that will in turn bring back her beloved. Army Specialist Christian Brice was the first to receive the letter coming only a month after his fiancé had sent him a Dear John, so moved and touched he writes her back, but unable to send it directly he shares both the letter and his correspondence with others like him and thus begins the journey of a woman’s heartfelt words across a war torn area to deliver a sweet kiss to those who need to feel it. Word spreads of the Beloved Woman and so does the number of correspondences, some of passion and appreciation, others sharing a far more open and sensual fantasy with her, each one added to the bundle that carries her from one soldier to the next, until she lands in the hands of Airforce Senior Airman Miles Conley who comes across the man it was intended for.
