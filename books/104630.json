  "description": "Phoenix, a hot-tempered Fire Elemental stationed in Manhattan, didn’t think life could get any worse. To improve his people skills, he is demoted from Wall Street fat-cat to lowly paramedic, where he must deal with humans at their very worst--and most vulnerable. The humans he has protected for centuries, but never dared get close to.Abby, an ER doctor who lives for the job, notices an emerging pattern. Suicide attempts have skyrocketed, flooding her ER with victims. Coma patients go missing with no explanation. In her quest to learn the truth, the last thing she needs is a cocky paramedic with a chip on his shoulder. But when they are forced to pair up, tempers ignite. Abby is stunned and fearful to discover Phoenix is an Elemental being; Phoenix learns that the rampant suicides befalling Manhattan are not a coincidence, but a planned strategy. Carlyle, leader of the evil Fallen Angel clan, has garnered special powers and has a new agenda--one that will reap innocent souls by the thousands. Together, Phoenix and Abby must overcome their differences and save humanity--before they become the next target in Carlyle’s crosshairs.",
