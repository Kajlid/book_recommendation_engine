  "description": "The closing of a definitive two-volume history, First Ladies is the fascinating examination of the modern role of the Presidents' wives. Enlisting the cooperation of all living First Ladies and gleaning new perspectives from interviews with their families, friends, and staffs, Carl Sferrazza Anthony reveals the remarkable influence of their office. From Jacqueline Kennedy's plan to begin an arts and humanities department to Lady Bird Johnson's impact on the environment; from Pat Nixon's diplomatic missions to Africa and South America to Betty Ford's controversial feminist views; from Rosalynn Carter's agenda of social welfare legislation to Nancy Reagan's media savvy and Barbara Bush's literacy programs, First Ladies shows how seven women heightened awareness and lowered resistance to change, how they often became victims of unvalidated speculation and national tragedy. Their considerable power as unelected presidential advisers was generally underestimated. Now, in First Ladies , the balance of power is authoritatively weighed.",
