  "description": "Alex Cander had her life all planned out – mom married off, check. Police academy graduation (all done in secret) – double check. Assigned to one of the biggest cases in her county – triple check.  Yet Alex knew this smooth ride couldn’t last long.  Sure enough all hell breaks loose, literally, when her stepfather asks her to help his sons get acquainted to their surroundings. Not only were her supposed stepbrothers claiming her as theirs, but it turns out they are demons. On top of this, she learns that her own grandparents weren’t even human?  And that’s no even the half of it!  A being called Darkness has stepped forward claiming her as well. Now she is mated to three demons that not only control her every movement, but also her heart…someone pinch her please.",
