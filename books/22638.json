She’s lost one leg to diabetes, and the next infection could kill her. She enters a nursing home ready to flout authority and kick administrative butt until the chill realities of institutionalization nearly flatten her. She soon calls it the Fun House for the scary sights and sounds that await her there. Lily grapples with suicide until she becomes drawn in by the other residents and staffers – a quirky and eccentric crew with enough idiosyncrasies of their own to keep Lily intrigued. Prepare for a few surprises along the way. Things get worse when the nursing home threatens to close leaving Lily no other place to go. How she, her daughter and her new friends handle this challenge shows that each stage of life can be its own adventure.
