  "description": "Donna Swanson has been the sheriff of New Castle long enough to know something is terribly wrong in her town…  With its peaceful Appalachian streams and a homely diner where the residents congregate over pie, New Castle seems like the least sinister place on earth. Then a new restaurant opens, and a wave of deadly illness ravages the town. Is it a coincidence, or has evil appeared in their midst, cleverly disguised as restauranteurs? Donna’s duty demands she discover what’s going on before the disease wipes out her town.  Jo Harwood didn’t ask to be a monster, and Bobby Weeks would do anything to take back her curse…  Bobby thinks they can make a fresh start in New Castle, a quiet place where he can teach her how to control the monster inside her. But when Jo’s desire for independence clashes with Bobby’s need for control, she takes off, and Bobby races to find her before she transforms into the beast.  Luna Blanche tries to accept her new identity, and to accept the gruesome truth about John Turner.  Luna tries to adapt to her role as Woman in the Woods—priestess of the desperate residents surrounding Mississippi’s Delta—while John struggles with his anger and hatred. Since his resurrection, he’s been driven to abominable acts. He wants Luna to love him, but how could she love a monster?  Dark forces are converging on New Castle, Virginia. Can conflicts be put aside before evil consumes them all?",
