  "description": "To be released Summer, 2016. Read The Life Tree by Nicholas McGirr to begin this collection.“Make me a tree for all I care.”Let me elaborate just a bit on this judgment. Whatever you think “death” is and the transition into all things holy at the pearly gates is somewhat a crock. Shocker, right? Actual souls floating around like orbs in a vastness that can’t be explained. For each one of us, it’s different. I, for example, see things in a very open space. But I move slowly, probably because of my drunken stupor in life. Others have told me that the faster you can move about, the more your surroundings take shape.",
