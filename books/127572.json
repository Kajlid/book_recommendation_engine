  "description": "Heard of strong language? This romance features superhero-strength language. Foul-mouthed curmudgeon Stephanie Love has one bright spot in her life and it definitely has nothing to do with romance. Being cheated on by her wealthy louse of a boyfriend, and making a (mostly unintentional) attempt at homicide, are the least of her worries. She's on the fast track to becoming News Director--until a corporation buys out the station she works for, that is. Charming, gorgeous, and arrogant, Chance Valentine has little patience for Stephanie's smart mouth and her crass, overly outspoken personality. Nothing overshadows the immediate dislike they take to one another--except the intense sexual chemistry they share. When he not only refuses to give Stephanie her promotion, but gives the gig to her adversary, Stephanie's had enough. While she's busy making plans to use him to get what she wants, he has a strategy of his own. He'll make the grumpy temptress fall in love, and then he'll break her heart. It doesn't take him long, however, to realize he's met his match. Through a series of steamy encounters, they quickly discover that even the best revenge schemes can go off course...and lead straight to love.",
