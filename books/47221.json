  "description": "The President has been kidnapped. There will be no ransom – no negotiations. Either the President’s forces withdraw from the Terrorist’s lands or, in three days on the stroke of midnight, he will be executed on live TV.Hiding out in a cave in the desert with his master and fellow kidnappers, Hassan believes the battle is almost won. Then, from the burning, empty plains a man in black appears. He carries only an antique dagger at his waist and a small golden bird in a cage. His purpose, he claims, is to help them in their mission. He has been sent by his master. And torture is his trade.",
