  "description": "Zohar-Beyond the BlackWhole is the unfurling of a seven hundred-year mystery. First came Zohar, meaning the most mystical of all Jewish texts. Then two hundred years later came Cabala, the key to Zohar. Only in modern times can her great vision be corroborated by scientific fact. Now is the time to turn the key and open the door, showing the way to a beautiful future. The words of Zohar promise to become relevant at the End of Days, before the six-thousand-year Jewish calendar runs out in 220 years. Independent scholar dovid Krafchow has deciphered the past and written a book for the ages. His insight places a demarcation line, pinning the present to the quickly approaching Thousand Years of Woman and Peace. Only through modern-day technology can we remove the veiled metaphor covering the naked Truth. Zohar brings Brilliance to the Earth, the center of the Universe, where God's desire to be known at the lowest level of creation is realized. Whereas others see Zohar from the outside, creating a fantasy of who she is from how she looks, dovid Krafchow has an intimate knowledge of the text from within. The author of twenty books, he is a lifelong purveyor of secrets plumbing the depth of Jewish wisdom. The purpose of his latest book is to provoke a worldwide awakening. God, the Creator is here-everywhere, for everyone, always-the original Jewish message delivered by Avraham four thousand years ago. Zohar-Beyond the BlackWhole illuminates the darkness, revealing the hidden secret about life and creation.",
