  "description": "A widowed rancher, a rebellious child, and the woman who comes to help. Falling in love wasn’t part of the deal.Corra Jameson doesn’t think of herself as a spinster and is content to spend quiet evenings with her books. Paper beaus, her sister calls them, teasing her about the stories Corra reads. But when a rugged widower asks her to come to his ranch for the summer to help him with his tomboy daughter, she sees opportunity to earn a side of beef for her sister’s family. Besides, she has nothing to lose in the arrangement. Except perhaps her heart.Widowed rancher Josiah Hanacker’s sister-in-law threatens to take his daughter away from him if he can’t raise her like a lady. Since he can’t, he needs a woman to do the job for him. Corra Jameson, the spinster who works at the Ford Junction boarding house may have just what his ranch-raised girl needs, and he hires her as a lady-trainer. Trouble is, he hadn’t figured she’d have what his lonely heart needed as well.Re-released from the 2016 ECPA bestselling Barbour collection, The Cowboy’s Bride.",
