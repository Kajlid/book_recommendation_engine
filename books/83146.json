  "title": "The Journals of Raymond Brooks",
  "description": "Raymond Brooks was born a thousand years ago. An orphaned boy lost in a foreign land, growing up during the Dark Ages was no easy feat. Reaching old age was highly unlikely. Surviving to see the turn of a millennium? Impossible! These are the journals of Raymond Brooks, a mythical figure from the Dark Ages, uncovering the mysteries and adventures he experienced during his unimaginable lifespan. The journals force humanity to face a terrible realization—there are monsters of horrifying power hidden from mortal eyes. They pretend to be sheep when they are wolves, pulling our strings and making us dance—until now. Could supernatural creatures really walk amongst us? And if they do, they must preserve their secrecy at all costs. Why then would Raymond commit virtual suicide by revealing their existence? What happens now, when all hell breaks loose?",
