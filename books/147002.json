After separating for months, she believes that Collin still feels the same, but they struggle to overcome the obstacles that keep them from being together. While house hunting, Victoria reconnects with an old friend, Preston James, who attempts to steal her heart. She is suddenly distracted by his presence, but deep down she knows what she wants. Emerging in more ways than one, Victoria explores a racier sex life, the opportunity to travel, finding her independence, and falling in love again.

Can Victoria free herself from her dark past so she can finally open her heart to her one true love? Diamond Love is the second installment of the epically emotional Moonstone Dreams Series.",
