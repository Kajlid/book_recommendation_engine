Her 5 year old triplets keep her grounded, she is passionately in love with her husband, and her pack is thriving. But when her children begin asking questions about how her father died, painful memories resurface. In a heart-warming dream, her father convinces her that it is time to share those memories with her most trusted mate, Levi, in order to heal once and for all. But will reliving the stormiest time in her life finally give Charity the peace and closure she so desperately needs? Or will it open a door, ushering in a danger that none of them are prepared for?",
