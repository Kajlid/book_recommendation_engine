  "description": "Based around Celtic myth and legend, this novel is set in a strange and compelling underwater world, Durbren, the Green Kingdom. Jack Fisher, the young hero, learns on his sixteenth birthday that he is the Champion of the Green Kingdom, and fated to fight Grimlow, Lord of the Abyss, who threatens the Green Kingdom. But Jack is an earthling--his home has always been the village by the river, though in recent times, he has felt very unwelcome there. So he follows Vagan, a merman aristocrat, and Shellycoat, a puckish water-spirit, into the lands of the Green prince, journeying first to the Riverland, then Lakeland, and then into the Green Kingdom itself. Along the way, he finds knowledge, love but also pain--and when at last he has to confront Grimlow, it is not at all sure that he will survive..",
