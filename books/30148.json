  "description": "To the tiny community of the Drook into which the foundling is adopted, Aurora, as they name her, with her shock of white hair, one blue eye and one brown, seems clearly enchanted. Throughout her early years, she displays behaviour the locals find spending most of her time outside, alone on the beautiful barren landscape, the girl seems closer to nature than to the world of people. Filled with the lore of shipwrecks, icebergs, whales, gardens, food, fabric and folk art, Latitudes of Melt is also an unforgettable love story as Aurora grows to adulthood and meets the son of the lighthouse keeper who shares her passion for reading. But it is only when Aurora is herself an old woman that the reader is taken to Ireland and England to learn the heart-wrenching story behind the baby's miraculous survival on the ice.",
