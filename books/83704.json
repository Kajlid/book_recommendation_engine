  "description": "The worst day of Lacey Baxter’s life was the day her parents announced their divorce and her boyfriend Chase Livingston went into a coma. Scratch that. The worst day of her life was two months later, when he woke up and didn’t recognize her. Now, as he pushes her away, she clings to the hope that each day will be the day he remembers how much they love each other. Turning to her new BFF Byron and his circle of friends, she does whatever she can to cope with the changes. She just wants to be numb and forget about everything.The headaches, the panic attacks, the pressure to be this perfect boyfriend are incredibly hard for Chase to bear. He doesn’t love Lacey, or at least he doesn’t think he does. Still, he doesn’t understand this strong attraction to her, or the jealousy he feels over every guy that talks to her. Losing two years of his memory means strangers think they know him and he’s not sure where he fits in. Will his memories come back over time or all at once? Should he even wish for them?Finding each other again could be harder than either of them thought, especially when everyone knows their business and has an opinion about it.",
