The underwater scenes are marvelous, and the portrait of the monstrous hurricane as it batters the key and surges over it is mightily gripping.\" --the Florida Weekly... Death Sweeps in off the Gulf of Mexico... An ageless, impossible corpse at the bottom of the sea. A lethal plague. A ruthless murderer. A monster hurricane.

When Carson Grant discovers the body of a man at the bottom of the sea, suspicion of murder falls squarely upon him.

With a hurricane bearing down on the quarantined island, Grant enlists infectious diseases researcher Kyoko Nakamura and teen misfit Charley Fawcett in a desperate race against time to break the spiral of death and unravel the mystery of a decades-old corpse and a staggeringly valuable prize shrouded in secrets of the past. Pitted against them is a killer who will stop at nothing to claim that prize.
