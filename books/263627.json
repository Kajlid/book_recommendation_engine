  "description": "It is almost impossible to envision what childhood would be like without the enchanting world of of fairyland. The snow-queen, the mermaid's son, ogres and dwarfs, monsters and magicians, fairies and giants - these are the companions who thrill boys and girls of all lands and all times, as Andrew Lang's phenomenally successful collection of stories have proved. From the day that they were first printed, the Lang fairy tale books of many colors have entertained thousands of youngsters, as they have also brought pleasure to the parents who have read these classics to their children.The Pink Fairy Book contains 41 tales from Japan, Scandinavia, Sicily, Africa, and the Catalonian tradition. They range from such familiar stories as Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Snow-Queen\" and \"The Fir-Tree\" to virtually unknown tales of the Tanuki, and unforgettable Japanese creatures; of the strange labors demanded by a generous troll; for the cruel treatment given lovely Maiden Bright-eye; and of many other people and happenings that are different enough to captivate young imaginations, but familiar enough so that boys and girls everywhere will listen and understand.",
