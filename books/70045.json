  "description": "A champion show jumper is replaced by a look-alike, but the switch isn't discovered for months. Comfortable in the safe world of equine photography, ex-cop Kim Kovak thinks she has finally moved past the terror of a routine patrol that changed her life forever. Then a simple photo shoot catapults her into the middle of a cunning and dangerous ring of horse thieves. Old habits die hard and Kim goes after the truth with a vengeance.Private investigator Garrett Quaid is determined to expose whoever is organizing a series of thefts where ringers are used and big insurance claims are paid. A quiet loner, Quaid doesn't welcome the meddling of one pushy photographer who always seems to be one jump ahead of him.Together, and often at odds, Kovak and Quaid try to out-sleuth each other and, in the process, learn the chilling truth about the crimes.",
