  "title": "The Thorough Check",
  "description": "So much has been talked about to quell the great religious divide in India. But it pervades like a dust storm all across the society, politics, business, and intelligentsia. Here is an honest attempt to see the nation first, a nation that cannot afford to talk divisive after sweltering for hundreds of years under foreign rule and their loot. This is the story of a police officer, who puts his life at stake in protecting the country. Narrated at the backdrop of some scintillating scenes of love, passion, and adventure, it keeps the readers glued to the content. The earthly appeal, scenic locales, and the contemporary relevance, make it a darling for all age groups. The book creates yet another “Tryst of Destiny,” this time in the twenty first century. The protagonist achieves what the creators of this nation could not, a change of heart of the hardliners. A must read for the world citizens of tomorrow – Vasudaivakudumbakam.",
