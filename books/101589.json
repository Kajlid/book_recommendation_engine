  "description": "Despite growing up in rival towns, Grady Rock and I were high school best friends.But now?Now, he's my biggest enemy. My dirty-talking, master-baking, grudge-holding, hot-as-sin enemy.All I wanted was to help my mom run her bakery after a family emergency left her unable to do it herself.Never mind that I can't bake. Or that I never wanted to move home again. Or that this is the hardest thing I've ever done and I could use a friend right now.All Grady freaking Rock cares about now is that I'm his competition .It's town against town. Bakery against bakery. Old friend against old friend.Until Grady finds out why I'm back home.And suddenly, Mr. Get Out of My Way is more like the boy I knew in high school. But older. Wiser. And infinitely more irresistible.I resisted his charm in high school for the sake of my future. But if I give in to it now, am I sleeping with the enemy?Dirty Talking Rival is a deliciously fun friends-to-enemies-to-lovers romantic comedy featuring a smooth-talking baker, the one who got away, and a goat with more matchmaking tendencies than a nosy old grandpa. It stands alone with no cheating or cliffhangers.",
