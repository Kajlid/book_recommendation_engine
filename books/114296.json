  "description": "A collection of Frank Reardon's most recent work that covers the transitions of the poet as he has traversed the country and developed his style into a diverse and heartfelt voice that creates hope inside the turmoil of modern living while painting vivid images for readers to walk into like a road worn pair of shoes gifted to a barefoot traveler in order to make it a little bit further down the road. \"Read Frank Reardon at your own risk. He'll open your heart with a corkscrew and leave you wide-eyed and longing for more.\" -Dan Fante, author of Chump Change, Mooch,\"86'd\" and Spitting Off Tall Buildings",
