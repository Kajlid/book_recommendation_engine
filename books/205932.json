  "description": "Sixteen wacky personalities marooned on a tropical island, a series of diabolical challenges, a million dollar prize, sexual tension, ribald humor, romance, greed, paranoia...Castaway. Castaway: where Survivor meets Gilligan's Island in The Twilight Zone. Sixteen men and women are stranded on a tropical islandwith an intrusive camera crew and a psychotic producer, where they fight for survival, TV ratings, and a million dollar prize. The winner is anyone who loves thrill-a-minute misadventures, gut-busting laughs, and broad-minded women. The premise may be familiar, though the contestants are anything but, when a desperate network owner is hell-bent on blockbuster ratings and casts the show accordingly.  Shannon, a budding novelist and former network employee, falls deeply in lust with tall, dark, paranoid Ryan, a Kentucky survivalist who is determined to win. \"The course of true love never did run smooth,\" Shakespeare said. Even he couldn't have imagined the road bumps Shannon and Ryan will encounter en route to love and hot monkey sex.  The women are not only star-crossed, but insect-infested and sand crab bitten. In this irreverent spoof, which focuses on an industry where nothing is as it seems, and no one can be trusted, Shannon and Ryan pull out all the stops to 'get the girl'and win the prize. Join them as they discover the best thing about Paradise is each other.",
