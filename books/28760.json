For Magnius Zoleki and the others, the trick is to find it without getting caught.In the weeks following the Xuranian triumph, humankind finds itself on the brink of ruin. Amii Martin speeds from planet to planet, where she hunts dissidents and punishes civil disobedience with death.

As the rebel cause takes shape, Magnius finds help in unexpected places. Enigmatic strangers. Former friends. Bitter rivals. There's just one catch. To exact their freedom, Magnius needs to go through Amii and end her days as the Butcher of Hope. He may not have a chance in hell of convincing her to join the rebellion, but if he can't, he'll be forced to kill herâ€”before she learns he's one of them and he's next on her execution list.Astra: The Harrowing is the third and final novel in the Astra saga.",
