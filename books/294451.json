  "description": "I thought Hillcrest and the handsome, sexy students in it would be my undoing. I was wrong. This place isn’t a new start. The feud between Sawyer, Travis, and Declan doesn’t matter. It never did. I was blind to it, but what happened to Will and what happened to me has opened my eyes. I, Ashley Bonds, am a liar. These pretty boys don’t know the real me, but they’re about to find out just how twisted I really am. Hillcrest was never going to be my end. My ruin has been with me all along, watching, waiting, stalking. A true monster in the darkness. When my past comes to light, everything I built here, everything I have with the guys is over. The truth is a bitch, and it cuts like a knife in the gut. This is my unraveling. *Skank is a darker romance, meaning there are topics that might offend you. Self-harm, suicide, stalking, bullying themes, and more to come. Be warned.*",
