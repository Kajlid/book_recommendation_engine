  "title": "The Earth is a Floating Sphere: A Care-Free Collection of Poems and Stories",
  "description": "This is a collection of some of my most bizarre and unusual writings. In these writings I have tried to capture every feeling imaginable, from the joy felt on Thanksgiving Day to the fear experienced on the battle field. You will enter the mysterious city of Ekerbraun, walk in the shoes of a “Low Fellow” and marvel in amazement at Susan the talking dog. You will also find an array of unusual and random photographs. I will warn you, however: these poems and stories are not meant to fall into any known category, which is why I have labeled them “Care-Free.” You will have to think hard about some of the writings if you are to discover a meaning.",
