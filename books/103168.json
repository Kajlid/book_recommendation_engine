  "title": "Stillways: A Memoir",
  "description": "From Steve Bisley, one of Australia′s favourite actors, comes a classic memoir of an Australian childhood in the '60s.Growing up on a farm called Stillways, Steve daydreamed about cars and escape. His story is about him hero-worshipping his older brother with Brylcreem in his hair; going to school as a young kid with bus money knotted into a hanky and clutching his Globite school case; fighting bullies at school and dreaming about girls.But there′s a darker thread running through the story: the father who′d take out his frustrations by savagely belting his young children; a struggling mother who′d do anything to protect her kids; a young boy irrevocably marked by his father′s anger.",
