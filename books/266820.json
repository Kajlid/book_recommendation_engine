  "description": "\"Moving, heart-felt prose poems by the beloved and much admired Bengali poet and mystic who first achieved international fame (and a Nobel Prize) in 1913 with his translation of these moving poems. Reminiscent of Blake and Gibran, they include many works that are almost biblical in their rhythms, phrasing and images. A collection of over one hundred inspirational poems, Gitanjali covers the breadth of life's experiences, from the quite pleasure of observing children at play to man's struggle with his god.",
