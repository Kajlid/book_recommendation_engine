  "description": "All her life Tate Vasilievich has felt overshadowed by her younger, vivacious sister Katie. Always an outsider in her own family due to her weight, Tate finally feels she's found her place now that she is in college. When Tate’s mother calls, pleading for her to come home and deal with her sister’s latest rebellion, Tate worries that her future is in jeopardy. A week later she wakes in her own grave, no memory of how she got there.  Now Tate finds herself with an incredible ability to heal and a nearly overwhelming craving for blood, and no answers as to what happened the night she died and her sister disappeared. She has little time to adjust to her new existence when it becomes clear that powerful forces are determined to hunt her down for doing the unspeakable: stealing immortality from a group that does not bestow it lightly. With nowhere else to turn, Tate forms an uneasy alliance with Malek, a doctor who has dedicated his life to the destruction of vampires. As Tate seeks answers about her deeply troubled sister, she must also struggle with a burgeoning eating disorder and her conflicted feelings for Malek. When the truth finally comes to light Tate is faced with horrifying secrets decades in the making and an even more pressing question: how far will she go to save her sister?",
