  "description": "Glamour, mystery, romance, humor and webbed toes are all back in full fin as rambunctious mer-socialite Juna Lee Poinfax invades the dignified coastal world of the Bonavendier clan. Determined to chronicle Mer life for her on-line journal, Juna Lee instead dives into Lilith Bonavendier's latest scheme to awaken the \"inner mermaid\" in an unsuspecting distant relative. World-famous author M.M. (Molly) Revere--who writes the mega-successful Water Hyacinth series, about a group of children who are secretly mermaids--is a shy, plain-footed young woman with nothing but vague clues to her extraordinary family link to the mer world. After Juna Lee--working for Lilith--lures the likable Molly to the Georgia coast, both Molly and Juna Lee find themselves in the middle of trouble. Mer-hunk Rhymer McEvers has come to Sainte's Point Island to hide his three remarkable nieces from their mysterious and possibly murderous mer-father--a man who may be more myth than reality, but dangerous either way. Molly has to face the reality of her heritage while falling in love with the enigmatic Rhymer and helping him protect his nieces from a danger so amazing even the Water People can barely believe it.",
