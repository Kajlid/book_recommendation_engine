Funny thing is, he didn’t even know I existed until our senior year, when his mom started hooking up with my dad.

Even though I can’t stand him, my body betrays me—and he loves it. Emerson and his mom just moved in with us, and as if crushing on him wasn’t weird enough, now our bedrooms share a wall. The sexual tension keeps building between us, but I know nothing can ever happen…especially now that our parents are engaged. I try to tell myself that I hate him, that he’s wrong for me, that we’ll never be together… So why did I agree to play Seven Minutes in Heaven at his girlfriend’s high school party? And why does Emerson suddenly have my panties in his hands?Stepbrother Billionaire is a standalone novel. It contains adult themes, harsh language, and graphic sexual content.",
