  "description": "Under ordinary circumstances, waking up bound and gagged next to a hot guy wouldn't be the worst thing that's ever happened, but these aren't ordinary circumstances. There's guys with guns after us...LOTS of them--both the guns and the guys.   Six-six, built like a god, red hair, blue eyes, and a tree trunk between his legs. Yeah. This is the guy I got kidnapped with. Phrasing is important there: kidnapped WITH, not kidnapped BY.   Fortunately, Duke Silver is a hard-core badass, because it's going to take every last shred of skill he has as a killer commando to keep us both alive, and even then, nothing's a sure thing.",
