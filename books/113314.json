  "description": "A massive solar flare devastated civilization, returning humanity to near barbarism. Teenagers Blaine and Kara, along with both an old friend and new ally, have managed to survive among the deadly and unforgiving conditions. They are threatened not only by desperate humans that know no other way to survive than to prey upon others, but also by the Intruders, hideous creatures that destroy everything in their path. The group is forced to move constantly to avoid attacks, but Karaâ€™s love for Blaine is unyielding as they both grow accustomed to their newly found gift, the ability to catch glimpses of the future through shared visions. One unwelcome vision haunting Kara could mean her love for Blaine comes with a terrible price, a price she is not willing to pay.",
