In order to balance that, and to fill in gaps he felt she left, he wrote a journal of the events and his adventure that didn't make it into Kai and Ellie's story. Eventually, he was persuaded to let A.E. Howard publish his tale, after making her swear she wouldn't change any of it.Reginald's Tale is a short novella of about 10,000 words.",
