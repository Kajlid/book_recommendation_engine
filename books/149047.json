  "title": "Adirondacks: Views of an American Wilderness",
  "description": "\"In most places, human beings dominate the picture. But in a few spots...nature rules unchallenged.\" So writes Bill McKibben in his uplifting introduction to Adirondacks , a book that reveals nature's glory, and the unique give and take between people and wilderness in the vast Adirondack Park.Bigger than the Grand Canyon, Glacier, Yellowstone, and Yosemite National Parks combined, the Adirondack Park contains a stunning array of mountains, wildlands, forests, rivers and lakes, waterfalls, and deep gorges. Photographer and Adirondack resident Carl Heilman has traveled from the foothills to the highest peaks in all seasons to photograph the park's natural wonders, its flora and fauna, and the myriad variations of light and weather that make each trip to the region a new experience.Favorite sites such as Lake George are here, along with secret bogland lakes, and the spectacular mountaintop views that are only experienced by the most intrepid hikers. Adirondacks demonstrates the beauty of nature's gifts-- and serves as a testament to the power of the people who protect them.",
