  "description": "Some couples have chemistry. Others have a connection. We have both. We took turns, walking away. But somehow, weâ€™ve still ended up here. On stage, together, in front of tens of thousands of people. Him holding a guitar, me a microphone. Singing the song I wrote that launched my career and dubbed me the princess of pop music. The song about him. Maybe we were inevitable from the start. To love. To dream. To end. Our song had one ending. Our story might have another.",
