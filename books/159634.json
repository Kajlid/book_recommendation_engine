  "title": "The Einstein Pool",
  "description": "When prominent physicist Daniel Bose has a near-death experience, he converts from atheism to Christianity and joins a group of Catholic physicists investigating claims of the paranormal on behalf of the Vatican. One of his assignments takes him to a small town in northern Thailand to investigate a powerful local witch who is rumored to dispatch her enemies by means of retroactive abortion â€“ she travels backwards in time and kills their direct ancestors, thereby ensuring that they will never be born in the first place. Dr. Bose gradually comes to realize that the tale he has somehow fallen into revolves around a passionate young Laotian beauty and a 3,000-year-old manuscript written in modern English.",
