I’m in no danger, in fact my husband and his sister talk just feet away from me, watching my every move.Behind them sits a place my husband refers to as our summer house. Apparently it’s my favourite place in the world, not that I can remember. Since the car accident, I’ve struggled to remember a lot of important things in my life, like giving birth to my daughter, Violet, just days after the crash. Or how perfect my marriage is.As I stare at the huge expanse of blue before me, I have a flashback to the crash—a detail so small it might seem insignificant to some, but to me it’s everything. So why is it so different to what everyone around me is telling me? Beads of sweat gather on my neck. If my memory is true, my life and my children’s lives could be in danger. What really happened the day of the accident? And is there anyone left who I can trust?Readers who enjoyed Gone Girl, The Wife Between Us and Mark Edwards’s Here to Stay will love this unputdownable thriller from USA Today bestselling author, Arianne Richmonde. The Breakdown will have you hooked!",
