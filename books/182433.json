  "description": "When Beauty Wants A BabyChampionship bull breeder and former Texas beauty queen Delaney McCall was having a heck of a time finding a daddy for the baby she craved. A failed marriage left her with no desire for another husband, but finding the right stud to satisfy her needs presents a bigger problem that she could have imagined. And The Bullrider Wants BeautyAfter hanging up his spurs, bull rider Zac McDaniel wants nothing more than to fulfill Delaney's dream of having a family. After all, his best friend's ex has been his fantasy for years. Zac, however, has no desire to be seen as just a means to an end. And when Zac insists on doing things the \"old fashioned\" way, their passion explodes like a bull out of the chute…Some Bucking Is Bound To Happen While insisting it's all just a passing fancy, the more Delaney sees the softer side of the rough and tumble cowboy, the harder it is to keep her emotions corraled. Zac, meanwhile, is more determined than ever to prove he's what she really needs, and will do whatever it takes to tear down the mile high fence around her heart…Praise for Victoria Vane \"Erotic and sexy.\" --Library Journal on the Devil DeVere series  \"For erotic passion and one-liners, the first book in Vane's new series will satisfy...Vane's latest gets a big yee-haw.\"  --RT Book Reviews on Slow Hand",
