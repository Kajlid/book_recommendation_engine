  "title": "Thyestes",
  "description": "A violent tragedy by a contemporary of Nero, in a faithful and uncut translation by one of our leading dramatists. Atreus, Agamemnon's father, takes revenge on his brother Thyestes by murdering Thyestes's sons and serving their flesh up for their father's dinner. 'a bleakly eloquent new translation... leaves you deeply impressed' - Sunday Times 'It is a sign of Ms Churchill's success that, without rubbing in any parallels, her version constantly prompts thoughts... of the ethics of revenge, of the latest reports from Rwanda, of what has happened in its time on all five continents' - Sunday Telegraph 'The effect is cold-bloodedly illuminating' - Independent on Sunday",
