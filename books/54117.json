  "description": "Opening a Christian coffeehouse in Seattle; that was my dream. I wanted to call it Maggie Black's Higher Grounds. So when banker William Grey III denied my loan, I was crushed. But then Mr. Grey (who's a tea drinker; figures!) explained that if I took his small-business course, the bank might reconsider my application. It would take the help of some of my fab coffee, but I was sure I could stay awake long enough to learn something. Besides, despite Grey's stuffy facade, his velvety British accent could make even financial analysis sound interesting.",
