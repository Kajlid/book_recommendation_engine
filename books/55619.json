  "description": "Leave 'em laughing. That's the classic credo of the funnyman. And that's just what Georgia's favorite son -- and one of America's best-loved humorists -- has done right here. Whether he's taking pointed potshots at blood-stealing orderlies, guffawing in the face of mortality, or talking poignantly about family, friends, and lovers, Lewis Grizzard makes his exit with neither a bang nor a whimper, but a poke in the ribs, a slap on the back, and a promise that his irresistible sense of humor and humanity will always keep on tickin'.\"Imagine Andy Rooney with a Georgia accent . . . and a sense of humor.\" -- The Houston Post\"A natural-born storyteller with a deft hand for reducing everyday occurrences into uproarious nuggets of prose.\" -- The Orlando SentinelFrom the Paperback edition.",
