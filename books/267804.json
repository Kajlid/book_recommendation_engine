  "description": "He's my best friend's brother. She's not over her ex.  Elliott.  I should have seen it coming, my world being shattered by the man that was supposed to love me. But I didn't and now I'm trying to find the pieces of me he left behind.  Duke.  I can't fix her, not when I'm just as broken as she is. I should leave her alone, she's too good for me. But, fighting the attraction that pulls us together is getting harder every day.  It doesn't take long until we're a tangle of limbs and pleasures.  No promises are made, no guarantees. Just a vow to keep our hearts out of the bedroom.  Simple, right? Except, now we both have to try and avoid getting cut on each other's broken parts.",
