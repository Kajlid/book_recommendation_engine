  "description": "Alternate cover edition can be found hereLife as a backdrop has its rewards. Miss Brianna Silverton not only prefers life in the background—she depends on it. It makes it far easier to decide upon a proper husband for her younger sister, plus, it keeps her rooted as the spinster she is determined to be. She has secrets to hide, and she isn’t about to let another man touch her—never again.  He knew it the very moment he saw her. A constant wanderer, the Earl of Luhaunt,Sebastian Rallager, never paused in one place for long. Not until the moment he saw Brianna across a crowded ballroom floor. Instinct had never failed Sebastian, and he knew it instantly—she was his. Now he just had to convince her of that fact.  Fate always finds a way. Just as Sebastian begins to see that staying in one place might be exactly what he had been searching for, secrets of the past loom. Because Brianna is not only hiding herself from the world, she is hiding secrets that cannot see the light of day. Secrets that could destroy her, and the one man determined to love her.",
