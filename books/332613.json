  "description": "\"I know when I started hating you. What I can't tell is when I started loving you, too. Maybe I never really hated you at all.\"Elliot is talented.He's the youngest player on his varsity soccer team. The best defender. When the infuriating sunshine child he played against in the summer tournament shows up at Fredricks High, he's mildly annoyed. When that sunshine child is given a spot on the varsity soccer team, he's sure it's a mistake.Jack is the new kid.He's ecstatic to finally be able to try out for a school soccer team. He's less enthused to find himself on the same team as the angry defender from the summer tournament.When the coach says they have to train together or they won't play in the first game of the season, Jack and Elliot grudgingly agree to work together . . . and find that maybe, they're just what each other needs.",
