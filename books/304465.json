My woman, she is the light that I've been craving, the peace that I lost so long ago. I know the Keres are after her, but if they think that they can take my last hope, my salvation. They will meet their end, because now that I have found her nothing is going to keep us apart.  ALAIA The pain in his eyes calls to all my nurturing instincts, the passion in his arms calls to everything that is me. Caelius needs me, but I have come to realize that I need him just as much.",
