  "description": "A landmark in world literature, Strait is the Gate describes a love affair between an acutely sensitive boy growing up in Paris and his cousin from the Normandy countryside that erupts into a soul-endangering passion. A devastating exploration of aestheticism taken to extremes, Strait is the Gate is a novel of haunting beauty that stimulates the mind and the emotions.A serious purpose underlies the work of Gide, and it is from such purposes that great novelists arise. - The New York TimesA little masterpiece.... as fine as a spire on Notre Dame. - James Joyce",
