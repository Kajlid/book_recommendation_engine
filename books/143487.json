  "description": "Spademan--the kill-for-hire antihero from Shovel Ready--returns in another riveting, twisted, genre-busting novel from Adam SternberghIt's a year after Shovel Ready. Persephone is ensconced with her newborn upstate; Simon the Magician is struggling to keep control of Harrow's evangelical empire; and Spademan has accepted a seemingly routine job: to snuff out a no-good bed-hopper named Lesser. Lesser has been causing headaches all over the limnosphere, racking up enemies left and right. But Lesser comes back from the dream with a wild claim: that the terrorists have found a way to infiltrate the limnosphere, to hijack the luxury virtual escape from the inside. And they're doing it from somewhere in New York. Spademan is not used to having enemies--his foes usually end up dead pretty quickly--but he tries to stay vigilant about the dangers that lurk right under our noses. He's about to find out just how close these new enemies are--and how dangerous they can be.",
