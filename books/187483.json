If she can't find a boyfriend, she'll do the next best thing . . . Hire one. Trent Montgomery isn't actually part of Match Made Easy. He's just doing a favor for his cousin, but one look at the blonde who hired him, and he's totally hooked. Now Maddie thinks that the attraction sizzling between them is just part of the package. And Trent is running out of time to prove to her that her date-for-hire might just be her happily-ever-after . . . Contains mature themes.",
