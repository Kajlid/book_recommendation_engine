  "description": "The Paradox Time Traveling adventure continues... with dragons, witches and magic Hundreds of years ago, a vampiric faction of angels abandoned their mystical realm and began their dominance of the New World - Earth. He's not like other guys. Grace is completely smitten with the new guy, but what girl in school isn't. It's hard to ignore Damon Draco -- the tall, dark haired guy with the mesmerizing eyes who, if his friends are anything to go by, is trouble. Damon is captivated by Grace, but he knows getting too close has deadly consequences. Staying away from her, however, is proving to be far more difficult than he imagined. In Book One of the Paradox series, Patti Roberts launches an epic saga that journeys from an ancient realm to modern day with dark glimpses into a post-apocalyptic future, blending the genres of fantasy, science fiction, adventure, and romance.",
