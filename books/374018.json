Soon thereafter the pro shop regulars assign a nickname to the teenager. To the locals the lad becomes known as Opur because of his propensity to sink putts with an old, worn-out putter that was gathering dust in the lost-and-found barrel. Follow the events until they culminate in an action packed conclusion as a young underdog fights for his dream on the hallowed grounds of America's greatest golfing event---The Classic.",
