  "description": "HELP WANTEDAs the world's oldest, most powerful witch,Thessaly has learned through millennia of experience to be prepared for almost anything, but since she could never have foreseen the persistence of one lovesick ghost names Fetch--or the conniving, underhanded lengths he would go to in order to win her heart. Attaching her name to a monster slaying business behind her back is one thing, but agreeing to take on the universe's ultimate destructive force--well, that just proves that love makes you stupid. Faced with this kind of courtship, it'll be a miracle if Thessaly can survive long enough to smack some sense into Fetch's intangible head--never mind stopping the unstoppable doom he's unleashed.",
