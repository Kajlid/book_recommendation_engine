He also brought about one of the most embarrassing moments of her life, triggering a life altering decision – one that landed her on a stage, being auctioned off at Club Alpha Cove, an exclusive BDSM club. Quade had no interest in embarking on a relationship of any kind, until he felt Maxine’s body instinctively react to him, that is. An instant possessiveness hit him right in the chest and he laid claim to her the moment she entered Club Alpha Cove. What followed was a whirlwind of emotions, overwhelming them both, awakening Maxine’s sensual side, and filling a deep void in Quade’s life.Ghosts from her past came back to haunt Maxine, threatening to break down the trust between the couple.The Syndicate is still after the Senior Masters and their loved ones.
