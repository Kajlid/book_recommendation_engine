  "title": "Daily Prayer: A Modern Guide to Ancient Practices",
  "description": "Sixteen hundred years ago Bishop Augustine of Hippo confessed our hearts are restless until they find rest in Thee. These deep longings can only be satiated by an intimate relationship-formed in prayer-with the One who formed us. With the wisdom that comes from nearly forty years of teaching the Bible and praying with women, men, and children, Joy Hilley offers readers a blueprint for building an inner sanctuary, a resting place.Daily Prayer: A Modern Guide to Ancient Practices is a sacred resource for developing a prayer life that is rich, vibrant, and dynamic. Drawing from ancient Hebrew texts, the words of Jesus, early Church writings and practices, and The Book of Common Prayer,  Joy provides a valuable handbook for those who yearn for something more.",
