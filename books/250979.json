  "description": "Newly released from her captivity by the fur traders - a group that preys on shifters for profit - Rin Hayashi is looking forward to a normal, quiet life, and the town of Malsum Pass seems a perfect place to settle. Surrounded by the wolf pack, she's never felt safer... maybe even safe enough to fall in love, and Mike seems more than willing to fall with her. But Rin senses not all is as it seems with the charming town mechanic. Did her captivity make her overly suspicious and paranoid, or is the male she is falling in love with hiding a dangerous secret?",
