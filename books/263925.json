  "title": "The Ocean Dark",
  "description": "In the uncharted waters of the Caribbean, far from the usual shipping lanes, lies a mysterious island surrounded by a graveyard of sunken ships--an island so remote that it's the perfect rendezvous point for a handful of Central American arms dealers and the Antoinette, a gun-smuggling cargo ship out of Miami. Amid the wreckage of ships new and old, the crew of the Antoinette--and the undercover FBI agent on board--enter what looks like a haven for modern pirates, only to discover that it hides something far more terrifying.In Washington, two Department of Defense scientists might understand what is about to happen. On an FBI ship monitoring the Antoinette's illegal trade, armed agents might be able to intervene. But this assumes that the Antoinette's crew survives their first encounter with a creature virtually unknown to man, yet whose eerie songs nevertheless echo down the corridors of mankind's darkest legends.",
