  "description": "“Wait, are you the interpreter? Not the, um, assistant or student intern or something? Are you joking?” You know how you applied for a job as an interpreter for a movie company filming a movie in Japan, and wound up getting pitched, head-first, into life with one of the most popular and successful bands in the world? Yeah, neither did Aileen, but somehow that’s what’s happened to her. The always youthful looking and very naive Aileen is in for the shock of her life when she winds up being interpreter for UK Crush, who are filming a documentary in Japan. She meets (and falls for, to a greater or lesser degree) the four members of the band, lava-hotties all, though one guy in particular captures her heart very early on. The next seven years bring tumult, great joy, agony and sorrow as Aileen, or Tink, as she’s known to the guys, seamlessly and irrevocably binds her life to that of the band and its members. From Japan to New York City to the Maldives to London, she does her best to live her crazy life. To love the guys and be loved by them is a great gift, and not one she’d ever give up, even though sometimes it seems like she might have to.
