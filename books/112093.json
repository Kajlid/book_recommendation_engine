  "title": "Only the Deplorable",
  "description": "\"Only the Deplorable\" is the second book in the philosophical novel series \"Migrations\" exploring themes related to ontology, epistemology, individual/social identity, and transculturation. By turns provocative, labyrinthine and engagingly absurd, this series of meditations propels the mind on a journey visiting--on both the macro and micro levels--the trials and tribulations, the concurrences and contradictions, the separations and unions, inherent in the human search for individual and metaphysical purpose.",
