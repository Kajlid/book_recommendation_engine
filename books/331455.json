It is a fiery challenge to preconceptions of race and relationships through poems of autobiography and self-empowerment. These poems are bold, humorous, and uninhibited, charting revelatory journeys through the complexities of identity, family, love, and independence. 'Dedicated to all of use who are bad, brown and brazen.'",
