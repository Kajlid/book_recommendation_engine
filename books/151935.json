  "description": "Dive into the secret, ancient, powerful world of two New Orleans families, the Deschanels and the Sullivans…  Midnight Dynasty Act I: Malediction, a novella, is the first of three serial installments of Book 3 in the House of Crimson & Clover Series. Not a standalone story,  Dynasty’s  plot makes the most sense only after having read at least Book 2, The Illusions of Eventide.  The Deschanel Curse, dormant for a decade, has returned with a vengeance.  Seers across the family are coming together, hopeful the Deschanel Magi Collective can solve this malediction that has plagued the family for nearly two centuries.  But how do you combat the blood oath of a grieving mother?  As the body count rises, it becomes apparent that strength, love, and ancient power provide no protection from destiny's cruel hand.
