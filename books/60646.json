  "description": "Everyone remembers the mass evacuations, deciding through tears what to bring and what to leave in their homes. The one-armed Marsh King is coming. Everyone remembers falling to their knees at the sight of the desolation they found awaiting their return after he had passed But few remember what you are about to read. How at sixteen he was just an outcast who had never left his village. How in those days he wanted nothing more than to become a master painter and to win back the heart of his childhood friend, who didn't fit in any better than he did.And none remember the single, sly act, or the hope behind it, that ultimately made him what he became. Until this volume was compiled, the connections were never drawn. And the identity of the one responsible was nearly lost to history. Prepare yourself, for you are about to witness the trials, triumphs and trickery of the boy who will grow up to become the most dreaded man to ever walk the Lands of Yod.",
