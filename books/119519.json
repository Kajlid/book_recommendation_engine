When a series of murders begins in Atlanta, Jewel and her best friend and partner Vander catch the case. Just when they thought they had a grasp on who the suspect is, Jewel is thrown for a loop when she finds the suspect to be her mate—along with his best friend. Retten is the Alpha of the New York Pack, sexy, powerful, and rich. Retten is the whole package. His Beta, Lex, works in the New York Police Department. They are shocked to find out Retten is the prime suspect in a serial murder case. When they all meet, a wave of shock rolls through them as they discover Jewel is their mate. Only the happiness for the men is short lived when Jewel informs them she’s having no part of two men as her mates. Especially if one is a murderer, she doesn’t care how wealthy he is. However, after some strange facts arise which make Jewel question her mates innocence, they must work together to find a way to prove it all. What happens if it can’t be proven that Retten isn’t responsible? How can she love someone she is going to have to put away forever? Enjoy the twists and turns that will leave you on the end of your seat, while the story makes you question the old saying, “Love can conquer all.” Words: 52,297Categories: Erotic Romance, Menage a Trois/Quatre, Paranormal, Shape-shifter, Thriller/SuspenseWarning: M/F/M",
