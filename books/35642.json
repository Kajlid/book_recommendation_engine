  "description": "Comedian and entertainer Joanna Ryde takes you back to the beginning of her journey along the path that took her into the world of showbiz! Diary Of A Ryde is set in a time when stardom is a distant dream and Joanna is a normal girl on Dublin's Northside looking for fun and maybe, just maybe, a bit of romance. Hilarious characters and situations paint a wonderful picture of modern Ireland as seen through the eyes of one it's brightest young things as only she can tell it!It's nearly January and I have this idea for one of me New Years revolutions. I'm goin' to write a diary!See, I'm about to turn 18 and as normal as ya think I might be- a regular fun lovin', good lookin' girl from Finglas on the northside of Dublin, me friends are anything but. Jasmin's as smart as a scented candle, Concepta's still pretendin' to be on every diet goin' and Tracy's started to think she's posh coz she goes to UCD. At least I still have me best mate Bernie.On top of all of that, I've to deal with another bunch of weirdoes in me job and don't even get me started on me family. Clearly I just do me best to get on with things by goin' out with the girls, havin' a few drinks and tryin' to find a fella, although that hasn't worked out very well lately!Overall, I'd say it's gonna be just another normal year in the life of Joanna Ryde. To be fair, things really can't get any weirder, can they?",
