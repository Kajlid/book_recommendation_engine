  "description": "Matchmaker Cassandra is a pro at finding her clients that perfect person—but unfortunately her talent doesn’t extend to her own love life. She's too busy for romance, and she’s guarded her heart ever since her parents’ nasty divorce. So a man like Nasir seems the perfect choice for a casual fling—handsome, successful, and not interested in a relationship. But things get complicated quickly when Cassandra realizes not only that Nasir is her new client…but that she’s pregnant with his child.  Nasir has always been a dutiful son. Like his brothers, he gives his all to the family business, which leaves little time for love. His mother, though, is eager for her sons to settle down. When she drags him to a matchmaker, Nasir can hardly believe that Cassandra is the woman hired to find him a wife. After the unforgettable night of passion they shared, Nasir isn’t sure how to react. But Cassandra seems determined to keep things professional, and before Nasir knows it, she’s arranged his first date.  Nasir is soon caught up in business and blind dates, and yet he can’t get Cassandra off his mind. Although Cassandra is convinced she’s not the woman he wants, Nasir has other ideas. But with a baby on the way and pressure mounting from Nasir’s mother, will her fear of repeating the past stand in the way of a perfect future?",
