  "description": "Adorable book about Three Little girls and there wish for Parasols. In spite of the fact that you may have heard it described as stereotypical or offensive in it's description of the characters, it is not. I have read the book to many and they all loved it. I do not know the person who wrote that review but it is the only negative review I have ever read.THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK",
