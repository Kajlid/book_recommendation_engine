The moment Jezebelle walks into his bar looking sad and troubled, he’s determined to do anything to turn her frown upside down. Even if that requires posing as her fake fiancé to get her bossy mother off her back. Pretending to love her will be the easy part—because he does. Walking away will be futile. But he doesn’t see a way he can keep Jezebelle for real, not when her mother’s diabolical ways prove she can make his life more than just complicated, but downright impossible.Jezebelle can’t believe her luck when Brick hatches this crazy plan.
