  "description": "Kubla Khan, A Vision; The Pains Of Sleep is a collection of three poems written by Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1816. The first poem, Christabel, tells the story of a young woman who is visited by a mysterious stranger named Geraldine. As the two spend time together, Christabel begins to suspect that Geraldine is not who she seems. The second poem, Kubla Khan, A Vision, is a dreamlike account of a fantastical palace that Coleridge claims came to him in a vision. The poem is known for its vivid imagery and use of the supernatural. The final poem, The Pains Of Sleep, is a reflection on the struggles of insomnia and the toll it takes on the mind and body. Coleridge's use of language and symbolism throughout the collection has made it a classic of English literature and a prime example of the Romantic movement.This scarce antiquarian book is a facsimile reprint of the old original and may contain some imperfections such as library marks and notations. Because we believe this work is culturally important, we have made it available as part of our commitment for protecting, preserving, and promoting the world's literature in affordable, high quality, modern editions, that are true to their original work.",
