  "description": "From Here to Eternity is a novel by James Jones, winner of the Nat'l Book Award for fiction in 1952. It was ranked 62 on Modern Library's list of the 100 Best Novels. It's loosely based on Jones' experiences in the pre-World War II Hawaiian Division's 27th Infantry & the unit in which he served, Company E (\"The Boxing Company\"). Fellow company member Hal Gould said that while the novel was based on the company, including some depictions of actual persons, the characters are fictional & both the harsh conditions & described events are inventions. The 1953 film, 1979 miniseries & 1980 dramatic series were all adapted from the novel. This is a long, satisfying, commanding novel of the soldiers who were poised on the brink of real manhood when World War II flung them unceremoniously into that abyss. Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt is the nonconformist hero who refuses to box at Schofield Barracks and is slowly destroyed by his own rebelliousness. Around him, others are fighing their own small battles--and losing. It's worth noting that Jones' 1951 audience was shocked by his frank language and the sexual preoccupations of his characters.",
