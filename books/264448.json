  "description": "They say that the human brain can remain active up to ten minutes after the heart stops. Maybe that was why Annabelle Aldridge could remember watching herself die…  Having been brought back from the brink of death after surviving a horrific attack, Annabelle Aldridge seeks to make a new start in a home she inherited from her beloved great aunt. However, almost from the moment she sets foot in Sweetwater, South Carolina, things begin to go awry for Annabelle. Briarleaf Hall, the house purchased by her aunt sight unseen, has a dark history in the sleepy southern town. Not least among her concerns is the fact that Annabelle feels a disturbing connection to the house – as well as to Sweetwater’s mayor, Harlan Hawbaker. As Annabelle experiences for herself why her home has earned its reputation, she and Harlan race against the clock to uncover long buried secrets. In doing so, they find themselves the target of some of Briarleaf’s former residents… both the living and the dead.",
