  "description": "Kaitlyn's life has been stuck in neutral- a lonely girl trying her best not to stand out. But by not standing out, she never really fit in. When an impulsive decision leads her to the local wild child and her quirky group of perfectly imperfect friends, she's immersed in a world she never knew existed. In this summer before college, she learns about friendship, falling in love, heartbreak, and how sometimes you just need to take a leap of faith in order to soar. Through unlikely friendships, she'll finally find the spark to chase her dreams, and to live life, not just survive it.",
