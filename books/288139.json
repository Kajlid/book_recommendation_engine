  "description": "Six years ago, Lucy Duncan and Jenson Phillips shared a moment on the beach. For years she had a crush on him, but hid it behind a mask of hating him, then… nothing. Now, they’re about to go on a three-thousand mile road trip together to his sister’s, Lucy’s best friend, wedding; the sister who knows nothing about their ‘history’.If Lucy’s boyfriend Matthew had been able to make the trip with her, she wouldn’t have had to put up with Jenson’s arrogance and secretive phone calls. If Matthew didn’t always put his career before Lucy herself, then maybe she wouldn’t be reliving that one night with astounding clarity while being trapped in an old car with Jenson, the one guy she’d never truly forgotten.Her Best Friend’s Brother is a second chance romance that will leave you wanting more.",
