  "description": "'After turning down a proposal of marriage, Millie longed for her mother's comforting embrace. Instead, she finds herself acting as mother to her brothers and sisters at home in Indiana while her parents try to save Aunt Wealthy's life in Ohio. Millie must pray for wisdom as the Keith children make room for three orphan children with a murky past and a terrible secret. Millie's dependence on God will speak to readers of all ages. Based on and adapted from Martha Finley's 1876 series, this updated, modern-language adaptation teaches timeless lessons of faith and courage.'",
