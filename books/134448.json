  "description": "\"A real page turner - a hugely enjoyable, often funny, always intense thriller of a book\" “This time everyone else had their ducks lined up and every last duck had “Alex Konninger” written in bold marker-pen on its forehead. If I didn’t crack this fast, those ducks would be shot, shredded and rolled into pancakes before you could say hoi sin sauce.”  Everything’s going rather well for Alex Konninger. He’s drifted his way into a big-money job in a top-tier bank, and if he doesn’t always play by the rules, he’s hardly the only one. Alex doesn’t know it yet, but he’s got a problem, a whole army of problems, in fact, and they’ve all picked this week to jump on him. He’s losing control, his past is about to catch up with him, and he doesn’t know who he can trust, because someone wants him out, and it looks like someone else wants him dead. In a world of bonds, bodies and blackmail, not everyone will make it to drinks on Friday. Welcome to Bankers Town, the explosive new thriller from Joel Hames. And you can watch the pulsating 2-minute video",
