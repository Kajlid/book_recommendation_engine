  "description": "\"A funny, ingenious and outrageous political thriller joining Hollywood and the Bush administration in a revisionist fiction about the Gulf War.\" Los Angeles Times.Once upon a time, there was a mean, dying GOP chairman named Lee Atwater who had the most brilliant, insane, frightening and do-able idea ever concocted to assure that his man, George Bush, would retain the office of the president of the United States. And the only man on the face of the earth who could pull of such an elaborate scheme was none other than the world's most celebrated Hollywood director.It's a sure-fire hit! A joint D.C./L.A. production that will play not in movie theaters but on the nightly news! Of course, hundreds of thousands of \"extras\" will die . . . . But, hey, that's show biz!",
