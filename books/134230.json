  "title": "Let Them Eat Snuff",
  "description": "A collection of short stories by David L Tamarin, ranging from extreme brutal terror and violence to dark humor and satire. Includes the infamous \"Snuff Movie Review,\" an experimental short story that was perceived as a real review when posted online, leading to the author being inundated with requests for information on how to purchase the faux snuff movie, which led him to take down the story. It was unsafe, as are the rest of the stories. Elizabeth Massie has said of Tamarin, he is the \"rising star in horrific humor\". Tamarin has had over 100 stories and articles published and plans to release more soon on Amazon Kindle,",
