  "title": "What Would Keith Richards Do?: Daily Affirmations from a Rock and Roll Survivor",
  "description": "The perfect gift for the legions of fans of the Rolling Stones: timeless wisdom and spiritual beliefs inspired by one of the worldâ€™s great survivors, Keith Richards. What is a wise man? What is a prophet? Someone with a strange, unflappable demeanor. Someone who speaks in cryptic koans, words whose meanings take years to unravel. Someone who has confronted death, God, sin, and the immortal soul. Someone unfit for this world, but too brilliant to depart it. Someone, in short, like Keith Richards. Here, at last, the wisdom of this indefatigable man is recorded and set forth. These are his visionary words: â€œI would rather be a legend than a dead legend.â€ Or â€œWhatever side I take, I know well that I will be blamed.â€ Andâ€”indeedâ€”â€œIâ€™ve never had a problem with drugs, only with policemen.â€ Not merely a compendium of wisdom, this book is also a complete guide to the inner workings of a complex and inspired belief system, and the life of a man sanctified by fame. What Would Keith Richards Do? reminds us to learn from our mistakes, let our instincts lead us, and above all, do what Keith has done better than anyoneâ€”survive.",
