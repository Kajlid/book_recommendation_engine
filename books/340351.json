  "description": "A companion volume to Lo Fu’s book-length poem Driftwood (Zephyr Press, 2006), Stone Cell compiles writing from every decade of his celebrated literary career.\n\n“Beyond Logic”\n\n\nDo you know why rivers cling to their banks?\n\nBecause they only have one way of dying\n\nEven with two banks, the ferries have no choice\n\nWe’d prefer an incendiary bomb\n\nTo smelling the scorched stench of the setting sun\n\n\nAs long as I live I’m destined to swallow those awful sonnets\n\nTurning to the last page—\n\nStill those damned sonnets\n\n\nThis is a cemetery where a single voice is buried\n\nIt echoes in the heart, an eagle circles the brink\n\nIf it’s a thorn, let it pierce blood with love\n\nIf it’s a poppy, let a smile blossom on the lips\n\nThe poet’s philosophy of life\n\nis an unwillingness to die\n\nLo Fu is the author of twelve volumes of poetry. He has won all the major literary awards in Taiwan, including the China Times Literary Award and the National Literary Award. Zephyr’s previous book by Lo Fu, Driftwood, was noted as one of the “poetry books of the year” on the Poetry Foundation’s blog Harriet.\nJohn Balcom has translated more than a dozen books into English from Chinese. He is an associate professor and head of the Chinese program at the Monterey Institute. Balcom’s recent publications include Taiwan’s Indigenous Writers: An Anthology of Stories, Essays, and Poems, which received the 2006 Northern California Book Award.",
