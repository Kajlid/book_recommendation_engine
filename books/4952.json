Now it is up to him to find out who was to blame. While investigating online, Sean stumbles upon a mysterious connection between his father and that new girl in his class. Now he has two puzzles to solve. What really happened to his dad and what does Carly have to do with it? In the face of danger, Sean sets aside his fear and finds the courage, compassion, and conviction to \"follow the evidence.\" Praise and Reviews for Hiding Carly \"Ann Eisenstein’s debut murder-mystery middle grade novel HIDING CARLY received a resoundingly positive review from the Wright State University Press. There is a strong FBI theme in this first book and Eisenstein is now collaborating with the FBI to continue with the SEAN GREY, JUNIOR SPECIAL AGENT series.\" ~Pen & Palette SCBWI-Carolinas, Summer 2011 \"Eisenstein chooses words that evoke the wide span of emotions that run through a sixth grader's mind. She keeps readers in suspense on every page. \" ~Joan Y. Edwards, Author, Illustrator, Motivational Speaker “I believe any time you can reach out to young people and impress on them that doing what is right outweighs peer pressure then we need to make efforts toward that end. The FBI's Junior Special Agent - sometimes referred to as “Junior G-men\" - Program does just that. After personally coordinating the program I saw such positive changes in many of our youth. In Hiding Carly, the protagonist, Sean, exemplifies the qualities that we see in our Junior Special Agents.” ~William Malinowski, Former (retired) FBI Special Agent",
