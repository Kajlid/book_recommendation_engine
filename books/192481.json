  "description": "Felicia Day, author of You're Never Weird on the Internet (Almost), brings her original webisodic-sensation to comics with the help of The Guild cast (most of 'em!), crew (producer Kim Evey and director Sean Becker), and an amazing group of artists. Set before the web series begins, these stories follow lonely violinist Cyd Sherman trying to navigate a frustrating personal life as she stumbles on an online MMO called -The Game-. As she gathers friends in-game, she gains confidence to confront all the problems in her real life. With, ahem, varying results. The Guild is a pioneer among web series, referred to by Rolling Stone as -[one of] the net's best serial shows.- Heartwarming and hilarious, this is a comic origin story that brings an award-winning world to life in a unique way that will delight geeks of all ages. Especially gamers.",
