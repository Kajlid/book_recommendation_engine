  "description": "ASIN B0098CF7RC moved to the most recent editionJolie Gentil and friends are putting the finishing touches on the Talk Like a Pirate Day fundraiser for the food pantry and trying to figure out who's breaking into some of the houses Jolie appraises. When she realizes a new face in town is leading high school kids into trouble in those houses, she's mad and lets him know it. But Hayden offers to help her mind her own business, and a lot of people at the fundraiser hear her give him what for. A hurricane's on the way to disrupt the fundraiser, and when a corpse turn up under the pirate ship the next day, someone wants to be sure Jolie looks like a suspect.When her car gets run into a ditch, Jolie knows someone is seriously mad at her. Soon she's getting less work. Who wants a possible murder suspect appraising their house? Scoobie's pirate limericks can't solve a crime, so Jolie and her sometimes buddy local reporter George Winters look for the murderer and try to figure out who's trying to frame Jolie. They need to stay ahead of whoever's mad at her and off the radar of the local police who tell Jolie -- for the hundredth time -- to butt out. Put on your pirate bandana and eye patch and join the fun in Ocean Alley -- with Jolie, Scoobie, Aunt Madge, and George. And let's not forget the dogs (Mister Rogers and Miss Piggy) and Jolie's cat, Jazz. And do batten down the hatches -- a hurricane's approaching.",
