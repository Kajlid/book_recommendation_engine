  "description": "A classic book available for the first time in paperback All of us at some point search for an organizing principle in life, one that is simple without being simplistic, that offers enduring direction. The book introduces, explains, and illuminates such a principle – centering one’s life on Christ. It examines twelve other \"centers\" and their effect on key dimensions of our our security, guidance, wisdom, and power. Although those other perspectives offer some value, only the \"divine center\" meets all the tests. This powerful principle is given life by an inspiring presentation of \"how-tos\" –imaginative, thought-provoking explanations of the divine-centering process and steps necessary to achieve the goal.",
