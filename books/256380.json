  "description": "When two rival TV chefs are forced to work together, things are bound to get hot in the kitchen.  Wyatt has boy-next-door charm, a broad smile, and can frost a mean cupcake. Sarcastic, classically trained, and well-travelled, Kai is everything Wyatt isn’t. When their constant bickering on air gets interpreted as sexual tension by a brand new audience, the two of them are encouraged to play it up for ratings.  Now that they’re on the network’s chopping block, they’ll have to work together to save their careers.  Except the line between playing it up and meaning it gets blurry fast, and before they know it, all that innuendo and fake flirting boils over into something more.  Could this spell disaster for both of their careers? Or are two cooks better than one?  Hot & Sweet is a standalone gay romance with a HEA ending. It contains: sarcasm, really good food, misuse of chocolate sauce, Kai’s glorious hair, a lot of chocolate, explicit sex scenes, and true love conquering all.",
