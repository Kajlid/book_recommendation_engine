  "description": "Does life feel futile? Doesn't have to. Do some of your failures seem fatal? They aren't. And your death. Does the grave appear to be the final stop? According to Christ, your death is just the start of the something great. There is a truth greater than all the losses and sorrows of life. And it can be discovered in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. In Six Hours One Friday , Max Lucado delves into the meaning of Jesus' last hours on the cross. Through his death, your life has purpose and meaning. You are forgiven and loved by a Savior who died for you. And an empty tomb proclaims that death does not have the final word. \"Peace where there should be pain. Confidence in the midst of crisis. Hope defying despair. Does death have the last word? I can see Jesus wink as he gives the answer, Not on your life. \"",
