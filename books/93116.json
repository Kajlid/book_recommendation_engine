  "description": "Note from the Author: This interlude was originally released on May 15, 2013 to celebrate Mac's birthday. It has now been added to Six Degrees of Lust, Second Edition.Sam Shaughnessy knows what he wants from Mac O’Bannon: monthly, uncomplicated casual encounters.Mac is on the same page. For two months they have been enjoying each other’s company, never forgetting that their agreement leaves zero room for long-term commitment.But a visit to a local gay club during a weekend getaway in South Beach tips the scale, and it isn’t long before Sam starts showing how much he really doesn’t like to share.Firmly placed rules get suspiciously bent, and by the end of the night only two things are clear: body shots are conducive to extreme displays of arousal and possessiveness, and anything can be blamed on tequila.",
