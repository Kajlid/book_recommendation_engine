  "description": "Deep in the canyons of northern Arizona, animal psychic Kai Tallon senses someone - or something - watching her, and wonders if the legends are true. This is the land of the Tocho - a pride of half man/half cougars borne of the Navajo - and rumored to possess unearthly masculine prowess...As night falls, Kai knows sleep will elude her, for her body is thrumming with sexual energy. But once she surrenders to the erotic sensations sweeping through her, she discovers a pleasure so breathtaking it can only be a dream...so intense it can only be real...so teasing, she knows she isn't alone. Kai lusts after this mysterious presence whose visitations arouse her with his primal sexuality. Quivering with need, she longs to feel him deep inside. And she will, for the man in him wants her, and the animal in him will take her. Now a willing prisoner to rapture, Kai must choose between her captor-lover, and returning to civilization.",
