  "description": "Fifteen years ago I met Sayer Wesley. I fell in love with him. I promised I would never leave him. I swore nothing could break us apart.  Five years ago I broke my promise. I ran away. I took the one secret that could destroy us both and disappeared.  Five days ago I thought I saw him.  I knew it was impossible. Sayer was locked away, serving a deserved sentence in federal prison. He couldn’t find me.  He wouldn’t find me. I was too good at hiding. Too good at surviving.  Because if Sayer ever found me, there would be hell to pay for a plethora of sins. The worst of which, he didn’t even know about.  Five hours ago, I told myself I was crazy.  Five minutes ago, I saw him again.  Five seconds ago, I was too late.",
