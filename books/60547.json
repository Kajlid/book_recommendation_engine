  "description": "For nearly a thousand years Persephone and her father have waited in the shadows, plotting the overthrow of the gods. Plotting to ascend to the highest throne. Plotting to rule over mortals. Now they are ready to put into motion the final steps of their diabolical plan. With her father’s election to the seat of galactic power all but assured, Persephone is dispatched on one last mission to hunt down and destroy the only person powerful enough to undo all that she and her father have worked so hard to achieve—a mysterious but beautiful katana-wielding assassin with a sinister past of her own.",
