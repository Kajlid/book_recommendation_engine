  "description": "This is anything but the common alphabet book. Frankie delivers a twist that will excite and delight your child. While his vocabulary may be limited, it certainly is different, as our host in the book discovers. See what words Frankie knows and how fun they can be when illustrated. Frankie's Alphabet is targeted at younger children who are early readers. The sentences are relatively easy with illustrated pictures to help tell the story. This book would be most suitable for children up through second grade, although this may depend upon your own child's progress. The story was developed to put a twist on the common alphabet book, while introducing some new words.",
