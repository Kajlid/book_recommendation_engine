  "description": "Charlotte d'AubigneLottie came to her father's home in France a girl -- but with a woman's beauty and desires. Lonely for her beloved English countryside, estranged from the boy she had always adored, she was soon to be swept away by the glitter of Louis XV's Paris. As the months passed, turning into years, Lottie would be hurled into a tempest of events, forever altering her life, changing the course of history. New love would come, in the person of a man whose private passions would equal his great craving for liberty. And an old love, too -- his mission in France enigmatic, his motives veiled. She would know joy and treachery, grief and triumph, and the advent of a time when heads would roll, chaos prevail, and the fates of those she loved to be thrown in most dire jeopardy.",
