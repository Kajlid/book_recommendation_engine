  "description": "This edition combines two books in one. Weaveworld was published in 1987 and Cabal followed in 1988. Clive Barker made his mark on modern fiction with Weaveworld with this surreal and magical tale exploring the profound and overwhelming terror that results. With its volatile mix of the fantastical and the contemporary, the everyday and the otherworldly, Weaveworld is an epic work of dark fantasy and horror -- a tour de force from one of today's most forceful and imaginative artists. With Cabal, the master of dark imaginative fiction Clive Barker takes us on a fabulous journey. The nightmare had begun...Boone knew that there was no place on this earth for him now; no happiness here, not even with Lori. He would let Hell claim him, let Death take him there. But Death itself seemed to shrink from Boone. No wonder, if he had indeed been the monster who had shattered, violated and shredded so many others' lives. And Decker had shown him the proof - the hellish photographs where the last victims were forever stilled, splayed in the last obscene moment of their torture. Boone's only refuge now was Midian - that awful, legendary place in which gathered the half-dead, the Nightbreed.",
