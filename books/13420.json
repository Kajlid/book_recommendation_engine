  "description": "Eve Rosser is turning eighteen. Does she accept the Protection or go without?This novella is found in the anthology Many Bloody Returns.This was my very first Morganville short story, published in Charlaine Harris and Toni L. P. Kelner’s fantastic collection Many Bloody Returns. Because when Charlaine Harris asks you if you’d like to contribute a story to an anthology that has the theme of ‘vampires and birthdays,’ you definitely say yes to that.I realised that I had the perfect birthday to discuss: Eve’s eighteenth, on which she had to make the choice to either be a good little Morganville resident, sign her Protection agreement, and fit in … or be Eve. I think you already know the answer, but it’s fun getting there.A little factoid – the Glass House address is a combination of the numbers of my first dorm flat in college and a book by Stephen King: 716 Lot Street (as in ‘Salem’s Lot).",
