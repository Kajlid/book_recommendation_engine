  "description": "What would you do to get your happily ever after?  Libby Saunders, who spent the first seventeen years of her life as an ugly duckling, bleaches her hair and drops forty pounds in order to get her fairytale ending. Once she evolves into a beautiful swan, the handsome princes are tripping each other’s royal steeds in order to get a date with her. But while the princes in fairy tales may be perfect gentlemen, Libby finds that her real life princes tend to be somewhat less than perfect. Actually, they tend to be a bunch of two-timing jerks.  Will Kaplan, the roommate of Libby’s latest boyfriend, is definitely not her idea of a handsome prince. He’s missing a cleft in his chin, he doesn’t have a British accent or even a French or Italian accent, and he rides a wheelchair rather than a white stallion. But the more Libby gets to know Will, the more she starts to wonder if handsome princes are really all they’re cracked up to be. And maybe a nice, ordinary drake is the only one who can give a former ugly duckling the happily ever after she’s been waiting for.",
