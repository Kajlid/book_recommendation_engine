  "description": "In summer, magic is warmly borne on the gentle, wafting breeze.It is a season of many wonders, with many secrets ripe for discovering...and some best left in shadow, unexplored. Summer has come to Sauterelle Lake. And inquisitive young Nick is discovering many things he doesn't want to know: About a pretty girl with hypnotic eyes who talks to his soul... About a wild creature--a wolf--whose features shine with an intelligent, un-lupine knowing... About a strange, inhospitable family occupying a cabin that is meant to be empty.This summer, nature's magic is not the only sorcery traveling on the wind.And the real trick will be surviving until the autumn.",
