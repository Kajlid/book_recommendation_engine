  "title": "Achtung-Panzer!: The Development of Armoured Forces, Their Tactics and Operational Potential",
  "description": "This is an English translation of the strategic study of tank warfare by one of its leading exponents. Written just two years before he put his theories to work in Hitler's Blitzkrieg of World War II. The theories of Heinz Guderain, substantially evolved from the British and French experiences from World War I, were considered revolutionary, even foolhardy. When he published his views in 1937 the book became a bestseller and yet few of the readers appreciated that the words would become the battle doctrine for Hitler's Panzer as they swept across Europe in the following five years. This translation also contains \"hindsight\" commentary added by Paul Harris of the War Studies Department, Sandhurst. The commentary explains Guderian's original aims and discusses how his theories were altered by practical events. The book is produced in the style of the original German book, even down to the small vehicle silhouettes used in the earlier book.",
