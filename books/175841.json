  "description": "SOPHIA 6 Months A lot can happen in six months. A heart can break and heal countless times. A life can change so dramatically that it’s unrecognizable anymore. Sophia was a ghost, a made up pseudonym on a fake ID that helped Alexis buy beer. She was never meant to become a real person. She was never meant to live. Breathe. Hurt. Love. It’s funny how one moment can alter the course of a lifetime. Now Alexis is a ghost, and Sophia is all that remains. But what happens when the threats you’re terrified to acknowledge come true? What happens when your loved ones are in danger, and facing the past is the only way to save them? The newest prospect of the Widow Makers Motorcycle club is about to find out. REBEL Louis James Aubertin III has always been single minded in his goal: bring down the Los Oscuros cartel, and kill Hector Ramirez for ordering the death of his uncle. Over the course of the last 6 months, things don’t seem that cut and dried anymore, though. If chasing down Hector means endangering the woman he loves, is it really worth the risk? If sending his club to war against one of the most dangerous cartels in the world means ruining the one good thing in his life, is the price worth paying? Jamie will do anything to protect Sophia, but with Hector kidnapping her family members and demanding the greatest of ransoms, keeping her safe is beginning to seem like an impossible task.",
