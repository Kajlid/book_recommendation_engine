  "description": "If they realise who I am… I’m dead   To the Council, I’m their top assassin. I terminate paranormals that step out of line. I’ll head off the hit list if they ever find out who I really am.  I’m close to finding out who’s responsible for my mother’s death, when the Council sends me on a mission,: kill two clan leaders who threaten to expose the paranormal world. Simple, Right? Then I meet them…and everything goes to hell.  Throw in my overheated libido, not one, but two soul-mate claims, a mysterious age-old shaman who throws me slap-bang into the center of an ancient prophecy, and things really heat up.  My next decision will send my life in a new direction… or kill me in the process. Which will it be? Personal revenge… or save the world?",
