He’s got a Nazi medallion in his pocket, a hot CIA bodyguard next to him, and a clearly dangerous Mossad agent on his tail. What was his father investigating? Why was his mother assassinated? Why are unknown sides fighting over him with automatic weapons? Far from his posh apartment, he races to save the world from a horrific conspiracy straight out of the darkest hours of history. \"A solid thriller,\" -Publishers WeeklyThis fast-paced thriller took France by storm when it was first published, reaping superlatives: \"Spellbinding,\" \"exceptional,\" \"staggering,\" captivating,\" \"brilliant,\" \"astounding,\"\"fascinating.\" Think a dash of Robin Cook, a splash of John Grisham and a pinch of Clive Cussler with a very distinctive voice all it's own.
