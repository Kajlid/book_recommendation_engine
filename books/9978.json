  "title": "Wolves at Our Door: The Extraordinary Story of the Couple Who Lived with Wolves",
  "description": "A lyrical and revealing memoir of living with wolves, from the creators of the Emmy Award winning Discovery Channel documentary.For centuries, wolves have haunted the human imagination. It has been accepted as conventional wisdom that they are savage predators, creatures of nightmare. Determined to overcome such misconceptions, Jim and Jamie Dutcher spent six years in a tented camp on the edge of Idaho's wilderness, living with and filming a pack of wolves. Now, in this lyrical memoir, the Dutchers share their experience of life among these intelligent and elusive animals.By socializing with the pack from the time they were pups, the Dutchers were able to gain the wolves' trust and observe their behavior in a way that few people ever have. What they witnessed was a complex nature oriented toward family life and strong social bonds.Wolves at Our Door is much more than a behind-the-scenes look at the making of the Dutchers' Emmy Award-winning Discovery Channel documentary. It is the story of two people brought together by their devotion to wildlife and held together by their belief in each other. It is about their struggle to keep the project alive amid marauding mountain lions, forest fires, subzero temperaturesâ€”and the never-ending storm of controversy that surrounds the wolf.",
