  "description": "Kraus' masterpiece is generally considered to be the massive satirical play about the First World War, which combines dialogue from contemporary documents with apocalyptic fantasy and commentary from two characters called \"the Grumbler\" and \"the Optimist\". Kraus began to write the play in 1915 and first published it as a series of special Fackel issues in 1919. Its epilogue, \"Die letzte Nacht\" (\"The last night\") had already been published in 1918 as a special issue.This edition was abridged and edited by Frederick Ungar. It contains an introduction by the editor and critical analysis by Franz H. Mautner.",
