  "description": "What if the one thing you really need is right next door?  Slate Kinney needed a break. A break from touring. A break from the fast cars and easy women. He needed something real. So when he found the empty piece of land on the north shore of Long Island, he jumped at the chance to build a private retreat.  Jenny Philips has been hurt before. She's shut herself away from the world, away from the men who want to use and hurt her, alone with her baking and her loyal dog Basil. But when construction begins on the mansion next door, it destroys her hard earned peace and makes her hate her new neighbor sight unseen.  When Slate gets a good look at his gorgeous but gun shy neighbor, he knows he has to get to know her better. But when she isn't impressed by his fame or his fortune, he has to pull out all the stops. Once the lights go down and they show their true selves, will either one of them ever be the same again?  This book is a super sexy stand alone novella with a guaranteed HEA!",
