  "title": "The Stan",
  "description": "The 'Stan is a collection of short comics about America's longest war. Individual stories highlight different perspectives--one through the eyes of a Taliban ambassador and others through the eyes of Afghan and U.S. Army soldiers--but every account highlights the human element of war. The tales in this book--based on reporting by David Axe and Kevin Knodell and drawn by artist Blue Delliquanti--are all true and took place in roughly the first decade of the U.S. military intervention in Afghanistan. While the stories are from the recent past, The 'Stan is still very much about Afghanistan's and America's present--and likely their future.",
