  "description": "In this horrifying zombie short story, seven characters find themselves trapped inside an elevator during a zombie apocalypse. The narrator, the last passenger to occupy the elevator, tells them that his wife, who was murdered by a zombie, told him as she died in his arms that she saw one of the passengers get bitten by a zombie before the person ducked into the elevator, but she died before she could describe the victim to him. The terrified passengers know that the victim will soon turn and attack them. They must determine who it is and kill him or her before it is too late--if they don't kill each other first trying to find out.  BONUS MATERIAL Included as a special bonus is the first chapter of the upcoming new Chad Halverson dystopian thriller \"Poxland,\" aka \"Blast Shelter\" (Book 5 in the series).  Praise for Bryan Cassiday's Chad Halverson zombie apocalypse books: \"Cassiday blends thoughtful suspense and pulse-pounding terror to deliver a novel with both bite and creeping dread.\"--David Dunwoody, author of \"Empire\"  \"Written with the epic scope of 'World War Z' and infused with the gritty spook works derring-do of a Robert Ludlum spy thriller, 'Sanctuary in Steel' is full of zombie mayhem through and through.\"--Joe McKinney, Bram Stoker Award-winning author of \"Dead City\"  \"'Sanctuary in Steel' made me feel like the first time I watched Romero. Fresh, exciting and engaging like any outbreak story should be.\"--Iain McKinnon, author of \"Domain of the Dead\"",
