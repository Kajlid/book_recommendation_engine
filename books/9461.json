  "description": "Unforgettable and wildly original, Oliver Caine's in Trouble Again by Australian writer William Kondylis is a real page-turner that teaches young readers to follow their dreams-and where to look for trouble. For fans of Harry Potter and The Spiderwick Chronicles, this new world voyage offers an imaginative madcap adventure in which characters defy what's expected of them in order to stay alive.Oliver Caine has always been one to make a mess of things. His timid, food-loving pal Peter, on the other hand, is pretty good at toeing the line. The lads and Oliver’s nagging half-sister Sarah unearth a mysterious book that changes their world from the moment they crack the spine. The three are suddenly thrust into a world where they’re forced to outwit seven-foot lizards, a fierce two-headed Cyclops, and a sorcerer with a strong resemblance to their science teacher. Besides the help of a gentle wizard and the spirit-guarded Pool of Prophecy, Oliver, who is no stranger to trouble, must do what he does best in order to make things right again. Oliver Caine’s In Trouble Again is a fantasy brimming with heart-thumping action and spellbinding magic. The Foreword Clarion Review says of this captivating and original adventure story: “It deserves a place on library shelves as an example of what can be done… a welcome change from the book clones of Tolkien and C. S. Lewis.”",
