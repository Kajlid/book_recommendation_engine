  "description": "A loner and an introvert, Chris has worked in one of Brighton's movie theatres for years. It's the kind of job that people drift through. When a new colleague joins, Chris feels she's found a real friend to spend time with and share things with.But as Chris and Dan become closer, she realises that he's dealing with complicated mental health issues that are playing havoc with his ability to work and take care of himself. As she becomes a bigger and bigger part of his life, and he becomes less stable, she's the only one who's there for him -- and the only one who can decide how to help him have a better future.With gorgeous, lush pencil artwork, Breakwater tells the story of a woman abruptly plunged out of her depth, and her struggles to be a good friend when friendship is complicated.",
