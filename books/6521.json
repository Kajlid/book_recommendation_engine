  "title": "Tyrannosaurus Dad",
  "description": "Tobias's father is a lot like other fathers--he likes corny jokes, and doing magic tricks, and works really hard at the office. But there the resemblance ends. He has teeth as sharp as steak knives, is forty feet high, and weighs as much as a locomotive. He is, in fact, a tyrannosaurus.This funny and poignant story about a kid trying to get his dad to pay attention has a fabulous payoff, when Dad shows up and saves the day during a Field Day baseball game; when a tyrannosaurus decides to ump, no one dares disagrees with his calls!An added bonus are the fabulous illustrations by newcomer Matthew Myers.",
