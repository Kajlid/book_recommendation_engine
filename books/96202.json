  "description": "The Vampyrs have seized control of what’s left of Earth. We humans live short and worthless lives fulfilling one of three roles, serving our Vampyr betters: Laborer, Administrative, or Donor. I chose a fourth role. A spy for the Resistance.That’s how I wound up working for Victor Bressov, heir apparent to one of the oldest, most powerful Vampyr families. As his personal Administrative, I can feed the Resistance valuable information on the Vampyrs’ plans. But Victor–cold, calculating, cruel–has other roles in mind for me. It’s not just the taste of human blood that drives him. It’s spilling it. Through pain, through pleasure, though I’m having a hard time these days finding the difference between the two.He says my pain can give us both unimaginable power. Power he can use to control the Republic, or that I can use to save humankind. When he ties me to his desk, whip trailing along the marble floor, I tell myself I’m enduring this for the Resistance. I’m doing it so one day, others can live freer than me.Problem is, I’ve never felt so free.",
