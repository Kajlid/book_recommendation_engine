Start the Underground Encounters series today!)Nike loves visiting the goth club Vamps—she can exchange her firefighter uniform for a slinky fantasy outfit. There she runs into the man she’d been admiring from afar at a rock-climbing gym. He’s been the star of all her sexual fantasies, so is it any wonder they end up in his private room upstairs? Just when things begin to heat up, Michel’s enemies appear. Michel isn’t an ordinary mortal. And someone from his past is on the hunt for vengeance. Michel and Nike are forced to run and hide out in a coastal cottage in Maine. They can’t resist their attraction and spend the nights exploring each other’s bodies while trying to sort out how they feel. Can they overcome their differences while evading the predators chasing them?",
