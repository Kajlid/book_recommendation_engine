  "description": "It’s not easy being an introverted kid in an extroverted town. Hunter Grayson is a 14-year-old boy who enjoys doing things by himself and hates being the center of attention. He has always felt different from his outgoing family and his chatty classmates, but he doesn’t understand why. Now he’s about to enter high school and he’s terrified. Lucky for him, he quickly befriends Ariana, an adventurous girl with confidence to spare, and Ty, a rising football star with a kind soul and a warm smile. Together, they will embark on a journey of self-discovery and acceptance as they navigate the complicated waters of adolescence. Throughout his freshman year, Hunter will learn to overcome his self-esteem issues and embrace his introversion. Instead of changing, as everyone tells him to do, Hunter will learn that there’s nothing wrong with being the quiet, reflective kid who likes spending time by himself. Introverted Me is a coming-of-age story about acceptance, friendship, and self-love. This is a book for anyone who has ever felt like there’s something wrong with them because of their quiet nature and who feel like they have to change in order to fit in and please those around them.",
