  "title": "Slow Boat to Uruguay",
  "description": "With precious little sailing experience and no clear plan, the author sails across the Atlantic Ocean before squeezing his wife, mother-in-law and seven-month-old daughter into their cramped and leaky boat to explore South America. The frustrations of impenetrable bureaucracy and a barely surmountable language barrier, added to a litany of mechanical disasters, being lost up muddy estuaries, tossed about in storms, washed onto rocks and charged by killer whales, are offset by the kindness and generosity of delightfully eccentric locals in the lesser travelled backwaters of southern Brazil, Uruguay and the Parana Delta. This real life story is available in 2019 in both Kindle Books and Paperback Books and will make a delightful gift for the armchair traveller or real life adventurer, both men and women. An excellent match for anyone who likes the following book travel books sailing books motivational books inspirational books adventure books christmas sailing gifts for men women books for men",
