  "description": "Debbie runs a support group for survivors of the Reviviscence disease, a disease that turned people into cannibals and destroyed their lives. Now, after the cure, the Revivers have to return to society to try to live a normal life once again. This is easier said than done as the Revivers struggle with acceptance and latent urges that leave them overcome with shame and guilt. Each member of the support group has a tale to tell and an innocent therapy session turns into something far more sinister when people in the circle reveal their true selves.",
