  "title": "Golem",
  "description": "Some four hundred years ago, according to Jewish legend, a revered Jewish teacher and scholar, Rabbi Loew, shaped a giant man out of clay--a golem--and brought him to life. The golem's task was to vanquish those who persecuted the Jews of Prague, and he performed it almost too well. Retold from traditional sources and accompanied by masterly cutpaper illustrations, Golem is a dramatic tale of supernatural forces invoked to save an oppressed people. It offers a thought-provoking look at the consequences of unleashing power beyond human control.Winner of the 1997Â Caldecott Medal.",
