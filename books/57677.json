  "description": "A former prosecutor is determined to save a man accused of murder in this \"completely engrossing\" legal thriller from the New York Times-bestselling author (Detroit Free Press).  During a sleepover with her two friends, Emma goes missing. The owners of a local news network, her parents have money and power. As the police scour the city, Emma's father offers a $250,000 reward for his daughter's safe return. Eight days after the abduction, two hikers find her. Emma has been dead for days. After a year's fruitless search, the police make an arrest, picking up the network's star anchorman. As Emma's father brays for blood, Luke Garrison is the only person who dares to stand in his way. Once a merciless District Attorney, Luke became a defender after mistakenly sending a man to the gas chamber. Now he will let no one--not even a bereaved father--rush justice. But is he doing the right thing, or is he fighting to set a killer free?",
