  "description": "Falling in love with a lie had taken its toll on Julia. Leaving was the only option, because breaking her own heart was better than allowing Jace to do it. It seemed like a good plan at the time, but now that she was back in New York City she was miserable. Even though she knew she could never fit into Jaceâ€™s lifestyle and he would never give her what she truly wanted, she still yearned for his arms around her and all that she had left behind.  After spending an unforgettable summer with Julia, Jace found himself abandoned and alone for the first time in his life. The woman who had stolen the hearts of everyone he loved, had also succeeded in stealing his. Now she was gone, and she had taken his heart with her. It was up to him to either get it back, or move on with his life.",
