  "description": "OUT OF THE GRAVE…AND INTO HER LIFE For over a century, musician Nicolo Paganini had rested in peace. Until Summer Santiago's innocent touch raised him from the grave. Awake in a world suddenly so foreign, he needed Summer's help. Yet his protector was a vampire…with a deep desire for Nicolo's blood. Despite the raving attraction between them, the pair had something more dangerous than bloodlust to contend with. The devil had a plan for Nicolo's eternal life. Should Nicolo play the cursed black violin, his fate would be sealed. But if he resisted Satan's call, he would lose the woman who had made his life worth living.",
