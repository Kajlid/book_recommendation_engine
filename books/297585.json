  "description": "Tension filled her body. Out of the corner of her eye she saw a movement. While turning her head in that direction, Stephanie saw the shape move and then suddenly it towered above her. As the shape rose to its full height, fear filled all the nooks and crannies left in her. Before her this thing stretched out its arms and growled. More than anything she wanted to scream but instead stood frozen. Terror drawing her eyes to look closer, she saw the arms were covered in fur; even the hands were strangely formed and not human. If she could have been more scared she would have. She searched her mind for any knowledge and none came, just a blank place in her mind where memories should be. Staring at the nightmare before her, Stephanie had no words. With no idea what to do, she screamed.",
