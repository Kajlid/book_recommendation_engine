  "title": "The Miracle Mile",
  "description": "Parker is caught in a routine job with devious and scheming bosses, in a tiny and noisy apartment in the gay neighborhood in City Centre where he and his friends live. The decision he faces in moving to the suburbs threatens the long-term relationship with his partner Francis, who wants him to stay put. The inconvenience of commuting to the City for work or socializing is quickly overshadowed by the homophobic next-door neighbor Parker encounters, and the bureaucratic reality of his new life in the suburban Province, with its often daunting municipal and cultural center known as The Miracle Mile. Set in an unnamed and ostensibly liberal democracy, and narrated with a distinctive if somewhat unconventional writing style, Mr. Goldstein once again draws us into a slightly surreal world, with some quirky but very likable characters. Will Parker ever realize his dream for a peaceful life amid the confusion that seems to constantly surround him?",
