  "description": "When Joanna Armstrong hires Riley Carrington to work for her company—one of Los Angeles’ most prestigious advertising firms—she knows she’s taking a risk. With her sharp tongue and defiant attitude, Riley seems bound for trouble, but there’s something special about her that Joanna can’t bring herself to pass up.After Riley insults one of the company’s senior partners, however, Joanna decides that what the beautiful, free-spirited twenty-seven-year-old needs is structure and consequences. Riley faces a suspension without pay for her misconduct, and when Joanna offers her an alternate proposal she hesitantly agrees. She will work for Joanna at her home office, but first she’ll submit to a thorough, no-nonsense paddling, and any future misbehavior will earn her more of the same, this time on her bare bottom.Joanna’s firm-handed discipline turns out to be just what Riley has been missing, and soon they have become much more than just boss and employee. Yet despite Joanna’s best efforts and Riley’s frequently sore bottom, her wild and careless behavior continues and before long a motorcycle accident almost claims her life. Joanna takes it upon herself to care for her girlfriend, though her treatment often leaves Riley blushing crimson, but once Riley recovers will Joanna be prepared to do whatever it takes to rein her in before it is too late?Publisher’s Note: Reining in Riley is an erotic romance novel that contains spankings, sexual scenes, anal play, elements of medical play, elements of BDSM, and more.
