  "description": "Jacob can see—and his vision brings him great power. But he still hasn't found what he's been looking for. . . . Danger is closing in. The stars are calling. And young Jacob Manford is restless. He's tried settling into life as a Seer, but he hasn't forgotten the ghostly boy who told him about a new colony—a colony for those who were once blind but can now see. A place for people like Jacob. Soon Jacob buys passage on a cargo ship hurtling toward distant planets. But strange events along the way worry him. Is he moving toward a new life and a new sense of peace, or is he simply bringing trouble with him?",
