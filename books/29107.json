  "title": "Finding Angel",
  "description": "Angel doesn't remember her magical heritage...but it remembers her. Start with a struggle revolving around the source of magic. Is it genetic--or is it part of your soul? What if someone was using his powers to run experiments based on a complete misconception of the source of magic? Throw in a twisted family tree that's rooted in a centuries' old feud, a painting that (literally) holds the key to the truth, a mysterious and talkative beetle, and an Elven rocker who can play the songs of the stars on an electric guitar. This is the world Angel Mason was born into, thrust out of, and returned to seven years later. To top it off, she must rediscover her identity and save her home from a madman at the same time. Kat Heckenbach's debut young adult fantasy has earned three Compton Crook (finalist), Grace Awards (YA category finalist), and INDIE Next Generation Book Awards (YA category finalist). Readers have compared her writing to that of Cornelia Funke and Madeline L'Engle.Ideal for young teens, older teens, and anyone who loves adventure, mystery, fantasy and magic.",
