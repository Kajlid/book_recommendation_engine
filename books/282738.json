  "description": "Serenity is an illusion.The deranged. The demented. The unstable. Six stories, six authors, non-stop madness.Dear Reader, I trust this letter finds you well. It is with the utmost concern that we invite you to join us at the infamous Serenity Institute. You’ll be able to observe the ongoings of the asylum, meet the patients and the doctors. We do however ask that you please be quiet. Do not interact with the patients, and respect the special treatments our doctors administer. This is where nightmares come alive. A home for the shattered psyche of its patients. Hope is lost when they cross the threshold. The deranged. The demented. The unstable. Six stories, six authors, non-stop madness. Kind regards,The Authors",
