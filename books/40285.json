  "description": "Take a ringside seat for these brutal tales of twisted emotions. An ordinary housewife, burning with a sick passion, will see her afternoon's entertainment turn deadly for an innocent child. A bright young woman, incapable of love, will destroy the hearts of men and cut the widest swath of destruction seen since Sherman's march to the sea. A distinguished teacher, unable to control his base desires, will learn that the telephone is mightier than a white-hot slug in the gut. And a faithful husband, yearning to swing wild, will bring home a problem he would gladly sell his immortal soul to solve. These are some of the real-life battles that will knock you to the mat and have you seeing stars.",
