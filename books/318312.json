  "description": "Sick of the constant betrayal, I’ve sworn off men for good. But there’s no cure for my attraction to Dr. Nicholas Barnes. \nI’m a magnet for egotistical playboys. It’s been years since I’ve let anyone in. Pursuing me is merely a challenge for this overconfident ladies' man. \nWhat else could this handsome, arrogant surgeon want with me?\nI have great friends and a job in the ER I love. A good night’s rest is what I need. One little sleeping pill couldn’t hurt. Could it?\nBut this irresistible doctor even seduces me in my dreams. It’s a delicious temptation I don’t want to stop. \nYet what happens when the line between fantasy and truth becomes blurred? When you can no longer live with the constant deprivation? \nThis man is beautiful. He’s charming. And he could be the love of my life or my complete destruction.",
