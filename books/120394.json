It's been two years since Dardian Dreshaj has wrestled control of Harlow Industries. Now a legitimate business owner, husband and father things couldn't get better. And they don't. New enemies have come forward, enemies that may be Padukshem's equal. Leaving very little clues each time the killers strike, Dardian finds himself in a deadly game of cat and mouse. As Dardian and his men race to discover the killers' identities he stumbles upon the true intent behind the killers' intrigue. Can it be that Dardian was never the killer's primary target? New clues left behind begin to point towards Aaliyah. Padukshem has no choice but to awaken from his miniscule slumber. Now in full form and deadlier than ever, Padukshem is up against time and the clock is winding down. Have the killers outsmarted him at every turn? From Los Angeles, New York, Miami and even the streets of Tirane, Padukshem assembles an elite crew of contract killers to make one final stand. But by this time it may already be too late. Has Dardian Dreshaj lost the one thing worth living for?\"",
