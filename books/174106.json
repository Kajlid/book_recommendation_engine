  "description": "Many have heard the story of a mortal girl who falls for a demon boy, but very few have heard it told like this.\tDamien was at the Mesonoxian club two miles out of the small town of Bentaway when he received his mark. His mark is the person he’s sent from his master to bully, crush, humiliate, torture, deceive, betray or destroy-someone who has a light too bright for his master’s eyes. \tThat night brought both love and agony to him, for he met the beautiful Hallie Robin who also happens to be his mark. The one person Damien is meant to destroy is the same one that made him believe that there is something greater, lighter perhaps, inside him. \tDamien decides that he is what he is and must do his job. He knows the best way to destroy a girl like her: heartbreak. He knows how to do it too. He’s done it hundreds of times. He knows to keep close to her and make her feel like an angel then out of nowhere, let her realize that he was the devil and break her heart. \tBut it’s not that simple.\tThe more time Damien spends with her, the more he falls in love with her. Frantically debating between whether to save her and leave or stay with her and hurt her, more problems arise. Other demons are catching on to him. Hallie is asking about his many, many secrets. He’s giving too much of himself to her. And worse of all: there are still so many things about her that she won’t say.So here it rests broken but loved, the story of Hallie.",
