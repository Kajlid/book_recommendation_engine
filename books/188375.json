  "title": "The Kingdom of Emptiness",
  "description": "Returning home after a final tour of duty in Afghanistan, John Fox sees his beliefs crumble as he struggles to re-adapt to both the realities of civilian life and redemption for a fatal error of judgement that cost the life of an Afghan woman.  Two thousand miles away, in remote Mauritania, Badia, an outcast, struggles to raise her son against a backdrop of setbacks as one by one her hopes for a better future are dashed.  As their disillusion leads to a quest for a new life, Fox and Badia weave a patchwork of events through the lives of Fudge - Fox’s comrade-in-arms and seriously wounded in Afghanistan, Azra, Badia’s friend and chaperone, Ondersson - a pastor and his aim to build a school in the desert, Neymann - an outlandish American marginal hiding an inner truth and Naym - Badia’s son, and his inexorable slide into terrorism.  It is the story of seven lives, seven challenges - thrown together in a Saharan Mauritania steeped in the growing violence of Al-Qaeda in Maghreb and the secret counter-terrorism operations of the French: seven lives that meet in hope, hatred, love and redemption.   About the Author  Tom Gamble was born in Essex, England, has trekked across the Sahara, teaches and coaches in leading European universities and business schools and lives in France. He is the author of Amazir, runner up to the 2011 RNA awards.",
