  "description": "Alexa's struggle with the turn has sent her straight into the arms of the one man who feeds her madness: Kale Sinclair. Together they wreak havoc on the city and discover why they are so wrong for one another. When Alexa's sister, Agent Juliet O'Brien, gets busted covering up Alexa's kills, she's arrested by the government op she works for. They offer Alexa a deal. If she turns herself in, Juliet goes free. It's risky but it just might provide her with an opportunity she never anticipated. The separation from Arys is starting to weigh on them both. As Alexa's sanity suffers so do her relationships. A Jekyll and Hyde mentality makes her unstable and unpredictable. If she continues on this path of destruction, her dark side will take her to a place she can never come back from.",
