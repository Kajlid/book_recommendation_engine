  "description": "What would you do if true love showed up in the wrong package—and knocked your socks off? American actor John Kaiser lives in London where he’s found fame as a television celebrity and theatrical star. He unwittingly falls in love with Brian Mallory, a reclusive Scottish millionaire who takes refuge in his London penthouse once a year to conduct business. Brian sees John as a shy, nervous and clumsy new friend, but John hopes they’ll be much more than just friends—until he learns of a love curvaceous, blonde, and sexy Carol Lexington. He’s devastated when he realizes he can’t compete with this beautiful woman. Or can he? And even if he could win Brian’s love, what other forces would lie in wait to tear them apart? From the ritzy charity galas of London’s elite to an English countryside manor and a stunning, riverfront luxury penthouse, this love story takes you on a journey of humor, happiness, pain, jealousy and bitter betrayal. Filled with quirky best friends, catastrophic events, and undying love and devotion, it’s the story of a straight man who falls in love with a gay man who did everything wrong and still got everything right. Straight Man Gay does what Giovanni’s Room and Brokeback Mountain couldn’ It takes the shame out of being gay and in love.",
