Lindsay wants to ignore it, until her husband is murdered and suddenly believing becomes a matter of survival. Lindsay and her young daughter are forced to rely on another Hemera, her husband's partner and best friend, Bryce Beuermann as more and more of the Hemera are slaughtered. Bryce will do anything to help his best friend's widow--including suppressing his own deep feelings for her. But he must prove they can trust him, even pretending he doesn't want her with all his heart.",
