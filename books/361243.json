  "description": "In Hide My Eyes, private detective Albert Campion finds himself hunting down a serial killer in London's theatreland. A spate of murders leaves him with only two baffling clues: a lefthand glove and a lizard-skin letter case. These minimal clues and a series of perculiar events sets Campion on a race against time that takes him from an odd museum of curiosities hidden in a quiet corner of London to a scrapyard in the East End. Allingham shows her dark edge in Hide My Eyes and evokes the sights, sounds, and inimitable atmosphere of Fifties London.",
