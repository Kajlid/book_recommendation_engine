  "title": "The Atlantis Blueprint: Unlocking the Ancient Mysteries of a Long-lost Civilization",
  "description": "In 1982, the American scholar Charles H. Hapgood made an astonishing claim to a young librarian, Rand Flem-Ath--that civilisations was almost a hundred thousand years old, & that he had evidence to prove it. But before he could substantiate these remarkable assertions, Hapgood was tragically killed in a car crash. Together with his fellow author Colin Wilson, Flem-Ath set out to track down the truth behind the scholar's statements. Their study of the world's most sacred sites--Stonehenge, The Great Pyramids, Machu Picchu & many others--led them to an amazing discovery. Far from being built by local people for local reasons, these monuments formed an undeniable geometrical pattern. This in turn implied the existence of an ancient advanced civilisation whose knowledge of the world was far wider than had previously been thought possible. Presenting its argument with enormous persuasiveness The Atlantis Blueprint makes a powerful claim: that our civilisation is not the first to occupy the planet--nor is it likely to be the last.",
