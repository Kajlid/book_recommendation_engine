  "description": "My name is Olivia Sharpe. I live in glitzy Las Vegas at the top of the Sharpe Hotel and Casino, shut away from the world just the way I like it.Five years ago, the first and only time I gave myself to a man, something terrible happened. Since then, I’ve remained isolated where no one can hurt me. Recently, in a moment of weakness, of desperate loneliness, I called someone. Some call him gigolo, others call him an escort, rent-boy, or a male prostitute. I call him Dillon.I had only meant to paint him, to capture his tan muscled physique, those chiseled features, that captivating smile on canvas. However, what started out as one call turned into two, into three…then everything changed.",
