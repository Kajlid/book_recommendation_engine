  "title": "The Great Post Office Scandal: The fight to expose a multimillion pound IT disaster which put innocent people in jail",
  "description": "This “factual thriller” from the journalist Nick Wallis details a scandal which has been described as one of the most widespread and significant miscarriages of justice in legal history. On 23rd April 2021, the Court of Appeal quashed the convictions of 39 former Subpostmasters and ruled their prosecutions were an affront to the public conscience. They had been prosecuted by the Post Office using IT evidence from an unreliable computer system called Horizon.When the Post Office became aware that Horizon didn’t work properly, it covered it up. Nick describes how a group of Subpostmasters worked out what was going on, formed a campaign group and fought the government-owned Post Office through the courts to eventual victory.The Great Post Office Scandal has been described as “an extraordinary journalistic exposé of a huge miscarriage of justice” by Ian Hislop, Editor of Private Eye Magazine. Dame Joan Bakewell says “Nick’s narrative has the power of a great thriller as he lays bare the lies and deceit that has ruined so many lives.”",
