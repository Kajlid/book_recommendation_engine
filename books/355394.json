  "description": "“Here is a lightning-fast tale of intrigue, lies, and the mother-of-all terrorist plots. Big story, big adventure, big thumbs-up!” —JAMES ROLLINS, New York Times Bestselling Author of Kingdom of BonesJohn Viera left his CIA fieldwork hoping for a “normal” occupation and a long-awaited family, but when a Pakistani engineer is kidnapped from a top-secret US project and diplomatic entanglements tie the government’s hands, the Intelligence Community turns to John and his team of ex-operatives to investigate -- strictly off the books. They uncover a plot of unprecedented magnitude that will precipitate the slaughter of millions.From the corporate skyscrapers of Montreal to the treacherous alleys of Baluchistan, these formidable enemies strike, determined to create a regional apocalypse and permanently alter the balance of world power. Isolated in their knowledge of the impending devastation, John and his network stand alone between total destruction and the Leopard of Cairo.\"Wild adventure, delicious storytelling, tradecraft that only the insiders know. An excellent reminder that great spies tell great stories. The Leopard of Cairo is Bayard and Holmes's best one yet. Do not miss the Truth and Fiction section at the back.\"—ANNIE JACOBSEN, Pulitzer Prize Nominated Author of Surprise, Kill, Vanish ; TV writer/producer of Tom Clancy’s Jack Ryan",
