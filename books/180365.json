While my family’s market is abuzz with excitement every time the minor league hockey player graces us with a visit, I keep a respectful distance from his alluring presence. Or, I did, until he rushes to my side during a moment of crisis without hesitation.Who knew he was more than hard muscles and a cocky demeanor? Landon claims he has feelings for me.

As tempted as I am to give in to our magnetic attraction, I can’t help but fear he only wants me because I’m one prize he can’t easily win.
