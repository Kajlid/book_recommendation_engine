  "title": "Dingo the Story of Our Mob",
  "description": "The story of one of Australia's most loved film and television personalities. The Dingo family history follows the formula of any self-respecting soap opera. It's full of life, death, laughter, violence, struggle, children, poverty, alcohol, and surprisingly after all that, success. It is the stuff of overblown fiction. It is also a history shared with every other Aboriginal family, a history still unknown to many Australians. Dingo makes that incredible story truly accessible to non-Aboriginal Australians. Told through the eyes of Ernie Dingo's wife, Sally, it comes alive. It is also Sally's story. Emerging from her white middle-class existence in a sleepy Tasmanian town, Sally marries a charismatic actor and the turbulent Dingo tribe. She finds much to love and much to cry about. With the unique perspective of a white woman adopted by an Aboriginal family who is able to write about her experiences with great skill and warmth, Dingo is a story to be treasured. 'I think I have learnt more about Aboriginal society than in anything else I've heard or read for a long time.' The Sydney Morning Herald 'A book that bites deep into our consciousness'.
