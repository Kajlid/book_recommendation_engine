  "description": "Ian’s alpha tosses him out of his car at a training camp for worthless and weak wolf shifters run by a crazy vampire.  His only choice is to escape and go lone wolf.  Until he runs into Clare…  She actually volunteered for this gig.  Her wolf is all alpha but it’s crammed into a petite package, and she definitely has no mercy when it comes to him.  The work is hard.  The training dangerous.  Surviving is optional.  Clare can’t stand Ian’s disregard for her authority and he hates her driven ambition.  Sparks fly and teeth are bared. Opposites attract they say.  If they don’t kill each other first.",
