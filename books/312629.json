  "description": "After losing both her neighbor to suicide and her friend to a drunk driving accident, Lily — a talented ballerina on the verge of going pro — stuns everyone and quits ballet. Ostracized from her family and grappling with emotions that she can barely understand, Lily starts wandering her city — and stumbles upon a boxing gym inside a repurposed fire station. Under the guise of working at a local coffee shop, Lily secretly begins training. What happens next is a summer of discovery, of adventure, and of learning what it means to be strong, to stand up for yourself, and to be part of a family.",
