His dragon has come for his help, but this time they face a daunting foe—an ice wizard who is stealing dragon eggs and keeping them locked up in his frozen castle. Luckily George knows how to outwit even a powerful wizard, although things don’t turn out quite the way he expects.In this companion to picture book favorites The Egg and The Great Dragon Rescue, George embarks on a spine-tingling, surprising adventure that will thrill children—especially those too young for a certain other wizard!
