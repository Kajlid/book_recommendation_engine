  "description": "Maurice tells the story of a handsome, rather superior young man with a flair for business, a man who is deeply conventional but for one element that puzzles him, torments him and, when finally admitted, saves him. Through Clive, whom he encounters at Cambridge, and through Alex, the gamekeeper on Clive's country estate, Maurice gradually experiences a profound emotional and sexual awakening.",
