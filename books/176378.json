  "title": "The Pursuit of Bravery",
  "description": "A series of disastrous relationships with men, along with several unrequited crushes on women, has led Amariyah--Mari to her friends and family--to realize that she is a lesbian. She wants to explore her new-found sexuality, but she's deeply afraid of her traditionally-minded mother; her paranoia is so deep that she is even too scared to try a dating site.  She gets a chance when her beloved dog, Thor, escapes from her side after a walk, stopped in his pursuit of a stray cat by Julia, who is \"out\" and who makes it clear very quickly that she's interested in Amariyah. Although Julia is perfectly accepting of Amariyah's desire for secrecy, as their relationship matures, Amariyah must decide whether or not she's willing to openly embrace her love of the woman--and whether she's brave enough to show their love publicly.",
