  "description": "Knulp is the eternal vagabond -- a true drop-out of an earlier time. Perpetually wandering, dependent on the hospitality of friends, he consistently refuses to tie himself down to any trade, place or person. With profound understanding and sympathy, but also with some irony, Hesse portrays his journeys, his love affairs, his questioning of life -- reaching a final powerful climax when God reveals to Knulp that the purpose of his life has been to bring 'a little nostalgia for freedom' into the lives of ordinary men.",
