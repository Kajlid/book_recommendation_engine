  "description": "In Moonbright, Maine, there's a pumpkin on every porch, fresh brewed apple cider in every cup--and the sweetest sorcery in the air...\nBefore, after, and even during the excitement of the annual Halloween parade, gathering at the Corner Café is a beloved Moonbright tradition. Costumed revelers of all kinds come for the famous whoopie pies, the heartfelt hospitality, and the chance to hear the town's spookiest stories and local legends whispered to the younger generation...The most magically romantic legend of all promises that a Moonbright woman will marry the man she sees reflected in a mirror on Halloween. For three such singles, the crunch of fall leaves and the fragrance of fresh-baked pie sets the perfect stage for this most tantalizing trick--and most delightful treat--the genuine enchantment of true love.",
