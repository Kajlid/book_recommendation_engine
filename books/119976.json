  "title": "Tickets to Ride: An Alphabetic Amusement",
  "description": "Welcome to an amusement park unlike any you've seen before. From Alligators in the Air, through to the Zebra Zeppelin, the reader is provided with an elegant ticket that admits them onto rides at turns thrilling, mysterious, spectacular-and always breathtaking to look at. In fact, picking a favorite amongst these 26 stunning illustrations proved so difficult, we've decided to release this book with six different jackets, each highlighting a different piece of this astonishing artwork. And even after the first perusal, both children and adults alike will go back over these images again and again in search of the items hidden cleverly within them. At the end of the book, a detailed map of this incredible park is also included for hours more of fascinating fun. Tickets to Ride is the debut of a major new talent in children's picture books. We invite you to tender your ticket and come along for a remarkable ride.",
