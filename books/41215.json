  "description": "Everyone jumped to their feet and stood at attention. The General stood before us, red with anger while the entire arena held their breath, waiting to see what was going to happen.“Harry, Chael, you’re free to go see the healwife to have your arms looked after and Caleb…”“No.”Everyone looked at me, shocked by my refusal. Even the General stood speechless.“Sir, when we spoke yesterday, you promised me the match I wanted.”He nodded.“I want it now.”“Chael, son, you’re hurt…”“With all due respect, sir, my arm’s not broken.” I moved it to show I wasn’t lying and tried not to wince as the pins and needles moved along the length of it.The general threw his hands up in desperation. “Chael’s luck,” he mumbled before throwing an apologetic look my way. “Alright, Chael. Nothing else is going as it should and quite frankly I’m at a bit of a loss. Caleb, you fight Chael for the Shadow Knight challenge.” When you’re named for the god of bad luck, you’re at least a head shorter than everyone else around you, and your horse is the only black one in a world where every horse is a grey, people are bound to talk. Chael has spent the past eighteen years of his life proving to those around him that he’s worthy of his family name; that he’s meant to be a Shadow Knight. Just when things are finally going his way, Chael’s luck strikes again. Now, Chael is in a race against time to find the one who has taken everything from him and who plans on destroying the one thing he’s worked so hard for, the knighthood. As if this weren’t enough, he’ll have to reveal the one thing he’s managed to keep secret for the past eighteen years. With help from some unexpected sources, Chael sets off on a journey that will test his will, his character, and his heart.",
