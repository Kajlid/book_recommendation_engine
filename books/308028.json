I certainly have. As a woman in my forties, who had a disastrous marriage,and having taken 5 years to find myself again I really identified with Henri and the self-doubtsshe found herself with. The book was written beautifully and took into consideration the complexity of the human brain, emotions and, of course, menopause. Thank you for the lovely book.\" ***\"Aww, this is so perfect. Feel completely invested in Danny and Henri and the supporting characters are adorable too. Honest about women's lives - empty nest, menopause, confidence issues, and...sex. Not for the faint hearted at times but very funny and joyful along the way. Read it in one sitting, thewords just glide off the page. Absolutely delightful.\"",
