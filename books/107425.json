  "description": "Every year, Ivy League colleges tell prospective students that, \"Here, you learn even more from other students than you do from your classes.\" What if that were just a roundabout way to say, \"Our teaching is pretty mediocre\"?What if, in addition to providing mediocre teaching, colleges were extracting exorbitant sums of money from students, their families, and American taxpayers?What if the college admissions process had transformed high school education into a series of pointless hoops for students to jump through?What if some of the most successful people in America had never gone to college? What if that were not just a coincidence, and their refusals to participate in a disempowering educational system had caused their successes?What if the very thing that American students work so hard for, that American families save for, that American taxpayers subsidize, is not only overpriced, but actually harmful?",
