  "title": "An Uncommon Friendship: a memoir of love, mental illness, and friendship",
  "description": "When Stewart Young becomes mentally ill with a variety of disorders, his mind betraying and lying to him, he fights his demons in an attempt to save his own life. His wife, Monique, has her own demons, but she is determined to keep him safe. When his infatuation with other women brings the marriage to a screeching halt, she continues to take care of him, and their friendship remains strong, despite the isolation, rapid mood swings, hallucinations, and the occasional psychotic episode. Through a combination of diary entries, emails, and narrative, we see the progression of his illness, and the recovery that appears so close, yet is so far away. More than a tale of mental illness and the havoc it wreaks on those who have it and those who love them, it's a story of friendship, and what we're willing to do for those we love.",
