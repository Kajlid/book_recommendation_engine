  "description": "The future Baroness van Tellerinck isn't exactly sure why she has agreed to get married. Perhaps it's because the tall and broad-shouldered Raf doesn't make her feel like a giant. It certainly isn't a love match. She doesn't love Raf, and he seems indifferent toward her.Â… Everything changes, though, when Raf's ex-girlfriend, Beyke, returns and shakes up this marriage of convenience. Suddenly Katrina's emotions are in turmoil. She couldn't be jealous, could she?",
