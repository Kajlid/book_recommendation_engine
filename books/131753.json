  "title": "Tabby Cat Tales",
  "description": "This short book is a memoir of a cat and her family, set in the 1960's. Tabby was a real cat, born in 1965 to an animal loving family in a small northwest Ohio town. The family owned at least 14 cats over the years. Three of the most memorable cats were three generations of felines: mother, daughter, and granddaughter. Tabby was the daughter of Shadow, one of the earlier cats. Tabby was given the honor of writing her story. She remembers the details of her life as if it just happened yesterday. Tabby tells about all of the author's childhood cats: Chester, born with only three legs; Fluffy, who loved to walk on the neighbor's car; and Mitzi, the meanest cat that ever lived. Also included in the book are the tales of some other family pets besides cats: chickens, a guinea pig, a white mouse, a hamster, and a gerbil. This short autobiography includes 14 photos of Tabby and her family and friends. From the author: My cat loving friends encouraged me to write a book about my felines after I included a few cat tales in my book, \"Cherished Cats and Childhood Capers\". All of the stories in this book are true. Although the memories of my beloved felines have faded a bit with the passage of time, this cat memoir was written to the best of my recollection.",
