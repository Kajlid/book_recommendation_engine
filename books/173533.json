  "description": "Knowledge can set you free, but fear will help you rule. So it came to be that on the same day, at the same minute and the same second, ten of the most populous cities around the world were destroyed, leaving no known survivors. The spies and covert groups were blamed, hunted down and destroyed by better agents. Agents that can read minds, punch through walls, and control the actions of others, working for an organization as old as the Roman Empire itself. When their first rogue agent in history wakes up with no memories, covered in bruises and targeted for execution, it's up to him to recover his past and reveal the secret of their powers. But first, he must decipher his name and answer the question that plagues them all: What is your greatest fear?",
