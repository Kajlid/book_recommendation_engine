Helena survived with triple scars that disfigured her face, and strange tales of a wolf that stood upright and spoke to her.Now at age sixteen, she knows it was no wolf. And it was not alone. A pack of similar animals banded together to kill Francois, the woodcutter who saved her from the first wolf. These creatures now threaten Helena’s family and everyone in the French province of La Rue Sauvage. To stop them, Helena must do things she never planned to do, and become something she never planned to become. Donning a red hood and cloak like the one she was forbidden to wear after the first attack, she arms herself with a repeating crossbow and other assorted weapons. She then wages a private war against the wolves, refusing to stop or slow down until she wipes them out. She only hopes she can somehow defeat the monsters when she confronts them … whatever they actually are.THE RED RIDERThe New Action-Adventure Fairy Tale Thrillerby Randall Allen DunnCome along for the ride.",
