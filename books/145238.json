  "description": "In just over an hour and twenty minutes, Joseph Greenwood would be dead…\nA successful art dealer with a penchant for paintings, Greenwood is blissfully unaware of his date with death as he drives through the English countryside. His mind is on the hot tip he’d received about a very valuable, original Stanley Spencer painting now in the hands of one-time actress and Flaxfield resident Victoria Varley. But after one look, Greenwood’s dead—and Victoria and the large sum of money Greenwood had on him have disappeared.Not putting much faith in circumstantial evidence, the sleuthing twosome of Lizzie Thomas, plucky housewife, and not-quite-retired police inspector John Webber get on the case—and discover that art collecting can be a most dangerous business… and that priceless masterpieces can often lead to wholesale murder.(Publisher’s description)",
