  "description": "Life’s full of good news and bad news for defence lawyer Robbie Munro. Good news is he’s in work, representing Antonia Brechin on a drugs charge – unfortunately she’s the granddaughter of notorious Sheriff Brechin. His old client Ellen has won the lottery and she’s asked Robbie to find her husband Freddy who’s disappeared after swindling Jake Turpie, but he’s not willing to bury the hatchet – unless it’s in Freddy’s head. Robbie juggles cases and private life with his usual dexterity, but the more he tries to fix things the more trouble everyone’s in.",
