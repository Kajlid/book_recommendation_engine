  "description": "At every point, Joe Simon and Jack Kirby raised the bar.When they came to comics, Superman had been around for about a year, and the medium was still in its infancy. They took the action and made it explode, breaking out of the panels and sprinting across the page. They showed what comics could do, experimenting with layout and design, creating the first full-page panels and double page spreads.Their first million-seller was a superhero ( Captain America ), and their next was military adventure that outsold Superman (DC's Boy Commandos ). These two guys from Rochester and Brooklyn broke all the rules when they created the first romance comics, and they blazed trails in every horror, science fiction, crime etc ...Their work in the legendary title Black Magic was acclaimed by readers. It was held up on national television by the Senate Committee on Juvenile Delinquency, where experts claimed Black Magic contributed to the corruption of American youth! Also included here are the Simon and Kirby stories from the experimental terror title Strange World of Your Dreams .",
