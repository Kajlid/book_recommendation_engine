  "description": "LOVE HAS ITS REASONSWhen William Fitch Minstead, the sixth Earl of Ackerman, agrees to a private audience with a lovely stranger, he's rewarded with the fateful news that he is the father of a little girl. After the death of her friend Elizabeth Bradstreet, Miss Hilary Compton became Lizzie's guardian. It is clear that Miss Compton thinks Fitch has neglected a child he never knew existed and she intends to right that wrong. Captivated by her charm and wit, the earl proposes a solution: a marriage of convenience.WHICH REASON DOES NOT KNOWThough she is only the daughter of a county squire, Hilary is independent to a fault – not the sort to submit to the whims of a handsome earl with a rakish reputation, even if Fitch insists that his service during the brutal Crimean War left him a changed man. Her decision would be so much easier were he the seducing scoundrel she had expected. Perhaps the arrangement he suggest is for the best – if she can keep herself from falling in love.",
