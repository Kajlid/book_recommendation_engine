  "title": "Indian Peter: The Extraordinary Life and Adventures of Peter Williamson",
  "description": "According to Peter's own account, his farm was attacked in 1754, during what became known as the French and Indian War, and he was captured by the Indians, who forced him to travel with them as a slave. After escaping, he joined the British Army to fight the French and their Indian allies but his regiment was forced to surrender and he was taken to Canada as a prisoner of war. Eventually, the POWs were exchanged for French prisoners and Peter found himself free. He made his way back to Scotland and tracked down the men who were behind his initial kidnapping,Â taking them to court in a landmark case that exposed the scandal of slave trading.Once settled in Edinburgh, Peter became a publican, writer, publisher, and entrepreneur. He developed Edinburgh's first Penny Post system, launched a weekly magazine, and shamelessly exploited his experiences for profit. A well-known figure, especially in the law courts, his 1788 divorce case scandalized the city - and provided further fodder for his autobiographical pen.Brimming with action and adventure,Indian Peter is a true-life tale of abduction, war, courtroom drama, and survival against the odds.",
