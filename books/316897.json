He’s here to acquire mineral rights to half a dozen farms in town.And there’s no way he’s getting mine.I don’t make deals with the devil.So when he challenges me to show him the small town ropes, my motivation is the prospect of seeing him make a fool of himself.

A man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants.And me in the middle.When the devil comes to town, you have to meet him head-on.And when he sneaks into your heart, he’ll only break it.",
