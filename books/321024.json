  "description": "The princess and a dead man. They say money makes the world go round. They’d be wrong.Sure, power can be bought, but you can gain a hell of a lot more with knowledge. With knowledge comes fear.I’ve seen it.I’ve caused it.I’ve even been the brunt of it.But when a stowaway princess barrels into my life like a runaway train, I throw patience out the window—the same one I jump out of, taking her with me. Now I’ve got more problems than any contract killer deserves.That includes Aliyah Zahir—an internationally coveted socialite, a true royal, and a social media sensation. Returning to the lion’s den, she ends up in harm’s way—all for a mirage.She’s chasing a ghost.But instead, she finds a dead man.I’m done being patient. It’s my turn to administer fear for a change, and no one is better equipped to fix Liyah’s problems than me.And I’m never giving her back.",
