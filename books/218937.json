  "description": "When one recalls the symbolism of \"The Scarlet Letter,\" it is natural to speculate on the allegory of \"The Marble Faun.\" The three sinners - Hester Prynne, Arthur Dimmesdale, and Roger Chillingworth - and the different shades of sin which they present invite comparison. The role of the 'A' and the symbolical nature of the child, Pearl, suggest that in Hawthorne people and objects have different levels of meaning. In \"The Marble Faun,\" the contrasting characters of Miriam and Hilda in their roles of mysterious dark lady and the fair-haired Saxon carry with them numerous connotations. The flame at the Virgin's shrine, the shadow that dogs Miriam's steps the sunshine wine of Monte Beni, and the various myths and works of art take on deeper meaning when compared with the events of the story.Hawthorne has presented three words in \"The Marble Faun:\" the world of art, the word of artists, and the world of morals and religion. These are bathed in mystery and in the ambiguity of allegory, but they prove both interesting and thought-provoking.",
