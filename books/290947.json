  "description": "Some damage cannot be fixed. Love. Faith. Honor. Trust. Devotion. These sound like tenets to live by, but at Pinnacle University, they are the kings who rule all.Five men. Five of the wealthiest successors known to man. Five cruel minds who see the world as their plaything. And me? I made the mistake of telling them no. No, I wouldn’t be theirs. No, I didn’t care about money. No, they’d never break me. So I’ve been enrolled in their school, in their kingdom, and I’m their pet. Meant to be used. Meant to be controlled. Meant to be damaged. I won’t be destroyed. Not by them, not by anyone. And by the end of this, we’ll all be left irrepairable. Note from the authors: This is a dark reverse harem college bully romance. This is not your typical academy romance. No school walls can contain this darkness. Welcome to the Pinnacle Group Estate. If you're looking for the light, turn away now.",
