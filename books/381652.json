  "description": "“[A] delightful tale of an intelligent, competent woman sharing adventure and romance with a formidable partner” (Publishers Weekly, starred review).The Blades of the Rose are sworn to protect the sources of magic in the world. But the work is dangerous--and they can't always protect their own. . .Ready For Action London Harcourt's father is bent on subjugating the world's magic to British rule. But since London is a mere female, he hasn't bothered to tell her so. He's said only that he's leading a voyage to the Greek isles. No matter, after a smothering marriage and three years of straitlaced widowhood, London jumps at the opportunity--unfortunately, right into the arms of Bennett Day.Risking It All Bennett is a ladies' man, when he's not dodging lethal attacks to protect the powers of the ancients from men like London's father. Sometimes, he's a ladies' man even when he is dodging them. But the minute he sees London he knows she will require his full attention. The woman is lovely, brilliant, and the only known speaker of a dialect of ancient Greek that holds the key to calling down the wrath of the gods. Bennett will be risking his life again--but around London, what really worries him is the danger to his heart. . .Praise for The Blades of the Rose \"Crackles with adventure, a rich sense of place, and terrific characterization.\" --Mary Jo Putney \"Weaves a delightful spell…cleverly blending history and magic.\"--Elizabeth Vaughan, USA Today bestselling author \"An innovative and exciting romantic adventure with just the right touch of the paranormal.\" --Jennifer Ashley, USA Today bestselling author",
