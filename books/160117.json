  "description": "An examination of racial tensions in a small, rural, conservative town in South AfricaThe arrival of a tank of lobsters in a local shop in Klippisfontein, South Africa, sets the community talking. Local kids and adults watch on with fascinated delight, but an undercurrent of suspicion and dislike soon begins to surfaceâ€”and it's not all about the lobsters. In a town troubled by undercurrents of racism, prejudice, and poverty, some people show their worst traits while others shine through with humor, warmth, and affection. A funny and touching story of friendship, marriage, kindness, redemption, and brightly colored shellfish.",
