  "description": "What if the world you know was taken from you tomorrow? David spends his time staring out the window at the forest he can see from his family’s apartment window, yearning to explore the woods until war ravages the world and thrusts him into a nuclear wasteland. Like many others, he finds security in the woods that once filled his daydreams. He takes shelter under the boughs of the ancient pines while he watches everything he knows turned upside down by a prolonged nuclear winter. Emerging from this apocalypse, he has little more than a cabin in the woods and a small store of canned food. Years of winter and constant hunger tug at the little hope he has of survival. Struggling to make it just one more day, David must face his own demons, abandon everything he has ever known, and travel to the last vestiges of humanity where a war between starving factions threatens mankind’s last chance to make up for past mistakes.",
