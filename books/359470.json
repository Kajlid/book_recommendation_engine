  "description": "\"I want to go home! Please, someone, take me hooowwwmmme!\" The beautiful shell groaned and wailed, even louder than before. \"Where is your home?\" asked Retishella mermaid gently, trying to be helpful. \"Blackrock Ridge\" came the whiny reply. \"Do you know where that is?\" \"Yes,\" said Retishella in a shocked whisper. Her mother had warned her about Blackrock Ridge, but what could she do if the shell needed her help? Retishella soon finds out that the shell is not all it seems and is launched into another exciting and dangerous adventure on the seabed. Retishella and the Pocket Shell is the second of Retishella's adventures that began with Retishella and the Dolphins, also by Linda Bond.",
