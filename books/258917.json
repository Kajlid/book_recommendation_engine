  "description": "When Mason’s sexy older neighbour turns out to be his choreographer, should he walk away, or dance into his arms? New job, new Mason hopes both will lead to him escaping burnout as a ballet dancer. Not living out of a suitcase anymore is a bonus. A steamy encounter with his neighbour, David—a man twice his age—gets things off to a good start, until they both turn up for work at the dance studio the next morning. Sleeping with his choreographer is bound to make things complicated, but Mason can’t stay away, especially when David wants to introduce him to kinks he’s never experienced. Is Mason willing to be completely vulnerable with David, so he can feel more alive than he’s ever done before? A Dance For You is a MM forbidden romance, with explicit language, an age-gap relationship, steamy scenes, mild D/s play and a whole lot of heart. It’s the second in a duet of standalone romances, with a happy ever after. A Dance For You is also available in an omnibus edition.",
