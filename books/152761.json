  "description": "The Godslayer does one thing and he does it well. When some damn fool stands up and declares himself a god, Slayer shoves a few feet of sharpened steel through him to see if the godling can miracle himself back to health. Not one has risen to the challenge. Godslayer, is the latest and –-by his own lights-- greatest in a line of heroes that kill anyone foolish enough to proclaim themselves a god. Catrina, is the Lady Ambassador Godslayer must take along on his next mission as both guide and . . . well, baby-sitter! Godslayer is not pleased but he figures to lose the wench somewhere along the way. The mission is simple: cross the ocean, find the god, discover how he’s growing blockbuster crops in the middle of a drought before killing him, and return said secret to their employers. What could possibly go wrong? Everything!",
