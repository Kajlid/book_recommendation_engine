  "description": "Our hometown doesn’t give second chances—and neither does Willow Haven. Not even for a charmer like me.As the resident bad boy, I wasn't supposed to fall for the untouchable small town princess. Her mayor daddy sure as hell didn’t want her anywhere near me. And he did everything in his power to scare me away. Loving Willow ruined my life. But ten years is a long time, and now I’m a grown man calling my own shots. I’m back in Havenbrook to open the town’s first bar, but I need Willow’s help. The trouble is, she’s no longer the girl I left behind but a woman with nothing but fire in her eyes. And all that anger is directed straight at me. She can pretend to hate me, but there’s no denying the chemistry that still crackles between us. Despite warnings from Mayor Haven, I’ve got my sights set on more than just the town, and I won’t be so easily scared off again. I might be from the wrong side of the tracks, but I know I’m right for Willow. And this time, I’m not going to let anyone stand in my way.",
