  "description": "Since she arrived in Italy, Azazel hasn’t been able to stop having nightmares. Sometimes her boyfriend Jason is covered in blood, grinning at her like a demon. Sometimes there is a gun in her hand, and she’s shooting the people she loves the most. The only way to stop the dreams is to drown them in liquor. Azazel can hardly concentrate on anything else. Not the library located in the Sol Solis School. Not the secrets about Jason’s origins they need to discover there. Not the prom. Not the fact that she can’t have orgasms. Azazel feels like black water is closing over her head. And she doesn’t know if she can breathe anymore.",
