  "description": "Commitment to Die A Kristin Ashe Mystery by Jennifer L. Jordan  Lauren Fairchild hiked to a remote Colorado lake and committed suicide - that much seems sure. But why? Why would she abandon her only sister, her beloved niece, and her raven-haired, hazel-eyed lover? What mysterious anniversary did Lauren celebrate just days before dying? Where had she really gone every two weeks - when her date book showed \"doctor's\" appointments? And who among her lovers, relatives, and friends was hiding crucial information about Lauren's death?  That's what part-time P.I. Kristin Ashe must discover, all the while coping with her own demons - the heartbreak of her brother's near-death, and her rocky relationship with beautiful lesbian activist Destiny Greaves. Good thing Kris can count on help from Fran Green, a straight-talking, queer-thinking ex-nun with attitude.",
