  "description": "Zack’s spent his whole life loving just one woman—Belle—only to have her walk out of his life and go half way across the world. But three years later, her unexpected return is stirring up feelings that never died, and Zack’s ready to do whatever it takes to get her back.  Belle has never gotten over Zack, but she has secrets—secrets she knows could hurt those closest to her, Zack included. When an old enemy returns and wants what he thinks is already his for the taking, she knows it’s only a matter of time before someone gets hurt.  With so much more than just their love on the line, will Zack and Belle manage to come together as one and pull through or will their past and their enemies tear them apart?",
