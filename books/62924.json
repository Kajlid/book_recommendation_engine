  "description": "With complete frankness Osho discusses the three stages of sex - physical, psychological and spiritual - and provides guidance on how this raw energy can be transformed into the realization of ultimate consciousness. He explains that when we repress our basic nature, sex takes roots in the unconscious, creating an unnatural obsession. It is this psychic state that has produced much mental sickness and the widespread perversity of society today. \"Sex is man's most vibrant energy,\" Osho says,\" but it should not be an end unto itself: sex should lead man to his soul.\"",
