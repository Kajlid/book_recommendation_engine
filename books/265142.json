She's content with who she is, her size and doesn't need to be some arm candy to make her feel pretty or smart. She is all of these things. Sort of.

Hot as he is, she's determined to stay focused on her career. But when Daniel proves not to be the ruthless playboy the media makes him out to be, can Abby make room for love in her life?
