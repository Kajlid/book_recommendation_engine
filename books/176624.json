  "description": "Phillip Todd is a normal army brat and baby boomer with one small a super human power to control all living beings. Like Superman, he takes years to uncover and develop his abilities. Unlike Superman, he sets no moral controls on his power. From age 3 through 17 he increasingly manipulates and discards others with glib disregard. As an army dependent, he spends his formative adolescent years in post-war Germany pursuing nearly maniacal sexual needs with Jill, the precociously ripe daughter of his father’s commanding colonel, and Wanda, his mother’s friend and frustrated wife of a feckless lieutenant. To rid himself of the moral and human excesses, Phillip engineers final, drastic solutions.From encounters with nuns of the Order of the Perpetually Disgruntled, juvenile delinquents, line-dancing German youths, paramilitary American dependents, and luckless soldiers, Phillip grows more controlling and despotic until he cuts all ties to humanity with acts of indifferent cruelty in order to maintain his This book features an anti-hero and contains language and sexual situations that are explicit - but never gratuitous - and intended for an adult reader.",
