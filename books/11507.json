  "description": "REPLICA is a fast-paced thriller/romance you will find hard to put down. Beth Chandler, bright, attractive but unassertive, is accidentally replicated in a flawed experiment at the government research institute where she works. A second Beth comes into being, complete with all her memories. To Sir Peter Ellis, MI5 chief, the replica is an embarrassment that must be hushed up and disposed of. Overhearing him, Beth Two goes on the run. With no official existence, homeless, penniless and pursued by Sir Peter’s agents, she has to find the inner strength and aggression to survive on icy London streets. Meanwhile the original Beth, unaware of what has happened, becomes romantically involved with Nick Cavanagh, the spec op she believes is there to protect her. In fact, he’s hunting her double. Nick refuses to face his moral doubts about Beth Two - as far as he’s concerned, it’s not his problem. As events unfold, and the situation grows more complicated, he has to decide whose side he is on. S. Horrigan, AMAZON VINE TOP 500 REVIEWER, “Read it! You won't regret it! Another cracking story from Lexi. Don't be put off by the seemingly science fiction based plot. The real story is the way that the two Beths deal with situations that they find themselves in and of their discovery of their real self. As with Lexi's first book, presentation on the Kindle is about as good as it gets. This deserves nothing less than 5 stars! An original, very well told intelligent story that had me turning the pages right to the end.” (See entire review below.) Full length 82,000 words, by the author of REMIX.",
