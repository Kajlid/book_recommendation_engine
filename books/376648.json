  "description": "Something is lurking in Lake Michigan... and it's waiting for Molly. Upon moving to the sleepy, beach side town of South Haven, sixteen-year-old Molly McInnis senses something eerie and mysterious in the atmosphere surrounding her new home—and her initial instincts are right. An enchanting creature beckons her, and it holds the key to the truth about the lake, and the truth about who Molly is. Because the water will haunt her until she learns the secret. The trouble is, a change is about to happen in Molly’s world, and it can either be good… or dark and evil. But the transformation depends on timing, and her impatience might just get the best of her.",
