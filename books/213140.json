  "title": "The Books of Angelhaunt: Art Prose",
  "description": "In these four Angelhaunt books, Jason Stuart Ratcliff explores his schizophrenia for all the creative treasures it holds within it. Ratcliff puts art prose beyond where it has ever gone, transcending the line between fiction and poetry, and creating a manifesto of sorts to the world of literary art that says, We don't want any more petty tales. Give us pure mind and self, and everything terrible and holy within you.",
