Suzy Wallace, a woman scorned, wreaks havoc and revenge on her husband's mistress, once her best friend, now her sworn enemy. She will never forgive and never forget. Alexandra Johnston, ambitious, talented and seductive, uses every trick she can to get what she wants...and then finds out that having is not quite the same as wanting. Ellen Munroe, the mother of Chris' child, the woman he has used and abused over and over, finally has the chance for happiness with an honest, decent, steadfast man...until Chris lies his way into her heart again. Mirror, Mirror is the story of women who have had enough. This is a tale of delicious revenge and glorious vindictiveness, as Chris Wallace finally tastes the bitter fruits of his deceits and gets what has been coming to him.",
