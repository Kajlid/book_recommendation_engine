This is book one of Corey and Mimi's story with the second book releasing in November.  What happens when fire meets gasoline?  That’s all it took was a spark. One kiss and I was hooked. I wanted to hate Corey Winchester more than anything and most days I did. He was an arrogant asshole, and bully. He didn't know the first thing about love but yet here I was falling into his lap.  Then things changed. I changed. Someone broke me, and he was there to pick up the pieces showing me a part of him I had never seen. Compassion, trust, and love. I wanted to hate him, with everything in me I wanted to look at him and feel nothing but I guess love and hate can’t coincide together.  What happens when you think you know someone? Like really know them?  Turns out we didn't know each other as well as we thought.   Turns out if you play with fire for too long you, you will in fact get burned.  My names Mimi Jones and this isn't a fairy tale.  ******** Series Order: Bittersweet Revenge Bittersweet Love Bittersweet Hate Bittersweet Trust Bittersweet Symphony",
