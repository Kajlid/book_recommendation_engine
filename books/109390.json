  "title": "Morris Southall and the Unpublished Library",
  "description": "During the Christmas holiday, Morris Southall wrote the most exciting story for his school homework. It was the story of a boy spy who saved the world from an evil mastermind impersonating Santa Claus. But Rollo, Morris' greedy dog, ate the story; and Morris' teacher, Miss Bossyboots, didn't believe he ever did his homework. On a school trip to an ancient library, Morris is left behind because he uses a wheelchair. He meets a strange librarian who tells him of a secret library where all the stories every written but never published come to life along with lost books by famous authors. Somewhere in its depths is Morris' story that Rollo ate. The library is in danger of burning down and only Morris can save it. Morris and Rollo set out to save the library and retrieve his story. But stories have a power of their own; they want to be told. In the dark of the secret library, stories come alive. The library is home to wonderful things as well as terrifying monsters, including a mad bull, a maniacal Santa, and a murderous pirate. Can Morris recover his story? Can he stop the library from burning down? Can he escape the labyrinth alive? After all, he is just a chubby boy in a wheelchair, with a highly trained but goofy dog. Are you brave enough to travel into the Unpublished Library with Morris and Rollo? Great for readers aged 8-14 to adult. Watch out for Book 2 of the Morris Southall Series, coming soon!",
