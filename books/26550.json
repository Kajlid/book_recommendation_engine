  "description": "In this hilarious follow-up to GONE WITH A HANDSOMER MAN, Charleston pastry chef Teeny Templeton witnesses a murder and discovers that her laywer-boyfriend, Coop O'Malley, has been keeping secrets. \nItâ€™s not every day that I bake a dozen Red Velvet cakes, learn my boyfriend may have a love child, and I witness a murder.Â After Charleston pastry chef, Teeny Templeton, witnesses a murder, she discovers that her lawyer-boyfriend, Coop Oâ€™Malley, has been keeping secrets: the victimâ€™s ten-year-old daughter may be his child. As more lies explode, Teeny finds herself trapped in Bonaventure, Georgia, a zanyâ€œlittle Savannah,â€ where she must deal with her commitment phobia, gather DNA from a ten-year old child genius, outwit a stalker, decode an encrypted diary, and fend off advances of an ex-beau, a handsome plastic surgeon whoâ€™s crazy-in-love with her. Â Teenyâ€™s life gets maddeningly complicated by a series of not-so-teeny troubles: an uneasy love triangle, a gossip-mongering tarantula breeder, an wise-cracking Southern Belle with early Alzheimerâ€™s, Coopâ€™s loveable Chihuahua-toting granny, and clues that point to the illegal trafficking of human organs. But when a suspect is arrested, the bodies keep piling up and Teeny doesnâ€™t know who to trust. As the murderers close in, Teeny unearths a revelation that becomes a game-changer and flips her world upside-down.",
