  "description": "For Constance Verity, saving the world isn t the hard part. It s keeping her new, ordinary life from falling apart along the way that s going to be tricky. Constance Verity Saves the World is the next book in the witty Constance Verity trilogy, which Booklist named a Top 10 SF/Fantasy book of 2016. Constance successfully became an ordinary person. People warned her it would be boring and they were right. That s exactly why Connie loves it. But there s an Adventurer-shaped hole in the cosmos now, and a lot of interested parties eager to fill it. Not all of those candidates are fit for the role, and if The Adventurer falls into the wrong hands, it can lead to chaos and destruction. Constance still has all the skills of her old life, but she s no longer chosen. Yet when the fate of the world is at stake, she sets off, reluctantly, to keep the forces of evil from stealing the destiny she abandoned.\"",
