  "description": "The blushing bride. The handsome groom. A secret one of them will kill for…It’s the day I’ve been dreaming about my whole life. As I glide down the flower-strewn aisle overlooking the Greek orange groves, in my pearl-encrusted ivory gown, I finally see my fiancé Nik. We look like the perfect couple, but not all fairy tales have happy endings…I try to forget the urgent calls from my sister this morning, and how she doesn’t know I’m about to marry a man I have only known for a few months. His family seem a little off and he shuts down when I ask him about his past – but we’ve all got skeletons in the closet, right?As I take in the guests, I don’t recognise a single person or see any of my friends or family. It doesn’t matter, though, what matters is Nik – the handsome man waiting at the altar who loves me so much.Of course, he doesn’t know the true reason I moved to this beautiful island, or what happened to my ex-husband.And when he finds out who I really am, it will be far too late…",
