  "description": "The man I loved is a liar, a predator who lured me in with sweet words and empty promises. Now, I’m trapped and it’s only a matter of time before he loses control. I have one chance to run. Head for the wilds and don’t look back. If I leave, I might die, but he’ll kill me if I stay. For so long it’s seemed like I’m destined to spend my days in hiding; scared and alone. But when a freak accident sends a pack of shifters crashing into my path, I catch a glimpse of a life worth living. Can I find the Love and safety I crave with three men the rest of society considers threats?**This is a HEA Standalone novel previously published under the pen name Sterling Thomas. Nothing's been changed inside the book, just the pen name! While there are numbers attached to the series, it's simply because it is a shared universe. ANY books in this series, by either myself or J. Kearston, will follow a different main characters. The world builds a bit more with each book, and there are easter eggs and cameos, so naturally it might be more more fun if you read them in order, but it's not necessary. Happy reading!",
