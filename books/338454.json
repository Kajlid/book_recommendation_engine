  "description": "What lurks in the shadows is even more horrific than I could have imagined. The only thing worse than having a bad reputation is having no reputation at all. So, as invisible as I am, I can’t say no when the La Famiglia heir drops an invitation to party in my lap. Even if that party is rumoured to be more dangerous than the man himself. Tino holds all the keys to my future status at The Academy, and all I need is an opportunity. But is his world more than I can handle? He seems to think I could be the light at the end of his tunnel, but all signs point that we’ll both end up in the dark… Please note, this is a tragic, yet beautiful, and heart-breaking love story. It does not have a Happily Ever After (HEA) or even a Happy For Now (HFN). The hero in this book gets his HEA in the Love on the Line duet; Broken Lies and Fractured Truth.",
