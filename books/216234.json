  "description": "Introduction by A. S. Byatt. The first-ever full-color facsimile edition of one of Jane Austen's early works, with delightful portraits painted by her sister Cassandra, followed by a transcribed version of the text. Sixteen-year-old Jane describes herself as \"a partial, prejudiced, and ignorant historian,\" and her gleeful parody hints at the humor she would later bring to her novels. \"Treats royalty with less respect (and more wit) than a British tabloid.\"--Cleveland Plain Dealer.",
