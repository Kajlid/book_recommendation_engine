  "description": "In Bela Lugosi's White Christmas, A.J. is being detained at Her Majesty's Pleasure for killing a girl: not that he meant to kill her, but that in his more unbalanced phases he doesn't really know what he's doing. Most of this uproarious novel concerns A.J.'s night of freedom, when his psychiatrist helps him escape from the security hospital in which he is being kept.",
