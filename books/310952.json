  "description": "Something is rotten in Tribane city. The humans are descending into madness and Tegan is certain that the sorcerer Theodore has something to do with it. Oh yeah, and she’s the reason Ethan’s been exiled by the vampires.This would be fine if it weren’t for the fact that he’s renting the house across the street, which means she can’t escape his condemnation, nor the fact that she still has strong and intense feelings for the two-hundred- and seventy-seven-year-old vampire.Tegan has her work cut out for her keeping those feelings in check while contending with a lust potion, a father who needs rescuing, and a vampire governor out for revenge.Witching Hour is book #3 in L.H. Cosway’s Blood Magic Series. A previous unedited version of this story was published under the title Tegan’s Magic.",
