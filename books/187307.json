  "description": "In the remote Rocky Mountains, lives depend on the Search & Rescue brotherhood. But in a place this far off the map, trust is hard to come by and secrets can be murder...As a Motorcycle Club member and firefighter, Ian Walsh is used to riding the line between the good guys and the bad. He may owe the Club his life, but his heart rests with his fire station brothers...and with the girl he's loved since they were kids, Rory Sorenson. Ian would do anything for Rory. He'd die for her. Kill for her. Defend her to his last breath-and he may just have to.Every con in the Rockies knows Rory is the go-to girl for less-than-legal firearms, and for the past few years, she's managed to keep the peace between dangerous factions by remaining strictly neutral. But when she defends herself against a brutal attack, Rory finds herself catapulted into the center of a Motorcycle Club war-with only Ian standing between her and a threat greater than either of them could have imagined.Search and Rescue:  On His Watch (novella) Hold Your Breath Fan the Flames Gone too DeepIn Safe HandsWhat People are Saying:  \"Sexy and suspenseful, I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.\"-Julie Ann Walker, New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Author on Hold Your Breath\"Chills and thrills anda sexyslow-burning romance from a terrific new voice.\" -D.D.
