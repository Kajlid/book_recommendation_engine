  "description": "Jacky Leon got away with it. She defended a little human girl, made a few unlikely acquaintances, and survived to tell the tale. Now she’s the only werecat in the supernatural community who can say a small family of werewolves lives in her borders.  That isn’t a good thing, though. As news of her heritage and relation to Hasan becomes more well known, Jacky finds herself in the spotlight, slammed with guilt over recent werecat problems and her duty as a daughter of Hasan. Having ignored the supernatural world and its politics for so long, she had no idea what sort of repercussions would come from her actions to defend Carey Everson. Ignorance can no longer be her shield.  Jacky wants to do better. She’ll step up to her responsibilities and stop running. She’ll learn how to live up to the obligations and expectations of her family.  Her honor demands it.",
