As Tia and Luc prepare for the arrival of their twins, Chanku from across the country wait--and share their stories of becoming. . .For each, embracing the truth of who and what they are has been a life-altering experience. From Anton and Oliver's journey of discovery to Jacob Trent's dark night of the soul;from the intensely powerful relationship Mik and AJ shared even before they knew about Chanku to Stefan's torturous feral years, the stories are woven together by common threads: loneliness, brutality, tenderness--and the ultimate satisfaction of finding one's place in the pack.The revelations of primal desire and human need made this night will bring the Chanku closer than even they dreamed possible. But will the bond be strong enough when the united packs are called upon to save the most vulnerable among them. . .?",
