  "description": "You know what makes me different? The thing that sets us apart? Life experience. I've never been tucked in at night. Hot meals and clean clothes might as well be fairy tales... Sleep? I've never felt safe enough. Wanted? Only by the police. Loved? The word doesn't exist in my vocabulary. I'm damaged goods. An easy paycheck. I thought there was an ulterior motive... There always has been. Until I met the McKinleys.",
