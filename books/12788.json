  "title": "A Quest for Good Manners",
  "description": "\"What's the big deal with manners anyway?\" demands Princess Rosalind. Why do we always have to say please and thank you? And who cares how we use a napkin? Appalled by her rude behavior, the queen banishes Rosalind and her pet dragon Sparkler from the castle until they can find Good Manners. Percival, the wizard, gives her a golden fork to help her on her search. They face several challenges --however, not until the final test, do they discover the real secret behind Good Manners. Manners are more than etiquette rules. Studies show that children who practice gratitude have more focus, energy and self-confidence. Good manners are the foundation for compassion, empathy and emotional intelligence. Children and parents alike will love and learn from this story. Recipient of the Mom's Choice AwardsÂ®--Gold",
