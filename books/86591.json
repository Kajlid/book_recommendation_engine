  "description": "Little Golden Book #187In a charming rhyme, this 1953 Little Golden Books asks, \"What do daddies do all day? Daddies work while children play.\" It shows daddies working in all kinds of careers, from farming to teaching to even singing in the opera! And it assures children that at the end of the workday, \"by taxi, train, by car and bus, Daddy rushes home—to us!\"  Illustrated by Tibor Gergely, who brought the beloved Little Golden Book characters Scuffy the Tugboat and Tootle to life.",
