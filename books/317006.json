After all, there was once or twice in our history when our chemistry nearly combusted.There is just one obstacle to my grand plan.Emily has a firm career plan, and they don’t involve any entanglements with me. Nope. The last thing she thinks she needs is to add sleeping with her boss to the equation.I, on the other hand, am betting on the fact that she could probably use a distraction—in the shape of me. Surely, all I need to do is throw in a little persuasion to ensure she doesn’t get away a third time…\nThis is the third standalone novel from the Mr. Boss series where you can revisit your favorite characters throughout.
