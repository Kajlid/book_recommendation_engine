  "description": "“& watch how easily the jaw sings of god\" is an astonishing linguistic invention. Every word Cline writes snatches your breath away as you are faced with her staggering creativity. She is so completely unique as a writer and an artist, crafting entire worlds within her sentences. This work really is a beautiful thing.” — Imogen Stirling, author of \"Love the Sinner\"\"& watch how easily the jaw sings of god\" embodies the hard-won verse, heat lost & held in the loamy soil, the hair standing on the back of your neck from the cold or an idea you had. Longing without self-pity, these poems make the pursuit of what never was sound nothing less than noble.  — James Cuartero",
