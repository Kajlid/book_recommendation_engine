  "description": "Raelynn Davenport.An elusive beauty queen with a sordid past.The Blackwoods.A prominent family with a graveyard full of tortured skeletons.The plan couldn't have been simpler. All I had to do was swap my big city life and tarnished reputation for a fresh start in a small town. Catching the immediate attention of said town's heartthrobs was nowhere on my agenda. Unapologetic about their true intentions, I find myself in the center of a game that has no concept of moral aptitude.All I wanted was peace.All they crave is madness.And in this game, losing isnâ€™t an option. Not when we're playing for my life.Prequel to Affliction",
