  "description": "February 2013. The day started out normal enough for Mel: emails, phone calls, and general business issues. His normal routine was about to be disrupted when the new General Manager, Cheryl, told him and Jimmy to evict the two hookers whose rent was three days past due. Mel shivered at the thought. The last eviction, six months ago, still haunted him. He couldn't erase the memory of the blood and gore, he and his partner RJ witnessed. What they saw reminded him of story the ole' timer told him about the unsolved murders of two oil men in 1973. Join Mel, as he embarks on a simple eviction that plunges him into the horrors and truths of the crimes from 1973. Get a copy today. You will never look at staying in a hotel the same way: ever!",
