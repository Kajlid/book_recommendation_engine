  "description": "Little Just Big Enough , written and illustrated in full color by bestselling author Mercer Mayer, offers a gentle but important lesson about bullying. In this 8x8 paperback, Little Critter is being bullied. Bigger kids steal his seat on the bus, eat his cupcakes, and won’t let him play football with them. Little Critter decides he has to get bigger, too. So he stuffs himself with vegetables, exercises until he’s exhausted, and turns himself a growing machine. He’s so disappointed when his hard work fails… But his grandfather helps him see that bigger isn’t always better. With this encouragement, Little Critter leads a team of smaller kids in a relay race against the big kids. And the little kids win!",
