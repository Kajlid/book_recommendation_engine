  "description": "Put-upon small-town store clerk Merton Gill puts his pennies aside for the day when he can afford to travel to Hollywood, become a big star in motion pictures, and marry his dream girl, a daredevil actress in adventure serials. But the reality of the movie world is much less glamorous than the fan magazines make it out to be. The naive Merton nearly starves before a sympathetic young character actress steps in to steer his nascent film career in the right direction.",
