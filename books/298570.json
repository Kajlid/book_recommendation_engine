  "description": "Being a single dad is not what I signed up for, but when my wife died unexpectedly just after our son was born, his upbringing became my number one priority, and I shut off the rest of the world, including any interest in women.My mother helped take care of Grayson while I worked, but when she broke her hip, I was suddenly without childcare—and in desperate need of a nanny.Rachel Zanetti befriended my son over feeding ducks at a pond, and before I knew it, she was moving in with me and my kid, much to the delight of my friends who actually knew her.Little did I know that hiring the first woman I found attractive since my late wife would flip over my world and my heart as it learned to beat to the idea of someone new.But grief is a fickle thing, and I struggled with the guilt of moving on, even though every fiber of my body wanted to be connected to every piece of Rachel’s.And my son fell for her just as hard as I did.The question is, do I guard my heart from the risk of losing another person that I love?Or will I be able to let my first love go to make room for this woman who is reviving me one day at a time?",
