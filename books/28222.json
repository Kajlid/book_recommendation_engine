  "title": "Unlocking Your Inner Zelensky: Lessons We Can All Learn from an Unexpected Leader",
  "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky captivated the world when his country was invaded by Russia in February 2022. His appearances were accompanied by countless inspiring statements. But there's a single one that informs Unlocking Your Inner Zelensky: \"We are all simple people.\"Jessie Kanzer sees Zelensky as a Spiritual Leader for Our Times. As a Soviet refugee, she picks up on the deep philosophical ramifications behind his words. Rich and yet easy-to-read, the life lessons in Unlocking Your Inner Zelensky are accessible and wise, and are more about starting where you are than about war.Kanzer herself has a bit part in Zelensky's life story, acting in one of his movies filmed in the States. She's a self-described \"spiritual nerd\" who followed Zelensky long before he stood before a blue and yellow backdrop on the national stage. She writes, \"What is so incredible about our man Volodymyr is that his belief in himself stems not from seeing himself as special, but from seeing himself as ordinary and from knowing there is great power in this ordinariness.\"",
