  "description": "(Alternate cover edition of ASIN B017MGIV3W.) To love a Dark One is to invite death...  It is wrong to love her. It is worse to want her. It is sin to consume her. I desire all three.  I've been given thirty days to prove my love to another immortal--as a human. Cursed to use nothing but the side of myself I've always despised to win her affection. I am Cassius, the King of the immortals, A Dark One. And today I tasted fear for the first time. How can I win her when my human emotions over take every ounce of logic I possess? A darkness is brewing. One I cannot stop as a human. One that Stephanie, my loves visions, have shown, will be my end. Thirty days ago I was King of the immortals. Today I know fear. Today I know how I will die. By her hand. The woman I love. Complete Stand alone, interconnected within The Dark Ones Saga, each book is about a different couple.",
