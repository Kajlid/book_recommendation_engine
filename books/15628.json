  "description": "Hailey LeBlanc did something stupid, but she couldn't help herself. If it had been any other woman they would have less resistance that she had, especially around Micah. He was gorgeous, tall, rich and the MVP of his team. It didn't help that she worked where he and his team practised day in and out and watched him from afar. Over the last year she'd fallen in love with him and that might have been just fine if her father didn't mind, but he did.",
