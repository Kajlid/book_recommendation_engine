  "description": "We thought the war against China would be fought in Asia, not Seattle. We were wrong.Analysts have long prophesized that China would go to war to reintegrate the province of Taiwan. It isn’t a matter of “if;” it’s a matter of “when.” For decades, the only thing that has restrained China from taking Taiwan by force of arms is the American promise to defend it, even if that means World War III. To date, China has not been ready to go that far. But what if China figured out a way to put the United States on the sidelines of their fight to regain Taiwan? Would they do it then? Drawn from today’s headlines, Red Tide: The Chinese Invasion of Seattle is set in a not-too-distant future where China decides to invade Seattle to use American citizens as high-stakes chips in a game of nuclear blackmail. Will the United States get Seattle back? Written by a former aviator with over 3,000 hours flying attack and reconnaissance aircraft for the United States Navy, including many missions supporting U.S. Special Forces, Red Tide: The Chinese Invasion of Seattle is a look at one possible future that isn’t as improbably as you might think. Events in it are not only possible, they’re already happening. Could China attack the United States to get back Taiwan?Yes.",
