  "description": "In this uplifting memoir, famous Japanese pop culture \"Geek\" Toshio Okada tells of the diet and lifestyle changes he made in his fight against obesity, and how his public perception dramatically improved as a result of his healthier appearance.Toshio Okada lost 110 lbs in one year, without the use of funky dieting techniques or exercises, using nothing but a notepad. He recognized that a diet is doomed to fail if it's unsustainable, and a person cannot continue something they do not enjoy. Examining various diets and exercise regimes—even taking surgery into account—he concluded that a recording diet would be the most effective method. By succeeding in the recording diet, a person will learn a means of self-control that can be applied to other aspects of life, such as budgeting. Toshio Okada's diet reflects the six stages of space flight, each stage a little bit closer to the final goal of health and self confidence!",
