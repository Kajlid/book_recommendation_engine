  "description": "Award-winning author Caitlin R. Kiernan, best known for contemporary settings, 'Ggothnoir' tales of pain and wonder, and atmospheric stories of Lovecraftian terror, was first published as an author of dark science fiction. Now Kiernan returns to SF with a masterful thirty-thousand word novella, The Dry Salvages.Three centuries in the future, though much of Earth has been crippled by war, pollution, and catastrophic climatic change, man has at last travelled to the stars and even found evidence of at least one extraterrestrial civilization. In a bleak and frozen Paris, at the dawn of the 22nd Century, an old woman is forced to confront the consequences of her part in these discoveries and the ghosts that have haunted her for almost fifty years. The last surviving member of the crew of the starship Montelius, exo-paleontologist Dr. Audrey Cather struggles to remember what she's spent so long trying to forget—the nightmare she once faced almost ninety trillion miles from Earth.",
