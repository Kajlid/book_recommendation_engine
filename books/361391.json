  "description": "Drew and his friends face an age-old sect that's determined to claim a treasure and ancient power. They race from the U.S. to Canada, pursued closely by the mysterious Brotherhood. Danny Hennigar, a member of the Oak Island Tourism Society, states, \"I devoured [Guardian] in an hour and a half. It was a fun romp through the back woods, islands, and rivers of Nova Scotia, culminating, of course, with the dramatic moment on Oak Island when all was revealed. Wow, the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew meet Harry Potter on Nova Scotia's Oak Island.\"",
