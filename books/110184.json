  "title": "Avoiding Karma: A Mind-Challenging Way to Recognize Who, Why, and What You Truly Are",
  "description": "Karma is only a function of the physical universe, and our true energetic selves, when attracted to the lower frequencies associated with the physical universe, are linked to it. Hence the need to return to it, to break the link, to break the Karmic cycle. Once the link with the physical is broken, the need to incarnate is no longer necessary and the true energetic self can ascend the frequencies, evolving in the process without needing to experience ever again those lower frequencies associated with the physical universe.The information within this book, given to the author by the Source Entity, is specifically designed to make people change their ways, to recognize who and what they truly are, to come out of their incarnate slumber and ascend.Some topics - Attraction to any physicality- Love your enemy - for he is you- Fear only exists in the physical- The Source Entity's Ten Commandments of Avoiding Karma- Accept everything, resist nothing- How jealousy affects us- Attachment- Karma attracts karma",
