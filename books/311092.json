  "description": "In his debut short story collection, Jonan Pilet explores the lives of Mongols and expats, looking for a sense of home within the nomadic culture. Based on the authorâ€™s insights having grown up in Mongolia, the series of interlinked narratives capture the cultural turmoil Mongolia experienced after the fall of the Soviet Union, painting a vivid picture of Mongol landscapes, Western interactions, and the rise of cultural tensions. An orphaned Mongolian girl lives in the sewers of Ulaanbaatar. An American boy falls in love with a Mongolian girl who has committed patricide. A group of nomadic traders are stuck in a blizzard in the Mongolian steppe. In these eleven stories, Western misconceptions of Mongolia are dispelled as home is discovered to be a transcultural human need.",
