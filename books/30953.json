Or so 17-year-old Sky Calloway has been taught. With all newborn boys ruined from infancy by a monster-borne plague, iron-willed women maintain the human race through medical means and boundless grit.

When Sky joins a perilous journey to the monster-infested shore to scavenge for precious resources, she hopes for the freedom she has always craved. After a horrific monster attack shatters the expedition, she must survive alone among the evil creatures that roam the dark shore.With hope all but extinguished, Sky’s situation alters wildly with unexpected aid from an astonishing ally. The subsequent journey leads her toward answers to questions that have long plagued her. What are the monsters and from where did they come? What really happens to the sick baby boys? And what might a grown man look like? Mystery, action, and romance abound as Sky faces the most difficult question of what makes us human? The answer may hold the key to humanity’s ultimate survival!",
