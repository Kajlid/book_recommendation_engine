  "description": "Meet Sam Cat and Dudley Pig, detectives: They find fingerprints and search for clues. They catch robbers. They delight young readers with their antics! Whenever the criminals strike Richard Scarry’s two endearing animal sleuths are ready to go—and in this treasury they’re out to catch some pie thieves, nab a supermarket shoplifter who finds an ingenious way to sneak out his goodies, and seize the bad guys who swiped some pearls. What kids will love most, though, are the madcap, slapstick-filled pictures; adorable animal characters; and the engaging (but sometimes clueless) heroes who dress up in a hilarious series of disguises.",
