  "description": "William Morris’s interests were wide-ranging: he was a poet, writer, political and social activist, conservationist, and businessman, as well as a brilliant and original designer and manufacturer. This book explores the balance between Morris’s various spheres of activity, places his art in the context of its time, and examines his ongoing and far-reaching legacy.A pioneer of the Arts Crafts Movement, William Morris (1834–1896) is one of the most influential designers of all time. Morris turned the tide of Victorian England against an increasingly industrialized manufacturing process toward a rediscovered respect for the skill of the maker. Morris’s whole approach still resonates today, and his designs are popular and much admired.Published to mark the 125th anniversary of Morris’s death, this book includes contributions from a wide range of Morris experts, with chapters on painting, church decoration and stained glass, interior decoration, furniture, tiles and tableware, wallpaper, textiles, calligraphy, and publishing. Additional materials include a contextualized chronology of Morris’s life and a list of public collections around the world where examples of Morris’s work may be seen today. This study is a wide- ranging, fully illustrated exploration of a great thinker and artist, and essential reading for anyone interested in the history of design.",
