Being a woman isn’t a weakness. It’s the opposite. I’ve spent my life being surrounded by four overbearing brothers, but I’ve never been a wallflower. Independent and unwilling to be tied down, I grabbed life by the balls and lived it to the fullest.I was enjoying myself, minding my own business at my brothers wedding. Then WHAM.Ever have a man walk into your life and alter your entire universe? My answer would’ve been no before he tempted me into his bed.I’m talking about the big damn bang.Everything that I thought was right, suddenly spins on its axis and bitch slaps me in the face.**Resisting is not required reading. It can be read as a standalone or as part of the Men of Inked series after reading Hook Me (Men of Inked #2).",
