  "title": "Ivory Dawn",
  "description": "Ivory Shepard didn’t want to be a pirate when she grew up but she didn’t plan on being orphaned and alone at thirteen with her three cousins either. After a Spanish raid in Charles Towne left them with nothing, Ivory held her cousins together, trained them to fight for their lives and led them to a life of quiet refuge on the banks of the Ashley River. Believing they were out of reach of the hands of unscrupulous men, they found life on the farm a tolerable substitute for the traditional alternatives life would force onto them—until the night the pirates showed up. Unfortunately for the pirates, these handy young women were ready, and they weren't going anywhere without a fight. This novella is a prequel to DEMONS & PEARLS.",
