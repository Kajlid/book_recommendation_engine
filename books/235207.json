Tom, Becky and their two children are on a family holiday when the virus hits. Follow them as they try to fight their way to safety, gathering others along the way. They soon realise that their best chance of survival will be to reach an ancient symbol of power and strength. Their future and safety lie behind a castleâ€™s walls.
