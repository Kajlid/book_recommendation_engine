  "title": "Bloodletting: Book 2.0 - Devon",
  "description": "This is Book Zero of the Bloodletting series. Originally written as an introduction to the world, it's violent, sexual and disturbing. I was torn between first publishing the somewhat more gentle book 2.0 (Devon) as the introduction, or this harsher, slap in the face. Either way, they're both up now and available. Chronologically, they take place at virtually the same time and in roughly the same place, yet tell drastically different stories. This volume follows Patricia Schaefer, a sociopathic daughter of a film producer and aspiring serial killer as she attempts to corner her first victim. As you may have guessed, things don't quite go as she expected. The plan is to release these bi-weekly, but as I'm just getting started and have a few in various states of readiness, I'm putting what I've got done up right away.
