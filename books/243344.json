  "description": "Twenty four year old Christian Shaw has a good life. He's had a rocky ride with being charged for a crime he didn't commit, but he's come out on the other side, older and wiser. He has good friends who've stood by him. He has family who love him. However there's something about Christian that he's never understood. There's something about him that sets him apart. It has made him not want to get close to anyone.  Now someone's appeared unexpectedly. To his surprise, she's just like him. Even more importantly, she has the knowledge to help him understand more about the strange existence he lives. But is she as nice as she appears, or could she have a darker reason for seeking him out and devoting time to him?  Providing an insight into one man's strange journey of coming to grips with who he really is, 'Christian' tells a story of courage and the strengths of friendships.",
