  "description": "Susan Sibley is a highly sensitive Witch who is doing her best to find where she fits in the world as she tries to understand her spiritual gift. When she falls in love with Tamika, the woman of her dreams, she discovers how easy it is to lose herself in someone else instead. In the Maiden phase, Susan's naivety and fear create her struggle to let the light in, flow with change, and fully realize her power.Â Maiden's Path is the story of one young woman's journey to discovering that the happiness you want can only come to you through lessons, which means living through both the painful and joyful parts of the human experience. Opportunities for growth arise as Susan's relationship with Tamika develops. Creating a home and family challenges her Maiden mindset and invites her to step into the role of the Mother. As she continues to receive signs and messages from Spirit, Susan ultimately faces the most painful choice of her whether to walk away from the greatest love she has ever known or lose herself in total darkness.",
