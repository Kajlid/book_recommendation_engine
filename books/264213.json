  "title": "Strange Dreams: Collected Stories & Drawings",
  "description": "The fourth book of the trilogy, \"Strange Dreams\", appears to have been completed on the artist's birthday in September, 1996, but that's only because you can do what you'd like with time when you're printing books yourself. To be honest, he was actually trapped in Paris with an ear infection on his birthday. The books were safely boxed and sitting here at StoryPeople, waiting for his return. \"I'd always planned on doing a trilogy\", he says, \"but I didn't figure out that meant I'd have to stop at three. So, I've developed a more relaxed attitude towards trilogies than people have been used to in the past...\" The ninety, or so, stories in this book include some of his favorites, including 'Simple Rules' and 'Hindsight' (\"I didn't listen to her because she was my mother & wouldn't know anything until I was much older\").",
