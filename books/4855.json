  "title": "A Scottish Love",
  "description": "Shona Imrie should have agreed to Gordon MacDermond's proposal of marriage seven years ago -- before he went off to war and returned a national hero -- but the proud Scottish lass would accept no man's charity. The dashing soldier would never truly share her love and the passion that left her weak and breathless -- or so she believed -- so instead she gave herself to another. Now she faces disgrace, poverty, and a life spent alone for her steadfast refusal to follow her heart.Honored with a baronetcy for his courage under fire, Gordon has everything he could ever want -- except for the one thing he most fervently desires: the headstrong beauty he foolishly let slip through his fingers. Conquering Shona's stubborn pride, however, will prove his most difficult battle -- though it is the one for which he is most willing to risk his life, his heart, and his soul.",
