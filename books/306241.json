  "description": "What's the harm in a quick fling?Graydon Mitchell doesn’t do love. Love means opening yourself up to pain, and Graydon’s had enough of that for one lifetime. All he wants to do is build beautiful homes in Jewel Lakes County and retreat to his lakefront cabin at the end of the day. Lucy Fulham doesn’t do love either. As a New York City designer-turned-life coach, she’s busy executing her perfect life plan, which explicitly excludes relationships. Lucy knows what she wants, and it’s not getting her dreams stifled by building her life around a man the way her mom did. But when one of Lucy’s favorite clients begs her to fill in on the interior design of his new lakehouse up in Jewel Lakes County, New York, she’s suddenly put in extremely close proximity with Graydon, the house’s skilled and way-too-sexy builder. They’ve only got six weeks together, but there’s no denying the attraction. Graydon and Lucy are so hot for each other they’re liable to burn a hole through the framing. A fling should get things out of their system, right? Or will these two relationship-phobes build themselves into a corner they can’t run away from?",
