  "description": "Monica Beggs is more than the hottest star out on DVD--she's Finn Daniel's next assignment.  Lights. Camera. Lube?  Monica Beggs wraps up another grueling on-location movie shoot when the Colombian cartel attempt to kidnap her. Their guns are as real as the price on her pretty head.  Former Special Ops and present day surfer, Finn Daniels recognizes a lady in distress when he sees one—especially when it’s his silver screen crush being hustled out the door. He’s no longer in the business of busting up the underworld, but that doesn’t deflect his moral compass.  In a fast-paced adventure--over land, sea, and air--playing it hot and heavy can only lead them straight into action!",
