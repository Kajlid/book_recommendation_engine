  "description": "For the Good and the Bad…It’s about to get ugly…When the Red Hot Poker destroys all in her path.They call him the Last Son, the Last Duke or, Oh God Please No. He is a man with a mysterious past, a Code, and a big ship. He wants to get close to the pirate queen Bella Budino and since he shot her last husband, many would call that a suicide mission.Lord Sniggler, the Grand Muff, Right Hand of the God Emperor of the Non Imperium… has been fired.He’s not the kind of man to shrug that off and walk away. The revenge he is planning is called The Red Hot Poker. She will be large, round and definitely not have any smegging equatorial trenches.Also included at no extra cost, star trooper Normal Trooper. Trooper is the most ordinary person he has ever met, but his new boss is the out of sorts Admiral. Should he follow orders like a good red guard? Or will he rise to save his ship and crew from the rather nasty Admiral and the ship full of heavily armed heroes on the way? If you like fast-paced comedy, ensemble casts, spaceship battles and adventure, buy this book now.",
