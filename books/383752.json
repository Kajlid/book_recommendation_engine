  "description": "Winner of the Nobel Prize for literature in 1907, Rudyard Kipling (1865-1936) drew upon his experiences in Anglo-Indian Society for much of his writing. This anthology of tales by Rudyard Kipling contains some of the most memorable and popular examples of the genre of which he is an undisputed master. The Man Who Would Be King (later adapted as a spectacular film) is a vivid narrative of exotic adventure and disaster.The other tales include the ironic, horrific, poignant and haunting. Here Kipling displays his descriptive panache and realistic boldness. Shrewd, audacious, abrasive and challenging, he remains absorbingly readable.Contents of this Wordsworth Classics edition:* The Education of Otis Yeere* At the Pit's Mouth* A Wayside Comedy* The Hill of Illusion* A Second-Rate Woman* Only a Subaltern* The Phantom 'Rickshaw* My Own True Ghost Story* The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes* The Man Who Would Be King* Wee Willie Winkie* Baa Baa, Black Sheep* His Majesty the King* The Drums of the Fore and Aft",
