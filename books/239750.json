  "description": "The mean and monstrously ugly Emperor Cho Cho Shang decrees that everything in China be the opposite of what it was-the just and beautiful becomes unjust and ugly; cruel and hideous is now fair and lovely. The kingdom is hopelessly topsy-turvy until a few brave souls, starting with the Emperor's own son, decide to resist the madness and put things right again. \"Gleefully parodies modern times (or any other rotten times)...This spoof speaks truth.\"-The New Yorker",
