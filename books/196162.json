  "description": "Christian fiction from debut author Debra Sue Brice.  Dana has lived her whole life for this moment. It is her chance to shine and break through to the demanding equine world that is attainable only to the extremely wealthy or incredibly lucky. It is now or never.  Dana finds the courage to leave her family and travel from Ohio to Canada to train with Olympic rider Amy Arnot, who has a reputation for being tough. Trying her best to leave her judgmental sarcasm at home, Dana attempts to excel at her tasks and training while getting to know the other riders at the farm. Determined to stick to God's plan, Dana tries to get in the good graces of fellow equine royalty, and she piques the interest of a particularly handsome barn manager. But an unfolding scandal is looming. Despite all of Danaâ€™s hard work, her once-in-a-lifetime opportunity could come crashing down to a devastating end.",
