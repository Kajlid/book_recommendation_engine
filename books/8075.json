  "description": "OMG. I think I just joined glee club and I am NOT EVEN JOKING! Buttercup has ISSUES. Her family's dysfunctional, her best friend's a drama queen and she doesn't know who her dad is! What's a girl to do? Isn't it obvious? Join the school glee club, embarrass the hell out of yourself singing rock ballads and dancing like a demented hamster on a sugar rush and write a diary for an internet shrink about your messed up life. OK, well perhaps YOU wouldn't, but Buttercup does . . . The mash-ups at the glee club are nothing compared with the mash-up that's Buttercup's life!",
