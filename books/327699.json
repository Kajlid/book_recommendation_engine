  "description": "If you know me, you know that agreeing to be Cooper Lansing’s fake girlfriend is completely out of character.Mostly because I hate him and I have for the last 14 years. Some might say that holding on to hurt feelings from ninth grade isn’t mature or healthy.Those same people probably would say lying to an entire town about a relationship that doesn’t exist is also not my brightest idea.I don’t care about those people. I don’t even care about Cooper. Not even a little. Sure, I’ve offered to be his fake girlfriend while his ex-wife is in town, but that doesn’t mean anything.Only the more time we spend together the more lines start to blur and the more my feelings get involved…good feelings. Warm, fuzzy feelings.",
