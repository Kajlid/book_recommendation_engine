  "description": "(Previously published as Undercover Galactic Red Light by Zara, Anita)Venus. The planet of sensuality, beauty…and missing Venusians. My mission? Infiltrate a high-class brothel, partnered with the universe’s equivalent of a peacock – the insufferable, arrogant Agent Kai. We’re supposed to be partners on this investigation, but so far it’s more like a forced marriage. Honestly, I’d rather face a horde of space pirates than investigate a Venusian brothel with him.The Interstellar Bureau of Investigation thinks we’re the perfect team? Yeah okay. They clearly haven’t witnessed our sparring exchanges and clash of wills. Kai is the last person I want to work with, but his infuriatingly charming smile and the way he looks at me… Let’s just say this mission is a disaster waiting to happen—and a part of me can’t wait.(Dear Reader, this SFR novelette contains the following forced proximity, enemies to lovers, exhibitionism, food-play, voyeurism, snark-flirting, all manners of smut, and the good ol’ classic – Oh. Oh)",
