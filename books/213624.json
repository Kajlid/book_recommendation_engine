  "description": "One man’s story of what it meant to be a PJ. In 1966, the political leaders in Washington and the Pentagon made the decision to escalate the war in Vietnam. In doing, the demand for a trained military far exceeded the supply. In an attempt to meet this demand, the Selective Service was required to draft thousands of young men into the military and send them to Vietnam to fight in United States’ most controversial war. Most young men were sent with little or insufficient training, where the commanders were required to put their troops into reckless jeopardy to satisfy the political ambition of a few. One Month, 20 Days, and a Wake Up, follows a young man’s account of his four years serving in the Air Force. This novel follows him and his best friend as they volunteer to cross train into the elite career field of Pararescue. They spend 14 months of grueling training where only the best and those with the desire to push themselves to the limit, successfully succeed in becoming a PJ. When he graduates and proudly wears the burgundy beret and Pararescue Flash, he knows it is only a matter of weeks; he will be assigned to a Pararescue flight crew in Vietnam. The book follows his 13 months in Vietnam where he quickly learns the horror of war and how he must adapt to not only keep his sanity, also return alive. His story contains several of the rescue missions he and his PJ brothers complete where not all of the rescued are returned alive. When he faces personal bereavement, he must reach deep to restore his integrity, and keep his oath, “These things I do, that others may live.”",
