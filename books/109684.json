  "description": "Anna Heymes, the wife of a top-ranking Parisian official, suffers from amnesia and terrifying hallucinations. In an effort to understand her malady, a psychiatrist performs a series of tests, which reveal that she has undergone drastic cosmetic surgery, totally transforming her appearance. When, where, and why, Anna cannot remember. In the Turkish district of Paris, two policemen investigate the brutal murders of three women from the tenth arrondissement's underground workshops. At the heart of their investigation is a powerful and ruthless group of right-wing Turkish mafia members, the \"Grey Wolves,\" who are involved in every conceivable manner of illegal trafficking. The link between Anna and the three murders becomes increasingly clear as her past is revealed and each of these characters -- prey and predator, manipulated and manipulator -- race toward an astonishing and horrible collision in the murky streets of a clandestine Paris and in the shadowy confines of Istanbul. A riveting blend of terror and mystery from the author of Blood-Red Rivers , \"the best thriller since The Silence of the Lambs \" ( Le Figaro ), The Empire of the Wolves is a gripping, hair-raising page-turner from \"France's own Stephen King\" ( VSD ).",
