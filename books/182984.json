  "title": "The Anatomy of Death: Notes from a Healer's Casebook",
  "description": "Trained as a scientist initially, and then a hands-on healer, Elena Gillespie had no idea that her father's death would lead to a door that contravenes everything we think we know about death and dying from a Western perspective. Starting out with a promise to her father that she would learn everything she could about this journey to ease its difficulties for others, she approached her visionary experiences with the open mind of a researcher. This took her to places that few of us travel, but are long familiar to the medium, the psychic and the shaman of ages past. From the shuttered passings of her father and little Kevin, to the epiphanies gleaned from the White Tiger, Regina and the Twin Towers, this is the story of that discovery.",
