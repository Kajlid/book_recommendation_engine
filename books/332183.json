  "title": "The Kiss Code: Man of the Month Club",
  "description": "I’m not about this 'small town everybody knows my business' life. At least, not when it comes to the part about my love life. So when the one night stand I picked up at a convention across the country follows me home, it’s a problem. No one in my life knew about the side hustle I was at the convention for. They all thought I was traveling to escape the grief of my father’s passing. That was by design. Now my secret’s out and everyone’s bombarding me with expectations. It’s impossible to keep my Big Mad in place when every time I turn around, the man of my dreams is here trying to make it up to me. I’m still gonna give it my best effort. The MAN OF THE MONTH CLUB is a steamy small-town collection featuring a new hottie (or two!) every month. In 2022, escape to Sycamore Mountain, North Carolina and celebrate ALL the holidays with your favorite group of romance authors and their delicious mountain men. Can’t wait to see you there!",
