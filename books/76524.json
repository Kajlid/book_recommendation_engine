  "description": "A rebellion of intelligent Cybernetic servants has left the females of the galaxy virtually sterile, crippling the controlling political body - the Matriarchy. The race is on to find a solution, but will it be enough to save the Matriarchy as other galactic authorities attempt to dominate them using sabotage and all-out war? Dryland's End is Felice Picano's science fiction adventure for the new millennium. The novel touches on many of today's most controversial subjects, such as interracial relationships, gender conflicts, cloning, and same-sex pairings - and views them with a lens toward the future.",
