Tears of the Giraffe took us further into this world, and now, continuing the adventures of Mma Ramotswe, Morality for Beautiful Girls, finds her expanding her business to take in the world of car repair and a beauty pageant. Acclaim for The No.1 Ladies‘ Detective \"The author´s prose has the merits of simplicity, euphony and precision. His descriptions leave one as if standing in the Botswanan landscape. This is art that conceals art. I haven´t read anything with such unalloyed pleasure for a long time.\" - Anthony Daniels, Sunday Telegraph \"The most entertaining read of the year.\" -The Guardian \"An African ‘Miss Marple´ . . . superb.\" - Sunday Times One of the \"International Books of the Year and the Millennium\" -Times Literary Supplement",
