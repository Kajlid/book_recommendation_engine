  "description": "At his Manhattan North Hospital Office, Steve Coughlin's job is complicated by an invisible companion - epilepsy. Its seizures have defied every effort to control them and force him to take them into account with everything he does.When he becomes a patient of the hospital's best neurologist, Dr. Diane Schneider, he hopes she's the one who can stop them. They've nearly killed him more than once and he knows his luck won't hold out forever. But she recommends unexpected hospitalizations and medicine changes that turn his life upside-down.His already-suspicious wife thinks he's cheating on her and leaves him. He's demoted at work. Schneider illegally gives his case to the hospital's human resources department, which insists that he \"voluntarily\" commit himself to their psychiatric hospital or look for a new job. Not seeing a way around their threat, he complies. After he's discharged, he's fired anyway.Jobless and alone, he confides in his close friend, Melissa. In time they grow closer. They want to put the hospital experience behind them, but don't understand why Steve wasn't fired like other people - why the hopsital insisted upon making him a psychiatric patient first. Hallucinations, suicides, cyber-stalkers and other nightmares will make them fear for their sanity and lives before they find the surprising answer.",
