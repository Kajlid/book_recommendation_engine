  "description": "Six days.  No one thought I could last Here in the cell—I now call home They didn’t know I grew up in the prison of my crime family’s dream.  Six weeks.  No one thought I could withstand The loss, the drugs, the torture They didn’t know how much I would enjoy their game.  Six months.  No one thought I could survive Their puppet and prey—but I like to play—Hard. And I don’t lose.  They picked the wrong guy. Their so-called ‘grunt’ would fight to get home and take revenge. I vowed to come back—for her—for Kaci. But everything changed.  My maniacal mind wrapped with a pretty mug, I am an unforgiving bastard, tough—tougher than they ever imagined.  And I will never – ever – break.",
