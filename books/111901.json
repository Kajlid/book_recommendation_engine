  "title": "Happiness: A New Perspective",
  "description": "In a unique approach, Happiness: A New Perspective combines the findings of psychologists with philosophical enquiry to answer the age-old question: how can we be happier? Unlike the claims of many other self-help books, James Hadley cogently argues that the answer is not to be sought in becoming wealthier, thinner or more popular, but simply in changing our perspective. In the course of this fascinating book he explains how to do so. About the author: James Hadley is not a self-help guru, celebrity psychologist or agony aunt. He is just a man who wanted to learn more about happiness and took a year out of his life to investigate the subject.",
