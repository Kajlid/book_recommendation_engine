  "description": "Tanneheuk, Montana, a seemingly idyllic small town, is overseen by \"the elders,\" a tribe of people who have watched over Tanneheuk for hundreds of years. The elders are shapeshifters – werewolves – and they protect the townspeople from the corrupting influence of outsiders. In return for their protection, they only require one thing: Every year, on the first day of Autumn, they want to hunt a human... Drake Burroughs, a young minister with a checkered past and newly assigned to the Tanneheuk Church, knows there's something dark going on beneath the surface of the seemingly perfect little town. When he discovers the truth about the elders, he convinces the townspeople that the hunt is a sin against God and to break their pact with the werewolves. Roman, the Alpha Wolf and leader of the elders, struggles to keep his pack together and his leadership unquestioned. Roman knows the annual hunt is archaic, but also understands the importance of tradition for a race of beings who live on the cusp of extinction. But the growing dissension between the townspeople and his pack is not Roman's only reason to hate Drake Burroughs: Diana, Roman's sister, is sexually drawn to the new minister, and is willing to do anything to act on it. Even kill, if necessary.Add to this volatile mix a family of con artists, a female pot-smoking deputy, a young girl determined to be the next chosen for the hunt, a restored 1970 Dodge Charger, Karaoke night, lots and lots of guns...It might Judgment Day for Tanneheuk.",
