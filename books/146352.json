  "description": "Could history’s greatest works of art be the product of a dark secret?Follow artifact hunter, Andrew Game, as he journeys on a clandestine assignment to Providence, Rhode Island hoping to recover an ancient document credited with being the inspiration behind many of the world’s most beloved literary masterpieces.But when, Cutty Abbott, a young, down on his luck writer with an affinity for antiques unwittingly purchases a trinket box at a local estate sale and discovers the long-lost document hidden a cleverly devised chain letter written by horror writer, H.P. Lovecraft, things get interesting.Excited by his good fortune, and hastily dismissive of the superstition surrounding chain letters, Cutty eagerly reads the cursed writing, unknowingly setting Lovecraft’s time-sensitive chain into motion.After a midnight visit from Lovecraft’s ghost warning him of the deadly consequences of not fulfilling the haunted chain, Cutty’s earlier disbelief quickly turns to fear; impelling him on a twisted race against the clock and a sure-fire collision course with Mr. Game.",
