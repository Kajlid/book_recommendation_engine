  "title": "Next Time We Steal The Carillon",
  "description": "Criminology professor Francis Palma and a few of Braxton Universityâ€™s brightest take matters into their own hands after the local police decide that the theft of an ancient Greek bowl from the library will be too daunting. Monica, Veronica, Jason and Ralphy are our students turned sleuths in this confounding campus case. Is some rejected suitor following Veronica or is he part of the bowl-stealing conspiracy. Is Veronica's seeming spite toward Ralphy truly spite or just her way of flirting? Will Braxton win the homecoming game? And who is Professor Palma dancing with?All these questions, and a few more, will be answered before you finish this story--about good kids with a devil of a job.",
