  "description": "Those eyes... Oh, those eyes... Something entrancing, alluring, and irresistibly hypnotic lurks deep inside those light crystal blue, masculine eyes. Just like most other women Dakota Troy encounters; all he has to do is hit Nicole Parsons with those eyes and she's putty in his hands. Nicole, however, is not like most other women Dakota has known. She's much younger than her appearance suggests, and she has never been in love. She's never even been in lust, but one look into those eyes of his and she knowsâ€¦ she's a goner. What she doesn't realize, and Dakota may eventually have to admit to himself... is he was Nicole's' for the taking a full week before she even knew he existed. Sounds like an easy love story... just like most... until you throw family into the mix. Dakota's childhood hero and older brother, Jacob Troy, (AKA Jackass Jake) has decided Nicole is his to claim and regardless of how obviously she displays her disinterest in him... he persists. A woman saying \"No\" has never stopped him before, so why should Nicole be any different? She is, after all, just a woman ... and baby brother would never choose a woman over him... Right? All bets are off, family loyalty is redefined, and Dakotas' old rules of engagement have to be reassessed when passion ignites a fiery love that burns so bright it could dwarf every light in the Dallas night sky. If you like steamy romance, controversial subject matter, and gorgeous Alpha Males... Come on in. The water is fine... in The Deep End",
