  "description": "Sequel to Impacted! Getting to know each other hasn-t been an easy journey for Scott Gregory and Robin \"Red\" Kennedy. Falling in love and exploring their kinkier sides revealed a perfect match, and Scott is a devoted sub to Red's headstrong and often impulsive Dominant personality. Scott, Robin, and their friend, Susie, open a new dental practice a short distance from the old office but miles away from Scott's former boss and his Promise Keeper mentality. But the move doesn't guarantee a happy ending. Robin's mother is in a medical crisis. Scott's grandfather makes an unexpected appearance. Ongoing interference from Jenna, Ron's needy assistant, stirs up trouble. And Susie, having completed her training as a Dominatrix, is on a quest for the perfect male submissive. Then there's one more threat to their relationship: Robin's desire for a public collaring, something the shy and formerly closeted Scott is having a really hard time accepting. Is a strong and binding love?albeit a kinky one?enough to keep Scott and Robin together?",
