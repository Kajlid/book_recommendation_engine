  "description": "'The Penal Settlement of Macquarie Harbour' recalls the first discovery and settlement of Macquarie Harbour in particular, Sarah Island. First used to house the convict rogues of Hobart in January 1822. The Government of the time found the island ideal and thought that on-one could possibly escape from such a hostile environment. Throughout its eleven year history, many men did escape including Matthew Brady and Alexander Pierce commonly known as the Pieman. Though most escapees perished while trying to forge their way through the bush to settled country, some survived only to be recaptured and punished or hanged. In 1834, ten men managed to escape and sailed as far as Chile, South America.In the final settlement years of Sarah Island, a man named George Robinson, by order of Governor Arthur, used the island to house the last remaining aboriginal natives before their transport to Flinders Island. Only about two hundred were found with the help of friendly natives Robinson had with him including Truganini, the last full-blooded Tasmanian aboriginal woman who later died in Hobart in 1876.With the abundant supply of Huon Pine forests that once lined the shores of the harbour and the Gordon River, pining was the main industry in the harbour and around Strahan. Today, people can take a boat cruise to Sarah Island and up the Gordon River to see for themselves how isolated and beautiful this part of Tasmania is.",
