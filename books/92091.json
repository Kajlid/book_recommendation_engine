  "title": "Competing Visions: A History of California",
  "description": "A strong social emphasis and succinct narrative distinguish this new text from other California history course books. Chronicling the stories of people who have had an impact on the state's history, the text presents California as a hub of competing economic, social, and political visions--and explicitly compares it to other Western states, the nation, and other countries, highlighting its cultural diversity.This text's concise account in 13 chapters renders it suitable for both the semester and quarter-length course. Its chronological organization and thematic approach allow students to keep track of events and fully understand their significance.",
