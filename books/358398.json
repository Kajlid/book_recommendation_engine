  "description": "Alistair isn't sure he remembers what loving feels like. He's done his duty by his family, leaving behind the feel of a man's touch years before. If he yearns sometimes for the rough love of a man, he keeps it to himself. Things are about to change for Alistair, though, when his old school friend Griff sends a very special stablemaster his way. Mick Cole, with Griff's help, intends to remind Alistair what it's like to have some fun, and to let his responsibilities go just long enough to remember pleasure. A true Victorian romp!",
