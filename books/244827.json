If he doesn’t find a husband soon, it could undermine the entire order because an aspirant must marry before advancingHe knows who he wants, he’s just too afraid to act on it. But as they go on a quest to help a friend, being so close to Tavros is filled with temptation Valis isn’t sure he can resist.As they fight for their lives, Valis learns more about himself as a person and as a leader, but the challenges only keep coming, and some of them have a price that just might be too high to pay.The M/M romantic elements in God Jars is a very slow burn. The God Jars Saga contains explicit material including violence, abuse, and M/M sexual encounters, and is not advised for anyone under the age of 18.",
