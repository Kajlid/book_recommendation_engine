  "description": "Blood from the epic battle stains the ancient stone, shed from both the living and the dead. The massive castle walls provide a period of respite from the unending terror and the group can finally honour the fallen. As Kurt and his family count the cost of securing their new sanctuary, new friends have joined the fray. Only by pulling together can they hope to have any kind of future in the apocalyptic world. A few short miles away, the psychotic lovers receive a victorâ€™s welcome. Craig Arater, older sibling to Mike, rules the prison with an iron fist, meting out brutal punishments to those who fail him. Designed to keep the worst of humanity locked away, now it provides a haven for the evil in men to thrive. Winston has chosen a different path from his murderous companions. Faced with an uncertain future in the prison or solitude amongst the dead, he chose to go it alone. A rumour about the castle and its inhabitants gives him hope. The journey that awaits, however, will be more dangerous than anything he has faced before.",
