  "description": "Here it is - the first glorious collection of Slack Wyrm! Within you'll find his first 100 comics printed all nice and big and lovely. Since his first appearance in 2016, Ferragus Slackwyrm and his comics have grown to be a hit with fans all over the world. Now finally here he is on your tablet. Read Slack Wyrm's initial foray into webcomics, where he was still just simple, shiftless dragon talking to beloved lair-mate, Sir Corpse. Push on into his expanding world as we meet Otho the cunning crow, the enigmatic Duchess Doris, and Paul the gelatinous cube. Also Lizardman is in there somewhere too. Yes, it's Slack Wyrm - the ongoing story of unconcerned dragon in an uncaring world by Australian artist, Josh Wright. All set in an ill-conceived fantasy realm of fabulous monsters, beautiful princesses, towering castles, creepy woods and the odd house made out of confectionery. There are witches and wizards and talking animals who sometimes wear jackets, but never any pants. Also a few people have smartphones, which makes no sense at all.Don't you want to read the first book of Slack Wyrm? Of course you do!",
