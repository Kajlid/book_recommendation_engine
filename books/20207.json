  "description": "Handsome and single cop, Det. Lt. Michael \"Mike\" McBride, Jr. continues his on-again, off-again romance with the sophisticated redhead, Juliette Carolle. The drug war persists in the towns and on the high seas. After intercepting a cocaine shipment, earlier, the US Coast guard pursues a drug sub while the US Navy attempts to follow the cocaine trail to its South American source, with surprising and amusing results. Free, awaiting trial, drug king-pin, Joseph the Rat, carries on behind the scenes, making trouble in Mike's town. A date-rape, kidnapping, and two murdered witnesses keep Mike and his precinct busy. His martial arts skills come in handy and his dog, Lady, helps track and chase the bad guys.",
