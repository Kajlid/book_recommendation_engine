And so he throws himself into his new life as an Oxford tutor, trying to avoid further heart-ache and definitely trying to avoid thinking about the all-too-seductive Erin.

The safest thing is to hide behind the assumption that he is still a priest.Erin may be young, but she's experienced more than her fair share of heartbreak and disillusion. What she wants now is a man she can trust – someone she can rely on. Pity the man who's caught her eye is already taken – and not by a woman but by God. The last thing she should ever do is try to seduce a priest – or is it?",
