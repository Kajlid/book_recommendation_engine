  "description": "Delivering high jinks and japes from Soccer Saturday 's roving reporter, this hilarious handbook documents the exploits of Chris \"Kammy\" Kamara, whose boyish enthusiasm and often baffling, at-the-ground football reportage has given him cult status and an army of fans. Over the past decade, football results program Soccer Saturday has become a television phenomenon, delivering goals and drama via a raft of ex-professional players positioned in television studios and on precarious gangplanks in rusting stadiums around the country. At the heart of this success is free-wheeling pundit and roving reporter extraordinaire, Chris \"Kammy\" Kamara, the former footballer-turned-manager-turned-cult hero who has astounded and dumbfounded a legion of armchair fans with his crackpot catchphrases, hyperactive reporting style, and Lionel Richie haircut. Mr. Unbelievable is his rags-to-riches tale. As a player, Kammy trawled football's outposts with the likes of Bradford City, Stoke City, and Portsmouth where he suffered the slings, arrows, and hurled bananas of racial abuse. Later, during the autumn of his career, he played in Howard Wilkinson's swashbuckling Leeds team where he rubbed shoulders with the likes of Eric Cantona and Lee Chapman. On hanging up his boots, he moved into the dugouts at Bradford and Sunderland as manager before joining the Sky football revolution as roving reporter on Soccer Saturday and Goal On Sunday 's eagle-eyed analyst, amassing a raft of catchphrases along the way. Mr. Unbelievable is a hugely entertaining, moving, shocking, and laugh-out-loud funny story of a genuine cult hero.",
