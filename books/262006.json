  "title": "Cymbal Man With Flat Feet",
  "description": "A story of San Francisco that recounts two desperate days in the life of the narrator after a terrible discovery plunges him into the depths of despair. Flitting between reality and madness, he roams the city with a dizzying array of odd companions, going to all the places he has loved over the years, getting involved in strange situations which lead him on a wayward adventure through the streets and sights that he has come to know so well. It is a harrowing love letter to a dying city, and an exploration of dealing with sudden grief, and the ways one might look to escape and ignore it while actually somehow dealing with it at the same time. Chapter-less, the story rolls and pounds and gut-punches its way through the inchoate spaces of time's chasm between a \"then\" that's never quite near enough or far enough away.",
