  "description": "Twenty-four-year-old Carnelle is entering Brookhaven’s annual beauty pageant, in hopes that it will help her tarnished reputation. Carnelle enlists half-blind seamstress Popeye to help her efforts. Meanwhile, Carnelle’s cousins, Elain and Delmont, are forced to come to terms with their late mother’s legacy, against their own desires. Beth Henley’s signature messy characters fit imperfectly into tragi-comic portraits of the American South.",
