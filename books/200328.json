  "title": "The Children of First Man",
  "description": "With its beautifully written and deeply felt descriptions of the feelings the first white settlers and Native Americans had for each other, THE CHILDREN OF FIRST MAN tells the fascinating story of a European people gradually absorbed into the Amerindian culture until their literacy was lost and their Christian religion submerged in the legend of a Welsh Prince named Madoc, the First Man. Sweeping from the blood-soaked castles of medieval Wales to the landmark expedition of Lewis and Clark, from the hushed beauty of virgin wilderness to Mandan villages of domed earthen lodges, THE CHILDREN OF FIRST MAN is a triumph of the storyteller's art.",
