  "description": "Josh Gray has made bad decisions and regretted them all, but it’s the rock ‘n roll lifestyle, so no problem, right? However, karma is a bitch. Mistake one… sleeping with the then boyfriend of the lead singer of one of the top bands, Social Sinners, which leads to Josh being fired as Ryder Hampton’s backup guitarist. Mistake two… signing on with Nicholas Shane Management, who promises a new band that’s the perfect fit. It turns out Nick is dealing dirty, and his company collapses when he’s sent to prison. Josh’s world is in ruins and starting over is next to impossible. Word gets around that he’s screwed over rock ‘n roll’s poster children, and he can’t get an audition. The future is now an endless stream of empty whisky bottles, and a surly server that no matter how hard Josh tries, refuses to sleep with him. If you’ve read the Social Sinners or Maiden Voyage series, you’ll understand the tough road that lies ahead for Josh. Is redemption possible, or should he just throw in the towel and walk away once and for all? Strike a Chord is book one in the Chaotic Abyss rockstar romance series featuring hurt/comfort, second chances, and a bartender who just wants to be left alone.",
