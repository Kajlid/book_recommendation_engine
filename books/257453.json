  "description": "Why would a man on Death Row, who claims to be innocent, refuse clemency? His lawyer has just 15 hours to find out.Lame duck governor Charles \"Chuck\" Dusenbury has been persuaded to offer a last-minute reprieve to young, trailer-trash redneck Clayton Burrow by the victim's mother - on condition that he reveals where he buried the body of the victim.The problem is that Burrow insists he is innocent and doesn’t know where the body is buried – even going as far as to suggest that the girl he is accused of murdering is still alive and has framed him. So – in the tight 15-hour time-frame before the scheduled execution – his lawyer, Alex Sedaka, must struggle to unravel the mystery, a baffling web of lies involving high school bullying, an abusive father, a dysfunctional family and an abortion clinic six thousand miles away. But as he gets closer to the truth, others get closer to the panic point - and a frightened animal is a dangerous one.",
