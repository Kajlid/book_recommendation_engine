  "description": "When the Cold War meets apple pie, sparks fly. Brigadier General Eli Wells needs a date, but he’s not been out socially since his wife passed two years before. The lack of a personal life is making him unbearable to be around and the staff has even begun to call him the beast behind his back. When he asks his Aide-De Damp to find him a date for a special party, his best friend—and post commander overhears the conversation and sees an opening to help Eli out of his slump. Together, the lieutenant and major general enlist the help of Madam Eve in hopes that Eli will agree to the setup. Heaven knows, someone needs to get him to relax. Anya Volkov’s modeling days are over. At the suggestion of her former agent and only friend, she elects to try an internet dating service called 1Night Stand. The first time she meets General Eli Wells, she knows he’s everything she asked for and more, but he also seems to be holding back and testing her. Can she get him to loosen up and take a chance, or will the date be over before it starts?",
