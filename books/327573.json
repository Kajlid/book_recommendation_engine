  "description": "When you finally find your home—your people—nothing should get in the way.But sometimes, the past is a rigid, stubborn thing that refuses to let go.A darkness that festers.And when your bonds are five men who would annihilate anything standing in their way—anything standing in my way…That’s when all hell breaks loose.My bonds? They ripped the world into shreds and built it back up, because their separate kingdoms were an obstacle we needed to face.When five men build one of the strongest empires known to history for you, then you sure as hell lead alongside them.My name is Amethyst Aphelion, and I’m either an empress… or a fraud.",
