  "description": "Jeffrey Conley, upon reaching puberty, is not only haunted by his own obsessions concerning the heart, life and death; a demonic being desires to bring him to despair and suicide. The demon leads Jeffrey to believe that he has committed the unpardonable sin by blaspheming the Holy Ghost so that there is no hope of Jeffrey's escaping Hell. Will Jeffrey, with the help of two elderly men who faced the demon thirty years before--and failed--be able to halt the spread of despair and avoid destroying himself? Will the demon have more hopelessness on which to feed, or will Jeffrey succeed in defeating the evil being?",
