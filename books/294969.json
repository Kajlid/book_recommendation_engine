  "title": "The Monster of Chateau Du Coeur",
  "description": "Two hundred years trapped in this castle, alone and miserable, without a single person to love or even to love such a hideous thing as I. I’ve been left here without a single memory of who I am, except that I was cruelly created in a lab by the Doctor, my Maker, my father, to only replace the son he lost many years ago. I’ve been trapped in this 17-year old body ever since, condemned to rot away in this castle. But then a family finds there way here, a family whose lineage traces back to the original owner of the castle. Amongst the family is a fellow 17-year-old boy, Collin—a boy who I can’t help but find myself drawn to—to love, to eat, I’m not sure. Collin quickly senses my presence, the monster of the castle, lurking behind his bedroom wall, watching him through subtle cracks in the foundation. I’m not alone anymore. The Doctor’s Failed Experiments have begun to appear. It is these three creatures who know the secret of the castle, and of the secret of the Doctor’s first experiment—the one who has sworn to return to take vengeance on all those who rest in the castle—the true Monster of Chateau Du Coeur. We’re all in danger.",
