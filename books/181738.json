  "description": "Setting out on the vacation of a lifetime, Marissa Chabot is well-provisioned with sun block, rum and a stack of good books. As one of the founders of the succesfanul, high-tech “soul-mate matching service” Finders Keepers, Marissa knows from experience that vacation romances are nothing short of hopeless.When the tall, dark and beautiful Linda Bartok sweeps her off her feet, Marissa yields to the magic of moonlit walks on the beach and longed-for whispers of passion. Though it hardly seems possible that the Amazonian, adventurous Linda could be truly interested in a desk-bound computer geek, their erotic encounters soon bring about Marissa’s complete and total surrender.Vacations end. Real life resumes. Waiting for the phone to ring, Marissa wonders if what she had seen in Linda’s eyes could have possibly been true. Was it just a vacation romance? Or was she going to end up losers weepers?",
