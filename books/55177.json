  "description": "“A ray of light, a stain of shadow, shall endure to breathe life and death into the future”  The war between the Guardians and the Shadow Riders ended in total devastation. The final battle killed all the dragons and left nothing but fields of ash. A small clutch of dragon eggs was all that remained to provide hope for the future.  Five hundred years later, the ability to use magic is a death sentence and dragons are remembered as a curse. But the unhatched dragons sing for their riders...and soon six lives will be changed forever.  The elements of magic are drawn together as the dragons’ call leads them on an epic and dangerous journey of discovery. They soon learn everything they've been taught to believe about magic and dragons is wrong.  With the last of the dragons and the world at stake, they will risk everything to heed the call.  But an evil from the past soon threatens their discovery and new found joy.  Shadow Dragons ride the dawn once more...",
