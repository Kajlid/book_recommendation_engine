  "description": "Hello rock? Meet hard place.This time, I'm in deep. My only defense is that it all happened in a moment of weakness. I'd literally just wiped a Ben & Jerry's stain from my three day old t-shirt (that I'd slept in, of course), turned the corner, and almost face planted into my ex's chest. I had three days worth of dry shampoo in my hair since I'd been too depressed to wash it, a hole in my leggings, and a seriously crushed ego.Here's where the story takes a turn, though.As I looked him over, standing arm and arm with the woman he left me for (who looked perfect, by the way) I opened my mouth, and told the biggest lie in the history of lies.Mouth, insert foot.Why I chose to pretend that I have a new boyfriend is beyond me. Why I chose to say that my new boyfriend is Adrian Malone, all star quarterback of the Minnesota Saints, is something that I may never understand. The man is a legend, devilishly handsome and rumored to have a really big, ah...heart, so he's quite obviously out of my league.But I'm a woman scorned, and desperate for revenge, so basically, one way or another, I'm going to make my lie come true.After a brief stint in jail (not my most shining moment) I finally manage to meet the guy. And when he agrees to go along with my plan, I'm more than ready to bring my ex to his knees.Adrian has a set of rules that I must follow, but I'm willing to do just about anything these days, if it means getting revenge.What I didn't plan on though, was breaking every damn rule.And opening up my heart to be broken all over again.",
