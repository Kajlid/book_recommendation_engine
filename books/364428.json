  "description": "\"Some readers have likened the dubious regard for humans in \"Sherman's Lagoon\" to the late, lamented \"Far Side\" by Gary Larson.\"--\"Dallas Morning News\"Sharks have always fascinated Jim Toomey. \"I was the only one rooting for the shark in \"Jaws,\"\" he says. Now, Toomey's dim-witted Sherman is back with \"Another Day in Paradise.\" This fantastic collection of the popular strip takes a satirical, sea-floor look at modern culture through the eyes of Sherman, his sidekick sea turtle friend Fillmore, and schools of other coral reef critters in their remote tropical paradise.",
