  "description": "Debut novel tells the story of a talented young hotel manager whose business skills don’t quite translate into managing the people he has to work with. Martin Hammond is an affable and ambitious manager at a hotel in Greater London. He is full of self-belief and feels confident that he can rise to the challenge of his demanding job, tackling any issues head on with success and flair.. But Martin is so driven to succeed in his job that he frequently fails to connect with those who work alongside him, his numerous members of staff - cleaners and cooks, receptionists and security - and to appreciate their problems and manage their professional wellbeing. Martin is utterly oblivious to his failings and his behaviour begins to irritate and alienate his staff and, in some cases, even his guests. Martin’s staff are starting to lose respect for him because he does so little to guide, incentivise or reward them in their daily tasks And with the arrival of a feisty young American tour guide called Naomi, Martin becomes even more distracted, louchly dissmissing his staff’s various concerns. However, Martin’s lax management style can’t go on much longer; after it emerges that some members of the staff are stealing from the hotel. Martin,feeling persecuted and hurt, sets out to show Head Office what he’s really made of. Only when a truly gifted manager arrives can Martin really start to understand the error of his ways and build for the future.",
