  "description": "It's a tale as old as time, and it's happening again. When the god of desire falls for a human, destiny determines the role of passion in the human soul.Vanessa has offended Aphrodite with her shallow approach to life. The mortal's attitude towards her own beauty and suitors denies the goddess of love her due, so Aphrodite sends her son Eros to punish her.With his ability to inflame the lust of mortals, Eros is tasked with making Vanessa fall for a monster to teach her humility. But the god of desire is mischievous by nature, and his curiosity gets the best of him. He steals the woman for his own purposes, indulging in an illicit tryst that's ordained by fate even as it's forbidden by the goddess.As it turns out, Aphrodite was right: Eros' influence is just what the mortal needs to wake up to the realities of her life. Vanessa thinks she might be losing her mind, yet she can't deny the way this mysterious creature makes her feel. Nights of pleasure combine with shifting priorities in her daily life, all going to prove the life-changing influence of passion.But love is fickle, and human nature is treacherous. Their affair is limited by the goddess's decree, which forbids Vanessa from laying eyes on her divine lover lest it feed her vanity. Eros himself is reluctant to believe his game might be getting out of hand, so when the strictures on their time together grate on Vanessa, their fragile relationship hangs in the balance.And so the age-old question: can passion ever be enough?Based on the myth of Eros and Psyche, this is a steamy standalone story of fate, forbidden desire, and the line between lust and love. Paranormal romance, adult/high heat, M/F, no cheating, no OW/OM drama, enthusiastic consent, HEA.",
