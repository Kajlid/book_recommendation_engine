  "title": "Anywhere and Nowhere",
  "description": "This is the 2nd of a series of 4 books and is the sequel to 'The Fantastic Journey', published by Arima, available from their website or from Amazon, ISBN 978-1-84549-311-0. The 3rd: 'The Haunting of Eddie Compton' is also available from Lulu.com, as is the 4th: 'Heaven on Earth'. 'Anywhere And Nowhere' is a tale of fantasy and adventure. It is 1963, and friends Len and Eddie have each received a special gift; Len a brand new football and Eddie, an electric train set. They are then taken on fantastic journeys from their home in Fenton-on-Sea. In the end the boys find it difficult to distinguish between fantasy and reality. 'Anywhere And Nowhere' is a good family read and is suitable for most ages, particularly if the reader seeks the nostalgia of England and, particularly, East Anglia, in the early sixties when 13-year-old-boys still dreamed of traditional adventure. The author is a retired Deputy Headteacher of a boys' Grammar School and lives on the Lincolnshire coast.",
