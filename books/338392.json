  "description": "Monsters exist. The only problem isâ€¦ I'm the only one that can see them. I always thought I would outgrow it. That one day, I would magically wake up, and the nightmares that haunt my life would suddenly be gone. Unfortunately, that hasn't been my luck. Avoidance is key. Don't look at them. Pretend they aren't lurking in the shadows, and never make eye contact. But what happens when the events of my life spiral out of control, plunging me into a new world full of magic, death, and chaos? All I want to do is live a quiet life. Alone, where the monsters can't hurt anyone else, but fate has another plan for me.A Shadow of Betrayal is book 1 in the Umbra Hunters series and DOES end of a cliffhanger. This is a Paranormal RH romance, which means there will be no choosing between love interests at the end of the story. A Shadow of Betrayal has darker elements that readers should be aware of such as strong language, assault, adult content, and violence.",
