  "title": "Untamed: Reactivating A Missional Form Of Discipleship",
  "description": "In this provocative and compelling book, internationally known missiologists Alan and Debra Hirsch overthrow culturized understandings of theology and culture, and cast a vision for a distinctly mission-shaped way of living the Christian life. Written for any Christian serious about issue of discipleship, Untamed covers such topics as church, humans as bearers of the image of God, family life, culture, and sexuality. Through it all they seek to answer the question, how are we to think and live day to day as followers of Jesus?Each chapter ends with suggested practices to help readers begin to live out the book's principles as well as questions for group discussion.",
