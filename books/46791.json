  "description": "A man is found dead with a bullet hole in his chest, and private detective Brett Cornell is the #1 suspect.  It might have something to do with the fact that he'd been seen punching the guy around only a few days earlier.  Or -- more likely -- because the police have discovered that the fatal bullet had been fired from HIS gun!  In the second novel of this detective series set in the late 1980s, self-proclaimed unscrupulous bastard Brett Cornell has to figure out who's trying to set him up:  Could it be his lovely but meek new client?  Or perhaps her equally lovely but far from meek room-mate?  Or might it actually be the beautiful and dynamic aerobics instructor he's recently taken up with?  In the meantime, Brett's legendary Adonis-like features get severely damaged when he ends up catching the beating of his life -- emotionally as well as physically -- before he finally nails the identity of the real killer!",
