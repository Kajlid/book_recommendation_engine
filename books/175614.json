  "description": "A stylish, screamingly funny, razor-sharp look at the British aristocracy in decline, Hunting Unicorns introduces us to the owners of the vast Bevan the Earl and Countess-charming and possibly round the bend; Daniel, their eldest son-funny and clever, but a hopeless alcoholic; and Rory-the younger brother mired in the tidying up of his family's well-meaning schemes. Adrift in a rapidly changing world, the Bevans cling to tradition while wrestling with taxes, tree blight, and the need to keep the family skeleton firmly in the cupboard.Enter Maggie, an opinionated American journalist for the hard-hitting show Newsline. Far happier sending dispatches back from the trenches of war-torn anywhere, Maggie is none too pleased at being forced to research a documentary on the decline of England's upper classes. When these two worlds collide, no one is prepared for the fallout.The story of two brothers bound by duty, and one woman who feels bound by no one, Hunting Unicorns is a delightful romantic comedy that explores loyalty, family, and, ultimately, having the courage to risk everything in the pursuit of what really counts.",
