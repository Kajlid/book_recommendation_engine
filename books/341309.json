  "title": "The Elements of Story: Field Notes on Nonfiction Writing",
  "description": "“A splendid book for journalists (new or old), fiction writers, essayists, and critics. But it could also be of great use to the intelligent common reader, the man or woman who wonders why it’s impossible to finish reading certain stories and why others carry the reader in a vivid rush to the end.”—Pete Hamill, author of A Drinking Life   In the spirit of Strunk and White’s classic The Elements of Style , comes The Elements of Story, by Francis Flaherty, longtime story editor at The New York Times . A brilliant blend of memoir and how-to, The Elements of Story offers more than 50 principles that emphasize storytelling aspects rather than simply the mechanics of writing—a relentlessly entertaining, totally accessible writing guide for the novice and the professional alike.",
