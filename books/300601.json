  "description": "The heavy burden of caring for the well-being of another life shouldn’t fall on the shoulders of a teenager. But I never complained or shied away from it. I had this friend. He needed me.   As the years went by, I continued to find myself drawn to those with pain in their eyes, wanting to ease their anguish with a smile or a joke. That was what first lured me to Journey. I quickly learned she bristled at even the suggestion of her vulnerability. We may be like oil and water, but I revel in fighting for her attention. This fiery beauty is worth the wait, and I’m playing the long game. She claims not to be the commitment type, but I see hope and refuse to give up. Can I convince her we belong together? Or will I be the one left hiding my own pain behind a smile?From USA Today Bestselling Author, Shari J. Ryan, comes the highly-anticipated conclusion to The Barrel House Series!",
