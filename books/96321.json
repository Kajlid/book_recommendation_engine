  "description": "\"He wants me to live with him in a palace for a year,\" the lass reported to her shocked family.\"No.\" Hans Peter dropped the knife to the floor with a clatter. Whirling around, he caught hold of the lass's shoulders and shook her gently. \"Don't do this. You cannot know what evil there is in the world.\"When a great white bear offers a woodcutter's daughter untold riches in return for her company, she accepts, believing she has made a wise decision. Even though the lass is offered every luxury at the bear's castle, she begins to feel like a prisoner. Then, when servants start to disappear, the lass realizes the bear may know more than he will say. Determined to learn the truth, the lass sets out on a windswept journey east of the sun and west of the moon to fight for the man she has only just discovered is her one true love.",
