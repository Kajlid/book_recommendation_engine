  "description": "Anna has just turned fifty, widowed, estranged from her only child, and embittered by a life that is full on the surface but empty at its core. When her daughter, Poppy, calls after a twelve-year absence and asks if she and her family can visit, Anna reluctantly agrees. Soon after, Poppy's husband and their ten-year-old daughter, Flynn, show up on her doorstep without Poppy, to stay. As a favor to a friend, Anna agrees to help coordinate a support group for HIV patients. On the first day she meets Jack, who must choose between his \"considerable appetites\" and Stuart, his partner who has been unwaveringly faithful for over a decade. Stuart, in turn, struggles with whether his deep love for Jack will survive the storms ahead. It is Flynn - imaginative, inspired, and haunted by her convictions about the spirit world - who becomes the center of this unlikely but devoted family.",
