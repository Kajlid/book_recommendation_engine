  "description": "She was never supposed to walk into my club.   But she did.    I shouldn’t have looked twice at her.   But I did.    The criminal underworld is no place for a girl like her.    One night with Katerina isn’t enough, but men like me can’t afford to be weak.   So, I tell her to leave me behind.    She does, but not before she sees something she shouldn’t.    When she goes into hiding, it’s my duty to hunt her down.   I have a job to do, and she needs to disappear for good.    But four years later, Kat isn’t alone anymore.   And the little boy right beside her looks just like me.",
