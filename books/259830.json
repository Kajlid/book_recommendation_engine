  "description": "Cops in Kabul is the thrilling personal account of retired RCMP Superintendent William C. Malone, who was the deputy Canadian police commander in Kabul, Afghanistan, from May 2011 to May 2012. His serious and at times hilarious story of working with military personnel, diplomats, and civil society organizations highlights the challenges of trying to bring about security and the rule of law in a theatre of war.From 2003 to 2014, Canada played an integral role as part of the NATO coalition in Afghanistan. The Government of Canada sent its military and diplomats to that war-torn country to help bring about peace. One little-known fact about Canada’s contribution during the eleven-year conflict was the presence of almost 300 Canadian police from across the country who volunteered to help train, mentor, and build the capacity of the Afghan National Police. Canada’s mission was to help Afghans rebuild their country as a stable, democratic, and self-sufficient society.Canada, along with dozens of other nations and international organizations, was engaged at the request of the democratically elected Afghan government to work within the United Nations–mandated and NATO-led mission in the Central Asian nation. This one-year snapshot takes a fascinating look at the bravery demonstrated by Canadian peacekeepers in a volatile and dangerous place.",
