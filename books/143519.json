But you don't always get what you want. \nA shaky Italian economy means Luca Castellioni can't afford a distraction from running his successful property restoration company. However, he needs an English speaking wife to cement a crucial deal. When his British bride-of-convenience undermines the foundations around his heart, he's forced to re-evaluate his priorities. Too bad his wife has rebuilt her own life, without him. Sophia Stevens is tired of working two jobs just to make ends meet. So when a super-sexy Italian property developer proposes a marriage of convenience, she's intrigued. Financial security and life in a beautiful Italian villa in exchange for attending a few business functions and typing some letters seems very convenient. Until she breaks the most definite term of their arrangement: she falls in love with her husband.When their respective lives pull them in opposite directions, they must decide: will they continue to put their businesses first, or allow love to overcome the obstacles between them?",
