Dancegirl is paid to dance, when all she wants to do is get into grad school. When you're young, a lot of things don't make sense, like getting on a subway and ending up in the Underground. If you surface, you might end up in Piccadilly Circus in London, listening to stories about Frankenstein and King Arthur.",
