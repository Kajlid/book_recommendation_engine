  "description": "She has to do what I say.And she's not allowed to leave.The government order is clear.My office must shut down.And I must work from a remote location.But I don't plan to work alone.I need to find a suitable assistant.Someone who actually suits my every need.And I have a lot of needs.There's a rigorous application process.But I just know Angie is the one.As soon as I lay eyes on her curvy body.She's a great assistant.So I can count on her to work hard for me.She'll be under my strict orders during this lockdown.She's also a virgin.But I can train her to fulfill my many desires.I'm not expecting to fall for her though.That's something I never do with any of my \"pets.\"But I've never been so close to one.In more ways than one.The quarantine is only temporary.But is my heart hers for good?Under Strict Orders is a standalone romance novella with no cheating, no cliffhanger and a very happily ever after.A note from Jamie: Because you're likely under lockdown, you deserve something HOT to help you pass the time while you stay home and stay healthy. I have a new series called Love Under Quarantine that are standalone books with a similar theme of romance during the lockdown. They can be read and understood separately but are best binge-read all at once. I guarantee this book will push all your buttons and hit the right spot. Enjoy!",
