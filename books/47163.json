  "description": "\"Hunter S. Thompson, eat your dead heart out!\" (Phil Shoenfelt, author of Junkie Love) \"Thor Garcia has written a satirical novel that brings to mind the best bits of John Kennedy Toole's A Confederacy of Dunces; the novels and short stories of Charles Bukowski; Bret Easton Ellis' American Psycho and the gonzo journalism of Hunter S. Thompson...\" (Chris Crawford, BODY) \"It's hard to imagine writing more energetic than this!\" (The Prague Post) \"Fueled by prodigious amounts of alcohol and tobacco, sex and drugs, this narrative skips along from one bizarre episode to the next in the tortuous life of Thor, a young man whose dreams of a literary career have been sidetracked into an undemanding job as a 'news clown' for a small wire service in the crime-infested back alleys of Bay City. Meanwhile, as Thor struggles with his inner demons, the national news clowns are cheering on President Wolfgang G. Mnung as he threatens a Middle Eastern dictator who may have stockpiled 'as many as 4,000 PlayStation video game units' from which, according to sources, he might fashion a crude supercomputer to control weapons of untold devastation. A flashy, satirical style keeps the narrative fresh, entertaining and eminently readable throughout.\" (Publishers Weekly) \"Hunter S. Thompson meets Russ Meyer's Under the Valley of the Supervixens meets Daft Punk - wearing a press pass and a smiley badge to a San Francisco gangbang.\" (Goodreads) Thor Garcia's monumental iconoclastic novel, News Clown, was a finalist in the 2009 Amazon.com Breakthrough Novel Award.",
