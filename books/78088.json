  "title": "Darksome Thirst",
  "description": "A coven of witches and one very determined computer geek independently battle the supernatural in late 1970s New England. Midnight. A crackling sound booms through the computer room, which then falls silent and dark. Waiting for the power to return, Alicia falls asleep. She is startled awake by a voice. \"Cold, isn't it?\" he asks, touching her with colder hands. When the lights return, no one is there. But there *is* someone there the second time the locked room is penetrated, someone who bites sharply into her neck. Across town, Matricaria and her coven must decode unsettling Tarot card readings to determine what the danger is, who it endangers, and what they can do to stop it.",
