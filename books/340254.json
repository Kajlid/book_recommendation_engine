Gareth and Sylvia trace the threat to an abandoned monastery; home to a family of living, evil puppets.It’s all right, though. They can handle this. Can’t they?Perhaps not. When a crucial mistake turns the entire situation on its head, Gareth and Sylvia must decide whether to stand and fight against impossible odds…or accept a dark bargain from an old enemy.",
