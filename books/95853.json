  "description": "2287. The Martian Republic is an established country on Mars. The planet was colonised in the late 21st century. During all this time, the Martian Republic has been on a level-playing field with Earth. Since the beginning of colonisation, Mars was seen as a stepping stone on humankind's way to the stars. Not all is well though. The Martian Republic is gradually getting farther apart from Earth and the societies on the two planets are losing interest in each other. The Earth Association is trying to fight against this increasing separation. Among its activities is an exchange programme for Mars children. The programme seems to work well, helping establish ties between the newest generations on Earth and Mars. However, suddenly children start dying of measles, an illness against which, it soon becomes clear, the humans born on Mars do not have any antibodies. Detective Inspector Harry Strickned, of the Aaltrin Police Department, investigates, with the help of Marko Slavik, a space marshal, on Earth. Are these deaths just an unfortunate coincidence or is there a bigger plan behind them?",
