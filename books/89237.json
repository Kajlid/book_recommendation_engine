  "description": "Catch up with the party-loving hippos from Hippos Go Berserk! in this long-awaited picture book more than forty-five years in the making—from the one and only Sandra Boynton!Hippos have a reputation for wild parties that go on till dawn. People have even gone so far as to say that partying hippos “go berserk.” Nobody knows how these rumors got started.But even if it’s true (it is), it’s not the whole story. Given the deep appreciation that hippos have for water, it’s no wonder that your average hippopotamus seeks, finds, and offers a state of flow, no matter the situation.We have much to learn from their example. Accordingly, this helpful book follows two typical hippos as they calmly and mindfully go about their ordinary hippo day.“O, flare thy wild nostrils,And welcome the day!Onward! And upward!Come what will,come what may.”",
