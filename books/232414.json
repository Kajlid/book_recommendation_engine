  "description": "Nicole Xao has dreamed about superheroes since she was a girl; now she's a grown-up hacker, trying to turn her talents to the greater good in the New Cloud capital of Maui City.  Citrine represents everything that Nicole hates - greed, violence, corruption... It's a company on the cutting edge in a worryingly literal way. With her sights set on taking it down, Nicole finds herself in a brave new world - and when a chance incident thrusts her into the limelight, her whole world changes.  Whether she likes it or not, the new CEO of Citrine is watching her. Nicole just has to work out what the woman wants - even if it might be her.  Don't Panic is a queer novella for young adult (and up!) audiences.DRM-free EPUB and PDF copies are available for free at https://www.jondarthur.work/dont-panic",
