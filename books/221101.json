  "description": "The second book of the Orochi no Kishi Series is finally here!Summary:Locked up in a decrepit Utah prison and two years into his life sentence for murder, ex-Orochi team Boss, Sadao Koga, must find a way to negotiate his way out of lock-up and back to his team's secret new encampment. Now under the leadership of his former Captain, Ichiro Tagata, the renamed Sasori team (‘scorpions’) is battling the elements while honing their new snow and ice racing skills in the heart of the Canadian Coastal Mountains. Nestled in cabins and trailers along the frozen edge of a picturesque lake, team mechanic Mouse and his best buddy Lieutenant Lupe (now a successful member of the active roster) wait for news of their lost leader's whereabouts. Impatient with longing for his wounded and imprisoned lover, Mouse must keep the financially struggling team’s mysterious natural disasters from upsetting their chance to win big at the upcoming Winter Sports Rally in Squamish. Despite their isolation among the pines, powerful outside influences are rolling dice against the displaced desert racers’ futures - many of which have grown from the deep roots of Sadao’s war-torn childhood in Japan.(6x9 in size - 460 page novel, gloss color cover with 17 greyscale interior illustrations! 18+ content.)",
