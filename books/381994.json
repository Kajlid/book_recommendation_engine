But now Emi-Lou fears that Von is going somewhere she can't follow. Yon has feelings for Babes, an older girl on their softball team. Emi-Lou wants desperately for Von to be \"normal\", for them to be the same best friends they've always been. What will Emi-Lou be without Von? Nobody, she thinks. But her desperate actions to hold on to her best friend just may break them.",
