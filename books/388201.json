One might think she has a hobby to provide a break from the many hours of writing, but storytelling is her hobby and she works at it full-time. A Wicked Wolf by Brenda Williamson Excerpt For minutes, he lavished her with kisses. His mouth moved firmer against hers, and his body rubbed hers faster, more insistently. When he stopped, she dared to open her eyes. He was looking up. She did too. From the open crossbeams, dried herbs dangled from tied silk ribbons. He let go of her wrist and reached up. She should have lowered her arm, but to move meant to chance breaking the spell. She watched him tug one ribbon, untying a cluster that fell to the floor. The clean scent of lavender burst from the bouquet. She stared at the other bundles. Had he collected them? They couldn’t be for cooking since his refrigerator was bare. When J.R. looped and tied the ribbon around her wrist, he jerked her thoughts from the idyllic illusion of everything going smoothly in her business acquisition and her sexual encounter. “What are you doing?” Her words rattled free. With the yellow silk strip snug, he drew her arm to the side and fastened the opposite end to the cabinet door knob. As much as she enjoyed aggressively passionate sex in all positions, she’d never been into real bondage. “I’m not sure I like being restrained.” She tipped her head back and watched him retrieve another ribbon. “You will.” He tied a blue strip of silk to her free wrist and fastened it to another cabinet knob.",
