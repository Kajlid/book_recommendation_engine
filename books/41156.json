  "description": "Across two continents, three strangers uncover the oldest story on Earth and the best kept secret of all times. On a rainy day in late June 1991, Dr Wallenberg, a Swedish neurologist passes through customs at Kennedy Airport. He has come to take over the Directorship at Asgard Park, an old mental Institution in upstate New York. The young academic has no way of knowing that his new position is bait in a bigger game. He is about to uncover a misguided conspiracy run from the asylum. His predecessor at the helm, a man obsessed with Intelligent Design, is using vast resources 'to protect the chosen children'.",
