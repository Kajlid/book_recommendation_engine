  "description": "Road Wise is a novelized account of the authorâ€™s monthlong, 3,600 mile motor scooter trip to visit friends and see the countryside. He experiences oppressive heat, Biblical thunderstorms, mechanical setbacks, and bad directions. He crashes on a mountain road. These obstacles are secondary to the insight this motoring Buddhist gains while rolling through farm and highlands. An excursion to the heartland becomes an odyssey of self discovery. Ride along on this Campbellesque journey.",
