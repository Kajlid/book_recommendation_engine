  "description": "Naya Adams has given up on feeling loved. A walking clich√©, Naya lost her parents in a freak car accident at thirteen and has been living with her detached foster 'adults' ever since. When Naya enrolls in one of the most respected theatre programs in New England, she is more than eager to trade in her pain for the spotlight. College would finally be the fresh start she'd longed for. Unfortunately for Naya, her high school boyfriend, and abuser, Seth, tags along, trapping her in the cycle of tarnished love. Accustomed to emotional numbness, Naya enters her first acting class, unaware of what was waiting on the other side of the door: her Twin Flame. Rarer and more intense than soulmates, Twin Flames search for centuries looking for their other half. It is in another student, an olive-skinned and terribly scarred sophomore named Etash, that Naya will discover what being loved really means. Although they both try to resist each other, their bond is ultimately too strong. Together they'll learn that this is not the first time they have been pulled together, nor will it be their last. But how will her abuser react to Naya's new flame?",
