  "description": "Homeless and heartbroken, Phoebe Morris is having a rough day. The old Cadillac she purchased with the last of her money, a vehicle meant to get her two states over to start her new life, is on the fritz and stalling in the sweltering heat. With no cash to pay for the costly repairs, Phoebe would sooner take her chances and keep on driving than become a charity case for the hottie mechanic trying to keep her safe. A retired Navy SEAL, Dane West refuses to let the weary submissive that’s putt-putted her way into his life leave his garage in the deathtrap she calls a car. It’s too hot and too dangerous for the stubborn beauty to be stranded on the side of a desolate highway, and he’ll be damned if another woman in his care gets hurt by his failure to act. When a small tug on an engine cable ensures her stay—at least temporarily, Dane shows the lovely Miss Morris just how good a little TLC (and BDSM) can feel.",
