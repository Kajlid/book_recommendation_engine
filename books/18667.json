  "description": "\"Attitude is everything.\" It's what makes the difference between those who succeed and those who fail. And it's easy to see-in other people. It's not as easy to recognize when our own attitude needs adjustment, or to know how to change it. \tIn You Are What You Think, David Stoop shows readers how to use self-talk to make positive changes in their attitudes and beliefs. Self-talk can be private speech, thoughts, or external speech, all of which shape emotions and behavior for good or bad. This popular book, previously published as Self-Talk, will help readers overcome stress, guilt, depression, anxiety, and anger; release the power of faith; choose healthy, positive thoughts; and more.",
