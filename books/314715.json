But he's left a trail of cryptic messages that lead Sam from Sydney across to the Blue Mountains and up to the tropical north. On the way, Sam meets two very different men. Trevor’s a surfer, carefree and easy-going. Dominic’s a researcher and much more reserved. Each has a secret, both want to help, but only one wishes him well. Sam has a secret too, but he doesn’t know it.Battling betrayal, threats, and outright assaults, Sam hunts for Max and for his missing research. At every turn, he must choose the right path, make the right decision and trust the right man or he'll lose everything.[Gay, Romance. Mystery. Adventure]",
