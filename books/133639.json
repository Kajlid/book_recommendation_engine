  "description": "The land echoed with the thundering hooves of Modoc ponies. In minutes they swooped down and captured the wagon train and its cargo of gold. But an Indian could not spend stolen gold in the days when Captain Jack ruled the Modoc tribe. So they buried it deep in a cave in the lava beds at Tule Lake. Now the big half-breed they called Sundance was going after it. And he swore nothing would stand in his way—not Indian savagery, the vicious gunfighters of the town named Hell, or a beautiful rancher’s woman with a roving eye.",
