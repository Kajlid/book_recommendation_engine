  "description": "This is an alternate cover edition of ASINB01M1MIBEZ.Remember what I said about saving the world? Yeah, apparently the third time is the charm. Turns out our little plan to stop the apocalypse left the gate open for some bastards straight out of HP Lovecraft. Now they’ve come on through to try to turn the planet into an all you can eat buffet. That’s not exactly my jam, so if I want to go on living here, I’ll need to find a way to stop them. My name is Frank Butcher, and one way or another, I’m putting an end to this once and for all.",
