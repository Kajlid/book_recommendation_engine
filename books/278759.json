  "description": "\"...these memoirs include information never before seen in the West, and as such, will prove to be an invaluable tool for the interpretation of the great carrier battles of the Pacific War. this volume will be appreciated as one of the last great Japanese first-person accounts of that conflict to appear in the English language within the span of the author's lifetime. Lastly, it will certainly serve as a tribute to the American and Japanese patriots who, earnestly and willingly, laid their lives on the altar of their country. May their souls find peace.\" - Michael Wenger",
