  "description": "In this erotic romance set in a dystopian future, healer Gabriel's attempt to convince slavegirl Mariah to trust him goes too far, endangering his life, his freedom, and his sanity. Mariah can save him from the despair that envelopes him only if she can find the strength to trust herself. Gabriel, on a mission of mercy, is horrified by what he finds when he arrives in Riviera, a land far from his home. So-called \"humans,\" bored and decadent, amuse themselves with the senseless torture of their slaves. Yet Gabriel finds unexpected friends. An artist named Animal, who notices everything except Rose, his slavegirl. And Mariah, a slave foisted on Gabriel when he unwittingly prevents her from escaping. Mariah knows that Master Gabriel's talk of a different way of life, in which slavery does not exist, is merely the latest and cruelest of the mindgames that humans have inflicted on her for her entire life. She must play along, but actually believing in it would bring disaster to her and to everyone she cares about. Mindgames is about love, and friendship, and the potential for redemption. It is about how one person can change the world, or be destroyed by it. Reviewers online call Mindgames \"absolutely amazing. The perfect balance of substance and sex and never a dull moment.\" \"Simply magnificent.\" \"The writing is spare, clean and sprightly.\" The writer \"proves that writing is an art form that possesses the ability to transfix and transform the reader to faraway lands.\" \"I LOVE this story, and I think about it all the time.\"",
