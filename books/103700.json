  "description": "This is a companion novelette to Fall into my Heart. If you have not read Fall into my Heart, please do so before reading this. In Fall into my Heart, we were introduced to Chloe and Jack, whose relationship was cut short when Chloe's Ex-fiance, Connor, told Jack they were still engaged and Jack ended things with no questions asked. Jack seemed to stay relatively quiet throughout the breakup, but things aren't always as they seem. Jack is ready to tell his side of the story and share insights as to where his head was and why he did the things he did.",
