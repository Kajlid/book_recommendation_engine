  "description": "In the near future, America is slowly becoming populated with a new minority: men and women who, at their parents' behest, were genetically altered in the womb to exhibit the appearance of anthropomorphic animals. Miara is a humanimal, a woman just like anyone else, except with feline features and some feline abilities. She accidentally witnesses a murder in the San Francisco Bay Area, and is subsequently kidnapped by the man she sees fleeing the scene. She is then forced to help him find a way to prove his innocence, but he couldn't possibly be telling the truth... could he?",
