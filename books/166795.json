  "title": "The Otherness Factor: Co-Creating and Sustaining Intentional Relationships",
  "description": "What if finding love and purpose only requires we become more of who we are — would we know how?  Envision a life where we no longer exhaust ourselves trying to fit in or change one another; where relationships are more about otherness than sameness; where the search for common ground and shared interests doesn't hold us back or limit our potential.  Today's campfire for the long conversation about life, love and purpose is lighting up cyberspace and the global community. No longer can we pretend there is one right way to be in this world. Spiritual, religious and cultural beliefs may influence our choices — yet, each of us has the innate power to shape our life and form relationships through intention and volition.  With life's megapixel array of distractions and diversions, we might question our energetic bandwidth to act with intention. That is, until we assess the cost of inattention — chaos, burnout, loneliness, despair.  In The Otherness Factor we slip out of our contained self to observe the remarkable whole of who we are. Guided by ancient and contemporary philosophers, we discover a new alchemy of science, psychology and spirituality. Beyond theory, our capacity to co-create our life has become scientific fact — revolutionizing and reframing all we thought we knew about freewill.  This book will take you to places far beyond the ordinary and offer you the power, courage and audacity to stand in your own otherness and form meaningful, lasting relationships. Turn the page — invite new energy and insight — as you begin to realize the potency and durability of becoming more of who you are!",
