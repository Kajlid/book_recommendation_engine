  "description": "As clever as it is heartbreaking, this comic masterpiece--now in paperback--tells the story of a marriage that is not, after all, exactly like anyone else's. Or is it?In The Dangerous Husband, they meet and almost immediately fall in love. Like everyone, they have been alone. He is perfect for her - charming and sexy and awkward and sweet. They are forty; it is time for them to marry and shelter each other. When the honeymoon ends, as honeymoons always do, real life begins, with its surprises. He trips up stairs, falls going down. He cooks a tasty dinner and the kitchen ends up looking like a slaughterhouse. Absorbed in sexual experimentation, he shatters the coffee table. He tenderly wrenches her neck; he breaks her arm. It was turning out that my husband's dishevelment was incomparable, potent, ramifying. It could destroy whole little worlds. It will surely destroy her. Unless she can kill him first.",
