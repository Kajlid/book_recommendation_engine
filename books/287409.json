  "description": "Three against one is not the best odds in any fight. But does she dare gamble on making an enemy into an ally?  The final installment in the USAT and WSJ bestselling epic urban fantasy that readers have been waiting for!  There might be no rest for the wicked, but there’s no rest for the exhausted either. We’ve barely survived one fight, and we have another blade at our throats-strike that, three blades.  I can see only one possible chance at surviving the three evils we face, no matter how much I might hate it.  I have to make my peace with one of them and pray that they will help me take down the other two before we turn on each other.  The only question is...who do I trust not only my life but with the life of my family? Because I have all those I love the best at my side.  Maks. Lila. Bryce.  Or do I leave them, and take the danger with me to face it all on my own?  One thing is for sure...even if I go down, it’ll be swinging with everything I have.",
