  "description": "M.L. Cooper presents an urban paranormal romance thriller that is sure to entice and frighten readers! Dark Side of Grace is an original tale about the fragile veil that separates the world of the living from the world of the dead—and how a rupture in that veil sends one woman and her lover, on a quest to uncover the truth about her family’s haunted slave past.In the midst of Newark, New Jersey’s urban decay and newfound revitalization, Asha, a brilliant, sensual social worker and director of the New Day Job Placement Program for ex-convicts, struggles to uncover the horrific secrets that have led to a history of what has been called mental illness in generations of women in her family. At a time when everything in her life seems all so unstable—her ill-conceived lust for a former client and ex-con, the collapsing relationships she shares with her sisters, and her grandmother’s failing health and apparent manic hallucinations—Asha is forced to confront a haunted past that may very well destroy her future. M.L. Cooper’s Dark Side of Grace follows Asha through the poverty infested streets of Newark, New Jersey to the old-world Spanish moss laden landscape of the South Carolina coast in pursuit of slave master Henry Tisdale’s ghost. Master Henry’s torments and haunts drive Asha to the point of no return. Asha’s quest to undo the family curse that binds them to the ghastly, malevolent apparition reveals her hidden connection to black magic, voodoo and Santeria, and seals her love for the only man strong enough to stand by her side.",
