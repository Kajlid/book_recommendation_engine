  "title": "Before the Knight",
  "description": "While this can certainly be read on its own as a short story, it was written as backstory -- a prequel -- for A Hard Dazed Knight. For the life of me, I can't figure out how to upload a MOBI or PDF version of this, so for those of you who can't open EPUB files,this story is available on my website: http://jjcassidy.com Jay Broussard knows his family is dysfunctional -- and not in a fun way -- but he's stuck managing the family business. He never celebrates his birthday, but this one -- his thirtieth -- is special, and he has someone to share it with as well. And then he remembers why he never brings anybody home.",
