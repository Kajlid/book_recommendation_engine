  "description": "Marler ‘Kitty’ Barnes has always been the fun guy who doesn’t stick around after the fun is over. Even in his old profession, he was always quick to take off once the job was done. After his release from prison, he focused on other things but never lost that urge to run as soon as things got serious. When he meets a woman who is just as gun-shy as him, it throws him for a loop and makes her even sexier somehow. His first instinct is to let her go, but that’s impossible since she’s all he can think about.Until a few years ago, Pandora Copeland led a sheltered life. Marrying straight out of high school and raising children in an ultra conservative family kept her from experiencing the fun and adventurous young adulthood that most people take for granted. Now that she’s divorced and out from under the thumb of her ex in-laws, Pandora is ready to spread her wings and fly. With her new business venture gaining popularity in Tenillo, she’s exposing herself to all sorts of new things, and one of those just happens to be Kitty.After spending so much time in an unhealthy relationship, she’s not sure she can trust another man to stay in her life. Kitty’s found the woman of his dreams, but he’s got his own reservations about a relationship with Pandora. Can she learn to trust him, and can Kitty trust that she’ll stick around?",
