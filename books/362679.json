  "description": "Shannon Mallory was a woman on the run....not from outside forces but from her own wounded heart. When she pulled up into the parking lot of \"The Last Resort Cafï¿½\" in the town of \"Sanctuary\", little did she know she would find the one thing she never even knew she was searching for....true love.Seth Proudfoot wasn't looking for anything, except an end to his miserable existence. Accused of a crime he couldn't remember committing, he was ostracized by a town that, ironically, bore the name of the one thing he could never find....Sanctuary. When the two meet, neither can ignore the magnetic pull between them, but will Shannon allow her damaged spirit to trust a man...a man who may have murdered his own family? Though Shannon is the most beautiful woman he has ever seen, it is her spirit that breaks down the iron-clad shield around his heart. Their desire burns hotter than the Arizona desert, threatening to melt the very mountains that loom like silent Gods above their heads. But can their love survive a betrayal that could very well cost them both their lives?",
