  "description": "Nat and Aric have despised each other ever since they crossed paths. But now they find themselves hopelessly lost in the middle of the woods, farther from home then either of them want to be. They'll have to put aside their differences, or at least not strangle each other, and make it out of the woods together. Or else, they'll drown in the sea of trees.",
