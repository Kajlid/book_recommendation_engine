Greed, hopelessness, and rage are the order of the day as humanity falls deeper into despair. Enter a small ray of light in the form of eight-year-old Maria Sullivan, who has been given a special task by King Jesus Himself. But evil forces have targeted Maria and God knows she needs protection. He sends Josh, Captain of the Global Security Force.Demon prince Jaxx and thousands of his minions arrive on scene with one relentless purpose—to disrupt, deceive—or destroy anyone involved with the King. These demons in human form are a relentless, cruel force, but overwhelming odds and fear don't register with Josh. Obedience is everything. He will protect Maria using whatever ruthless methods are required, and let God sort things out after.",
