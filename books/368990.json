With her two best friends by her side, she's ready to start over and not look back. During her first major exhibition at a legitimate art gallery, Kate expects the inevitable nerves, but what she doesn't anticipate is meeting someone who—with one glance—leaves her breathless. What happens when the charming mystery man disappears, leaving Kate wanting more? Without even knowing his name, the odds of finding him again are stacked against her. Will fate intervene, and if it does, will her old wounds prevent her from acting on the undeniable connection she feels?",
