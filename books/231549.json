  "title": "The Betrayal Of The Negro: From Rutherford B. Hayes To Woodrow Wilson",
  "description": "This is the first full-scale study of the four decades from 1877 to 1918 which produced the \"color line\" and the \"separate but equal\" philosophy that have betrayed the principle of Emancipation to the present day.Beginning with an account President Hayes 1877 tours of the South, the author traces, step by step, Southern repudiation of its promises and Northern acceptance of the concept of \"second-class\"status for the Negro. He analyzes the economics factors, in agriculture and labor, that held down the Negro, scrutinizes the Supreme Court decisions which hastened the decline of Negro rights, and re-evaluates the attitude of Negroes such as Booker T. Washington that the Negro could rely on the friendship of the white Southerner. Finally, he gives a unique and disturbing account of the caricature of the Negro Perpetuated by respectable, and even liberal, newspapers and magazines in the North.The new, enlarged Collier edition carries the story up through World War I and the Wilson administration, pinpointing, finally, the hesitant emergence, in Constitutional law an in education, of trends which would a half-century later reverse the national tide of betrayal.",
