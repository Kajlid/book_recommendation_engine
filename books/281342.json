The halfling prince with murder in his eyes and the sea’s songs in his blood will make sure of that.He should kill her.Perhaps, keeping her might be worse.Two kingdoms are falling. One king is losing it all and another threatens to ruin everything. The rules of the land and sea are changing. Secrets of the past are spilling.And all because of a prince and his little mermaid—whether they live or die—nothing in the realm will ever be the same.*In The Hunted, Bethany-Kris opens a new world—the 9INE REALMS—for readers with a dark fairy tale retelling, and pulls inspiration from the cult classic favorite and the Hans Christian Andersen original to redefine what it means to be The Little Mermaid.",
