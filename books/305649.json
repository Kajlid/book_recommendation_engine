  "description": "Can a young timegatherer find love in another century? Not if a secret society out to eliminate time travel finds him first. Young George St. James needs help. He doesn’t know how to unfold the wings of his gift, but a timegathering medieval monk and a 23rd century geneticist can put him on the right track. He learns the genetic nature of his ability and that his destiny is to nudge history in the right direction. Unfortunately, this brings him deadly enemies. As George struggles to thwart them, love unexpectedly arrives while he’s on a history research mission. Beautiful, talented 17th century painter Elisabetta Sirani is destined for an untimely end, but George’s passion makes him determined to save her, even if he must change history, and it might cost him his future. The Time Gatherer (Book 2 in the Timegathering Series), will immerse you in love, history, and adventure.",
