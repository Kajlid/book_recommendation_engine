  "description": "He's the loveable, cheeky larrikin with a heart of pure gold. He's the size of a bear and we aren't talking about the cuddly type. Just one look into his ocean blue eyes, will make you want to combust. He is Jacob Walters.  You are either going to love her or hate, but no matter which column you choose to place her in, she won't care. She is feisty, temperamental and a little bit stubborn. She is Lola McIntosh.  This is not your typical love story.  Jump in and hold on tight, while you enjoy the emotionally gripping and life altering story of epic proportions.  If you haven't already fallen in love with Jacob from the books 'Perception of Life' and 'Reality of Life', I think this next instalment in the 'Perception' series will have you falling head over heels in love.  This book can be read as a standalone, but it is highly recommended to be read after the first two books in the 'Perception' series.",
