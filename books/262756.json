  "description": "This is the story of the ship - a journey of six thousand years on all the waters of the world. The Ship takes us from Queen Hatshepsut's obelisk vessels and the papyrus rafts of the Nile into the Mediterranean of the classic times, into the world of the Phoenicians, the Greeks, and the Romans. Beyond the Pillars of Hercules the horizon stretches to distant lands: The Ship takes us with Columbus' Santa Maria to the Indies, into the great age of seafaring. Captain Cook, the East Indiamen, Nelson and the Victory, the graceful clippers, the first steam-propelled vessels, Mississippi paddle-wheelers, the Monitor and the Merrimack, icebreakers, aircraft carriers, tugs, whalers, and nuclear-powered submarines - Björn Landström knows them all, making his knowledge live in superb illustrations and informative text.Based on facts gathered from hundreds of books, from numerous journeys, from study in museums and libraries, and from communication with authorities in many countries, The Ship is the most comprehensive and exhaustive pictorial history of the ship ever published.The Ship is an experience for all who love ships and the sea, a goldmine of maritime and social history. Over 800 illustrations, with 160 pages in full color ind 160 pages in two-color.",
