  "description": "In the heart of Iran, a dark family secret has been passed from father to son, mother to daughter, generation to generation – a line unbroken by time. And Dr. Shahzad Yavari, the professor of geopolitics at Tehran University, is destined to become the next recipient of this legacy. After the sudden death of his father, Dr. Yavari learns of the most closely-guarded secret of his family: an astonishing lineage the stretches back more than three thousand years, and the inheritance of not only a kingdom lost, but a kingdom stolen from them. With this revelation, an ancient vendetta is reawakened and Yavari quickly begins rising to power in the Islamic Republic of Iran. Thirteen years after Dr. Yavari becomes a top adviser in the regime, Iran has completed its quest to become the second nuclear power in the Middle East, though not without tremendous cost. Rumors of espionage and infiltrators abound throughout the program, and no one is above suspicion. As Iran begins to capitalize on their newly-acquired nuclear status, Israel grapples with the realization that America may not assist them in preventing a nuclear Holocaust. Deep inside the Quds Uranium Enrichment Facility near Qom, the scientists and technicians are under constant surveillance by the ever-watchful eye of the Iranian Republican Guard as the newest, fastest centrifuges are brought online. Within months, Iran’s nuclear program at Quds will be producing several warheads per year. To counter the growing threat of a nuclearized Iran, a team of Israeli agents has been dispatched to Qom with the sole objective of stopping the enrichment program at Quds by any means necessary.",
