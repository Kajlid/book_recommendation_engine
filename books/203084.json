  "description": "‘He flies through the air with the greatest of ease – the daring young man on the flying trapeze!’ Step right up, Ladies and Gentlemen, for a glorious spectacle of graphic literature beyond your wildest imaginings, in which young Etienne discovers that replacing his uncle as the Amazing Remarkable Monsieur Leotard, world-renowned acrobat and head of a circus troupe, is every bit as difficult as it appears to be. Etienne is swept up in wonder and work even as he struggles to keep up his grandiose façade, while every day his chances for happiness slip further away. For Etienne, taking a stand for his own happiness is as daring as any trick the Amazing Remarkable Leotard could perform. Eddie Campbell and Dan Best bring to life the historical story of the daring young man on the flying trapeze in a tale filled with wonders and marvels.",
