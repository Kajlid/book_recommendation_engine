  "description": "Bianca’s life is tediously normal until the day she rescues a fairytale princess from a troll. Then, everything changes and Bianca finds herself being thrust into the role of Prince Charming whether she likes it or not.Despite her misgivings, she’s drawn to the strange Princess and her ways and before she knows where she is she’s forced to fight for her love - and her life.Other comments/ “[...] the story just fascinated me from beginning to end. I loved the idea in general, the hole between worlds, the princess in distress the not-quite Prince Charming. It's witty and lovely and rather epic and all sorts of gripping. I loved the characterisation, I loved the relationship between Bianca and Alexandra, I loved 'the gang'...it was just an awesome read, tyvm!”“[...] This was absolutely adorable, it captured everything i love about ya fiction and had amazing characterizations throughout. Some of my favorite YA books are the fantasy/realism fusions and i really felt this GOT it. I also loved the f/f aspect because I find that queer YA books are generally ~dramatic hs plots instead of ever venturing into fantasy etc.”",
