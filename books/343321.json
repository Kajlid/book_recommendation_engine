  "description": "These early volumes of our multiple Harvey and Eisner Award-winning Complete Crumb Comics series have been amongst our most demanded reprints the last few years. Following last season’s reprint of the expanded Vol. 1, the first three volumes of this best-selling series will all be in print for the first time in a decade! “Some More Early Years of Bitter Struggle” features several key stories from Crumb’s pre-underground, homemade comics of the early 1960s (such as Farb and Arcade), with stories featuring early Crumb characters Fritz the Cat, Jim, Mabel, and Little Billy Bean.",
