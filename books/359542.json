Unfortunately for me, I look just like her.While he hates me with a passion, he also burns for me.I shouldn’t crave the fireworks whenever we’re together—it always ends in disaster. Especially after I learn the dark truth—the vengeful gods cursed him to endure endless hunt until he finds his fated mate and slays her.I have one goal—to escape Ryder and the heat that makes me want him every second. Should I fail, I vow to bring Ryder to his knees he ruins me.If you like a dominant, possessive, and damaged demigod dragon, tough nerdy heroine, panty-melting heat in action, and enemies-to-lovers trope, you’ll enjoy this series.",
