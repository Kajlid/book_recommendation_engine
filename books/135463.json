  "description": "Meeting the family is scary. Surviving them is a nightmare.Connie can’t deny she’s nervous about meeting her boyfriend’s family. Spending the weekend at their ritzy woodland summer home, Evan’s already given her fair warning: that his parents are cold, snobbish, and especially unpleasant toward those outside their usual social circles.So when Evan’s mother warmly greets them with open arms, Connie is as confused as he is. Evan’s parents are nothing like he described. They’re so friendly, in fact, Evan himself can hardly believe they’re real.Then, while helping Evan’s mother with dinner preparations, Connie overhears strange noises coming from the basement—what almost sounds like voices calling out for help.Connie doesn't realize that once the door is opened, it can’t be closed. Or that once she descends those rickety steps into the darkness below... she may never see the light of day again.From horror author Abe Moss comes a relentlessly fast-paced supernatural nightmare that will leave you gripping the pages long into the night, and afraid to turn out the lights long after you're done.",
