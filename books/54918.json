  "title": "A Cathedral of Cedars",
  "description": "I stood up and looked in the window again, but the rooms were still empty empty of furniture, empty of life, empty of love, empty of everything I was looking for and couldn't find. The summer of 1971 held promise. Ginny was looking forward to spending time with her friends, landing her first boyfriend, and practicing with new makeup. But the reality of her family turns a summer vacation into a spiraling tunnel of endless misery. Between a drunk father, a distracted mother, and a brother whose footsteps ignite fear worse than the devil, Ginny must reason her way out of childhood and find safe ground in the chilling first steps toward adulthood. Her only safe haven is the woods behind her house where she spends endless hours alone, hiding from the destruction within her house. But when she is followed into the woods by territorial teenage boys, her safe haven is torn from her faltering grip a memory she won't easily put aside. A Cathedral of Cedars is the compelling story of a young teen fighting for her childhood while losing herself to a dysfunctional family too intent on maintaining some fa√ßade of normalcy to provide the love and nurturing care that a young girl needs. Virginia Johnston-Dodds leaves readers desperate to love Ginny and determined to make right the wrongs of their own family sorrows in A Cathedral of Cedars. 'Virginia Dodds has done an extraordinary job at reminiscing about the summer that changed her life...an engaging and unforgettable story that I could not put down. I would recommend this book to everyone.' -Dr. Sarah Hawthorn ND Doctor of Naturopathic Medicine",
