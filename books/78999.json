  "description": "\"Hell Camp\": How to chew on a crazy childhood and avoid choking!It took a few years before Smart could see the funny side of having a mother who ran over the crossing guard, collapsed onto the baggage carousel, extinguished candles with her bare stomach and crashed cars on a regular basis.Growing up with a mother suffering from borderline personality disorder had its fair share of excitement, bizarreness, and flat out madness. Add to this the fact that Smart grew up in South Africa during the “Kill a White Man” era; a time when the entire country had gone mad, and this should give you a rough idea of the chaos that reigned supreme in \"Hell Camp\" - a nickname her younger brother bestowed upon their rental home in Johannesburg.\"Hell Camp\" will make you laugh and it will make you cry, but above all, you won't be able to put this book down.",
