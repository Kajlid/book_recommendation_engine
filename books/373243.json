  "description": "Erotic, rebellion, spiritual thirst, a strong hint of early feminism, and a steaming animal passion, these are what makes Mirabai's songs irrepressible four centuries after she sang them. To open this book is to get close to the oldest kind of song, sweet and bitter, sage and spontaneous. And to remember why we're on earth.",
