Furthermore, can he prevail against his greatest foe, a Delghorlin nightwalker hellbent on destroying him, seeking a powerful charm called the Clyth?Amid these challenges, the dir cyohr must find peace within himself, including opening his heart to a newfound love, never imagining the surreal reality that lay in store. But with the support of his sister and trusted friends who have crossed worlds to stand by his side, he is now ready to embrace…his immortal calling.",
