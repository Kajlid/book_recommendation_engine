  "description": "There's one word you don't utter at Prescott High, not unless you want them to own you. H.A.V.O.C. Hael, Aaron, Victor, Oscar, and Callum.  The Havoc Boys rule the hellhole we call Prescott High. Once upon a time, they ruled me. For an entire year, I endured their shit. But senior year is going to be different.  This year, I own them. I’ve made a pact with the Havoc Boys to get the vengeance I deserve. Their price? Me. At their beck and call, in their beds, a part of their gang.  Their girl. A Havoc Girl. Those dirty, rotten boys are going to get revenge against everyone that’s wronged me—everyone but themselves.  HAVOC AT PRESCOTT HIGH is a 105,000 word mature high school/new adult romance with enemies-to-lovers/love-hate themes. It has brief flashbacks of past bullying incidents as well as foul language and sexual scenes; any sex featured is consensual. This is a reverse harem novel, meaning the main character has more than one love interest. This is book one of three in the series.",
