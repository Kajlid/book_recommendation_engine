  "description": "When college student Emily stumbles upon an old, seemingly innocuous mirror at a flea market, her life takes a sinister turn. As strange occurrences begin to plague her home—flickering lights, whispers in the dark—Emily realizes the mirror may hold more than just her reflection. Soon, she’s thrust into a nightmare where reality bends, and trust in her own sanity falters. But as the terror unfolds, it becomes clear that the mirror is part of something far older and far more dangerous—a cursed artifact with the power to destroy her mind and body. With no one to trust and her own memories betraying her, Emily must confront the unseen evil lurking just beyond the glass before it claims her soul.",
