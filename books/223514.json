  "description": "I always thought love was black and white. You meet the girl and within the first meeting you’d know if she’s the one. You live happily ever after. My concept was a little off, but it worked for me. I don’t waste my time with women I don’t see a future with.  The day I met Whitney, I didn’t get hit with the love bug, nothing spectacular happened, at least not how I expected it to.  The last year has been a constant struggle to live with the loss, the pain. Needing a change, I picked up and move to Kentucky to live with the only family I have left. I didn’t expect to feel at home like I did. I didn’t expect him.  The day I met Aaron, I was sure he would run for the hills the next time he seen me. That’s not at all what happened.  She’s everything. Everything I thought I wanted, and everything I never thought I would.  With his sweet gestures and words that melt my soul, he worked his way into my heart.  Now that I’ve found her, it’s time to build our future.  How can I stay with this cloud that follows me?  Will Aaron and Whitney find their happily ever after?  Book 1: Southern Pleasure",
