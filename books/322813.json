  "description": "The worst part about betrayal, is it never comes from your enemies.I should have known better, I should have seen the signs, but now all I'm left with is heartache and disappointment.They may think they've got the better of me, but I won't go down without a fight. Especially when it comes to the ones I love.Even if I have to protect them from themselves.Wading into the depths of darkness, nothing can prepare me for the secrets that bind us.The truth will either be the answer to our salvation or the beginning of our downfall.",
