  "description": "(Author’s This story is at a special intro price! Enjoy!) LEGALLY BINDING (Lawyers Behaving Badly #1) is a steamy office menage BDSM novella of 25,000 words. Maisie can’t hide her shock the first time she sees Ethan Brennbach’s scarred, mask-like face. Ethan. Gorgeous except for… yeah. Ethan, her new boss. He’s not impressed by her lack of tact. Neither are Raphael Lattimore and Trent Banno, the handsome partners at the prestigious LB&B law firm, where gossiping about Ethan’s appearance is grounds for termination. The whole office is brimming with secrets, some downright dangerous. Soon the secrets include Maisie herself, the illegal activities she discovers… ...And the filthy things all three of her dominant bosses expect of her.",
