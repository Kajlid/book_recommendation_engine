  "description": "Won the 1996 Camera D'Or at Cannes. Set in the forlorn Riverina town of Sunray, Love Serenade is the story of Vicki-Ann and Dimity Hurley, twenty-something sisters beset by the notion that somehow the world is passing them by. Idealistic Vicki-Ann in particular feels sharply the lamentable lack of decent boyfriend material in sleepy Sunray. Dimity has apparently given up on romance completely and shifted attention to her chief interest in life -- fish. So when Ken Sherry -- mid 40s, thrice divorced, ex-drivetime king of Brisbane radio -- arrives in town to take over the running of the tiny local radio station, the sisters respond by abandoning all sibling loyalty and launching into a stormy battle for his reptilian affections.",
