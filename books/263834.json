  "description": "I live in the forest of the fairies and frolic with the nymphs. I talk with the owls and hear the rumors spread by ravens. But it is within the walls of the old stone castle that I hear that which is worth knowing. The lies and secrets, the human willy-nillys. Normally it is all just bubbles in the sunlight. Nothing more or less. Nothing bigger or smaller.  But things are changing. I just need medicine for my owl. He is my home and my friend and the person who listens the most. He speaks in the voice of the ancients and knows my heart. But he is sick, and the robed ones in the castle have potions and liquids and vials of magic they steal from the earth and the sky and the water and fire, and so I will steal it back from them to make my friend better.  That is when I hear it.  That is when I know.  The still waters will be still no more.  ***  Welcome to a world of magic. A world of mystery. A world of adventure. Welcome to Moonstone Academy, a new series from USA Today bestselling author Karpov Kinrade. Enjoy a peak into the mystical island of Moonstone, where nothing is at it seems, in this novella prequel.",
