  "description": "Bad things are brewing in the halls of the Ben Turpin School for K-8. When a science project goes wrong, only the prepubescent children are spared the fate of zombification - which is not to say that they're immune from being eaten alive! George Romero covered night, dawn and day, but how about recess? With Recess Pieces, Bob Fingerman (Beg the Question, You Deserved It) dishes up a grisly combination of Hal Roach's \"Our Gang\" and zombies, zombies and more zombies.",
