  "description": "Chloe Sorenson's just started a brand new job at Ms. Muffet’s art gallery. However, no one told her that the latest auction piece – a sculpture of a handsome Roman soldier – comes to life. Think it's hard to explain to your boss why you're fondling a statue? Try explaining to the statue why you're holding his, uh, fig leaf.Chloe never thought that touching the statue would turn him into a sexy, aroused man, but she's not saying no to this delicious Roman soldier. The curse requires that she touch him at all times? Such a hardship...But there's a problem in their lust-fueled relationship; she’s falling dangerously in love with a guy that cursed to be hard as a rock - literally - unless she can somehow free him. And the statue of Titus just went up for auction. If she doesn’t do something, he’s going to be out of her life and trapped for all eternity…This novella (16,000 words - about 70 pages) contains explicit scenes, including some backdoor play.*** This story is a companion to MIRRORLIGHT, an Erotic Time Travel Novella also available on the Kindle. Both stories stand alone, but if you like one, I recommend you try the other! ***",
