  "title": "Dancing with Nature",
  "description": "Dancing with Nature offers a logical, innovative merging of twenty-first-century science and spirituality. It explores newly discovered elements of human-animal communications, particularly focusing on whales. Author Peter Beamish shares stories and images of his travels and research, as well as his thoughts on time and spirituality, interspersed with original poetry relevant to the subject. The most exciting aspect of Beamish's adventures has been the involvement of the Great Whales near the shore of the scenic bays of eastern Canada. These adventures have brought about unexpected and rewarding events, always in the \"Now Time\" of the wild and necessarily unstressed animals. His story follows a group of humpback whales northward, meeting countless other unstressed animals along the way. These whales may be the most altruistic animals in our biosphere. Learn from the nature of whales and their interactions with humans in Dancing with Nature.",
