  "description": "\"She walks a tightrope between light and dark. Danger and passion. Obsession and love...\"Aziza Jane Stewart is living on borrowed time, and making a few mistakes in London seems like a good way to go out with a bang. But when two compelling strangers draw her into an ancient conflict, she realizes her curse isn't about death at all...it's about the power within her.The sexy giant following her says he can smell trouble on her skin, the smokeless fire and magic of the demons he was born and bred to hunt. Brandon may be an enforcer, but his reaction to her is anything but adversarial. Ram, her new Jinn shadow, will do whatever it takes to come between them, and he's just as hard for Aziza to resist.When her dark family legacy burns to the surface, whom can Aziza trust? The alpha male who pushes all her hot buttons, the Jinn who seduces her in dreams, or the emerging Fireborne within? As danger circles closer, she must learn to embrace her newfound powers-and trust someone with her heart-before she becomes the final casualty. Explicit content, magic, danger, voyeurism, chains, a secret menage and carnal deeds of devilish debauchery at every other turn. Basically...fasten your seatbelts and get ready to burn.",
