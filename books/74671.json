  "description": "Dead Man Riding East is a fantasy adventure where the unintended theft of a tyrantâ€™s concubine, followed by the inadvertent acquisition of a wife, leads to revenge, the fall of dynasties and over exposure to the world of high fashion. Such are the further adventures of Benor Dorfinngil. Described by some as a love story with more action that fifty shades. I think they mean it has better fight scenes.",
