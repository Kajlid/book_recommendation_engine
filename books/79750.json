Another group has their eyes on the same charity and will stop at nothing to get their way, including using the Dirty Dozen’s lifestyle for target practice. While the men babysit, the women are raising money to sponsor The Dallas Children’s Home, but another group wants to snatch it from them. They resort to underhanded methods like siccing child welfare on them because of their menage relationships. Well, two can play that game. The women put their heads together and fight fire with fire. Their rivals don’t know who they're dealing with. When the dust settles, who will be delivering Santa to the children? And who is expecting their own little bundles of joy? Will the guys end up working over the Christmas holidays or helping their wives plan the most perfect Christmas ever? There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among the men. NOTE! This is a holiday reunion book in The Dirty Dozen series. ** A Siren Erotic Romance",
