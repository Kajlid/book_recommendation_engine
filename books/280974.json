  "description": "Andrew Klavan's 2019 writings and speeches come together to make a powerful argument for living a joyful and reasonable life of faith rather than following the culture's default secular path into moral madness. In \"Can We Believe?\" Klavan takes on the 'Enlightenment Narrative,' which claims science and reason have made faith impossible for the thinking person. In \"Can We Be Silent in A World Gone Mad?\" he examines the way mistaken ideas lead to insane moral conclusions. In his powerful and eloquent discussion of abortion, “The Art of Making Sense,” he examines the deep importance of a cogent moral worldview. And in “Speaking Across the Abyss,” he lays out his ideas on speaking faith into an unbelieving world. Taken as a whole, these writings suggest a fresh and original approach to redirecting a culture that has lost its way.",
