  "description": "\"We were all looking at Anna as she raised her leg and shook it in panic. A large rat was dangling from her trousers by its teeth. It let go, dropped to the floor and ran off across the restaurant...There was a short period of mayhem while the kitchen staff chased and cornered the rat. A waiter knocked it unconscious, popped it into a saucepan and carried it through to the kitchen.\"This was just one of the many incidents that took place during this fascinating journey through China from Hong Kong to Beijing.Discover the amazing Stone Forest, the Giant Buddha of Leshan and Mount Emei, one of China's four sacred mountains. Encounter the dentist, ear cleaner and barber at work in a country market, learn the health benefits of drinking snake's blood and find out why August is the most propitious month in which to marry.This book, illustrated with photographs, is not intended as a guide since China has changed considerably in recent years. Instead, it is a snapshot of places visited at one particular time and a record of personal experiences.",
