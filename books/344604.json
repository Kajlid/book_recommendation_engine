  "title": "Submission Times Two",
  "description": "When Ethan and Cam met the year before at an underground BDSM club, their connection was intense and immediate. There's just one small problem-they're both subs. To work around this, they agree to find their own Doms for play, offering their submission and their bodies to would-be Masters, but leaving their hearts at home. The setup works fine, until the day Ethan meets a hot Dom named Maestro. For the first time, Ethan finds himself keeping secrets from his lover. And Maestro has secrets of his own. Unrequited passion and sizzling hot D/s lead to the three agreeing to a play scene that ends up ensnaring them all in something more powerful than any of them had dreamed of. Can two subs submit to a man who would claim not only their bodies, but their hearts and minds? Or will the intensity of a D/s m√©nage break their world apart?",
