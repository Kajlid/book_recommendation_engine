  "title": "Herbie: A Troy Youth's Coming of Age Sort Of!",
  "description": "Herbie's neighborhood buddies drift away into adulthood, as their neighborhood continues its evolutionary death spiral. However, tales of the many characters who crossed Herbie’s path continue to amuse and entertain the reader. Hyde’s conversational writing style keeps you in the moment, as though you were sitting on your neighbor’s stoop, shooting the breeze. Herbie’s personal and emotional awakenings call into question: friendships, church, social hierarchy, family relationships, and romantic and sexual yearnings of a young male. However, always lingering beneath the surface is the real constant in his life, poverty, and how to deal with it.",
