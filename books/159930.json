  "description": "MacKenzie can’t help but be a rebel. She was born one. A poor excuse for a wereleopard, she can’t shift, she can’t heal, she can’t hunt like the others.  She escapes all that, though, becomes a fugitive, and spends the next forty years hiding as a civilian amongst humans. But a girl’s gotta eat. Inevitably, life takes a turn when she’s caught infringing on the wrong female’s territory.  With an irresistible price on her head, Mac’s estranged father sends in his trusted friend and werehunter, Ramone. Mission: rescue.  Except, she puts up a mean game of cat and mouse. Understandable when crude genetics have been the “kick me” sign of her existence. MacKenzie lives, eats, and breathes mistrust, yet she watches this male defend her at every turn.  In her darkest hour, Ramone’s sacrifices add up. And when an unresolved family debt ties Mac to imminent death, his loyalty knows no bounds.",
