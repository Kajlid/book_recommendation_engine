  "description": "**This is an emotional and angsty Friends-to-Lovers romance** When we were kids, we made all kinds of promises. We promised to always be best friends, to always put each other first, and that no matter what, no one would come between us. Little did we know that life had its own plans.  We grew up and reality set in. We realized that not all love lasts forever, and some promises are meant to be broken. Itâ€™s ironic that the promises we made as kids, the ones we thought would hold us together, might just be the very thing that could tear us apart.",
