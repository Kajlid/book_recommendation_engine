  "description": "Nestled in a towering fir forest on British Columbia’s famous Vancouver Island, Three Rivers Campground is calling you to come relax, explore, and maybe even fall in love...Trish Rivers lives a good life. A happy life. A safe and predictable life spent running the cafe at her family’s campground, perfecting her award-winning recipes, and terrorizing the local small town bartender with her endless supply of bad jokes.Trish has never wanted more—or at least, she’s never admitted she wants more, but that was before Kennedy March showed up on Vancouver Island.That was before Trish realized falling for your sister’s girlfriend’s best friend doesn’t fit into a safe and predictable life, especially when you’ve never fallen for a girl before.Kennedy’s not sure why life as a real estate star in Toronto doesn’t feel quite as shiny as it used to, but a spontaneous vacation to visit her newly coupled-up best friend seems like the perfect opportunity to ignore the problem.Three weeks without client calls, benefit galas, and, most of all, dating apps is worth braving the woods for, but her plans for relaxation come crashing to a halt at the sight of Trish—the absolutely off-limits and definitely straight little sister of her best friend’s new girlfriend. There’s no path to each other that doesn’t end in disaster, but the farther they go, the more Trish and Kennedy realize it might be too late to turn back.Turning Back is part of the Three Rivers series, a trilogy of interconnected sapphic standalones. Grab your tent and get ready for an adventure in this steamy romance from bestselling author Katia Rose.",
