  "title": "The Gaean Enchantment",
  "description": "The world is going through a Time of Change where science has failed and Gaean earth magic is the new way in which life and survival now work. Oregon archaeologist Thomas and his mage wife Mary embark on a cross-country drive to Virginia to save his three children from the chaos of social breakdown, as national unity disintegrates and local NeoMob or drug Syndicate bosses take over. And Evil incarnate follows them, including a giant leaf monster full of evil from past human sacrifice. But ancient gods, goddesses, sacred mountains, magical groves and totem animals like the bison Black Mane are also awakening, and they will have much to say about the new shape of the world that humans thought they controlled. This is a great book for readers of contemporary dystopia, post-apocalyptic futures, quest adventures, Gaean earth magic, Spirit World stories, Greek mythology, and romance--there are two love stories in this 125,000 word, 374 page novel. And the Greek goddess Artemis appears as a major character.",
