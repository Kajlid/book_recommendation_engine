  "description": "Josh and Raquel have known each other for years - The Society placing them in the same circles, each watching the other as they grow into someone that sparked their attention.It was no surprise when The Society paired them together, slating them as a match for the breeding program. But the more Raquel discovers about The Society, the faster she backpedals from them and Josh.But is Josh content to let go? Can he simply walk away from this spitfire of a woman who challenges him at every turn?The second installment in The Illuminati files will leave the reader wide eyed in shock and awe as more secrets from The Society are uncovered.----I want to rage at the world about how unfair this whole situation is. About how something that I know is inherently twisted, has thrust him and I together. I see the fire that burns through him - the rage at it all, and it calls to me. And his burning rage should only fuel mine, but it somehow doesn't, it blankets and soothes my storm - which only makes this whole situation even more precarious. Because even if I wanted this, I am not the girl for him - because after last summer, I will never be the type of woman that The Society breeds.And Josh? He isn't as oblivious as he seems, but if given the choice I don't think he would choose me, I think he'd choose them, even if he didn't want to. Because the truth of the matter was that we didn't have a choice.",
