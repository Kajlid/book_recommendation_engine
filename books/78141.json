  "description": "Germany is once more the dominant power, her leadership determined to win the world's respect, by bloody force if necessary. In Eastern Europe, where a weakened Russia is struggling against the ambitions of neighbors, virulent nationalism and ancient ethnic hatreds fan the flames of war, this time with nuclear weapons as the ultimate threat. Caught up in the rising storm of a Europe in dangerous transition is an American army, no longer just keeping the peace, but drawn inexorably into a real shooting war.",
