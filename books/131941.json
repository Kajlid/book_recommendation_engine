The Rayder civilians must be escorted to their new home. And the biggest question on everyone's mind is how they will survive the brutal winter.Appernysia fairs no better. Its civilians are defecting to Taeja every week, fleeing from their own deteriorating nation.

The last hope for their kingdom dwells with Mellai Marcs, but can she master her power and find the courage to oppose her own twin brother?",
