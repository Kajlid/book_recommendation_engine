Realizing this mission goes beyond his grief, he accepts, hurtling himself toward the menace of the Third Reich. Relentlessly pursued by the Nazis, as well as his own people from the U.S. Department of War who believe he's traveling into the Reich to assassinate Adolf Hitler, Reuter uses his unique set of skills to battle his way from San Francisco to England, through Germany and on to Austria in a race against time to find the hidden group of children. A sweeping saga of espionage and suspense, over the backdrop of a tantalizing love story, FINAL ZION combines modern storytelling with the excitement and cliffhangers of the classic Saturday afternoon movie serial.",
