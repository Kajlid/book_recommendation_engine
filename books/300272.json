  "title": "Thinking on the Web: Berners-Lee, Gödel and Turing",
  "description": "Tim Berners-Lee, Kurt Gödel, and Alan Turing are the pivotal pioneers who opened the door to the Information Revolution, beginning with the introduction of the computer in the 1950s and continuing today with the World Wide Web evolving into a resource with intelligent features and capabilities.Taking the main questions posed by these thinkers--\"What is decidable?\" by Gödel, \"What is machine intelligence?\" by Turing, and \"What is solvable on the Web?\" by Berners-Lee--as jumping-off points, Thinking on the Web offers an incisive guide to just how much \"intelligence\" can be projected onto the Web.Presenting Web intelligence from both philosophical and applied perspectives, Thinking on the Web explores the next generation of Web architecture, the Semantic Web, and takes a realistic look at the Artificial Intelligence (AI) capabilities resulting from this new layer of machine processing. It is divided into two sections, the first addressing Web intelligence and the second Web logic and language. The book builds from commonsense, real-world examples to some of the most cutting-edge issues surrounding the next generation of Web capabilities, Throughout the book, a series of vignettes highlight important issues underpinning the Information Revolution, thereby mirroring the authors' attention to both the abstract and practical questions posed by a \"thinking\" Web. A unique guide to the next frontier of computing, Thinking on the Web offers both tech-savvy readers and serious computer science students a stimulating and practical view towards a smarter Web.",
