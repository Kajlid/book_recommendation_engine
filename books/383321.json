  "description": "Georgie Mayer has no boyfriend and rarely goes out. In short, she needs a life. Since graduating from college and returning home, her brother s protectiveness has been in overdrive, and she hasn't been able to have any fun, never mind go on a date. So what's a poor particularly attractive girl to do in a situation like this? The only thing she can find him a woman! He'll thank her for it in the end. That is, if his best friend Walt Somers would stop interfering with her plans. The handsome pharmacist has made it no secret that he doesn't approve of what she's up to. Unfortunately, having Walt hanging around does strange things to her mind, and she finds she can't help but take a healthy interest in him. But how can Georgie entertain thoughts of the two of them together when Walt still treats her like his best friend's little sister?",
