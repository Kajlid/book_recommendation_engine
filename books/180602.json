  "description": "Enjoy a sexy alpha werewolf romance while on the go!   **Can be read as a stand-alone, no cliffhangers.**  She thought rules could never be broken. Then she met them.  Ambrosia lived by one rule: Never break them. Of course, only after Ambrosia—a self-proclaimed by-the-book-witch—decides to break the rules does everything go to hell on a witch’s spell!  After their one-night stand with two alpha shifters leads to a bonding, Ambrosia seeks out her secret sanctuary in the woods to perform a cleansing spell. How it led to jinxing both alpha werewolves and a stolen night of wild passion under a full moon was anyone’s guess.  Forced to take her mother’s position within the High Council, Ambrosia is forbidden to marry outside her royal status, much less her species. If anyone discovers her predicament, not only will her superiors strip her of her powers, but she’ll be banished from her coven. For good.  The choice is hers and the consequences are clear. Is the price of losing her magick worth a shared love with her werewolf alphas? What she discovers about their entwined souls will seal all three in a whirlwind of desire and destiny no one could have predicted. Not even by magick.  Hex My Heart, a werewolf erotic series, follows four coven sisters as they find true love through their misadventures with love spells gone wrong and a botched hex or two. Be warned, this series is smokin' hot!",
