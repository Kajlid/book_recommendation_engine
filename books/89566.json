They travel to the low country of South Carolina to compete against some of the top dogs in the southeast for blue ribbons, squeaky toys, and perhaps even that elusive title of High in Trial. But even in this carefree atmosphere of high-spirited dogs and dedicated owners ambition runs high, and when one of the competitors is found brutally murdered it begins to look as though corruption might have penetrated even this last bastion of decency and sportsmanship, the AKC.While Raine and Cisco stalk a killer, a twenty-year old mystery is unfolding back home that will have devastating consequences for Raine and those she loves, and every hour that passes brings a deadly threat closer.ALL THAT GLITTERSThe short story is actually a prequel to the entire series, describing how \"how Raine and Cisco first met and solved their first mystery together\"",
