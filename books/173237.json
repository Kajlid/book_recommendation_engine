  "description": "Asshole cop. It's Joey's role, and one he's comfortable with. Joey tells gay jokes. He's crude, tough, and thick-skinned. But now he's got a chance to work with a fox shifter—and he doesn't want to lose that opportunity.  Dylan is a mess: clingy and broken, cheerful but lost, seriously unpredictable…and very gay. But Joey desperately wants the partnership to succeed. He's not willing to lose the fox shifter for any reason, even when Dyl drives him crazy.  Is there any way to make it work? And will the weird attraction he feels to the cute redhead ever go away?  57,000 words",
