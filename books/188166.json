  "description": "Love Zombies? Meet our local Zombie Response Team, all dressed up with nothing to do but kill pretend zombies and peddle comic books. That is, of course, until they find themselves the only ones prepared for an honest to goodness zombie outbreak. Now all our intrepid adventurers want to do is get home, but it's not going to be easy. There's nothing like an unexpected zombie apocalypse to derail the best laid plans. Join our team of zombie hunters while they sharpen their wits, mow through zombies, and let the sarcasm flow with a sense of humor even the threat of death and dismemberment can't curtail. If you're a fan of gory fun, dark humor, and miss that campy feel slaying zombies used to have, this is the book for you. Warning: Graphic details and foul language. Threat of snorting milk or soda out of your nose, and if you are squeamish, possible nausea at times. Persons reading this novel may be prone to sudden outbursts of laughter.",
