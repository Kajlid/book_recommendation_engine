  "title": "\"WHATEVER, GOD\": Rediscovering the One I Thought I Knew",
  "description": "Too many people stumble through life with an inaccurate view of who God is. They believe in His existence, but don’t know how to relate to Him in a practical and meaningful way. As a result, they fail to achieve anything beyond a superficial relationship with their Creator, and live less-than-fulfilling lives.In “WHATEVER, GOD”, Fr. Anthony Messeh attempts to change that. He shares his unique story and the lessons he’s learned that helped him go from a “don’t-get-too-close-to-God-because-He-might-ruin-your-life” Christian, to a fully devoted “I-can’t-get-enough-of-God-in-my-life” believer.In his own words, “I wrote this book to show you what that life can look like, and help you take a step or two to get there. My goal is to help you see where God wants you to be . . . how He wants you to live . . . and what your life should look like and could look like if you allow Him to lead it for you.”All you need is to say, “WHATEVER, GOD” and you’ll see for yourself that God is REAL, God is RELEVANT, and God is always REWARDING.Fr. Anthony Messeh is a priest in the Coptic Orthodox church, serving at the church of St. Timothy & St. Athanasius (STSA) in Arlington, Virginia. Through his blog (www.FrAnthony.com), his weekly sermons, and now through this book, Fr. Anthony brings an ancient faith to the modern world through his unique ability to communicate life-changing truths in simple and understandable ways.",
