It begins by detailing how positive psychology came about from a meeting in the Yucatan, in a home owned by the Grateful Dead, to an anonymous donation of $1.5 million by a secretive billionaire. It then outlines the science of happiness, including counterintuitive findings about what actually makes us happy.",
