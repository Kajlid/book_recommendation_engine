  "description": "“The story flows so seamlessly that readers will dread putting the book down and will be disappointed when it finally ends.” —RT Book Reviews, Five Star Gold reviewThe Men of fierce passion, unyielding loyalty.Especially when it comes to their women.Zeke Dugan is not a man who walks the straight and narrow. He may have sworn an oath as a trauma doc, but he has zero problem leveraging his medical skills outside a hospital if it means giving the Brotherhood—the group of men he calls family—an advantage. Blood before business. All that changes when shy Gabrielle stumbles into his life and ignites his protective instincts.Mechanic Gabrielle Parker prefers the complexities of an engine over men. Her life wasn’t always quiet and well-ordered, but now that it is, she finds peace in the solitude. When a robbery in her neighborhood forces her out of her safe bubble, she never fathoms that a dangerous, cocky trauma doctor will fix more than her injuries.Zeke doesn’t play by the rules that Gabrielle follows but knows that he’s exactly what she needs in her life. He’ll show her the fierce and uncompromising protection that comes from belonging to a man like him.When tension outside the Brotherhood threatens Gabrielle, Zeke will do anything to keep her safe, and damn the consequences. No one will hurt his woman, even if it means putting the very men who saved his life at risk.Men of HavenBook 1: Rough & TumbleBook 2: Wild & SweetBook 3: Claim & ProtectBook 4: Tempted & TakenBook 5: Stand & DeliverBook 6: Down & DirtyAlso by Rhenna KnightsBook 1: His to DefendBook 2: Hers to TameBook 3: Mine to Keep",
