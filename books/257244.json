  "title": "I'll Go to the Gym When I Lose Weight: The Musings of a Bewildered Middle-Aged Woman",
  "description": "\"One of the best books I've read in ages! All the little things we women face on a day-to-day basis, the author describes in side-splitting detail. I couldn't stop laughing!\"  Christy Phillippe,  Dog Ear Publishing Editor  Since when did ordering at Starbucks require an advanced educational degree? What are the proper rules for regifting these days, and how can I avoid regifting the candle my friend gave me last Christmas back to her?  Why does Siri seem to have an attitude if I ask her the same question more than once?  These are the musings of real-life, middle-aged-and-proud-of-it Madalyn Kinsey, who allows us to laugh along with her as she candidly reveals the weaknesses she has that we all know only too well. She belongs to a gym she's never visited, and she shudders at the thought of running into friends at the grocery who'll see the cookies, chips, and soda in her shopping cart. This candid and funny book is a breath of fresh air for women (and men) who want to enjoy the humor of a smart and bewildered woman as she not only examines her own foibles, but also the absurdities of the world around her. She may not have all the answers, but she makes examining the issues a whole lot of fun!  When author Madalyn Kinsey isn't working on one of her books, she's employed as a corporate attorney and partner in an Indianapolis law firm. Madalyn has also lived and worked in Chicago and San Francisco. She studied voice and journalism at Indiana University, where she also received her law degree. Madalyn's other books include the young adult series, The Vanessa Mysteries, set in a small Indiana town in the 1960s.",
