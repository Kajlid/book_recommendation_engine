  "description": "RCMP Constable Danutia Dranchuk is investigating a mysterious death at Sitting Lady Falls. The evidence she gathers points to three separate stories, leaving her with more questions than answers. Is this murder connected to two earlier killings of Aboriginal women? Are all three the work of the same killer? Some of the details are hitting a little too close to home, and Danutia is forced to examine her friendship with forensics head Corporal Surinder Sharma and his family. Deftly woven into Danutias investigation are the stories of two other characters. Parolee Ritchie Taylor fears that the unidentified body from the waterfall is his estranged daughters, who was supposed to meet him after his release from prison, but never showed. Awkward busboy Trav cant seem to help behaving suspiciously. Author Kay Stewart pulls the threads together in an unexpected and dramatic resolution at Sitting Lady Falls.",
