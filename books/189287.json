  "description": "While it is beyond doubt that Jerome K. Jerome is most well known for his comic masterpiece Three Men in a Boat, the range of his other literary achievements is staggering. Journalist, playwright and author, a wealth of his writing has remained just beyond the public gaze. Diary of a Pilgrimage is one such work. The pilgrimage of the title is a journey to see the famous Passion Play at Oberammergau, which has been performed every ten years since 1634, the middle of the Thirty Years War. Diary is a typically witty account of this journey, part travelogue and part social commentary. It is also a work which has long deserved its place in the sun, outside of the benevolent shade of Jerome’s more famous writing.",
