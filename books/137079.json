  "description": "He burns for her… but she can’t hear him\n. “\nUnbelievably attractive male seeking roommate. Must be able to tolerate loud drumming and even louder sex. Serious inquiries only.\n” That was the ad “delicate” wallflower Thea replied to. Stuck in L.A.—jobless and homeless—after leaving her cheating ex, Thea’s best option is to move in with tattooed rocker and sex symbol Draven Maxwell. To Draven’s dismay, Thea does not trip all over herself when Draven plays his sexy music—mostly because she cannot hear it. A drummer living with a deaf woman sounds like a match made in roommate heaven, but the scorching attraction between the two utter opposites is hot as hell. She thinks he is a smug playboy, but he only craves her. When the heartthrob drummer reveals he is learning sign language to communicate with her, Thea’s perception of bad boy Draven cracks. He’s…nice? And funny. And puts subtitles on the TV without her asking. Could the cocky rocker have a heart of gold behind his chiseled chest? And what’s up with all those pining looks of agonized yearning every morning he sees her trudge around the apartment in modest pajamas and no makeup? From enemy roommates to best friends, speaking different languages will not lessen their undeniable connection and sizzling chemistry. Through the thin walls, something becomes much louder than the nightly drum set, and it might sound like love.",
