  "description": "Laredo's defenders were ground down and its people ruthlessly slaughtered when the Bactrians invaded the planet. Overwhelmed, its Army switched to guerrilla warfare and went underground. For three years they've fought like demons to resist the occupiers. They've bled the enemy, but at fearful cost. The survivors are running out of weapons, supplies, and places to hide.  Then a young officer, Dave Carson, uncovers news that may change everything. An opportunity is coming to smash the foe harder than they've ever done before, both on and off the planet. Success may bring the interplanetary community to their aid â€“ but it'll take everything they've got. Win or lose, many of them will die. Failure will mean that Bactria will at last rule unopposed.  That risk won't stop them. When you're fighting a war to the knife, in the end you bet on the blade.",
