  "description": "Falling in love wasn’t in Damian’s life plan. All Josh wants is to be loved. Damian has never given any thought to any kind of relationship with anyone. He wants to start medical school and keep full focus on his education. At least, that's what he used to want. Meeting Josh one rainy night changes everything. Used and abused since he was a little kid, Josh carries more baggage than one man should have to lift. He's been betrayed by the people who should have protected him. Scarred inside and out, he's wary of trusting anyone and despairs of being loved for who he is. Damian's carrying his own share of wounds, which Josh may understand better than anyone else. Can two scarred souls make each other whole?",
