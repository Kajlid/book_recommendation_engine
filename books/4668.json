  "title": "Thais of Athens",
  "description": "Thais of Athens was first published in Russia in 1972. Since that time, it has sold over a million copies and has become one of the most popular historical novels in the former Soviet Union. In difference to other famous novels of Ivan Efremov, like The Land of Foam and The Heart of the Serprent, his last work Thais of Athens was never translated into English and we are truly excited about its “rebirth” 37 years after it was written. Set in the era of Alexander the Great, the book tells a story of an Athenian hetaera Thais, whose fascinating image captured our hearts and minds. Her adventures, masterfully described by the author, hold your attention from the very first page and make you fall in love with the heroine.",
