Sign me up.Hmmm, Patrick Kelley? My borderline stalker? My Wednesday regular? I’m not interested. I’d never bring him home to meet my family. But times are desperate. I can’t spend a week in the mountains with my family alone, plus my ex will be there, so I ask Patrick…“Will you be my fake-date for the holidays?”I figure he’ll be easy to control.I couldn’t have been more wrong.*FAKED is sexy Christmas standalone with a HEA. It is a companion novel to Sarah Darlington's KILL DEVIL INK series. It does not need to be read with the others in the series to enjoy. Happy Holidays!",
