Educated by correspondence, taught by her mother it was from her mother that she developed her ability to write. When most girls her age were learning to cook sew lessons and school, she was out with her father learning to track trap shoot skin butcher and survival. By the time she was ten she could track an animal for miles or shoot a rabbit on the run for her dinner. A humorous sometimes bitter sweet story about her unique interactions and communications with animals and wild life in the region. Her book is a tell all tale of growing learning and survival in the harsh Australian bush.",
