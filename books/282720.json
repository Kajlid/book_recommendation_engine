  "description": "Alternate cover edition of ASIN B093G1KC36. Josh Miller. That's his name, but I just call him DG for Do Gooder. This guy is relentless. All-American, baby-faced, blue-eyed band dork who's not a band dork at all, because you can't be a dork when you're getting scouted to play college soccer. When he's not doing music or sports, DG is counting up his Boy Scout badges or front-rowing it at the First Baptist church. DG is my new stepbrother. Little brother. I'm a whole year older, not that he knows. I don't think he knows I'm starting senior year a whole year late. And he definitely doesn't know why. I've got secrets I'm taking with me to the grave. Everyone thinks I came to play varsity football, but I've got other plans, and DG's trying to thwart them all. He's making my life worse than it already is. Having him around is a damn plague. But I can fight back. I found out a little secret about Mr. Perfect. He plays for the \"other\" team. That ball bat he's got stuffed into his gray sweatpantsâ€”it swings \"that\" way. The best part about this twisted game is when I find out it gets hard for me. The Do Gooder...he wants me. I don't know why. But I know how to make him pay. -- Wrath is an emotional, forbidden MM romance that will be the fourth standalone in the bestselling Sinful Secrets collection, where each book is inspired by a sin and centered on a devastating secret.",
