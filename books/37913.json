  "description": "Poetry. \"Scott Abels's first book, RAMBO GOES TO IDAHO, opens with the line 'He is good, ' this is true and finishes with the line 'I could fly.' and nobody having read it can deny that this is also true. Abels is our camera panning the scene of a place at once familiarly unreal, hilariously true and banally dystopian. Sincerely ironic, this 'fictitious involvement' is also nonetheless true. Celebrities and heroes like dreams are already alternative selves floating in their post-celluloid heavens caught on reel as real as anything else this is a vision of a vision of America, a tragi-comic joke that means the world.\" Martin Corless-Smith\"",
