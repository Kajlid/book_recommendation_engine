  "description": "She’s one of the few…Jazz has been one of the guys for over a decade, serving her country with distinction, but she longs to explore her femininity, to be desired as a woman, to flirt, cavort and fulfill every sexual desire. When her mother, of all people, signs her up for a 1Night Stand, she’s not sure whether to be exhilarated or pissed. She flew all the way to Las Vegas on the promise of a total escape, to be Jasmine for just one night, because tomorrow, she plans to re-up for another five years.They’re two of the proud…Logan Cavanaugh grew up across the street from his best friend and ‘brother’ Zach Evans. Inseparable, the two shared everything until a year before when an IED attack took out the Humvee they traveled in with Colonel Dexter. Zach suffered a concussion, but Logan’s injuries were far more extensive. After a year of physical therapy, he can walk, but he’ll never run or love a woman again, or so he fears. Logan seemed ready to accept his impotence until Zach came home. Now the ‘brothers’ are in Vegas to meet the perfect woman, the woman who can heal Logan’s confidence and masculinity.They’re all Marines…They’ve shared everything, but will one night be enough?",
