  "description": "When Evelyn Brennan's parents are attacked and slaughtered without warning, she naturally assumes that her life is over â€“ especially when she herself is drained dry by a vampire. To her surprise, however, she awakens sixteen years later to discover that she has been reborn as a Banshee, a creature of myth with the power to foresee death. Taken in by her great (times a thousand) Aunt, a fellow Banshee named Kendyl, Evelyn must adjust to her new life and track down her baby brother in order to keep him safe. But when her killer, a persistent vampire named Theodore, and Donovan, an enigmatic yet charming Grim Reaper seem to be shadowing her and her brother, Evie finds herself thrown into a world she doesn't understand, with the life of herself, her brother, and everyone she has ever known on the line.",
