  "description": "All aboard for Maggie's latest adventure with her magical boots! Maggie Malone wants to fit in at her new school, so she decides to join the swim team. Only her tryout is a complete flop (of the belly variety, to be exact). What Maggie needs is a little help―from her mostly magical boots! What could be better than spending a day as Marina Tide, daughter of a famous oceanographer? So Maggie jumps into Marina's shoes―er, flippers―for a day of sunbathing, ocean breezes and an adorable pet dolphin! But there's a treasure-hunting traitor aboard her ship… and it's up to Maggie to save the crew and the coral reef before her time runs out. \"A fanciful and fun read―where do we get a pair of those boots?\"―Sheryl Berk and Carrie Berk, authors of The Cupcake Club series \"This lighthearted contemporary fantasy will appeal to fans of Sarah Mlynowski's 'Whatever After' series and be a nice fit for readers graduating from the 'Katie Kazoo' series by Nancy Krulik.\"― School Library Journal",
