If it simply has to happen, let it at least be a billionaire and a hot biker.Virginity isn't all it's cracked up to be and her search for the Holy Grail of Erotic Romance, the ten inch purple-headed schlong, may have finally borne fruit.Yeehaw! Playing hide the tentacle has never been so much fun.",
