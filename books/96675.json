  "description": "If you fall deep enough down the rabbit hole, how will you even know when you’ve made it out?When teenage runaway Wren Silver’s little sister gets lost in the DreamScape, a virtual world so addictive its use has been outlawed, the prognosis is bad. Nobody who’s fallen into a coma while using the DreamScape has ever recovered. Realising her only chance to save her sister is to venture in after her, Wren logs into the DreamScape to discover a bizarre, lawless world presided over by two self-proclaimed ‘gods’. Convinced one of them has captured her sister and is using her in his attempt to attain immortality, Wren must seek the help of a cult acolyte and an elusive rock star in order to unmask the god’s true identity before her sister is lost for good. DREAMSCAPE is a dark cyberpunk Alice in Wonderland tale full of colourful characters that merges the fantastical settings of Erin Morgenstern's The Night Circus with the neon-gothic vibes of Silvia Moreno-Garcia's Certain Dark Things .",
